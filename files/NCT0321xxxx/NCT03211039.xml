  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will seek to determine if rapid genomic sequencing improves outcomes for acutely&#xD;
      ill infants. The investigator will enroll up to 1,000 acutely ill infants in a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized, blinded study to either rapid Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) or rapid Whole Exome&#xD;
      Sequencing (WES, which is 2% of the genome and ~4-fold less expensive). 213 infants were&#xD;
      actually enrolled. Outcomes will be measured both by objective clinical measures and family&#xD;
      perceptions (patient/family centered outcomes). Primary analysis of WGS or WES will be in&#xD;
      infants alone. Secondary analysis, in infants who do not receive a diagnosis, will be of&#xD;
      families - ideally trios (mother, father, and affected infant), which is ~2-fold more&#xD;
      expensive. Trios will be analyzed within the same randomization arm (WGS or WES). This study&#xD;
      is designed to quantify which acutely ill infants benefit from rapid genomic sequencing, by&#xD;
      how much they benefit, how they benefit, which rapid genomic sequencing method is superior,&#xD;
      and the cost effectiveness of such testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acutely ill infant inpatients who have an undiagnosed illness, and their families, will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. The investigators will enroll up to 1,000 infants.&#xD;
      Locally, the study population will be recruited from Rady Children's Hospital (RCH) inpatient&#xD;
      population, primarily the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), pediatric intensive care unit&#xD;
      (PICU), and cardiovascular intensive care unit (CVICU), with a smaller population presenting&#xD;
      to other hospital in-patient services. Recruitment will be targeted at the RCH main campus,&#xD;
      but it may include referrals from satellite locations in the RCH network (particularly the&#xD;
      RCH NICU network throughout San Diego County). All patients will continue to receive routine&#xD;
      care as clinically indicated, including the state newborn screen and other genetic testing as&#xD;
      determined by their treating providers. Half of the affected study participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the other half will receive&#xD;
      rapid whole exome sequencing (WES). Each arm will initially be analyzed using the patient's&#xD;
      (proband's) sample only. If a proband-only analysis fails to yield a diagnosis, genomic data&#xD;
      from the biological family members (typically parents), when available, will be used to&#xD;
      supplement analysis (trio analysis). Occasionally, a second affected sibling may be available&#xD;
      for family analysis. Not infrequently, the father is not available for study. Similarly, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate the need for targeted genetic analysis of biological parents, and&#xD;
      possibly other family members, to confirm diagnostic results and/or provide additional&#xD;
      information regarding inheritance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that in rare cases a newborn may be so ill that the team lacks&#xD;
      equipoise that the child can wait for the estimated ten day turnaround time of our send-out&#xD;
      exome testing. In these rare cases, the PI, or his delegate, will decide if the child is not&#xD;
      eligible for randomization. These children will remain in the research study throughout the&#xD;
      entirety of the study, but will receive in-house ultra-rapid whole genome sequencing by the&#xD;
      Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine (RCIGM, also called RadyPGSMI) laboratory in&#xD;
      lieu of either a rapid genome or rapid exome (both anticipated to be 10 day turn-arounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be sought within the first 96 hours following admission to RCH or an RCH&#xD;
      network ICU or within 96 hours of meeting criteria for the study if the infant was not&#xD;
      previously eligible. Patients and their family members who consent to participate will have&#xD;
      their blood drawn and will be randomized to receive either rapid WGS or rapid WES. The&#xD;
      initial symptom-driven analysis will be conducted on the patient's sample only (singleton&#xD;
      analysis). If a diagnosis is not found promptly (within 24 hours) via a singleton analysis,&#xD;
      the family (or any combination of parents and/or other family members) will be analyzed using&#xD;
      the same technology that the patient was randomized to receive. Pathogenic and likely&#xD;
      pathogenic variants (as determined by American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) guidelines)&#xD;
      that relate in part or in whole to the patient's current phenotype will be clinically&#xD;
      confirmed and reported into the patients' medical record. Although the intention of the study&#xD;
      is to return symptom-driven results to the medical record, the clinical report for&#xD;
      confirmation of symptom-driven findings may include negative findings of testing. In the&#xD;
      event that our analysis incidentally finds a pathogenic variant for which a treatment or&#xD;
      intervention exists to improve morbidity and/or mortality, families may choose not to receive&#xD;
      this additional information.&#xD;
