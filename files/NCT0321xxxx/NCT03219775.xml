  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TITAN-TCC (0416-ASG) is a Phase 2, open-label study of nivolumab (BMS-936558) monotherapy&#xD;
      with additional nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles in previously untreated* and&#xD;
      platinum-based pretreated, 2nd and 3rd line, advanced or metastatic transitional cell&#xD;
      carcinoma subjects. Nivolumab is a fully human PD-1 antibody which blocks the respective&#xD;
      immune checkpoint in a ligand (PD-L1/PD-L2) independent manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single arm study of a tailored immunotherapy approach with nivolumab in&#xD;
      adult (â‰¥ 18 years) subjects with previously untreated (1st line)* or pretreated (2nd and 3rd&#xD;
      line), surgically unresectable or metastatic TCC (further designated &quot;advanced TCC&quot;). The&#xD;
      study targets to recruit 130 untreated (1st line) and 120 pretreated (2nd / 3rd line)&#xD;
      patients, respectively. Tumor tissue obtained at least 2 years prior to screening must be&#xD;
      available for a central pathology assessment. Subjects must have advanced (not amenable to&#xD;
      curative surgery or radiation) or metastatic TCC, and must not have received more than two&#xD;
      prior platinum-based chemotherapies for the treatment of advanced TCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [*Update from Jan-2020: First-line cohort was stopped and the inclusion of these patients was&#xD;
      terminated. According protocol v.5.0 80 2nd/3rd-line patients need to be included]&#xD;

    <time_frame>max. months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be measured by the primary endpoint of ORR (based on investigator assessments) among all treated subjects, first line subjects and second line subjects. It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response of CR or PR divided by the number of all treated subjects, first line subjects or second line subjects. Best overall response is defined as the best response designation, as determined by investigator, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented immunotherapy resistance per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Time to Immunotherapy Resistance (TIR) will be used as a surrogate parameter of progression free survival using a tailored Immunotherapy regimen with &quot;boost&quot; cycles upon initial progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Response (TTR)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 68 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined either as the time from first dosing date or initiation of nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles to the date of the first confirmed response thereafter, as assessed by the IRC. Hence, TTR may be recorded several times per patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 68 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from first confirmed response (CR or PR) to the date of the documented progressive disease as determined using RECIST 1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. DOR may be recorded multiple times per patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 68 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented tumor progression based on investigator assessments (per RECIST 1.1), or death due to any cause. Clinical deterioration in the absence of unequivocal evidence of progression (per RECIST 1.1) is not considered progression for purposes of determining PFS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>max. 68 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of death. A subject who has not died will be censored at last known date alive.</description>

                  hours prior to the start of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must not be breastfeeding&#xD;

                  plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half lives.&#xD;
                  The terminal half lives of nivolumab and ipilimumab are up to 25 days and 18&#xD;
                  days, respectively. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23&#xD;
                  weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half-lives)&#xD;
                  after the last dose of investigational drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Comment: Azoospermic males and WOCBP who are continuously not heterosexually&#xD;
                       active are exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, WOCBP must still&#xD;
                       undergo pregnancy testing as described in this section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on&#xD;
        the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected pregnancy&#xD;
        Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP on&#xD;
        the use of highly effective methods of contraception. Highly effective methods of&#xD;
        contraception have a failure rate of &lt; 1% when used consistently and correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At a minimum, subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception, with one&#xD;
        method being highly effective and the other method being either highly effective or less&#xD;
        effective as listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male condoms with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pills, vaginal&#xD;
             ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as MirenaÂ® by WOCBP&#xD;
             subject or male subject's WOCBP partner. Female partners of male subjects&#xD;
             participating in the study may use hormone based contraceptives as one of the&#xD;
             acceptable methods of contraception since they will not be receiving study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGardÂ®&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vasectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complete Abstinence*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse&#xD;
                  and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Subjects who&#xD;
                  choose complete abstinence are not required to use a second method of&#xD;
                  contraception, but female subjects must continue to have pregnancy tests.&#xD;
                  Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed&#xD;
                  in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diaphragm with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical cap with spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaginal sponge&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male Condom without spermicide&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female Condom*.&#xD;
