      Radioisotopic and wire localizations suffer from several limitations. These techniques add&#xD;
      another procedure prior to surgery, can be uncomfortable and entail additional cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to develop a novel technique of breast tumor localization using preoperative&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and breast optical scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diagnosis of breast cancer who have had a preoperative MRI and 3D optical scans&#xD;
      are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical scanning is done preoperatively and intraoperatively after tumor localization was&#xD;
      marked on the breast using radioisotopic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI is then adjusted with the intraoperative optical scan to match the breast position at&#xD;
      the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators evaluate the efficiency for localization of breast lesion of the novel&#xD;
      technique by comparison with radiosiotopic technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most commonly cancer diagnosed among women, with approximately 42000&#xD;
      women diagnosed with breast cancer annually in France. Incidence rates of breast cancer rose&#xD;
      steadily from 1980 to 2005 due to the increasing use of screening mammography and longer life&#xD;
      expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With advances in breast cancer screening techniques, many women now have malignant tumors&#xD;
      detected before they become clinically palpable. For these women, breast conserving surgery&#xD;
      (BCS) has become the preferred treatment option, comprising more than 75 % of surgeries in&#xD;
      most breast cancer centers. The goal of BCS is to resect the tumor with a surrounding margin&#xD;
      of tissue free of cancer while simultaneously preserving the overall shape and appearance of&#xD;
      the breast. For non palpable lesions, localization of the tumor prior to surgery is needed.&#xD;
      The standard technique for such patients is wire localization. Wire localization suffers from&#xD;
      several limitations. It adds another procedure prior to surgery, complicating and lengthening&#xD;
      the process. It can be uncomfortable for the patient and entails additional cost. This&#xD;
      technique requires the surgeon to estimate the 3-dimensional (3D) position of the cancer from&#xD;
      2-dimensional mammography images. Wire localized excision results in positive margins&#xD;
      approximately 30-50 % of the time. These cases require additional surgery to remove the&#xD;
      remaining cancer, which is both costly and emotionally difficult for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatives to wire localization have been tested. Radioguided occult lesion localization&#xD;
      (ROLL) has been shown to be superior to wire localization with shorter risk having positive&#xD;
      resection margins and shorter duration of localization and surgical excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast has been shown to be more sensitive than ultrasound&#xD;
      or mammography for the detection of cancer. Despite this evidence, the use of MRI has not&#xD;
      been demonstrated to produce better short-term outcomes: the prospective randomized COMICE&#xD;
      trial failed to demonstrate a decrease in the positive margin rate and need for re-excision&#xD;
      with the use of preoperative prone MRI. The COMICE study authors recognized that the&#xD;
      inability of prone MRI to result in decreased positive margin rates might be due to the way&#xD;
      the imaging data is presented to the surgeon, stating that ''techniques to ensure surgical&#xD;
      precision is at an optimum need further examination.'' The shape of the breast during prone&#xD;
      MR imaging (with the breast pendant in a bilateral imaging coil) is radically different from&#xD;
      the supine, arm-extended position in the operating room (OR). Supine MRI more accurately&#xD;
      replicates the surgical position. Indeed, a study by Sakakibara et al. randomized patients&#xD;
      with DCIS to undergo wire localized or supine MRI- guided BCS and found the positive margin&#xD;
      rate and resected tissue volume were lower in patients undergoing supine MRI-guided excision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to develop a novel technique of MRI- guided breast tumor localization that&#xD;
      incorporates preoperative prone MRI and uses a preoperative and intraoperative 3D optical&#xD;
      scans to adjust the MRI image to the exact position in the operating room. This novel&#xD;
      technique will provide the surgeons with 3D views and measurements of tumor shape and&#xD;
      position within the breast as it appears during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data collection Data are obtained from the database of the gynecologic department of the&#xD;
           Montpellier University Hospital, using the Medicalization Program of the Information&#xD;
           Systems. The patient who have had a BCS for breast cancer between 2016 and 2017 are&#xD;
           selected. The investigator then include consecutively 10 patients who have had a&#xD;
           preoperative MRI and a preoperative and intraoperative 3D optical scan of the chest and&#xD;
           who meet eligibility criteria. A subject identification code is assigned by the&#xD;
           investigator to each subject to anonymized the data. A subject identification code list&#xD;
           allows the investigator to keep a confidential list of names of all the patients&#xD;
           included in the study on the protected central computer server of Montpellier University&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.Clinical data The source of clinical medical data is the patient's electronic&#xD;
           medical record. The data recorded by the investigator include name, surname and date of&#xD;
           birth of the patient, cup size, date of MRI, breast cancer localization, date of&#xD;
           preoperative 3D optical scan, date of date of surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.Optical scans Since 2016, in the gynecology department of Montpellier University&#xD;
           Hospital, photographs of the chest are taken for each patient who undergoes a BCS.&#xD;
           Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative 3D optical scans are also done. Optical&#xD;
           scanning are obtained with the sensor structure 3D scanning. Acquisitions take few&#xD;
           minutes. Preoperatively and postoperatively, patients are on standing position, arms&#xD;
           abducted 45° with anatomical landmarks marked on the surface of the skin (manubrium of&#xD;
           sternum, xiphoid process, top edge of the mammary gland, submammary fold).&#xD;
           Intraoperatively, the tumor is localized by radioguided occult lesion localization and&#xD;
           is marked on the surface of the breast. Two acquisitions are taken, before and after the&#xD;
           tumor has been localized, with patients placed on the supine position, arms abducted&#xD;
           90°.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.Preoperative breast MRI The standard breast MRI protocol includes T2 sequences&#xD;
           (anatomy and signal analysis), T1 gradient-echo sequences and injected dynamic 3D&#xD;
           sequences (gadolinium-containing contrast agent). Patients are placed on the prone&#xD;
           position, arms above the head, with both breasts hanging in the coil loops. MRI data are&#xD;
           collected from the computer server of radiology department, anonymized with the subject&#xD;
           identification code and then burned to CD. Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine&#xD;
           (DICOM) data are converted into MHD format.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. different steps to create a 3D personalized breast model 2.1. 3D reconstruction of MRI&#xD;
           data The 3D reconstruction requires the segmentation of the anatomical elements within&#xD;
           the 2D images. Segmentation is done using a computer software called Medical Image&#xD;
           Segmentation Tool (MIST) which allows semi-automatic and manual segmentation of the&#xD;
           following elements: tumor, mammary gland, sternum, skin, pectoralis major and minor&#xD;
           muscles. The 3D reconstruction is then performed by an indirect volume rendering method,&#xD;
           the marching cubes. Instant Mesh software is then used for post-processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.Registration of 3D reconstruction to optical scans Image registration is the process&#xD;
           of transforming different sets of data into one coordinate system. The registration&#xD;
           problem is to find the optimal spatial transformation that matches the images. The&#xD;
           benefits of using multimodal data have created a need for the development of highly&#xD;
           accurate and robust multimodal image registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anatoreg, a software designed by Anatoscope, allows registration of a reference model to&#xD;
           a target. In our study, the reference model is the 3D reconstruction obtained from&#xD;
           breast MRI. 3D reconstruction data are included in a Sofa Modelling Language (SML) file&#xD;
           to be read by the registration software. The target is the optical scan, previously&#xD;
           processed thanks to Blender (artefacts removal, axis correction, correction of unit of&#xD;
           measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first step of registration is the Interaction Closest Point algorithm (ICP). The ICP&#xD;
           algorithm searches for the closest point in the reference surface for each point in the&#xD;
           target surface without any restrictions. The second step is the use of landmarks to&#xD;
           improve the registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of the 3D breast model Tumor localization by this 3D breast model is then&#xD;
           compared to the localization by ROLL. The intraoperative 3D optical scan gives us the&#xD;
           tumor localization obtained by radioguided occult lesion localization thanks to pen&#xD;
           marking left by the surgeon. The novel technique gives us a 3D model and the&#xD;
           localization of the tumor visible by transparency. Comparison is done by superimposing&#xD;
           both acquisitions.&#xD;
