      Blocking the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MACN) during an axillary block often a&#xD;
      subcutaneous wheal of local anesthetics is made what is described as painful. With the&#xD;
      improvement of the resolution of the ultrasound machines smaller structures and nerves can be&#xD;
      visable. In this study topographic assessment will made of the anatomical variation of the&#xD;
      medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MACN) by ultrasound in the axilla and 5 cm above the&#xD;
      cubital fossa of the arm.&#xD;

      The ethics committee will approved the study and informed consent is obtained. Patients with&#xD;
      contraindications for regional anaesthesia will be excluded from the study. 150 patients will&#xD;
      be included The arm is placed above and beside the head for scanning (abduction 90 degrees at&#xD;
      the shoulder and 90 degrees flexion at the elbow with external rotation) Ultrasound is&#xD;
      performed with a 12-18 MHz (Mega-Herz) linear probe (BK medical). The frequency is set to 18&#xD;
      MHz and the depth to 3 cm and adjusted to 1 cm below the brachial artery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The terminal nerves of the brachial plexus (median, ulnar,radial an d musculocutaneous) are&#xD;
      identified at the axillary fossa in a routine fashion described by Ranganath (see&#xD;
      references).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After identifying the MACN at the axilla and 5 cm above the cubital fossa, the images at&#xD;
      these two sites will be stored after digital marking of the MACN, the medial and ulnar nerve&#xD;
      and the and radial nerve on the frozen ultrasound image. Its position relative to the venous&#xD;
      structure and the artery at the axilla will be registered in the axilla at the lower border&#xD;
      of the conjoint tendon of the teres major and the latissimus dorsi muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After scanning the skin will be prepared with an aseptic solution and an axillary block will&#xD;
      be performed with a 55 mm sonoplex 22 G short bevel ultrasound needle (Pajunk). With a partly&#xD;
      in plane (ulnar, radial and MACN) and partly out of plane (median &amp; musculocutaneous nerve)&#xD;
      technique . Mepivacaine 1.5 % will be injected around each nerve in the following order:&#xD;
      Ulnar nerve, MACN, radial nerve, median nerve and musculocutaneous nerve. The time at which&#xD;
      the MACN is blocked will be noted. For each nerve 5 ml of local anaesthetic solution will be&#xD;
      injected except for the MACN nerve where 3 ml will be used because of its smaller caliber.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve stimulation will be used with a current of 0,2 mA (milli Amps). Following completion of&#xD;
      the block the dermatome supplied by the MACN will be tested by loss of cold sensation. After&#xD;
      20 minutes the dermatomes and motor function of all nerves are tested by elbow flexion and&#xD;
      extension, primarily thumb opposition and abduction of the index finger. Sensory block is&#xD;
      tested at the fifth finger (ulnar nerve, the hand palm at the thumb (medial nerve)and the&#xD;
      dorsum of the hand ( radial nerve), the lateral (musculocutaneous nerve) and medial skin (&#xD;
      MACN) of the forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin will be prepared with an aseptic solution and an axillary block will be performed with&#xD;
      deposition of local anesthetic around the MACN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing. The locations of the different nerves will be displayed in a pie chart with&#xD;
      the axillary artery in the centre, as well as the relative position to the basilic vein.&#xD;
      Statistics will only be descriptive .&#xD;
