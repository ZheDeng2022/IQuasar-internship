      Nutraceuticals have attracted interest as possible approach to be associated with lifestyle&#xD;
      changes for lowering plasma cholesterol levels in patients with moderate&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. Ruscica and colleagues showed that a 8-weeks treatment with a&#xD;
      nutraceutical combination containing red yeast rice extract, berberine, policosanol,&#xD;
      astaxanthin, coenzyme Q10, and folic acid was able to reduce significantly total cholesterol&#xD;
      (-12.8%) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-21.1%) [11]. These nutraceutical compounds&#xD;
      exert their lipid-lowering effect through different ways, like the inhibition of the&#xD;
      hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (CoA) enzyme, increasing the hepatic expression of low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL degradation via enhanced hepatic binding and&#xD;
      internalization. In addition, they up regulate the numbers and function of circulating&#xD;
      endothelial progenitor cells increasing nitric oxide (NO) production. The purpose of the&#xD;
      present study was to assess the effectiveness of CARDIOVIS COLESTEROLO 3 mg (containing red&#xD;
      rice fermented with Monascus purpureus titrated with 3% monacolin K, hydrol mixture of olive&#xD;
      fruit titrated with vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10 and polymethoxyflavones) in terms of cholesterol,&#xD;
      endothelial and inflammatory parameters reduction.&#xD;

      Epidemiology. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death globally: an&#xD;
      estimated 17.5 million people died from CVD in 2012, representing 31% of all global deaths.&#xD;
      Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million were due to coronary heart disease and 6.7 million&#xD;
      were due to stroke. Consistent evidences suggest that a large proportion of CVD incidence&#xD;
      could be prevented by lifestyle modifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis covers a central rule in cardiovascular diseases. This process can be&#xD;
      promoting by several risk factors, all related with endothelial dysfunction, as&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, cigarette smoking and arterial hypertension that acting as&#xD;
      negative stimuli lead to a prothrombotic pathway by proinflammatory-induced cytokines and&#xD;
      chemokine's production. Furthermore endothelial cells exposed to hypercholesterolemia are&#xD;
      inhibited by the downregulation of extracellular nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the release&#xD;
      of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, thus the benefits of lowering cholesterol are not&#xD;
      only related to its primary implication in the atherosclerosis process, but also by the&#xD;
      improvement of the endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular risk (systematic coronary risk evaluation, SCORE). Current guidelines&#xD;
      recommend the cardiovascular risk estimation, using a risk estimation system such as SCORE,&#xD;
      for adults &gt;40 years of age, unless they are automatically categorized as being at high-risk&#xD;
      or very high-risk based on documented cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or kidney&#xD;
      disease. A patient is defined at low to moderate risk when the cardiovascular risk is below&#xD;
      5%. Interventional strategies for hypercholesterolemia. The current guidelines&#xD;
      recommendations for the management of hypercholesterolemia according cardiovascular risk are&#xD;
      reported below in the Table. In addition to lifestyle advice, drugs may be considered in&#xD;
      patients at low risk if LDL values are ≥ 190 mg/dl and in patients at moderate risk if LDL&#xD;
      values are ≥ 100 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutraceuticals Several studies have assessed the effect of dietary interventions on risk&#xD;
      factors for CVDs, but there is often lack effectiveness in the long term, mainly due to poor&#xD;
      compliance. Research has thus turned its attention to nutraceuticals, nutrients that have the&#xD;
      ability to modulate physiological and pathophysiological molecular mechanisms, resulting in&#xD;
      favorable health outcomes. Nutraceuticals enhance cardiovascular health through several&#xD;
      metabolic pathways as via promoting vasodilatory, anti-atherogenic, antioxidant,&#xD;
      antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects]. Of note the extracts of red yeast rice&#xD;
      explicate a lowering lipid action through monacolins, a family of naturally occurring&#xD;
      statins, especially monacolin K, that is an inhibitor of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA&#xD;
      enzyme. Several trials of its possible lipid-lowering effects have been conducted and a&#xD;
      meta-analysis [10] assesses the effectiveness and safety of preparations on lipid&#xD;
      modification. Nutraceuticals have attracted interest as possible approach to be associated&#xD;
      with lifestyle changes for lowering plasma cholesterol levels in patients with moderate&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. Ruscica and colleagues showed that a 8-weeks treatment with a&#xD;
      nutraceutical combination containing red yeast rice extract, berberine, policosanol,&#xD;
      astaxanthin, coenzyme Q10, and folic acid was able to reduce significantly total cholesterol&#xD;
      (-12.8%) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-21.1%). These nutraceutical compounds&#xD;
      exert their lipid-lowering effect through different ways, like the inhibition of the&#xD;
      hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA enzyme, increasing the hepatic expression of LDL receptor and the&#xD;
      LDL degradation via enhanced hepatic binding and internalization. In addition, they up&#xD;
      regulate the numbers and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells increasing NO&#xD;
      production. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of CARDIOVIS&#xD;
      COLESTEROLO 3 mg (containing red rice fermented with Monascus purpureus titrated with 3%&#xD;
      monacolin K, hydrol mixture of olive fruit titrated with vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10 and&#xD;
      polymethoxyflavones) in terms of cholesterol, endothelial and inflammatory parameters&#xD;
      reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-center, and phase IIb study evaluating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      CARDIOVIS COLESTEROLO 3 MG in improving cholesterol, endothelial and inflammatory parameters.&#xD;
      Subjects that meet the inclusion criteria and have provided informed consent will be assigned&#xD;
      to receive a daily oral dose of CARDIOVIS COLESTEROLO 3 mg. Before the treatment with&#xD;
      CARDIOVIS COLESTEROLO 3 mg all subjects undergo a 4-week period of lifestyle advice and&#xD;
      changes. If, after the 4 weeks, LDL values are confirmed above the established cutoffs, the&#xD;
      subjects receive CARDIOVIS COLESTEROLO 3 mg. Finally, a last blood samples to assess a&#xD;
      potential rebound effect after nutraceutical suspension is collected 4 weeks after the&#xD;
      treatment stop.&#xD;
