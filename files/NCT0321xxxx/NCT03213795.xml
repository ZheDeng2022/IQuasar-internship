  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the development of multibranched endografts a novel therapeutic option for the&#xD;
      management of thoracoabdominal and para-renal aortic aneurysms was made accessible. The&#xD;
      introduction of readily available off-the-shelf devices expanded the application of such&#xD;
      technology also to those patients who could not afford to wait for a customized endograft to&#xD;
      be designed and manufactured according to their aneurysm morphology&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the theoretical anatomical feasibility of multibranched off-the-shelf endografts&#xD;
      in patients with thoracoabdominal and para-renal aortic aneurysms based on retrospective&#xD;
      review of pre-operative imaging studies of the patients treated for this pathology in the San&#xD;
      Raffaele Hospital's Vascular Surgery Unit in the past ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators review retrospectively the pre-operative contrast-enhanced computed&#xD;
      tomography scans (CTA), stored in the hospital PACS, of the 562 patients treated at the San&#xD;
      Raffaele Hospital's Vascular Surgery Unit, between January 2007 and January 2017 by means of&#xD;
      open aortic aneurysm repair. All patients involved in the study have already signed informed&#xD;
      consent for data collection and analysis at hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • patient who underwent treatment of thoracoabdominal or para-renal aortic aneurysm at San&#xD;
      Raffaele Hospital in between January 2007 and January 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • incomplete or inappropriate imaging quality defined as pre-operative CTAs with slice&#xD;
      thickness &gt;1-mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All preoperative CTAs with 1-mm slice thickness will be included in the study and analyzed on&#xD;
      the dedicated workstation with OsiriX software (Pixmeo sarl, Bernex, Switzerland) currently&#xD;
      employed in the Unit for imaging assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitive patient information will not be available during data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular access will be evaluated according to the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. femoral and iliac artery diameter ≥8mm (24Fr) on one side and ≥5mm (16Fr) on the&#xD;
           contralateral side, without severe calcification or tortuosity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at least one patent vessel for anterograde branch cannulation&#xD;
           (branchial/axillary/subclavian artery) with diameter ≥3mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of patients excluded due to inadequate vascular accesses will be reported in&#xD;
      the final results together with diameter of the smallest access vessels determining the&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected patient sample will be subdivided in three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. extensive TAAA: including Crawford extent I and II TAAA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Crawford extent III TAAA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. supra-renal aortic aneurysms: including Crawford extent IV TAAA and para-renal abdominal&#xD;
           aortic aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest 100 consecutive cases per group will be subsequently studied in order to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of an off-the-shelf endovascular approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-planar and curved reconstruction of each patient CTA will be analyzed and the following&#xD;
      measurements recorded using the top of the ostium of the celiac trunk as reference point:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. patency of the target vessels (CT, SMA, LRA and RRA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. presence of accessory renal arteries or independent origin of celiac trunk branches;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. inner diameter of the target vessels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. target vessels with aberrant or early branching, aneurysm or dissection, with &lt;15mm of&#xD;
           healthy artery for bridging stent placement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. radial orientation of the target vessels (&quot;clock position&quot;, expressed in degrees);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. orientation of the target vessels with respect to the longitudinal aortic axis&#xD;
           (expressed in degrees);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. distance to the top of the ostium of target vessels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. distance to aortic bifurcation and bilateral iliac bifurcation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. aneurysmatic involvement of common iliac arteries (max diameter &gt;20mm);&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. distance to proximal aneurysm neck (25mm of healthy aorta);&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. distance to left subclavian artery;&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. inner and outer diameter at proximal neck, at 1cm and 2cm above proximal neck, at aortic&#xD;
           bifurcation, and at common iliac artery bilaterally;&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. residual aortic lumen at CT, SMA and renal arteries emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility will be evaluated considering the patients and endografts characteristics and&#xD;
      all the technical steps required for a proper endovascular aneurysm exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the assessed variables will be prospectively recorded in a Microsoft Office Excel&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study will be carried out according to the ethical principles of the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki and following the active regulations on observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extracted data will be employed to feed three major lines of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the anatomical suitability of the novel investigational Gore TAMBE (W.L.&#xD;
           Gore &amp; Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) multibranched off-the-shelf stent-graft for total&#xD;
           endovascular management of thoracoabdominal and para-renal aortic aneurysms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the anatomical suitability, according to Instruction for Use and literature&#xD;
           recommendations, of the commercially available Cook T-Branch (Cook Medical, Bloomington,&#xD;
           IN, USA) multibranched off-the-shelf stent-graft for total endovascular management of&#xD;
           thoracoabdominal and para-renal aortic aneurysms. This line of research will focus on&#xD;
           the evaluation of the expected length of healthy aorta sacrificed to obtain appropriate&#xD;
           proximal endograft sealing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare the applicability of Gore TAMBE and Cook T-Branch endografts in TAAA of&#xD;
           different extents and para-renal aneurysms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the three studies will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed&#xD;
      scientific journals focused on the field of vascular and endovascular surgery.&#xD;
