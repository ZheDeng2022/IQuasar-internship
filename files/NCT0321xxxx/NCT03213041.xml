    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) with&#xD;
      the combination carboplatin - pembrolizumab in patients with CTC (circulating tumor cells)&#xD;
      positive, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracyclines and&#xD;
      taxanes. Previous studies have indicated that recurrent breast cancers are more resistant to&#xD;
      chemotherapy and maybe associated with a weak immune system. This study is investigating the&#xD;
      use of an immune therapy drug, pembrolizumab, that has the ability to restore the capacity of&#xD;
      controlling and killing cancer cells of an important component of your immune system called&#xD;
      T-cells. Pembrolizumab has been found effective in other types of cancer and has already been&#xD;
      approved by FDA for those indications, but the efficacy in breast cancer is still unknown. In&#xD;
      this study, pembrolizumab will be combined with chemotherapy to increase the cancer cell&#xD;
      killing. There is no control or placebo treatment in this study.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the impact on progression free survival (PFS) of the combination pembrolizumab -&#xD;
      carboplatin in patients with circulating tumor cells (CTC) positive, HER2 negative metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in primary setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the impact on overall survival (OS) of the combination carboplatin -&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with CTC positive MBC previously treated with anthracyclines and&#xD;
      taxanes in primary setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the overall response rate or objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit&#xD;
      rate (CBR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria in&#xD;
      patients with carboplatin - pembrolizumab in patients with CTC positive MBC previously&#xD;
      treated with anthracyclines and taxanes in primary setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess immune-related response using tumor response by immune-related RECIST&#xD;
      (irRECIST) as immune-related partial response (irPR) or immune-related complete response&#xD;
      (irCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Measure the time to new metastases (TTNM). V. Evaluate ORR and clinical benefit in&#xD;
      relation to PDL-1 expression in tissue and CTCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure immune biomarkers (PDL-1) in CTCs (CellSearch) and immune cells such as&#xD;
      cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs) (CellSieve) and correlate with therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measure cell-free circulating tumor deoxyribonecleic acid (ctDNA) and T-cell receptor&#xD;
      sequencing analysis and correlate them with CTC enumeration and therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and carboplatin IV&#xD;
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1 beginning with course 3. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days, every 9 weeks&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks.&#xD;
