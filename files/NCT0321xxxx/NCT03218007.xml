  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One proposed strategy is the stratification of troponin-negative patients with biomarker&#xD;
      testing at presentation to facilitate the clinically-appropriate rapid discharge from the&#xD;
      emergency department of patients who present with low-intermediate risk chest pain, and&#xD;
      conversely to triage appropriate Non sustained ST elevation acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      (NSTE-ACS) patients to Cardiology beds, stress and non-invasive imaging modalities.&#xD;
      Biomarkers such as high-sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn), heart-type fatty acid-binding protein&#xD;
      (H-FABP), CRP, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); and copeptin and ischemia-modified albumin&#xD;
      are an important advance for diagnostic testing for ACS (4). Regarding novel biomarker&#xD;
      testing at presentation, the addition of these biomarkers demonstrated increased sensitivity&#xD;
      at an acceptable QALY threshold, but more evidence is needed (5,6). A reliable method for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of minimal cardiac ischemia would meet a strong demand for the sensitive diagnosis&#xD;
      of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain but unremarkable ECGs and biomarkers.&#xD;
      Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside cardioprotective agent. Its cardiovascular effects are&#xD;
      mediated throught the activation of A2A Receptor (A2 AR) and play a major role in the&#xD;
      regulation of Coronary flow CF. As altered coronary blood flow occurs in patients with CAD,&#xD;
      it has been showed that that A2AR expression and functional activity play a role in CAD. In a&#xD;
      previous studies the team have developped an agonist-like monoclonal antibody to study&#xD;
      expression level of this receptor and their functional activity. Recently , Gariboldi&#xD;
      demonstrated that measuring the expression level of A2AR on peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
      cells ( PBMC) represents a good tool to address in situ expression in coronary tissues of CAD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the diagnostic setting of ACS, expression and functionnaly activity of A2AR could be a&#xD;
      sensitive detection method for ischemia. It would be a powerful tool for risk stratification&#xD;
      of patients presenting with chest pain but unremarkable ECG and blood tests. the&#xD;
      investigateors therefore designed a blind multicentrique prospective study to evaluate&#xD;
      expression and functionnaly activity of A2AR in the management of undifferentiated chest pain&#xD;
      The objective of the study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy between this novel biomarkers&#xD;
      A2AR and invasive and non -invasive evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD).&#xD;
