      Recently, Mark Morris Dance Group, and created Moving Through Glass (MTG), a project that was&#xD;
      funded by Google, as a portable, round-the-clock extension of the internationally acclaimed&#xD;
      Dance for Parkinson's Disease (PD)速. When a user activates Glass, participants can choose&#xD;
      from a variety of different exercises, like &quot;warm me up&quot; or &quot;balance me.&quot; Once selected, they&#xD;
      see the founder instructors of the Dance for PD速 projected in front of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a single site research study at Syracuse University, researchers are conducting the pilot&#xD;
      phase of the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of MTG on quality of life and motor&#xD;
      functions (i.e. balance, gait, fall efficacy). Participation in the study required three&#xD;
      visits to Women's Building in a period of four weeks and about 1-3 hours of the participant's&#xD;
      time at each visit. During the first visit, 1 participants reviewed the consent form,&#xD;
      completed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and if qualified participated in a&#xD;
      face-to-face interview. Participants were given survey package to fill out at home and were&#xD;
      given a week to complete all the paperwork. On the second visit, they returned the completed&#xD;
      survey package, were given physical assessments and were taught how to use Google Glass. The&#xD;
      participants left with Google Glass, log sheet, and survey package. After 3 weeks,&#xD;
      participants came to Women's Building for the last visit and the physical assessments were&#xD;
      repeated, followed by an exit interview.&#xD;

      The common symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) include but are not limited to resting&#xD;
      tremor, muscular rigidity, and difficulty in initiating movement. These motor impairments,&#xD;
      which can negatively impact the fluidity and pacing of movement, can increase the risk people&#xD;
      with PD face in their daily activities. Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as apathy and&#xD;
      depression can often lead to isolation, potentially reducing physical activity in people with&#xD;
      PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001, Dance for Parkinson's Disease (DfPD), a collaboration between Brooklyn Parkinson&#xD;
      Group (BPG) and Mark Morris Dance Group (MMDG), an internationally known company based in&#xD;
      Brooklyn, began providing dance classes for the Parkinson community to train other teachers&#xD;
      in the hopes of developing cognitive strategies and to enhance the sense of community and the&#xD;
      amount of physical activity in PD population. Since then, positive effects of dance in motor&#xD;
      and cognitive functions of people with PD have been reported from several types of dance&#xD;
      classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While recent research has investigated dance as a therapy for people with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD), there is only one study, to our knowledge, that investigates the use of Google Glass as&#xD;
      a portable way for persons with PD to use cued movement as they perform activities of daily&#xD;
      living to help temporarily alleviate symptoms such as freezing, initiating movement, and&#xD;
      balancing. This qualitative study explored the acceptability of the Google Glass in five&#xD;
      participants with PD, as well as their caregivers. The results of this study showed that&#xD;
      participants highly favored the voice activation system used to control this technology,&#xD;
      especially in comparison to the frustrations expressed using touch screen smart phones. The&#xD;
      participants also expressed increased confidence because the Google Glass gave them a sense&#xD;
      of independence when going out into public alone. Despite the potential beneficial uses of&#xD;
      the Glass, due to the highly complicated menus with multiple applications participants found&#xD;
      using the Glass frustrating. Additionally, low number of participants used in this study,&#xD;
      very short intervention time, and the lack of quantitative data suggests that further&#xD;
      investigation of use of a simplified version of Google Glass in rehabilitation of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, MMDG created Moving Through Glass (MTG), a project that was funded by Google, as a&#xD;
      portable, round-the-clock extension of the internationally acclaimed Dance for PD速. When a&#xD;
      user activates Glass, they can choose from a variety of different exercises, like &quot;warm me&#xD;
      up&quot; or &quot;balance me.&quot; Once selected, they see the founder instructors of the Dance for PD速&#xD;
      projected in front of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a single site research study at Syracuse University, researchers will be conducting the&#xD;
      pilot phase of the research project. MMDG provided the research team with the three pairs of&#xD;
      glasses needed to complete this study. At the end of this study, the glasses will be returned&#xD;
      to MMDG. The MTG questionnaire (described in detail in Section 4), provided by MMDG as part&#xD;
      of their product development, will also be given to the participants to collect information&#xD;
      about the product. MTG questionnaires, including only deidentified, gross data, will be&#xD;
      shared with MMDG as a part of product development, not research. Researchers will NOT be&#xD;
      reporting our research findings to Google or MMDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of MTG on quality of life and motor&#xD;
      functions (i.e. balance, gait, fall efficacy). Researchers are trying to answer the following&#xD;
      questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose #1: What are the Parkinson's disease patients' experiences (constraints, benefits,&#xD;
      strategies, etc) related to physical activity?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose #2: What is the participants' perception of using Google Glass during their daily&#xD;
      activities? In topics related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived competence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Movement independency&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in social interactions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers plan to&#xD;
      recruit 15 subjects in this project. Due to the limited number of Google Glasses (3 pairs),&#xD;
      only 3 participants will go through the study at a given time period. Once recruited, the&#xD;
      participants will be expected to make three visits to Women's Building at Syracuse University&#xD;
      in a one-month period. On the first visit, researchers will go over the consent form with the&#xD;
      participants. Upon signing the forms, participants will be asked to complete the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MOCA, 10 min). The MOCA is shown to be a highly sensitive cognitive&#xD;
      assessment even for mild cognitive impairment and is used widely with Parkinson's population.&#xD;
      Researchers will use this assessment to have a cut-off point for the exclusion criteria for&#xD;
      the participants who are in a high-risk group for dementia. The optimal cut-off value of 22&#xD;
      is determined on a 30-point scale, with 30 indicating no cognitive problems. The scale is&#xD;
      comprised of 7 sub scores that include executive functioning, memory, naming, attention,&#xD;
      language, abstraction, and orientation. If the inclusion criteria are met, the participants&#xD;
      will also participate in a face-to-face semi-structured interview to explore their perception&#xD;
      regarding movement strategies, fear of falling, patterns of physical recreation, perceived&#xD;
      benefits, and constraints. This interview will occur before the implementation of the&#xD;
      program. The duration of each interview will be between 60 to 75 minutes. This interview will&#xD;
      be audio and video recorded. The purpose of video and audio recording of the interviews is to&#xD;
      ensure that we capture the essential meaning of participants' experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the interviews are completed, the participants will receive a package that includes&#xD;
      several questionnaires and surveys.&#xD;
