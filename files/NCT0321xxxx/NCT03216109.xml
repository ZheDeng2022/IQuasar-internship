  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a proactive approach to improve symptom management of&#xD;
      patients with thoracic malignancies and ensure receipt of evidence-based cancer care&#xD;
      delivery. In this pilot study, the investigators propose to evaluate the feasibility of using&#xD;
      outbound, proactive telephone symptom assessment strategies and ensuring evidence-based care&#xD;
      receipt and measure the efficacy of this approach on patient satisfaction with their care,&#xD;
      patient activation, quality of life and use of healthcare resources.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously shown in previous work that patients and caregivers who&#xD;
      experience thoracic malignancies express poor symptom management that result in utilization&#xD;
      of healthcare resources after-hours for symptoms that could have been prevented if assessed&#xD;
      more proactively and prospectively. Currently, there are limited proactive approaches to&#xD;
      prospectively identify and intervene on patient-reported symptoms. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to enhance symptom assessment strategies by using a proactive assessment approach to&#xD;
      improve symptom relief for patients with thoracic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will test whether a proactive telephone symptom assessment and management&#xD;
      strategy is feasible and can facilitate early patient report of their symptoms and&#xD;
      intervention. The knowledge gained from this approach will be used to identify solutions that&#xD;
      can be scaled nationally to improve patient-reported symptom management and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with their clinical care.&#xD;
