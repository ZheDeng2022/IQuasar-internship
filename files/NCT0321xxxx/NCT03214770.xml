  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical study. 48 subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of deep carious&#xD;
      molars without pulpal lesions were randomized to one of two treatments: Patients treated with&#xD;
      Light-cured calcium silicate (Theracal) liner, or treated with light-cured calcium Hydroxide&#xD;
      (Biner LC) liner. Both two Treatments are with the step-wise excavation Technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be done at baseline, collecting dentin sample before application of liner&#xD;
      material, then patients will be dismissed with Resin-modified Glass Ionomer restoration and&#xD;
      recalled after 6 months. Re-entry of tooth required for completing the step-wise excavation&#xD;
      technique collecting the second dentin sample after this time interval (6 months) and&#xD;
      permanently restore tooth with composite restoration. Dentin samples will be&#xD;
      microbiologically analyzed and the results will be statistically calculated.&#xD;

      1. Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be carried out on adult patients attending to the operative clinic in&#xD;
           The Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The procedures will be&#xD;
           carried out by postgraduate student Hanaa Mohamed Morsy [B.D.S. 2011 from Misr&#xD;
           University for Science and Technology] without an assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Variables of the study: A total of 48 carious lesions will be included in the study.&#xD;
           Divided into two groups 24 each. Thus 48 dentin samples will be collected from each&#xD;
           group (24 pre-operative dentin sample and 24 dentin sample after 6 months&#xD;
           post-operative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Trial Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Grouping of participants: Patients will be diagnosed to find carious molars reaching&#xD;
           dentin level. Participants will be divided to two groups randomly according to the type&#xD;
           of liner that will be placed and sample of dentin that will be taken before placement of&#xD;
           liner and after placement (6 months); D1 Dentin sample before and after treatment with&#xD;
           light-cured Calcium Silicate (Theracal) {n=48}, and D2 Dentin sample before and after&#xD;
           treatment with light-cured Calcium Hydroxide ( Biner LC){n=48}.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Intervention/ Control: The procedure will be formed by removing the caries tissue till&#xD;
           reaching dentin, leaving the deep layer for the application of the step-wise technique.&#xD;
           Dentin sample will be taken by a spoon excavator for both groups and stored in a media&#xD;
           to be transferred to the microbiological lab for analysis at the time baseline of the&#xD;
           study (T1). Liner will be applied in the cavity for Group D1 using Theracal, and D2&#xD;
           using Biner LC. For both two groups, molars will be restored with Glass Ionomer&#xD;
           restoration at the time baseline. Patients will be recalled after 6 months for the&#xD;
           re-entry of the restored teeth , removing the Glass Ionomer restoration and collect the&#xD;
           dentin sample (T2) for evaluation of the microbiological count. Finally restoring the&#xD;
           teeth with Composite as the final permanent restoration. the procedure will follow the&#xD;
           manufacturer's instructions for every material used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Outcome: The outcome will be the bacterial count of Streptococcus Mutans of the dentin&#xD;
           samples collected from the tooth included in the study. Agar Diffusion test and Digital&#xD;
           Colony Counter will be conducted for the study. The measuring unit of the bacterial&#xD;
           count is CFU/ml. The first dentin sample will be collected in the baseline time and the&#xD;
           second dentin sample after 6 month for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Randomization: Randomization will be done according to a check list done by a dentist&#xD;
           other than the researcher including the number of participants divided into 2 subgroups&#xD;
           denoting with letter A, B.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Microbiological analysis: Samples will be vortexed for 15 s, diluted, and measured&#xD;
           aliquots of the dilutions will be cultivated in duplicate in 3 different culture media.&#xD;
           Mitis Salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin will be used for counting&#xD;
           of mutans streptococci . For isolation of lactobacilli, Rogosa selective Lactobacillus&#xD;
           agar will be used. Counts of total colony forming units (CFU) will be obtained by&#xD;
           culture in brain heart infusion agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood and enriched with&#xD;
           k-hemin vitamin. The Mitis Salivarius will be incubated under CO 2 conditions at 37 0C&#xD;
           for 48 h. Colonies of mutans streptococci will be counted based on their morphology and&#xD;
           confirmed with catalase test. Rogosa SL Agar and the BHI will be incubated anaerobically&#xD;
           at 37 8C for 72 h. The BHI will be also incubated aerobically at 37 8C for 48 h to&#xD;
           determine the total aerobic counts (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Sample size calculation: The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibacterial action&#xD;
           of TheraCal (light-cured Calcium Silicate base/liner), comparing this material with&#xD;
           Calcium Hydroxide paste. If the expected clinical differences in bacterial count by&#xD;
           digital colony counter, agar diffusion test is 1± 1. Using power 80% and 5% significance&#xD;
           level , we will need to study 17 in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis&#xD;
           that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal. This number&#xD;
           is to be increase to 24 in each group to compensate for possible losses during follow up&#xD;
           according to Petrou et al., 2014. The sample size was calculated by PS program.&#xD;
&#xD;

                Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine - Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Participant enrollment will be done by the principle investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Blinding: It will be a single-blinded study so that the participant will be&#xD;
                blinded, the researcher and the data analysis will be unblinded.&#xD;
