      This is a phase I, single-site, study to evaluate the effects of VOR and HIV-1 Antigen&#xD;
      Expanded Specific T Cell Therapy (HXTC) on persistent HIV-1 Infection in HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals suppressed on ART. Twelve participants with durable viral suppression will be&#xD;
      enrolled and will complete the study. All participants will receive the same treatment and if&#xD;
      eligible, will be dosed with HXTC and VOR. Participants will continue their baseline ART&#xD;
      regimen throughout the study.&#xD;

      Purpose: This study will test the use of special immune system cells called expanded&#xD;
      HIV-specific T Cell (HXTC) Therapy to stimulate the immune system to respond better to HIV.&#xD;
      HXTC Therapy will be given in combination with the drug Vorinostat (VOR) which has been shown&#xD;
      to stimulate some cells infected with HIV to become active and start making HIV virus. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the safety of a series of HXTC infusions in combination with serial doses of&#xD;
           VOR and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Help scientists evaluate ways of re-activating latent (non-active) HIV virus and&#xD;
           determine if the immune system can be made stronger to eliminate the activated HIV&#xD;
           virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Men and women living with HIV, ≥ 18 and &lt; 65 years of age, with durable viral&#xD;
      suppression for ≥ 24 months as measured on standard HIV RNA assays. Eligible participants&#xD;
      must be on stable cART and have a CD4 count ≥ 350 cells/mm3. We plan to enroll up to 12&#xD;
      participants at UNC who complete all 6 Steps of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods):&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 1 and prior to initiating the two series of VOR and HXTC combined therapies, all&#xD;
      participants will undergo study screening and enrollment where they will be required to: 1.&#xD;
      Demonstrate a baseline measurement of the frequency of resting CD4 T cell infection ≥ 0.3&#xD;
      infected cells per million as determined by QVOA, as a further decrease from this low&#xD;
      frequency of infection cannot be definitively measured given the QVOA assay threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with an IUPM measurement &gt; or equal to 0.3 will provide whole blood cells for&#xD;
      the manufacture of their HXTC product (Step 3). Successful manufacturing of the HIV-1 antigen&#xD;
      expanded specific T cells will progress participants to combination treatment in Steps 4 and&#xD;
      5. In Steps 4 and Step 5, participants will receive two series of VOR dosing and HXTC&#xD;
      infusions, for a total 20 doses of VOR 400 mg and 5 HXTC infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first series (Step 4), participants will receive VOR 400 mg PO every 72 hours for 10&#xD;
      doses and 2 infusions of HXTC. The first HXTC infusion will be administered six hours after&#xD;
      the first dose of VOR (HXTC #1) and the 2nd HXTC infusion (HXTC #2) will occur 6 hours after&#xD;
      the 6th dose of VOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second series in Step 5, participants will receive an additional 10 doses of VOR 400&#xD;
      mg PO every 72 hours and 3 HXTC infusions. The first HXTC infusion in Step 5 (HXTC #3) will&#xD;
      occur 6 hours after the 11th dose of VOR (1st dose in Step 5), the 2nd HXTC infusion (HXTC&#xD;
      #4) will occur 6 hours after the 16th dose of VOR, and the 3rd HXTC infusion (HXTC #5) will&#xD;
      occur 1 - 3 days after the 20th dose of VOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are insufficient cells manufactured to allow 5 infusions at 1 x 10-8 cells/m-2 dose,&#xD;
      the dose will be adjusted to allow 5 infusions at a dose &gt; or equal to 5 x 10-7 cells/m-2 but&#xD;
      &lt; 1 x 10-8 cells/m-2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the final HXTC infusion, participants move into Step 6 for a minimum of six&#xD;
      additional visits: 21-26. The 2nd leukapheresis will occur at Visit 23 (Week 21),&#xD;
      approximately 9 weeks after the last HXTC infusion to evaluate the effect of study treatment&#xD;
      on the IUPM by QVOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who receive greater than 8 doses of VOR (3200 mg) will be required to enter&#xD;
      a study cancer registry where they will be contacted once a year for 5 years after completion&#xD;
      of their study participation. The registry was created to monitor participants for the&#xD;
      development of future malignancies given concern for genotoxic impact with the use of VOR.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. ≥ 18 years and &lt; 65 years of age at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ability and willingness of participant to give written informed consent. NOTE: Due to&#xD;
             the lack of foreseeable benefit to study volunteers, the study will not enroll&#xD;
             illiterate or mentally incompetent volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmation of HIV-1 infection HIV infection is defined as documentation by any&#xD;

             is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid&#xD;
             test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is&#xD;
             based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g.,&#xD;
             indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. On antiretroviral therapy for at least 24 months and on potent antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
             for greater than or equal to 6 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Potent ART is defined by current treatment guidelines and consists of at least 2&#xD;

             transcriptase inhibitor, integrase inhibitor, or a protease inhibitor without&#xD;
             interruption (defined as missing more than 9 total days in the 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Other potent fully suppressive antiretroviral combinations will be considered on a&#xD;
             case-by-case basis. Prior changes in or elimination of medications for easier dosing&#xD;
             schedule, intolerance, toxicity, or other reasons are permitted if an alternative&#xD;
             suppressive regimen was maintained.&#xD;

             copies/mL on two consecutive time points in the last 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: A single unconfirmed plasma HIV RNA &gt; or equal to 50 copies/mL but &lt; 1000 c/mL&#xD;
             is allowed if a subsequent assay was &lt; 50 copies/mL; but none in the 6 months&#xD;
             preceding the study screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. CD4+ cell count ≥ 350 cells/mm3 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. No active HCV infection at or within 90 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: No active HCV defined as negative HCVAb or if HCVAb is positive, reflex HCV RNA&#xD;
