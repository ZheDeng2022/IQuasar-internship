  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a clearly necessary neurobiologic process that influences innumerable aspects of&#xD;
      basic daily functions, physical health, and mental well-being. Recent literature shows that&#xD;
      college students across the country are experiencing high rates of sleep deprivation.&#xD;
      Interestingly, some recent studies have implicated this sleep loss in contributing to weight&#xD;
      gain that occurs in the first year of college, also known as the &quot;freshman fifteen.&quot; Rates of&#xD;
      depression and other mental health issues, which are closely connected to sleep disturbances,&#xD;
      are also on the rise in college campuses. The majority of the sleep data obtained in this&#xD;
      population has been via questionnaires and self report, and the studies usually include&#xD;
      college students at all seniority levels (e.g., freshmen, sophomores, seniors). Here, the&#xD;
      investigators outline a novel study investigating how sleep time changes in college freshman,&#xD;
      and how it relates to multiple different aspects of their health and functioning over the&#xD;
      course of one quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As technology has advanced, the ability to easily obtain objective measurements of different&#xD;
      health parameters has increased dramatically. The investigators plan to use wireless&#xD;
      actigraphy devices to measure sleep over a baseline seven day period in college-bound UCSD&#xD;
      students prior to matriculation, and for 2 additional seven day periods during the first&#xD;
      quarter of college. To the knowledge of the investigators, this is the first study to&#xD;
      directly measure sleep time in college freshman in their normal environment. Effects of sleep&#xD;
      time loss will be evaluated through multiple different metrics of physical and mental health.&#xD;
      Given the recent link between sleep disturbances and weight gain in college freshman, the&#xD;
      investigators will plan to measure weight changes prior to entering college and at two&#xD;
      different time points through the first quarter. The investigators will use the PSQ-9 and&#xD;
      GAD7 batteries as measures of mental health, obtained at the same time points as the sleep&#xD;
      and weight information. As one of the primary consequences of sleep deprivation is on&#xD;
      neurocognition in the daytime, the investigators plan to measure vigilant attention using&#xD;
      psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT) as well. Screen time use has recently been targeted as a&#xD;
      possible contributor to sleep loss in adolescents as well as adults and is something the&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to measure as well using a smartphone application. Finally, this&#xD;
      project will test the efficacy of a one hour sleep education intervention on improving total&#xD;
      sleep time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the knowledge of the investigators, no other studies have closely examined how total sleep&#xD;
      time changes during the first year of college in freshman in relationship to weight and&#xD;
      mental health parameters, nor has PVT been done in this context. Additionally, with the&#xD;
      increasing concerns regarding screen time use in adolescents and young adults, this study&#xD;
      provides prime opportunity to examine this issue in the context of sleep.&#xD;
