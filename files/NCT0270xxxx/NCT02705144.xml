      Scientific Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Degenerative lung disorders are the result of inflammatory events that end in destruction of&#xD;
      the normal pulmonary architecture. Two main patterns exist:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
           Until 2020 it is expected to become the third cause of mortality following&#xD;
           cardiovascular disorders and cancer. Emphysema is the destructive form of COPD as the&#xD;
           alveolated tissue disappears. This anatomic pattern is not always homogenous and&#xD;
           functional impairment is not connected to the extent of the tissue destruction.&#xD;
           Therapeutic elimination of the destroyed tissue may be achieved by surgery or by using&#xD;
           various blocking techniques (Lung Volume Reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is characterized by abnormal repair of the respiratory&#xD;
           epithelium. Various diseases may result in PF such as infections, autoimmune (connective&#xD;
           tissue disorders), sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, pneumoconiosis,&#xD;
           histiocytosis X, lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM etc. In many situations a cause effect&#xD;
           relationship cannot be identified and the disease is idiopathic IPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last years cell based therapies using progenitor cells and various scaffolds&#xD;
      became available in various medical fields. Lung regenerative medicine appears to be an&#xD;
      alternative to transplantation in these end-stage diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, very complex cellular composition of the lung, comprising more than 40 different&#xD;
      cell types, makes this objective challenging. The epithelial lining of the respiratory tract,&#xD;
      composed of conducting and respiratory parts, varies along its proximo-distal axis. The&#xD;
      conducting airways from the trachea to bronchioles of human lungs consist of pseudostratified&#xD;
      epithelium, comprising equal proportions of basal cells, secretory cells, and ciliated cells,&#xD;
      as well as some neuroendocrine cells. The smallest bronchioles, known as terminal and&#xD;
      respiratory bronchioles, are lined with a simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium containing&#xD;
      secretory and ciliated cells with fewer basal cells. The epithelia of these conducting&#xD;
      airways form a tight barrier against the outside world and are specialized for the process of&#xD;
      mucociliary clearance. The alveoli are lined by type 1 and 2 alveolar epithelial cells,&#xD;
      called AT1 and AT2, respectively, hereafter. These cells are also specialized for barrier&#xD;
      function and the extremely thin AEC1s share a basement membrane with the surrounding network&#xD;
      of pulmonary capillaries to facilitate the diffusion of gases between the atmosphere and the&#xD;
      circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This general distribution of epithelial cell types is conserved between humans and model&#xD;
      organisms such as rodents. However, there are notable differences. For example, the&#xD;
      transition from a pseudostratified to columnar epithelium occurs more proximally in rodents,&#xD;
      so only the trachea and mainstem bronchi are lined with a pseudostratified epithelium. Nearly&#xD;
      all intralobar airways in mice are lined with a simple columnar or cuboidal epithelium with&#xD;
      few basal cells. In mice, the abrupt transition from a conducting airway to the alveoli is&#xD;
      known as a broncho-alveolar duct junction. In humans, terminal bronchioles give rise to&#xD;
      respiratory bronchioles from which many alveolar ducts terminate ultimately in alveoli.&#xD;
      Considering essential role of epithelial compartment in the lung much effort has been done to&#xD;
      identify epithelial stem and progenitor cells responsible for regenerative and reparative&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epithelial progenitors reside in unique microenvironment or niches, represented by vascular&#xD;
      and mesenchymal cells, which are richly innervated. This architecture highly resembles HSM&#xD;
      niches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable progress has been made in mice toward identifying the signals that regulate lung&#xD;
      epithelial stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. These include Notch, Hippo/Yap,&#xD;
      ROS/Nrf2, EGF, FGF, c-myb, and cytokines including IL-4, -13 and -6. Neighboring epithelial&#xD;
      cells, stromal cells (including mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and&#xD;
      endothelium) and immune cells all represent potential sources for these factors. Distinct&#xD;
      stem cell niches have been defined in adult mouse trachea and lung in the steady state and&#xD;
      there is increasing evidence that in different pathological conditions stem cell niches are&#xD;
      affected and altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very little is known about stem cells and stem cell niches in human adult lung and the&#xD;
      signals which regulate maintenance of the lung tissue homeostasis in health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the Reisner group at the Weizmann Institute has demonstrated that vacating the lung&#xD;
      stem cell niches is a pre-requisite for successful transplantation of mouse or human lung&#xD;
      progenitors (Nature Medicine 2015). To that end, they used an initial lung injury with&#xD;
      naphthalene which triggered an immediate stimulation of endogenous progenitors. Thus within&#xD;
      48 hours the dividing progenitors could be effectively ablated by 6 Gy total body irradiation&#xD;
      enabling effective engraftment of donor lung progenitors (Fig.1).&#xD;
&#xD;

      Tissue damping. Comparison of control mice vs mice with lung injury (Student's t-test,&#xD;
      P=0.015), and of mice with lung injury vs mice transplanted after injury (Student's t-test,&#xD;
      P=0.021). Values are means ± SEM of 10-15 (n=15 control, n=10 injured and n=10 treated) mice&#xD;
      in each group pooled from two independent experiments However, while this conditioning was&#xD;
      required for enabling effective engraftment of donor lung progenitors in normal mice, we&#xD;
      envision that in patients with different lung diseases, the lung niches could be already&#xD;
      partially depleted and therefore transplantation might require less severe conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To characterize stem cell compartments in their niches in different clinical&#xD;
      situations (non-diseased compared to emphysematous and fibrotic pulmonary tissue) and to&#xD;
      assess their proliferative and developmental properties in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further implement lung organoid culture system in the drug screening and development of&#xD;
      patient personalized medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Biopsies of lung tissue will be obtained by surgical procedures: open lung biopsies.&#xD;
      This procedure is routinely performed for histological diagnosis of fibrotic diseases.&#xD;
      Patients with emphysema and end stage fibrotic disease are at higher risk to develop lung&#xD;
      cancer. A large proportion of surgically treated lung cancer patients have emphysema and&#xD;
      fibrotic disease as histologic background. Lobectomy and pneumonectomy are frequently&#xD;
      performed as state of the art procedures in lung cancer surgical management. Part of the&#xD;
      resected lung tissue contain emphysematous and fibrotic changes or make look macroscopically&#xD;
      and microscopically normal. These &quot;non-cancerous&quot; areas will be sampled and preserved at the&#xD;
      Sheba Tissue Bank for evaluation together with samples from fibrotic and emphysematous areas.&#xD;
      The biopsies will be analyzed by immunohistology, FACS and 3D organoids (after the removal of&#xD;
      fibroblasts) at the immunology laboratory at Weizmann Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Samples will be collected following informed consent signatures of patients both on the&#xD;
      designated informed consent form for this protocol and the tissue bank form. We may have as&#xD;
      many as 3-4 patients/ week. Collected samples will be resected by experienced personnel&#xD;
      either from the Thoracic Surgery Department or the Pathology Department (as part of their job&#xD;
      description in the Tissue Bank). Fresh samples will be transported to the Weizmann institute&#xD;
      for FACS and IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As very limited knowledge exists on human lung tissues it will be mandatory to test lung&#xD;
      tissues from healthy and diseased lungs. Initially we suggest testing 10-15 normal lung&#xD;
      tissues and 15-20 diseased samples during the period of 2 years. As mentioned before the&#xD;
      normal lung tissues will be obtained as &quot;non-cancerous&quot; areas from patients undergoing&#xD;
      lobectomies/pneumonectomies.&#xD;
