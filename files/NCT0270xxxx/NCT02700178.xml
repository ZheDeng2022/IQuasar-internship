      This study will evaluate movement of the arm and forces put through the hand during&#xD;
      activities performed in a manual wheelchair. The goal of this study is to identify what&#xD;
      motions and forces are most likely to lead to the development of pain or pathology and&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of strategies to modify movements and decrease risk.&#xD;

      Participants in the study will be asked to participate in the following during the first&#xD;
      (1st) session:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical exam assessing joint motion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires asking about shoulder pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All or a subset of the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Level wheelchair propulsion for up to 10 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Ramp wheelchair propulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Lifting the wheelchair, including into a car (simulated car in therapy area)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Transferring in/out of the wheelchair&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Overhead tasks (such as lifting an object off a shelf)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Reaching&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the next session(s), participants will be asked to participate in all or a subset of&#xD;
      the activities listed above (3a-3f) and will also be guided through a biofeedback&#xD;
      intervention. The intervention will consist of visual and/or auditory cues to guide movement&#xD;
      while performing the tasks. The visual biofeedback will consist of line or shape targets on a&#xD;
      screen that are the participant's goal to achieve with their movements. The auditory cues&#xD;
      will be a tone or multiple tones to alert the participant when to move and/or when targets&#xD;
      have been achieved. During the biofeedback session the study staff may also provide verbal&#xD;
      cues and feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators may review the medical records of the participants to obtain information&#xD;
      about their spinal cord injury, wheelchair and any injury to their muscles, ligaments, bones&#xD;
      or nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all sessions, and prior to performing the activities listed (3a-3f), motion sensors&#xD;
      will be applied to the skin overlying the participant's sternum (chest), shoulder blade, via&#xD;
      a plastic cuff on the arm just above the elbow, and wrist using medical grade adhesive tape.&#xD;
      Sensors that detect muscle activity may also be applied to the skin of the participant's arm.&#xD;
      Sensors that detect force applied by the participant's arm will also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force will be detected using all or a subset of the following tools: exchanging one of the&#xD;
      wheels on the participant's wheelchair for one of the same size that detects force, having&#xD;
      the participant wear a glove that detects force, and using a mat that detects force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activities completed while in this study may be photographed or videotaped.&#xD;
