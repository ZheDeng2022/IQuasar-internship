    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to conduct a fully-crossed 2 X 2 X 2 factorial randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with a diverse sample of 224 MSM recruited from 2 urban HIV primary care&#xD;
      clinics (one in the Northeast and one in the South). The first study factor will compare&#xD;
      brief advice (BA) vs. a motivational intervention (MI) that contains detailed personalized&#xD;
      normative and HIV-specific feedback. The second factor compares an interactive text messaging&#xD;
      (ITM) intervention vs. no text messaging. The final factor compares intervention of low&#xD;
      intensity and duration (two sessions over 1 month) to extended intervention (EI) entailing 5&#xD;
      sessions over 9 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heavy drinking in HIV-infected patients can lead to low antiretroviral therapy adherence and&#xD;
      poor virologic control, greater sexual risk taking, increased risk of liver disease, and&#xD;
      decreased cognitive function. Therefore, reductions in drinking may have particularly&#xD;
      positive and widespread effects in HIV-infected patients. Men who have sex with men (MSM)&#xD;
      continue to represent the majority of new HIV infections, and HIV-infected MSM have rates of&#xD;
      hazardous drinking as high as 33%. Therefore, developing and testing interventions to reduce&#xD;
      heavy drinking in HIV-infected MSM is a very high public health priority. There have been&#xD;
      relatively few alcohol interventions tested that focus on MSM, and only two have addressed&#xD;
      drinking in HIV-infected MSM. Although recent studies indicate that behavioral interventions&#xD;
      can reduce heavy drinking in HIV-infected patients, much remains unknown about the efficacy&#xD;
      of different approaches to behavioral intervention and their unique and combined effects. The&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to conduct a fully-crossed 2 X 2 X 2 factorial randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with a diverse sample of 224 MSM recruited from 2 urban HIV primary care&#xD;
      clinics (one in the Northeast and one in the South). The first study factor will compare&#xD;
      brief advice (BA) vs. a motivational intervention (MI) that contains detailed personalized&#xD;
      normative and HIV-specific feedback. The second factor compares an interactive text messaging&#xD;
      (ITM) intervention vs. no text messaging. The final factor compares intervention of low&#xD;
      intensity and duration (two sessions over 1 month) to extended intervention (EI) entailing 5&#xD;
      sessions over 9 months. BA and MI will be delivered by a core set of interventionists from a&#xD;
      central location using a webcam-enabled telemedicine system, which can facilitate&#xD;
      larger-scale implementation. The design will allow us to test the hypothesis that MI compared&#xD;
      to BA, ITM compared to no ITM, and EI compared to no EI, will result in significantly greater&#xD;
      reductions in number of alcoholic drinks consumed and number of heavy drinking days at 6- and&#xD;
      12-month follow-ups. Secondary outcomes include engagement in unprotected anal intercourse,&#xD;
      ART adherence and viral suppression, CD4 cell count, liver function tests, and neurocognitive&#xD;
      function. We also will test the hypothesis that the effects of MI, ITM, and EI on drinking&#xD;
      will be moderated by alcohol use disorder status and readiness to change drinking such that&#xD;
      these interventions will be relatively more efficacious in those with a current disorder and&#xD;
      those with low readiness. The study will provide crucial evidence regarding which&#xD;
      intervention approaches, alone or in combination, are likely to be most efficient to&#xD;
      implement on a large scale in HIV care settings.&#xD;
