  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well tremelimumab and durvalumab with or without&#xD;
      radiation therapy works in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has returned&#xD;
      after a period of improvement. Monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and durvalumab,&#xD;
      may limit the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread by enhancing immune function.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving&#xD;
      tremelimumab and durvalumab together with radiation therapy may lead to improved clinical&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy (progression free survival [PFS] and objective response rate [ORR])&#xD;
      of combined immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy as treatment for relapsed small-cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact of antigen priming using radiation therapy (XRT) on the efficacy of&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine immune related objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate overall survival measured as time from randomization to death from any&#xD;
      cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD1) expression in paired tumor biopsies at baseline, end of&#xD;
      cycle 2 and at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine dynamic changes in cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) and the&#xD;
      immunophenotype of peripheral blood repertoire of circulating lymphocytes using&#xD;
      multiparameter flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine changes in circulating cytokine mediators of inflammation and immunity&#xD;
      using Luminex assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients achieving disease control may restart treatment upon evidence of&#xD;
      progressive disease, with or without confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy daily for 5 days over 1 week or for 3 fractions&#xD;
      every other day for 1 week and then receive the same treatment as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
