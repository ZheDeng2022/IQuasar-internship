  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if LOAd703 (an oncolytic adenovirus) can be safely given&#xD;
      to patients with pancreatic cancer. The study will also evaluate whether or not intratumoral&#xD;
      injection of LOAd703 will support current standard of care treatment to reduce the size of&#xD;
      the tumor and improve survival of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenoviruses are known as the &quot;common cold&quot; virus and most individuals have had multiple&#xD;
      infections during their lifetime. Oncolytic adenoviruses are adenoviruses that are modified&#xD;
      so they cannot multiply and spread (known as replicating) properly in normal (e.g. healthy)&#xD;
      cells, but instead, they infect and replicate very well in cancer cells. This strong&#xD;
      replication leads to the death of the cancer cell. Oncolytic viruses have been evaluated in&#xD;
      multiple clinical trials for cancer treatment during the past decade and been proven safe. It&#xD;
      is common to have a fever the first day or two after virus injection since the immune system&#xD;
      will react to the virus infection. The immune system can also kill cancer cells but to do so&#xD;
      it needs to be properly stimulated. Oncolytic viruses alone do not seem to be strong enough&#xD;
      to activate clinically relevant anti-cancer responses. However, it is thought that if&#xD;
      additional immune system stimulators are added to the oncolytic viruses they may be able to&#xD;
      result in clinical relevant antic-cancer responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LOAd703 is an oncolytic adenovirus that has been modified to include additional immune system&#xD;
      stimulators. Specifically, genes that stimulate the immune system have been added to the&#xD;
      oncolytic adenovirus. Once the oncolytic adenovirus infects the cancer cells, the genes will&#xD;
      be expressed, resulting in activation of the immune response so it can attack and kill cancer&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, LOAd703 will be given by intratumoral injections. It will be given in addition&#xD;
      to standard of care treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel +/- the anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      atezolizumab. Because this is an experimental therapy, there will be extra visits for disease&#xD;
      monitoring and samples accordingly to the detailed information below. The LOAd703 is an&#xD;
      investigational agent not approved by the FDA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will be conducted at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Baylor St. Luke's&#xD;
      Medical Center (BSLMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive standard of care treatment for their pancreatic cancer. Standard of&#xD;
      care treatment will be gemcitabine in combination with nab-paclitaxel given on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15 of a 28 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: LOAd703 treatment will be initiated at day 15 of the first cycle and given every other&#xD;
      week for 6 doses. Depending on the location of the tumor the injection of LOAd703 can be&#xD;
      given in different ways. The most common route of injection is ultrasound-guided percutaneous&#xD;
      injection, but endoscopic ultrasound-guidance will be used for some patients as appropriate.&#xD;
      All patients will receive anti-anxiety drugs or sedation as needed for comfort during the&#xD;
      procedure. This study evaluates different doses of LOAd703. All patients will receive six&#xD;
      injections of LOAd703. If patients in either phase of the study are judged by the&#xD;
      investigator to be deriving clinical benefit from LOAd703 once all scheduled injections have&#xD;
      been administered, they will be eligible to receive up to 6 additional biweekly doses of&#xD;
      LOAd703.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: the same procedures as arm 1 in regard to LOAd703. In addition, the arm 2 patients&#xD;
      will receive atezolizumab at a fixed dose, every chemotherapy cycle day 1. The treatments can&#xD;
      continue until the final follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits: Besides visits to receive treatments, patients will continue to visit&#xD;
      BCM/BSLMC or their local doctor for evaluation of health status and side effects. At some&#xD;
      visits blood samples will be obtained. Some of the blood samples being obtained are&#xD;
      considered standard of care to ensure patient safety for standard of care treatment and the&#xD;
      LOAd703 injection. However, some blood and biopsy samples (in applicable patients) will be&#xD;
      collected to be analyzed for the presence of LOAd703, atezolizumab tumor markers and&#xD;
      immunology markers. The extra blood will be 5-15 ml (3 teaspoonfuls) of blood collected at&#xD;
      the screening visit and at eight different time points both during treatment and after&#xD;
      treatments are completed. Imaging of the tumor to determine tumor size will be done every two&#xD;
      to three months, which is routine for the monitoring of patients with pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
      Patients will actively participate in the study for about 9 months when the final follow-up&#xD;
      visit will be scheduled (or 12 months if additional doses of LOAD703 are given). After their&#xD;
      active participation is completed patients will continue to receive routine care and will be&#xD;
      contacted by the study team every 3 months to provide follow up on the status of their&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
