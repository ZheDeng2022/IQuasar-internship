  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institution, single-arm, window of opportunity pilot trial of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      in patients with resectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. All patients will undergo a&#xD;
      pretreatment PET/CT scan for clinical staging and a VATS procedure to acquire pretreatment&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three cycles of pembrolizumab will then be administered (200 mg IV every 21 days). A PET/CT&#xD;
      scan will then be repeated to assess response to pembrolizumab and then surgical resection&#xD;
      will be performed at least 4 weeks after the third dose of pembrolizumab. Standard adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and pemetrexed for 4 cycles (every 21 days) will be&#xD;
      given following surgery. After the completion of standard chemotherapy, optional adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab will be given to eligible patients for 1 year post-surgery.&#xD;
