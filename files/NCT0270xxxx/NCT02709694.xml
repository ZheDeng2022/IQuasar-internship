      In patients with Crohn's Disease, symptoms of inflammatory back pain (IBP) precede changes on&#xD;
      plain X-rays by years, and MRI changes of axial inflammation precede development of X-ray&#xD;
      changes. Sacroiliitis on MRI without x-ray changes (i.e.Non radiographic SpA) is a valid&#xD;
      diagnostic criterion for Spondyloarthritis (SpA) and leads to earlier diagnosis of SpA in&#xD;
      patients with IBP. It is unclear when MRI changes occur, and if they precede clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of IBP. There are reports of asymptomatic sacroiliitis noted on MRI in Crohn's&#xD;
      patients. This is important, as MRI evidence of inflammation may be the first sign of&#xD;
      incipient SpA. Inflammation in other regions of the axial skeleton in SpA patients has also&#xD;
      been documented, but its significance is unknown. The prospect of undiagnosed and untreated&#xD;
      inflammation is concerning, as it can lead to significant morbidity. Moreover, relationship&#xD;
      between MRI evidence of axial inflammation-likely a proxy for systemic inflammation- and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (e.g. ASDAS-CRP= Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score- C&#xD;
      reactive protein, BASDAI= Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index, SF-12 = Short&#xD;
      Form- 12, HBI= Hervey Bradshaw Index and PROMIS-29= Patient Reported Outcome Measurement&#xD;
      Information System-29), has not been reported. Recent unpublished data from Dr. Longman's lab&#xD;
      (collaborator) suggest a distinct intestinal dysbiosis in Crohn's associated SpA. But&#xD;
      relationship between this microbiome and MRI changes is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying inflammation earlier on MRI- in the absence of clinical symptoms will provide an&#xD;
      opportunity to intervene early with available therapies, such as- biologics etc. Asymptomatic&#xD;
      MRI changes could be a marker of underlying systemic inflammation- which is a risk factor for&#xD;
      poor outcomes in Crohn's associated SpA. Studying association between whole spine MRI changes&#xD;
      with patient reported outcomes) may facilitate informed clinical decision making to initiate&#xD;
      targeted therapy to prevent progression of structural damage. Understanding microbial&#xD;
      dysregulation in this population, and correlation with MRI changes, could lead to development&#xD;
      of therapy targeted to restore intestinal symbiosis.&#xD;

      IMAGING AND CROHN'S ASSOCIATED SpA: Crohn's disease (CD) is the most common type of&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It affects an estimated 0.7 million patients in United&#xD;
      States and is responsible for 0.2 million hospitalizations each year.1 Although the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract is the primary site of inflammation, inflammatory arthritis (both&#xD;
      peripheral and axial) can affect between 12.8-23% of patients with Crohn's Disease2,3, and&#xD;
      axial SpA alone has been reported to effect 6.7% to 18% of Crohn's patients.4 However, in 2&#xD;
      recent studies5,6, radiological sacroiliitis was reported to be present in 27% and 52% in IBD&#xD;
      patients. MRI changes of inflammation precede radiological sacroiliitis by years but it is&#xD;
      not clear when this occurs. Presence of damage on x-ray in asymptomatic patients may suggest&#xD;
      that Crohn's associated axial SpA could be underdiagnosed. Since Crohn's associated SpA often&#xD;
      affects younger patients, undertreatment or missed diagnoses could have a significant impact&#xD;
      on health related quality of life (HR-QoL) and disability during prime wage earning and child&#xD;
      rearing years.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis&quot; is a term used to describe patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic SpA who do not have findings on plain x-rays. These patients can have identical&#xD;
      symptoms to those with radiographic evidence of cartilage loss and erosions, and anti-TNF&#xD;
      (anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor) therapy has been shown to be effective in those with&#xD;
      non-radiographic SpA.8 These patients are a clinically relevant subgroup, as 20% of patients&#xD;
      with only MRI evidence of sacroiliitis will progress to non-reversible radiographic SpA over&#xD;
      two years.9 Therefore, MRI evidence of sacroiliitis, in conjunction with inflammatory back&#xD;
      pain is now sufficient to diagnosis SpA. In fact, MRI imaging is a standard component of&#xD;
      current SpA diagnostic criteria, (ASAS: Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International&#xD;
      Society),10 and MRI changes of sacroiliitis are routinely used to identify SpA patients for&#xD;
      clinical trials.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite these new definitions there is a deficiency of published research evaluating&#xD;
      the clinical significance of MRI findings in patients with Crohn's disease. Of all the&#xD;
      SpA-associated diseases, Crohn's-associated SpA has a particularly high burden of&#xD;
      extra-articular inflammation. Studies suggest only half to two thirds of patients with CT or&#xD;
      MRI evidence of inflammation have symptoms of inflammatory back pain.1,12 This suggests that&#xD;
      in Crohn's disease, MRI imaging biomarkers may be identifying early disease, analogous to the&#xD;
      way that ultrasound can identify subclinical rheumatoid arthritis.13 We therefore hypothesize&#xD;
      that in a mixed cohort of Crohn's patients with and without inflammatory back pain, MRI&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers will correlate with measures of health status which reflect systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory burden, (i.e. BASDAI, SF-12) independent of symptoms of inflammatory back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI IMAGING BIOMARKERS: A POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTOR? The observed discordance&#xD;
      between axial inflammation seen on MRI and inflammatory back pain raises a particularly&#xD;
      intriguing clinical question: could Crohn's patients with imaging evidence of axial&#xD;
      inflammation but without axial symptoms potentially benefit from therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very well established that in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation is associated with myocardial infarction, stroke and death, and that treating&#xD;
      inflammation improves cardiovascular outcomes.14,15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent population based study from Europe and Canada showed increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality in patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis.16,17 Despite clear evidence that&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk is increased in SpA, how to quantify the increased risk is not&#xD;
      straightforward. There is no consistently reliable marker of systemic inflammation in these&#xD;
      patients; sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may not always reflect&#xD;
      ongoing inflammation, especially in patients with non-radiographic axial SpA9. Therefore,&#xD;
      accurately measuring the inflammatory burden in Crohn's patients, regardless of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal symptoms, is an important area for future research. Initiation of earlier&#xD;
      targeted therapy to decrease inflammation may not only prevent incident Crohn's associated&#xD;
      SpA, progression of prevalent SpA, with concurrent improvements in HRQoL, but may also&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, although sacroiliitis is the primary axial feature in SpA, there is increasing&#xD;
      evidence that there can also be spinal involvement even in the absence of SI joint&#xD;
      inflammation. Recent studies suggest that spinal inflammation can occur in up to one-third of&#xD;
      nonradiographic SpA patients with &lt;5 years of disease duration.18 This could be an important&#xD;
      early imaging inflammatory biomarker. To our knowledge there are no published studies&#xD;
      evaluating spinal and SI joint MRI imaging biomarkers in Crohn's associated SpA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE MICROBIOME: A CORRELATE OF INFLAMMATION IN CROHN'S DISEASE? The etiopathogenesis of&#xD;
      Crohn's Disease-associated SpA remains a puzzle. As with other autoimmune diseases, interplay&#xD;
      between genetic factors such as HLA B27 (Human Leukocyte Antigen- B27) and environmental&#xD;
      factors likely play a role. The joint symptoms of SpA are not consistently correlated with&#xD;
      bowel disease flares.19 Intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in evolution of our&#xD;
      entire immune system, since axenic laboratory animals (germfree animals raised in sterile&#xD;
      environment) were noted to have partial restoration of T cell population when these animals&#xD;
      are colonized with filamentous bacteria. A symbiotic relationship between the main bacterial&#xD;
      phyla is necessary for proper functioning of immune system, since notable alterations in the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiome (i.e. dysbiosis) have been suggested in various autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
      Reduction in taxa-diversity (such as, enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroidales and Clostridiales)&#xD;
      and expansion of certain phyla in the intestine have been recently reported in a large cohort&#xD;
      of new onset treatment-naïve Crohn's disease (CD) patients.20 In addition, Dr. Longman's lab&#xD;
      has shown that the expansion of immunologically relevant Enterobacteriaceae correlates with&#xD;
      Crohn's related SpA among a mixed group of patients with Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, (in&#xD;
      press). However, while these are exciting data, SpA cases were identified using a&#xD;
      non-validated clinical diagnosis, without systematic rheumatology evaluation and no imaging&#xD;
      studies. This will be first study evaluating the microbiome in a carefully phenotyped cohort&#xD;
      of Crohn's associated SpA, who will also have detailed MRI imaging.&#xD;

    <description>MRIs were independently read and scored by 2 expert rheumatologists and 1 newly trained rheumatologist reader, blinded to any clinical information. MRIs were evaluated and scored for presence of bone marrow edema (BME) and structural lesions (erosion, fat metaplasia, backfill and ankylosis) using a validated scoring method originally derived from the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada SIJ module. Readers determined whether BME and the structural lesions were present in each of the quadrants for each participant. There are 2 sacroiliac joints and 4 quadrants for each joint, for a total of 8 quadrants for each participant. A quadrant is deemed affected if concordantly reported by ≥ 2/3 readers.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients were identified by physicians in the study at outpatient IBD clinics at Cornell during scheduled visits and through review of medical records. Gastroenterologists at the IBD clinic and HSS rheumatologists were contacted and asked about potential patients. Flyers were placed in patient rooms so patients could express interest in study. We approached potential subjects via postal and/or email addresses and sent survey questionnaire to determine eligibility. Recruitment done 4/2016-5/2017.</recruitment_details>

          <title>Adult Subjects With Crohn's Disease</title>
          <description>These were consecutive subjects prospectively identified and enrolled from an outpatient clinic of Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) at a tertiary care academic medical center. Subjects between 18 and 65 were enrolled from April 2016 through May 2017. All subjects met clinical, pathological or radiological criteria for CD. Patients with ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, other inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic or reactive arthritis), co-existent autoimmune diseases (eg, celiac disease, Behçet's disease) or skin psoriasis were excluded. All subjects were either biologic naïve or had been off systemic biologics &gt;6 months prior to enrollment and could remain on non-biologic CD therapy (eg, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Patients could also be on vedolizumab, an antagonist of α4β7 integrin in the intestinal epithelium which has no established efficacy in extra-intestinal manifestations of CD. Other exclusions included malignancy less than 5 years in remission (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) or having a contraindication to MRI.</description>

Patients with ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, other inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic or reactive arthritis), co-existent autoimmune diseases (eg, celiac disease, Behçet's disease) or skin psoriasis were excluded. All subjects were either biologic naïve or had been off systemic biologics &gt;6 months prior to enrollment and could remain on non-biologic CD therapy (eg, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Patients could also be on vedolizumab, an antagonist of α4β7 integrin in the intestinal epithelium which has no established efficacy in extra-intestinal manifestations of CD. Other exclusions included malignancy less than 5 years in remission (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) or having a contraindication to MRI.</description>

        <description>MRIs were independently read and scored by 2 expert rheumatologists and 1 newly trained rheumatologist reader, blinded to any clinical information. MRIs were evaluated and scored for presence of bone marrow edema (BME) and structural lesions (erosion, fat metaplasia, backfill and ankylosis) using a validated scoring method originally derived from the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada SIJ module. MRI was considered &quot;positive&quot; for presence of sacroiliitis if it met global evaluation, based on the reader's overall evaluation of presence or absence of sacroiliitis by taking into account the contextual signature of both active and structural SIJ lesions. For analysis, MRI positivity for sacroiliitis was defined based on majority-of-readers agreement (≥2 out of 3).</description>

        <title>Crohn's Disease Activity (Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Score)</title>
        <description>HBI consists of five parameters, which are all clinical. These parameters are: patient well-being (previous day). abdominal pain (previous day), number of liquid or soft stools (previous day), abdominal mass, and complications.&#xD;
Patient well-being is scored with: 0 = very well, 1 = slightly below par, 2 = poor, 3 = very poor, 4 = terrible.&#xD;
Abdominal pain is scored as: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Abdominal mass is scored as: 0 = none, 1 = dubious, 2 = definite, 3 = definite and tender.&#xD;
Complications can be answered with &quot;No&quot; (0 points) or by choosing from a list, with each selection being 1 point. The list is: arthralgia, uveitis, erythema nodosum, aphthous ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, anal fissures, appearance of a new fistula, abscess.&#xD;
Calculation formula: sum of the scores of all 5 parameters. &lt; 5 remission 5 - 7 mild activity 8 - 16 moderate activity &gt; 16 severe activity</description>

        <title>Crohn's Disease Activity (Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Score)</title>
        <description>HBI consists of five parameters, which are all clinical. These parameters are: patient well-being (previous day). abdominal pain (previous day), number of liquid or soft stools (previous day), abdominal mass, and complications.&#xD;
Patient well-being is scored with: 0 = very well, 1 = slightly below par, 2 = poor, 3 = very poor, 4 = terrible.&#xD;
Abdominal pain is scored as: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. Abdominal mass is scored as: 0 = none, 1 = dubious, 2 = definite, 3 = definite and tender.&#xD;
Complications can be answered with &quot;No&quot; (0 points) or by choosing from a list, with each selection being 1 point. The list is: arthralgia, uveitis, erythema nodosum, aphthous ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, anal fissures, appearance of a new fistula, abscess.&#xD;
Calculation formula: sum of the scores of all 5 parameters. &lt; 5 remission 5 - 7 mild activity 8 - 16 moderate activity &gt; 16 severe activity</description>

        <description>MRIs were independently read and scored by 2 expert rheumatologists and 1 newly trained rheumatologist reader, blinded to any clinical information. MRIs were evaluated and scored for presence of bone marrow edema (BME) and structural lesions (erosion, fat metaplasia, backfill and ankylosis) using a validated scoring method originally derived from the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada SIJ module. Readers determined whether BME and the structural lesions were present in each of the quadrants for each participant. There are 2 sacroiliac joints and 4 quadrants for each joint, for a total of 8 quadrants for each participant.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With ≥4 Quadrants Affected by BME or Structural Lesions</title>
        <description>MRIs were independently read and scored by 2 expert rheumatologists and 1 newly trained rheumatologist reader, blinded to any clinical information. MRIs were evaluated and scored for presence of bone marrow edema (BME) and structural lesions (erosion, fat metaplasia, backfill and ankylosis) using a validated scoring method originally derived from the Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada SIJ module. Readers determined whether BME and the structural lesions were present in each of the quadrants for each participant. There are 2 sacroiliac joints and 4 quadrants for each joint, for a total of 8 quadrants for each participant. A quadrant is deemed affected if concordantly reported by ≥ 2/3 readers.</description>

          <title>Adult Subjects With Crohn's Disease</title>
          <description>These were consecutive subjects prospectively identified and enrolled from an outpatient clinic of Jill Roberts Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) at a tertiary care academic medical center. Subjects between 18 and 65 were enrolled from April 2016 through May 2017. All subjects met clinical, pathological or radiological criteria for CD. Patients with ulcerative colitis, indeterminate colitis, other inflammatory arthritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic or reactive arthritis), co-existent autoimmune diseases (eg, celiac disease, Behçet's disease) or skin psoriasis were excluded. All subjects were either biologic naïve or had been off systemic biologics &gt;6 months prior to enrollment and could remain on non-biologic CD therapy (eg, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Patients could also be on vedolizumab, an antagonist of α4β7 integrin in the intestinal epithelium which has no established efficacy in extra-intestinal manifestations of CD. Other exclusions included malignancy less than 5 years in remission (except for non-melanomatous skin cancer) or having a contraindication to MRI.</description>
