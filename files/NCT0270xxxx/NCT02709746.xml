    <measure>Change in Children Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R) Total Score After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From Randomization to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-rated scale to measure the severity of depression of children and adolescents. The CDRS-R consists of 17 items: 14 items rate verbal observations, and three items rate nonverbal observations (tempo of language, hypoactivity, and nonverbal expression of depressed affect). Depression symptoms are rated on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 for the verbal observations, and a 7-point scale from 1 to 7 for the nonverbal observations. The total score ranges from 17 (normal) to 113 (severe depression).</description>

          <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-rated scale to measure the severity of depression of children and adolescents. The CDRS-R consists of 17 items: 14 items rate verbal observations, and three items rate nonverbal observations (tempo of language, hypoactivity, and nonverbal expression of depressed affect). Depression symptoms are rated on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 for the verbal observations, and a 7-point scale from 1 to 7 for the nonverbal observations. The total score ranges from 17 (normal) to 113 (severe depression).</description>

          <title>Change in CDRS-R Total Score During Treatment (at Week 4)</title>
          <description>The CDRS-R is a clinician-rated scale to measure the severity of depression of children and adolescents. The CDRS-R consists of 17 items: 14 items rate verbal observations, and three items rate nonverbal observations (tempo of language, hypoactivity, and nonverbal expression of depressed affect). Depression symptoms are rated on a 5-point scale from 1 to 5 for the verbal observations, and a 7-point scale from 1 to 7 for the nonverbal observations. The total score ranges from 17 (normal) to 113 (severe depression).</description>

        <title>Change in CDRS-R Behaviour Score</title>
        <description>Change in Children Depression Rating Scale - Revised (CDRS-R): Behaviour. The CDRS-R has been widely used for the evaluation of children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The CDRS-R total score is the sum of the responses to 17 items. Each item is graded on a 5- or 7-point scale. behaviour is one of four subscores defined in the CDRS-R:sum of items 1, 2, 3; score ranges from 3 to 21. The highest possible score indicates the most severe measure of depression.</description>

        <title>Change in Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) Score</title>
        <description>The Children's Global Assessment Score (CGAS) is a rating scale which measures psychological, social and school functioning for children. The CGAS is a clinician-rated global scale to measure the lowest level of functioning for a child (4 to 16 years) during a specified time period. The CGAS contains behaviourally oriented descriptors at each anchor point that depict behaviours and life situations applicable to a child. The items range in value from 1 (most functionally impaired child) to 100 (the healthiest). A total score above 70 indicates normal function.</description>

        <population>Double-blind treatment period. There where overall numbers of participants analyzed are not consistent with numbers provided in the participant flow can be due to particpant flow module total number of patients also includes patients that were enrolled but not treated and other reasons of discontinuation from the study.</population>

        <description>The PedsQL™ VAS is designed to measure at-that-moment functioning in children and adolescents. The PedsQL VAS consists of 6 domains: anxiety, sadness, anger, worry, fatigue and pain using visual analogue scales. The functionality for each domain is measured on a 10 cm line with a happy face at one end and a sad face at the other (0-10 points). The patients are asked to mark on the line how they feel. A lower value represents a better outcome.</description>

        <description>PQ-LES-Q total score (items 1 to 14). The PQ-LES-Q is a patient-rated scale designed to assess satisfaction with life. It is an adaptation of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q), which is used to measure quality of life in adults. The PQ LES Q consist of 15 items, item 1-14 assess the degree of satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning (and item 15 allows subjects to summarize their experience in a global rating). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The total score range of item 1-14 (this outcome measurement) is 14 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>
