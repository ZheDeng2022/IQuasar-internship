      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a participation of a medical clown in&#xD;
      videofluoroscopic examination of pediatric speech disorder such as velopharyngeal inadequacy,&#xD;
      improves the collaboration of the pediatric patient, the patient's and the caregivers&#xD;
      subjective experience, and the quality of the examination (shorter exposure to radiation,&#xD;
      shorter time at the radiology suite, more accurate parameters retrieved from the imaging&#xD;
      results).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Velopharyngeal inadequacy (VPI) results in reduced speech intelligibility and nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      regurgitation. VPI is more common in patients who previously underwent cleft palate repair,&#xD;
      in craniofacial syndromes such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, or in neuromuscular diseases.&#xD;
      Part of the work-up sometimes includes videofluoroscopic examination of the palate's movement&#xD;
      during speech. This procedure involves ionizing radiation and requires adequate collaboration&#xD;
      by the examinee. The examination set-up is foreign to the child and can cause stres and&#xD;
      anxiety which can hinder the examination's accuracy and completion. Medical clowns&#xD;
      professionalise in stress relieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective controlled study, the study group will be accompanied by a medical clown&#xD;
      from the arrival to the premise, through the actual examination and after exiting the exam&#xD;
      room. The medical clown will explain about the upcoming examination and will induce a less&#xD;
      stressed atmosphere. After the examination the clown will close the session for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will do the same procedure but without a medical clown. Factors such as&#xD;
      pulse, total time in the examination room, net time of exposure to radiation and quality of&#xD;
      data will be collected for each patient. The patient (if 7 year old and up) and his&#xD;
      caregivers will fill up after completion of the examination a short questionnaire about their&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected and summarized and then a statistical analysis will be made in&#xD;
      order to compare the study group and the control group.&#xD;
