  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to pilot a real time electronic consultation with an&#xD;
      Oncogeriatric Information Team (OGIT) located at Moffitt using Total Cancer Care (TCC).&#xD;
      Investigators want to see for which type of patients this information is the most useful, and&#xD;
      work out the practical ways of making this process work.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study to test a real time consultation system using the Total Cancer&#xD;
      CareTM database (TCC) cohort at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA. The&#xD;
      purpose is to make Moffitt's expertise available to private practice oncologists throughout&#xD;
      Florida. An oncologist seeing an older patient with a difficult case could send key patient&#xD;
      parameters to a senior adult expert at Moffitt. The TCC concierge would extract from the TCC&#xD;
      database patients with similar characteristics. The oncogeriatric information team (OGIT)&#xD;
      would review those cases and provide a summary report of treatments received and outcomes.&#xD;
      The treating oncologist could then use that as an on-demand case series to help in the&#xD;
      decision making. In order to pilot and build up the large scale intervention, several steps&#xD;
      are necessary. The first step was a scenario testing with vignettes, which allowed tracing&#xD;
      the most effective way of retrieving and formatting the information. The next step will be a&#xD;
      pilot testing of the intervention in real time with one private practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess which format of expert-vetted database consultation and patient selection is the&#xD;
      most useful to a private practice oncologist. We will test a model of approach and gain&#xD;
      feedback on subjective utility and objective treatment modification profiles, in order to&#xD;
      target a future study towards the stakeholders most likely to benefit. Impact of the&#xD;
      consultation on treatment plan (per pre-post e-mails). Availability of similar patients in&#xD;
      the TCC database.&#xD;
