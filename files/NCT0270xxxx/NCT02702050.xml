      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation on&#xD;
      mastectomy scars in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) alleviating scar appearance - pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, (ii)&#xD;
      reducing shoulder morbidities, (iii) improving arm functions, and (iv) enhancing quality of&#xD;
      life, in women with breast cancer after mastectomy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer is common among women. After surgical interventions like mastectomies, women&#xD;
      with breast cancer may suffer physical, emotional and psychosocial complications. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that comprehensive physiotherapy program, including patient education, manual&#xD;
      techniques, therapeutic exercises and compression bandaging, is effective in managing the&#xD;
      above complications. Scarring was frequently overlooked in past studies. Besides cosmetic&#xD;
      issues, a post mastectomy scar may cause adverse physical, functional, and psychological&#xD;
      outcomes. The effects of mechanical stimulation on mastectomy scars have not been well&#xD;
      investigated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) alleviating scar appearance - pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, (ii)&#xD;
      reducing shoulder morbidities, (iii) improving arm functions, and (iv) enhancing quality of&#xD;
      life, in women with breast cancer after mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Out-patient physiotherapy breast care clinic at the Hong Kong Queen Elizabeth Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and eight women with breast cancer after mastectomy in recent 6 weeks will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted. 108 women with breast&#xD;
      cancer after mastectomy will be recruited from the breast care clinic of the Queen Elizabeth&#xD;
      Hospital. They will be randomly allocated by block randomization method into either the&#xD;
      mechanical stimulation group (n= 54) or conventional treatment group (n=54).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study groups will receive an educational session before commencement of the program.&#xD;
      Twelve sessions of 40-minute remedial exercises, 5-minute warm up and 5-minute cool down&#xD;
      exercises will be provided within a 6-week period (i.e., two sessions per week) to all&#xD;
      subjects. For the mechanical stimulation group, a ten-minute mechanical stimulation program&#xD;
      will be provided. For the conventional treatment group, no mechanical stimulation will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include scar evaluations by the Vancouver Scar Scale and spectrophotometry.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are composite measurements of shoulder morbidities, including numeric pain&#xD;
      rating scale (NPS), shoulder range of movement and hand grip strength; arm function as&#xD;
      evaluated by the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH-HKPWH) questionnaire; and&#xD;
      quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Breast&#xD;
      Cancer (FACT-B). Outcome assessments at baseline, immediately after the 6-week program, and&#xD;
      3-month follow-up periods will be conducted by blinded assessors at the breast care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21.0. Alpha level will be set at 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Clinical Significance of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of physiotherapy in scar management might potentially improve scar appearance -&#xD;
      pigmentation, vascularity, pliability and thickness, decrease shoulder morbidities, improve&#xD;
      upper limb functions, and enhance quality of life for women with breast cancer after&#xD;
      mastectomy. If the mechanical stimulation protocol is proven to be effective, it will bring&#xD;
      about significant advances in physiotherapy practice in post-mastectomy care in an&#xD;
      evidence-based manner.&#xD;
