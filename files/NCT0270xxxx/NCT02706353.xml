  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have metastatic (cancer that has&#xD;
      spread) melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      APX005M that can be given with pembrolizumab that can be given to patients with metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the combination can help to control&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. APX005M is not FDA approved or commercially available. It&#xD;
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. The combination of these&#xD;
      drugs to treat metastatic melanoma is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 41 participants will be treated in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study&#xD;
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 4 groups of 3 participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      Part 1, and up to 20 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of APX005M you receive will depend on when you join&#xD;
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of APX005M.&#xD;
      Each new group will receive a higher dose of APX005M than the group before it, if no&#xD;
      intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      APX005M is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive APX005M at the highest dose that was&#xD;
      tolerated in Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      APX005M will be injected directly into 1 tumor every 3 weeks (Weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9) for up to&#xD;
      4 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The injections may be done with or without the help of a ultrasound, CT, and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight or be&#xD;
      monitored by a caregiver for 24 hours after you receive APX005M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein 1 time every 3 weeks (Weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12). The&#xD;
      first dose of pembrolizumab will be given 1-2 days before or after your first dose of&#xD;
      APX005M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a diary to write down any injection site reactions you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 week before your first APX005M injection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a punch biopsy or image-guided biopsy of a tumor to check the status of&#xD;
           the disease. To collect a biopsy, the area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small&#xD;
           cut is made to remove all or part of the affected tissue. To collect a punch biopsy, the&#xD;
           area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small cut is made to remove all or part of&#xD;
           the affected tissue. To perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is inserted into the&#xD;
           affected area using imaging such as CT or ultrasound to collect cells or tissue from an&#xD;
           organ, lymph node, or suspected tumor mass. The doctor will use the imaging to guide the&#xD;
           needle into the area.&#xD;
