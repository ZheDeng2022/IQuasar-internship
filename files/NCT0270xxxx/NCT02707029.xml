      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers want to better understand pain by studying people with and without different&#xD;
      kinds of pain. To do this, researchers will expose people to pleasant and unpleasant&#xD;
      sensations. They will ask them questions about their pain. Researchers also want to see if&#xD;
      these people are eligible for other research studies at the National Center for Complementary&#xD;
      and Integrative Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the experience of pain. Also to find people eligible to join other NIH studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 12 years and older with and without pain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have one required visit. This may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about themselves and their pain experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: They will lie on a table that slides into a cylinder. They will feel different&#xD;
           sensations while completing tasks on a computer. This lasts 15 minutes to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative sensory testing: They will be exposed to different pictures, sounds,&#xD;
           tastes, and smells. They will also be exposed to pleasant and unpleasant sensations.&#xD;
           These could include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Burning, itching, or cold sensations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pinpricks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pressure and pinches&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram: Stickers on the chest record heart activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Straps placed around the chest to measure breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small sensors on the fingers or palms to measure pulse and sweating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the next 3 months, participants may have up to 4 other study visits. These last 2 to 4&#xD;
      hours each. They include repeats of some of the tests in the required visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be recorded at the visits.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to allow for the deep, broad, and targeted phenotyping of&#xD;
      persons with or without pain disorders. This protocol will enable NCCIH investigators to&#xD;
      describe the clinical aspects of pain disorders, collect scientific measurements for the&#xD;
      purpose of making deep phenotypic descriptions, and use the collected data to perform&#xD;
      descriptive analyses of pain disorders. The study will also facilitate obtaining information&#xD;
      relevant to determining if a person is potentially eligible to participate in other research&#xD;
      protocols at NIH, in particular those of the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI) at&#xD;
      the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). The specific goals of&#xD;
      this protocol are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To enable the clinical description and phenotyping of research participants, in&#xD;
           particular those with pain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To facilitate obtaining information relevant to determining potential eligibility of&#xD;
           consenting participants to participate in other IRB-approved NIH protocols that focus on&#xD;
           pain and related disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform descriptive analyses of painful experiences within discrete pain disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The study population will consist of up to 10,000 persons with or without&#xD;
      pain disorders, who seek to participate in research protocols at NIH, primarily those&#xD;
      sponsored by NCCIH Division of Intramural Research investigators. Human beings of adolescence&#xD;
      age or older (greater than or equal to 12 years) that are willing to provide assent and/or&#xD;
      consent may participate in the study. This protocol is open to participants of any ethnicity,&#xD;
      gender, or nationality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol is designed as a cross-sectional observational study. Participants will&#xD;
      initially undergo an informed consent process and a core phenotyping evaluation, which&#xD;
      includes a clinical evaluation from a Licensed Independent Practitioner (LIP) and&#xD;
      questionnaires. Following the core evaluation, participants may undergo selected scientific&#xD;
      measurements for phenotyping purposes. Phenotyping measurements can occur over the course of&#xD;
      several months. On completion of the phenotyping measurements, participants will be&#xD;
      discharged from the protocol. After completion, past participants may be contacted to undergo&#xD;
      re-evaluation as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a wide variety of measurement tools for phenotyping purposes. These&#xD;
      include: vital signs, medical history, physical exam, medical record review, qualitative pain&#xD;
      interview, patient reported outcome measurements, psychophysical and behavioral measurements,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory measurements, structural and functional imaging assessments using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging, and psychophysical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the NCCIH phenotyping protocol will enable investigators to obtain detailed&#xD;
      clinical descriptions and collect phenotyping measurements from research volunteers, in&#xD;
      particular those with pain disorders. It will collect information on research volunteers&#xD;
      that, with consent, can be used to determine potential eligibility in other IRB-approved&#xD;
      protocols. The study will allow NCCIH investigators to perform descriptive research on pain&#xD;
      disorders for use in hypothesis generation.&#xD;
