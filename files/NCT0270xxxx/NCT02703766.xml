    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the role of weight gain in adipose tissue immune cell influx and&#xD;
      development of obesity related cardiometabolic disorders. Adipose tissue-mediated chronic&#xD;
      systemic inflammation is implicated in the development of cardiometabolic disorders in&#xD;
      obesity. Therefore, resolution of adipose tissue inflammation may be key to ameliorating&#xD;
      obesity-associated dyslipidemia, insulin-resistance, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Proinflammatory cytokines contribute to the initial influx of immune cells into adipose&#xD;
      tissue during weight gain. However, mechanisms regulating these cytokines in the adipose&#xD;
      tissue milieu and the effects of weight gain on adipose tissue are not completely understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study proposes to investigate the molecular events contributing to increased infiltration&#xD;
      of macrophages and T-cells into adipose tissue during weight gain. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that in lean subjects (with low body fat mass), healthy fat gain which is associated with&#xD;
      decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. However, in obesity (high body fat mass),&#xD;
      adipose tissue is altered, which permits increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      further fat gain results in influx of immune cells. To test the hypothesis, adipose tissue&#xD;
      from well characterized lean (control, with low body fat) and obese individuals (with high&#xD;
      body fat) at baseline and after a modest 5% weight gain will be used. Adipose tissue samples&#xD;
      after subsequent weight loss will also be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, obesity will be defined by body composition rather than body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), as several studies have shown that BMI does not adequately define obesity and several&#xD;
      individuals with normal BMI may indeed have high body fat mass. Individuals with body fat&#xD;
      content ≤25% for men, &amp; &lt;35% for women) will be considered lean and individuals with body fat&#xD;
      content &gt;25% for men, ≥35% for women will be considered obese.&#xD;
