      There is an urgent need for stronger evidence to support recommendations for the role of&#xD;
      sugars in diabetes and related cardiometabolic diseases. Although large prospective cohort&#xD;
      studies have shown a significant positive association of fructose-containing sugars-sweetened&#xD;
      beverages with incident obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, these associations do&#xD;
      not appear to hold true for total fructose-containing sugars and other important sources of&#xD;
      free fructose-containing sugars such as pure fruit juice, yogurt, or even cakes and sweets.&#xD;
      As dietary guidelines have moved away from macronutrient centric recommendations towards more&#xD;
      food and dietary-pattern based recommendations, this inconsistency in the data has not been&#xD;
      appreciated. There remains a focus on free sugars, in the absence of sufficient information&#xD;
      on the role of different food sources of fructose-containing sugars in diabetes and related&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies&#xD;
      is considered to be the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of evidence. To provide evidence-based guidance to&#xD;
      support the development of public health policy in relation sugars and the primary prevention&#xD;
      of diabetes, we will conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the relation&#xD;
      of food sources of fructose-containing sugars with incident type 2 diabetes and related&#xD;
      cardiometabolic diseases in prospective cohort studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Sugars have emerged as one of the most important public health targets. Attention&#xD;
      has focused on the special role of fructose based on its unique biochemical, metabolic, and&#xD;
      endocrine responses. These mechanisms, however, have failed to translate into clinically&#xD;
      meaningful effects in calorie-matched comparisons with other sources of carbohydrate.&#xD;
      Sugars-sweetened beverage (SSBs) appear to be the special case. Whereas large prospective&#xD;
      cohort studies have shown a consistent relation of SSBs with incident obesity, diabetes,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome (MetS), hypertension, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and gout,&#xD;
      associations have not been shown when modeling total sugars (with the exception of gout) or&#xD;
      other food sources of added/free sugars such as pure fruit juices, yogurt, or even sweets. In&#xD;
      the absence of a clear signal for sugars alone, it is unclear whether the associations seen&#xD;
      for SSBs hold for other important food sources of sugars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for a review: As dietary guidelines and public health policy have shifted toward food&#xD;
      and dietary-pattern based recommendations, the lack of high quality syntheses and translation&#xD;
      of the role of different food sources of sugars in cardiometabolic diseases represents an&#xD;
      urgent call for stronger evidence to support guidelines development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To build on our previous work, we will conduct a series of systematic reviews and&#xD;
      meta-analyses to compare important food sources of added/free sugars (SSBs, pure fruit juice,&#xD;
      yogurt, sweets, cereals, etc). in their relation with incident cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Our proposed series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses will follow the same&#xD;
      successful protocol we used for our previous CIHR-funded knowledge synthesis of fructose and&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01363791). The knowledge syntheses will be&#xD;
      conducted according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and&#xD;
      reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses&#xD;
      (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane library will be searched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: We will include cohorts assessing the relation of different food sources of&#xD;
      fructose-containing sugars (SSBs, pure fruit juice, yogurt, sweets, cereals, etc) with&#xD;
      incident type 2 diabetes, MetS, hypertension, CHD, stroke, and gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk&#xD;
      of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: We will assess 6 outcomes: type 2 diabetes, MetS, hypertension, CHD, stroke, and&#xD;
      gout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Risk ratios will be pooled using the generic inverse variance method for each&#xD;
      food source of fructose-containing sugars. Random-effects models will be used even in the&#xD;
      absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses&#xD;
      will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q&#xD;
      statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically&#xD;
      removed. If there are &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses (follow-up, adjustments, exposure assessment,&#xD;
      dose, outcome ascertainment, risk of bias). Meta-regression analyses will assess the&#xD;
      significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When &gt;=10 studies are&#xD;
      available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal&#xD;
      testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study&#xD;
      data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: We will follow the Ottawa model. Results will be disseminated&#xD;
      through presentations at scientific meetings and publication in high impact journals.&#xD;
      Webcasts and social media posts on YouTube videos, Facebook, twitter and LinkedIn will also&#xD;
      be used. Target adopters will include clinicians, allied health professionals, policy makers,&#xD;
      industry, researchers, and patient groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the health&#xD;
      effects of food sources of sugars, informing evidence-based guidelines and improving health&#xD;
      outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and&#xD;
      guiding future research design.&#xD;
