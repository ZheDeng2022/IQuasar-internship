  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new era of outcomes for pediatric burn patients has begun as burn care continues to&#xD;
      improve. Unfortunately, complete restoration of burn-injured skin may be limited by the&#xD;
      development of hypertrophic scarring. Treatment with laser therapy is one of the newest forms&#xD;
      of scar therapy available. Although laser therapy has only been adopted by burn clinicians&#xD;
      within the last several years, early evidence suggests that it may offer significant&#xD;
      benefits. Thus the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using laser&#xD;
      therapy to treat hypertrophic burn scars in pediatric patients by using a comprehensive set&#xD;
      of subjective and objective scar assessment tools.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vancouver Scar Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (month 0) to month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Vancouver Scar Scale is composed of four subscales which include pigmentation (range: 0 - 3), vascularity (range: 0 - 3), pliability (range: 0 - 5), and height (range: 0 - 3).&#xD;
Total Vancouver Scar Scale score refers to the score obtained by summing the values from each subscale (range: 0 - 14) with higher scores indicating a worse scar.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (month 0) to month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale consists of two independent scales: 1) the patient scale (patient-reported), and 2) the observer scale (clinician-reported). Both the patient scale as well as the observer scale include a set of individual subscales that assess scar severity (range: 1 - 10) with higher scores indicating a worse scar.</description>

    <measure>Scar thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline(month 0) to month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Scar thickness measurements will be taken at five study visits over the course of one year and will be measured using ultrasonography.</description>
