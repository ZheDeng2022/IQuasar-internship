    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of entinostat used in&#xD;
      combination with atezolizumab in patients with Advanced Triple Negative Breast Cancer&#xD;
      (aTNBC). Additionally the purpose of the study is to assess how effective entinostat and&#xD;
      atezolizumab are in combination in patients with aTNBC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SNDX-275-0602 is a Phase 1b/2 study evaluating the combination of entinostat plus&#xD;
      atezolizumab in patients with aTNBC. The study has 2 phases: an open-label Dose Determination&#xD;
      Phase (Phase 1b) followed by an Expansion Phase (Phase 2). The Expansion Phase will evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of entinostat when administered at the RP2D with atezolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with aTNBC in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled setting. Up to 88&#xD;
      evaluable patients are anticipated if the study completes all phases of evaluation (up to 18&#xD;
      patients for Phase 1b, up to 70 patients for Phase 2). Up to 30 study centers in the US and&#xD;
      Europe may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed during the study by documentation of AEs, clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Eastern&#xD;
      Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. Adverse events of special interest&#xD;
      (AESI) will be collected and reviewed in a manner consistent with serious adverse event&#xD;
      reporting procedures.&#xD;
