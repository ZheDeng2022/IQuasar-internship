      Specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To outline and evaluate key active elements of the Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure&#xD;
           Reduction (MB-BP) intervention. This aim will be achieved using (a) focus groups of&#xD;
           participants undergoing the MB-BP intervention, (b) discussion with experts (including&#xD;
           cardiologists, epidemiologists, mindfulness experts, mindfulness intervention&#xD;
           instructors) prior to, and following pilot testing of MBHT in participants, and (c)&#xD;
           clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate impacts of MB-BP on target engagement (pre-post change in effect size) and&#xD;
           longevity of target engagement (follow-up time-points). Follow-up time periods include&#xD;
           10 weeks, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective single-arm trial during the intervention development phase.&#xD;
      Following this phase, after the intervention has been further developed, a subsequent study&#xD;
      (with a different clinicaltrials.gov identification #) will utilize a randomized control&#xD;
      trial design to further evaluate causation and effect size.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness interventions customized for prehypertensive/hypertensive patients have never&#xD;
      been investigated. Until methodologically rigorous studies to evaluate customized&#xD;
      interventions for hypertension are performed, we will not know if the observed preliminary&#xD;
      effects of general mindfulness interventions on blood pressure reduction could be much more&#xD;
      effective with a tailored approach. Consequently, we propose to conduct a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention study to evaluate whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) customized&#xD;
      to prehypertensive and hypertensive patients has the potential to provide clinically relevant&#xD;
      reductions in blood pressure. This customized intervention is called Mindfulness-Based Blood&#xD;
      Pressure Reduction (MB-BP). This study follows the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral&#xD;
      Intervention Development, where targets likely proximally affected by the intervention are&#xD;
      identified, that should also have effect on the longer-term outcomes (e.g. blood pressure,&#xD;
      mortality). The selected targets, consistent with theoretical frameworks and early evidence&#xD;
      how mindfulness interventions could influence mental and physical health outcomes, are&#xD;
      measures of self-regulation including (1) attention control (specifically the Sustained&#xD;
      Attention Response Task), (2) emotion regulation (specifically the Difficulty in Emotion&#xD;
      Regulation Scale), and (3) self-awareness (specifically the Multidimensional Assessment of&#xD;
      Interoceptive Awareness). Based on the degree of target engagement, MB-BP can be further&#xD;
      customized to better engage with the targets as needed. The grant funding this study is&#xD;
      performing a concurrent systematic review of impacts of mindfulness interventions on&#xD;
      self-regulation outcomes. Based on the findings from the systematic review, other&#xD;
      self-regulation measures will be explored as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims are:&#xD;

        1. To outline and evaluate key active elements of MB-BP. This aim will be achieved using&#xD;
           (a) focus groups of participants undergoing the MB-BP intervention, (b) discussion with&#xD;
           experts (including cardiologists, epidemiologists, mindfulness experts, mindfulness&#xD;
           intervention instructors) prior to, and following pilot testing of MBHT in participants,&#xD;
           and (c) clinical judgment of the investigators performing the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>MB-BP (Mindfulness-Based Blood Pressure Reduction) customizes Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to participants with prehypertension/hypertension. MB-BP will consist of nine 2.5-hour weekly group sessions and an 7.5-hour one-day session. Some of the unique areas of MB-BP are education on hypertension risk factors, hypertension health effects, and specific mindfulness modules focused on awareness of blood pressure determinants such as diet, physical activity, antihypertensive medication adherence, alcohol consumption, and stress reactivity. Students learn a range of mindfulness skills including body scan exercises, meditation and yoga. Homework consists of practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week.</description>
