    <textblock>
      This study compares two different types of speculum insertion to determine the level of&#xD;
      discomfort they might cause. This study compares the straight horizontal insertion (SHI) of&#xD;
      the speculum and the vertical insertion and rotation (VIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of the two insertion groups and are not told which&#xD;
      group they are in until the examination is over. Participants rate their level of discomfort&#xD;
      immediately after insertion of the speculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic demographic information (e.g., age, ethnicity, number of vaginal deliveries, menopausal&#xD;
      status, etc.) and clinical information are also collected to determine if other factors&#xD;
      influence the level of discomfort experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *NOTE* This is NOT a paid study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most medical schools around the world, speculum examination is taught using a bivalved&#xD;
      speculum, since this is the type of speculum most commonly used in clinical practice. Due to&#xD;
      the oval shape of the vulva, and the alignment of the labia majora and minora, the aperture&#xD;
      of vaginal introitus is commonly perceived to have a vertical orientation. In reality&#xD;
      however, the vaginal introitus is round and the vagina itself has more of a horizontal&#xD;
      orientation: the anterior and posterior vaginal walls are opposed, and the sidewalls only&#xD;
      become apparent once the anterior and posterior walls are separated. Nevertheless, the most&#xD;
      common way of teaching the speculum examination worldwide is to introduce the speculum in a&#xD;
      vertical orientation and then once it is successfully inserted into the vagina to rotate it&#xD;
      90Â° into a horizontal position. Once it is correctly positioned, it is slowly opened to&#xD;
      visualize the vaginal epithelium and the cervix. However, in clinical practice, the rotation&#xD;
      of the speculum in the vagina may cause pain and discomfort. Introduction of the speculum&#xD;
      initially in a horizontal orientation, without rotation in the vagina, seems more appropriate&#xD;
      and could potentially be associated with less discomfort or pain for women undergoing this&#xD;
      exam. In practice, a minority of clinicians separate the labia first, introduce the speculum&#xD;
      in a direct horizontal fashion, and thus avoid the potentially uncomfortable twisting part of&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to quantify the amount of pain/discomfort women experience with two different types of speculum insertion: straight horizontal insertion (SHI) and vertical insertion and rotation (VIR). Participants will rate their pain/discomfort by placing a mark on a visual analog scale measuring 10 cm in length. Pain/discomfort ratings on this scale range from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;pain as bad as it possibly could be&quot;.</description>
