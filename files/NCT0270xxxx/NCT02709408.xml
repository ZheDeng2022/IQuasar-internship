  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among antibiotic-resistant organisms, the Gram-negative bacteria are now the most important&#xD;
      challenge because of the rapid worldwide spread of mechanisms conferring resistance to&#xD;
      multiple drugs. The most recent and worrying problem is the emergence and spread of&#xD;
      carbapenemases. Additionally, carbapenem-resistance is known to be very frequent among&#xD;
      Acinetobacter baumannii isolates for many years. Overall, the therapeutic options available&#xD;
      against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and A. baumannii (CRAB) are very&#xD;
      limited. The best available treatment (BAT) against CRE is unknown, which is a challenge for&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions and also for the design of randomized trials with new drugs. The&#xD;
      generic objectives of EURECA are to obtain high-quality observational data to inform the&#xD;
      design of randomized controlled trials for complicated intraabdominal infections, pneumonia,&#xD;
      complicated urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections due to Carbapenem-resistant&#xD;
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobater baumannii, and to provide&#xD;
      cohort data that could eventually be used as historical controls for future comparisons with&#xD;
      new drugs targeting CRE. This will be achieved by a prospective, multinational cohort study&#xD;
      of patients with targeted infections due to CRE and CRAB, and by matched case-control-control&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: 5 independent predictors for cure and mortality can be identified, including active&#xD;
      empirical therapy, early targeted optimized therapy and early source management if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: For pneumonia, cIAI (complicated intrabdominal infection) and BSI (bloodstream&#xD;
      infection), combination therapy with two active drugs, one of them being (if available) an&#xD;
      &quot;active&quot; beta-lactam (such as meropenem or imipenem if minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]&#xD;
      &lt;16 mg/L, aztreonam if isolate is susceptible as in many metallo-beta-lactamase producers, or&#xD;
      cephalosporin if isolate is susceptible as in some OXA-48 producers). For cUTI (complicated&#xD;
      urinary tract infection), monotherapy with an &quot;active&quot; beta-lactam as above, colistin or an&#xD;
      aminoglycoside (if active in vitro) is as effective as combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Clinical cure rate at test of cure (TOC) will be 50% with BAT. H4: Specific carbapenemase&#xD;
      types do not independently influence cure rate or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H5: CRE infections caused by isolates showing a carbapenem MIC &lt;16 mg/L are associated with&#xD;
      higher probability of cure and lower mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H6: five significant independent predictors (risk factors) for CRE infection can be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H7: the targeted infections due to CRE are significantly and independently associated with&#xD;
      higher mortality, hospital stay and hospital costs than infections caused by&#xD;
      carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (CSE) or than other diseases causing&#xD;
      hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. O1. To characterise the features, clinical management and outcomes of&#xD;
      hospitalised patients with cIAI, pneumonia, cUTI and BSI caused by CRE and CRAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O1A. To provide cohorts of patients with the targeted infections caused by CRE and CRAB that&#xD;
      would eventually be used as historical cohorts for comparison of efficacy and safety of newer&#xD;
      drugs against these organisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O1B. To identify the outcome predictors of patients with cIAI, pneumonia, cUTI and BSI caused&#xD;
      by CRE and CRAB, with identification of the best alternative therapy (BAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      O1C. To exploratively investigate the importance of the specific carbapenemase and&#xD;
      carbapenem-MIC in the outcome of CRE and CRAB infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O2. To identify the risk factors for target infections caused by CRE to inform a more&#xD;
      efficient design of future randomized clinical trials for these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O3. To assess the mortality, length of hospital stay and hospital costs associated with&#xD;
      target infections caused by CRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND STUDIES To answer the above objectives, a prospective, multinational, multicentre,&#xD;
      observational and analytic project including 3 studies was design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1. For the analysis of outcome predictors of CRE and CRAB infections (objective 1), a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study of patients with the target infections due to CRE and CRAB will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2. For the analysis of risk factors for target infections caused by CRE (objective 2),&#xD;
      a nested case-control-control will be performed. The first group of controls will be formed&#xD;
      by matched patients with CSE infections, and the second groups of controls will be formed by&#xD;
      admitted patients non-infected patients by CRE or CSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3. For the analysis of cost, outcome impact and length of stay associated to target&#xD;
      infections caused by CRE (objective 3), a matched cohorts study will be performed. The&#xD;
      cohorts will be formed by selected patients with infections due to CRE and the patients with&#xD;
      infections due to CSE (identical to the CSE control group above). Additionally, a control&#xD;
      group of admitted patients not infected by CRE or CSE will be studied (identical to the&#xD;
      admitted control group above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING This study will be performed in 50 European hospitals from Spain, Italy, Greece,&#xD;
      Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD The recruitment period of the study is planned from February 2016 to June 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS (MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES) See below&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY VARIABLES AND DEFINITIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRE: any isolate identified as an Enterobacteriaceae showing a minimum inhibitory&#xD;
           concentration (MIC) ≥1 mg/L if using any dilution method and/or ≤22 mm if using a&#xD;
           disc-diffusion method for imipenem or meropenem (10 µg disks); all others will be&#xD;
           considered carbapenem susceptible (CSE), but meropenem and imipenem susceptible isolates&#xD;
           showing resistance to ertapenem will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRAB: Any isolate identified as Acinetobacter baumannii showing a minimum inhibitory&#xD;
           concentration (MIC) ≥16 mg/L for imipenem or meropenem if using any dilution method&#xD;
           and/or ≤17 mm for meropenem and/or ≤15 for imipenem if using a disc-diffusion method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent variables for Study 1: demographics, comorbidities in adults (Charlson's&#xD;
           index), comorbidities in children (ARPEC PPS definitions), type of acquisition, systemic&#xD;
           inflammatory response syndrome severity in adults, sepsis criteria in children, Pitt&#xD;
           score, SOFA score, APACHE-II score, PIM2, invasive procedures, neutropenia,&#xD;
           microbiological variables (poly or monomicrobial infection, carbapenemase producer,&#xD;
           carbapenemases type, susceptibility profile, carbapenem MIC), clinical management&#xD;
           (source control and support therapy), antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent variables for Study 2: demographics, length of hospital stay,&#xD;
           epidemiological variables (travels, previous contact with persons colonised by CRE,&#xD;
           previous hospitalization, nursing home or other long term-care facility residency,&#xD;
           previous colonisation by CRE), comorbidities, acquisition type, SIRS severity in adults,&#xD;
           sepsis in children, Pitt score, SOFA score, APACHE-II score, PIM2, invasive procedures,&#xD;
           neutropenia, type of infection, microbiological variables, antibiotics received in the&#xD;
           last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent variables for Study 3: all those included in Study 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND FOLLOW-UP Data will be collected by trained local investigators. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for 30 days from day 0. Data prior to study entry will be collected by&#xD;
      reviewing medical records or interviewing the patient, his/her family or the attending&#xD;
      healthcare staff. After that, the patients will be followed prospectively. If the patients&#xD;
      had been discharged before assessement, outcome must be assessed by an outpatient visit or&#xD;
      phone call according to a pre-design questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MICROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES. All procedures will be performed locally using accepted, standard&#xD;
      microbiological protocols. Isolates identified as CRE or CRAB according to above criteria&#xD;
      will be locally studied for carbapenemase production using the CARBA-NP test. Susceptibility&#xD;
      tests to key antimicrobial agents will be collected. Isolates preservation CRE and CRAB&#xD;
      isolates will be preserved locally at least at -20ºC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY ASSESMENT No investigation drugs will be used in this study. Adverse event will be&#xD;
      collected during follow-up as one variable of interest for analysis purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1 The sample size for the CRE and CRAB cohorts were calculated so that the cohorts&#xD;
           may serve as 'historical' cohorts for future comparison with new drugs for CRE and CRAB.&#xD;
           To do so, and because the estimates for the outcome variable of the new drug is unknown,&#xD;
           we seek to estimate the clinical cure rate of BAT with 95% confidence interval and 8%&#xD;
           precision. For an estimated cure rate of 50% based on data from previous studies, 151&#xD;
           patients for each of the five types of infection are needed (due to CRE: cUTI,&#xD;
           pneumonia, cIAI, and BSI; due to CRAB: BSI). However, because around 25% of patients&#xD;
           will not receive BAT, we will need 201 patients per type of infection except for BSI due&#xD;
           to A. baumannii, for which we will need 221 because some blood isolates identified as&#xD;
           Acinetobacter spp in sites not specifying the species will not be A. baumannii (total,&#xD;
           1025 patients). Such sample size will be enough also to investigate the best available&#xD;
           therapy with the merged CRE cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 2: The CRE case group will be formed by 248 patients with CRE infections selected&#xD;
           from the study 1 cohort. Per each CRE case, one CSE control patient and 3 non-infected&#xD;
           controls will be selected. Because of possible heterogeneity due to the different&#xD;
           infection types, we have chosen to over sample by a ratio of 248/201*100%. The number of&#xD;
           matched controls has been chosen to be four which is well known to well approximate the&#xD;
           power of full cohort data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 3 The CRE, CSE and non-infected cohorts will be formed by the same patients as in&#xD;
           Study 2. Therefore, the sample size rationale is as for Study 2, however with the&#xD;
           refinement that the nested case control matching is now viewed as an exposure density&#xD;
           sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 1. The outcomes associated with exposure to different variables will be compared;&#xD;
           the targeted exposures will be empirical active antimicrobial therapy, early targeted&#xD;
           optimized therapy, and early source control. Antimicrobial regimens will be analysed as&#xD;
           empirical (administered before the susceptibility testing is available) and targeted&#xD;
           (thereafter) therapy. The primary endpoint &quot;mortality from any cause until day 30&quot; will&#xD;
           be analysed using survival methods (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression). The other primary&#xD;
           endpoint &quot;clinical response at TOC&quot; will be analysed as a dichotomous outcome,&#xD;
           regression analyses will use the logistic regression model. The analysis of the&#xD;
           secondary endpoints will be analogous. Microbiological response at TOC is a&#xD;
           polychotomous outcome and will be analysed using multinomial logistic regression.&#xD;
           Goodness of fit will be assessed throughout. Variable selection will be based on&#xD;
           Akaike's information criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 2. Exposure to potential risk factors of patients will be compared between CRE&#xD;
           cases and CSE controls, and between CRE cases and admitted controls. A stratified and&#xD;
           weighted Cox analysis will be performed. Multilevel hospital data (local rate of CRE,&#xD;
           antimicrobial consumption, infection control measures) will also be considered in the&#xD;
           analyses above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study 3. The impact of CRE infection on mortality, length of stay, cost, length of&#xD;
           hospital and ICU stay, and length of mechanical ventilation of patients will be assessed&#xD;
           by comparison with those of CSE infection and admitted patients. All time-to-event&#xD;
           outcomes (for costs and extra hospital/ICU days see below) will be compared using&#xD;
           survival techniques. Because the outcome infection due to CRE is subject to the&#xD;
           competing risks of death in hospital w/o CRE infection and discharged alive from&#xD;
           hospital with or without CRE infection, the analyses shall be supplemented by those of&#xD;
           the competing outcomes. Goodness of fit will be assessed throughout. Extra hospital/ICU&#xD;
           days will be estimated using the multistate approach of Beyersmann et al. Variable&#xD;
           selection will be based on Akaike's information criterion. Goodness of fit will be&#xD;
           assessed throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS. Prior to initiation of a study site, approval will be sought from the&#xD;
      appropriate regulatory agency and local Ethics Committees of Research or IRBs to conduct the&#xD;
      study in accordance with regulatory requirements. This is an observational study and&#xD;
      therefore no intervention is performed on behalf of the investigation. Management of all&#xD;
      patients including all antibiotic regimens prescribed will be decided by the physician&#xD;
      doctor/team in charge without any interference. The processing of the patients' personal data&#xD;
      collected in this study shall comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and with the European&#xD;
      Directive on the Privacy of Data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MONITORING The study will be monitored for quality and consistency of data.&#xD;

        Selection criteria for CRE GROUPS and CRAB GROUP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria (all must be fulfilled):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolation of CRE or CRAB from a clinical sample (e.g., a sample obtained in the&#xD;
             work-up of a patient with suspicion of infection; therefore, screening samples are not&#xD;
             considered).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient meets the criteria for any of the following infections (see definitions&#xD;
             below): complicated urinary tract infection, pneumonia, intraabdominal infection or&#xD;
             bloodstream infection (if the source of infection is any of the above, the patient&#xD;
             will be included in both groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or his/her representative sign the inform consent if requested by the local&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in these groups will be included until the needed sample sizes are reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The infection is considered to be polymicrobial according to standard microbiological&#xD;
             interpretation of culture results (except for cIAI, in which polymicrobial infections&#xD;
             are allowed).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient was previously included in the same cohort of this study for the same&#xD;
             organism. A single episode of CRE or CRAB per patient can be included. Patients who&#xD;
             suffer a CRE infection could later be included in the CRAB cohort if developing a CRAB&#xD;
             infection and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Isolation of CSE from a clinical sample (e.g., a sample obtained in the work-up of a&#xD;
             patient with suspicion of infection; therefore, screening samples are not considered).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient meets the criteria for any of the following infections (see definitions&#xD;
             below): complicated urinary tract infection, pneumonia, intraabdominal infection or&#xD;
             bloodstream infection (if the source of infection is any of the above, the patient&#xD;
             will be included in both groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The infection is the same as that of the index case; in case of BSI, the source of&#xD;
             bacteraemia must be the same as the index case classified as follows: UTI, pneumonia,&#xD;
             intraabdominal infection or any other.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The type of acquisition is the same as for the index CRE case (nosocomial or&#xD;
             community).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The previous length of hospitalization before the infection onset is minus 1 up to&#xD;
             minus 3 days the previous length of hospitalization before the CRE infection date in&#xD;
             the CRE correspondent (up to minus 7 days if the CRE case occurred after 14 days of&#xD;
             previous stay).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient was admitted to the same type of service as the index case (medical,&#xD;
             surgical, ICU, neonatal Unit, paediatric ICU, general paediatric wards).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or his/her representative sign the inform consent (if requested by local IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in this group will be included until the needed sample size is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The infection is considered to be polymicrobial according to standard microbiological&#xD;
             interpretation of culture results (except for cIAI, in which polymicrobial infections&#xD;
             are allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is participating in a clinical trial that involved active treatment for the&#xD;
             infections at assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with do not resuscitate orders or with a life expectancy of &lt;30 days. The&#xD;
             first patient found with all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Selection criteria for ADMITTED CONTROL GROUP Inclusion criteria (all must be fulfilled)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is admitted in the same hospital ward where was admitted the index CRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The previous length of hospitalization is at least one day less than the previous&#xD;
             duration of hospitalisation of the correspondent CRE case when the CRE infection&#xD;
             occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or his/her representative sign the inform consent (if requested by local IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in this group will be included until the needed sample size is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient was participating in a clinical trial that involved active treatment for the&#xD;
             infections at assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with do not resuscitate orders or with a life expectancy of &lt;30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the search for CSE controls is more difficult, the search for admitted control&#xD;
        patients can be started once a CSE control has been included; the first 3 patients with the&#xD;
        above inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be included.&#xD;
