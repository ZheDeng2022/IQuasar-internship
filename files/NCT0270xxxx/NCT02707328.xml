      This study is looking at determining the maximum safe dose of CyberKnife when given with&#xD;
      chemotherapy for unresectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the MTD for radiosurgery in the treatment of&#xD;
      unresectable pancreas cancer, this MTD can then be used in future phase II or III studies. In&#xD;
      terms of starting dose for the phase I study, based on the low toxicity seen in the Moffitt&#xD;
      study we feel that 30 Gy in five fractions will be a successful starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the data in unresectable is derived from patients in the metastatic setting in terms&#xD;
      of chemotherapy agents. There have been two major studies that looked at various chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens versus the previous standard of care Gemzar. One study found improved survival with&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX and a second found that the combination of nab-paclitaxel and gemzar were superior&#xD;
      to gemzar alone. Thus, the current standard of care for metastatic pancreas cancer (in which&#xD;
      a local therapy like radiation has more limited role) is either FOLFIRINOX or gemzar and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel. While there is some discussion of a randomized study comparing FOLFIRINOX and&#xD;
      gemzar combined with nab-paclitaxel such a study has not started as of this time and it is&#xD;
      unclear how much interest there would be in accruing to this study. Therefore the exact best&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease is unclear but is either FOLFIRIONX or&#xD;
      gemzar-nab-paclitaxel. The chemotherapy regimens for unresectable cancer are extrapolated&#xD;
      from the metastatic setting, per NCCN guidelines any chemotherapy regimen approved for&#xD;
      metastatic disease is reasonable to use in unresectable pancreas cancer. Thus for purpose of&#xD;
      this study we have chosen one of the two chemotherapy regimens that have shown the best&#xD;
      results in the metastatic setting, since there is no way to determine the exact best regimen&#xD;
      we have chosen gemzar and nab-paclitaxel since it is felt that this is a less toxic regimen&#xD;
      as compared to FOLFIRINOX.&#xD;
