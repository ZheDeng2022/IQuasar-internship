  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a efficacy and safety study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) as monotherapy in&#xD;
      participants with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts: participants with advanced&#xD;
      HCC and with no curative option after disease progression on sorafenib or intolerance of&#xD;
      sorafenib (Cohort 1) or who had not received treatment for systemic disease (Cohort 2). Study&#xD;
      participants may receive pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for up to 35 initial cycles (up to&#xD;
      approximately 2 years) and a potential additional 17 cycles in a re-treatment phase&#xD;
      (approximately an additional 1 year of treatment) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the Objective Response Rate (ORR) of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab given as monotherapy in participants with HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective with Amendment 7: Upon study completion, participants are discontinued and may be&#xD;
      enrolled in a pembrolizumab extension study, if available.&#xD;
