      MTN-032 is an exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials that will utilize&#xD;
      qualitative In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus-Group Discussions (FGDs) to explore&#xD;
      socio-contextual and trial specific issues which affected participants' adherence to the&#xD;
      dapivirine vaginal ring (VR), as well as male partner attitudes towards and experiences with&#xD;
      the dapivirine VR and their perspective of their female partner's attitudes and experiences.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MTN-032 trial is a two-phase exploratory sub-study of the ASPIRE and HOPE trials. A total&#xD;
      of 187 former ASPIRE participants aged 19-48 years were enrolled in Phase 1 of this study. Up&#xD;
      to 156 HOPE participants and up to 120 male partners of HOPE participants will be selected&#xD;
      for participation in Phase 2 of this study. There were approximately 4-6 months allotted for&#xD;
      recruitment and follow-up at each site for Phase 1, and 9-12 months allotted for recruitment&#xD;
      and follow-up at each site for Phase 2..&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTN-032, an observational study, using interviews and focus group discussions, is primarily&#xD;
      designed to identify factors that may have affected participant adherence to study product in&#xD;
      ASPIRE and HOPE, including male partner attitudes. MTN-032 will also elicit perceptions about&#xD;
      various participant engagement and adherence promotion interventions implemented in ASPIRE&#xD;
      and may also explore the potential use of incentives to promote adherence to VR use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTN-032 will use study product adherence results from ASPIRE and HOPE, qualitative in-depth&#xD;
      interviews (IDI) and focus group discussions (FGD) to explore study product adherence&#xD;
      behaviors and strategies used to overcome adherence challenges. An in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      the various socio-behavioral factors that contribute to product use adherence may assist in&#xD;
      the interpretation of past and ongoing study results and inform implementation of future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;

        A sample of 187 former ASPIRE participants was selected to take part in Phase 1 of the&#xD;
        study. A sample of up to 156 HOPE participants will be selected for participation in Phase&#xD;
        2. In addition, a sample of up to 120 male partners of HOPE participants who provided&#xD;
        consent to have their male partners contacted will be selected for participation in Phase&#xD;
        2. Participants will all be adult women and their adult male partners from seven sites in&#xD;
        three African countries: South Africa, Uganda and Malawi. It is anticipated that&#xD;
        participants and their male partners will be representative of the overall ASPIRE and HOPE&#xD;
        trials by enrolling participants from each of the participating ASPIRE and HOPE countries.&#xD;
