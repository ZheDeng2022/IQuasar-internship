  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the study is to evaluate the anti-tumour activity and the tolerance&#xD;
      profile of Pembrolizumab + RT in comparison to cetuximab + RT in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC and to explore potential correlations between treatment outcome and the immune&#xD;
      landscape.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A majority of HNSCC are locally advanced and commonly treated with concomitant&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT). However, a large proportion of patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      stage are not suitable for receiving cisplatinum-based chemotherapy (CT) concomitant with&#xD;
      radiotherapy (RT) either due to age, general and/or medical condition(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative standard treatment has been established, combining RT and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, both CT-RT and cetuximab-RT which are considered as standard approaches in locally&#xD;
      advanced non operated HNSCC are associated with poor outcome in patients with the most&#xD;
      advanced T stage (T4) and/or N stage (&gt;=N2) and/or HPV negative tumours. A new and promising&#xD;
      approach could target immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a high-affinity monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody which showed antitumor activity&#xD;
      in melanoma and NSCLC. In the KEYNOTE-012 (multi-center, nonrandomized Phase Ib HNSCC),&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab was well tolerated and safe with no serious drug related AEs reported. About&#xD;
      51% (26/51) of patients had decreased tumor burden which was seen both in HPV (-) and HPV(+)&#xD;
      HNSCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observation led to the hypothesis generated in the current study that Pembrolizumab is&#xD;
      potentially a very active drug in HNSCC and that the combination of Pembrolizumab with&#xD;
      radiotherapy will be well tolerated, given the very good toxicity profile of the drug and&#xD;
      will improve the outcome of patients with locally advanced HNSCC non suitable for CT-RT, as&#xD;
      compared to the treatment of reference combining cetuximab and RT.&#xD;
