    <textblock>
      The aims of the present study are to measure dynamic changes over time in the plasma level of&#xD;
      SDF-1α in patients with confirmed diagnoses of AMI, AF and CHF and in so doing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Monitor the plasma level of SDF-1α at the diagnosis, during and after the long term&#xD;
           treatment of AMI, AF and CHF. The SDF-1α level of patients is expected to decrease&#xD;
           during treatment of the aforementioned conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlate the plasma level of SDF-1α in relation to clinical, biochemical&#xD;
           characteristics of Acute Myocardial Infarction(AMI), Atrial Fibrillation(AF) and&#xD;
           Congestive Heart Failure (CHF). In so doing, the investigators expect that SDF-1α will&#xD;
           correlate with the severity of heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study the dynamic of SDF-1α pertaining to its property as prognostic indicator for the&#xD;
           long term follow up risk of readmission and mortality of patients diagnosed with AMI, AF&#xD;
           or CHF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study considers changes in SDF-1α levels in response to treatment of cardiac disease&#xD;
      (myocardial infarction, heart failure or atrial fibrillation). SDF-1α levels will be measured&#xD;
      at the acute stages of the disease, after stabilization and at longer term as detailed below.&#xD;
      Levels of SDF-1α will be correlated to the outcome of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLOOD SAMPLING AND MEASUREMENT OF SDF-1Α A blood sample of about 5 ml will be sampled by&#xD;
      peripheral venepuncture and anticoagulated with heparin. Blood samples will be spun for 15&#xD;
      minutes at 1000g within 30 minutes of collection. The resulting plasma will be stored at&#xD;
      -80°C until analysis. Levels of SDF-1α in the plasma will be determined using a commercially&#xD;
      available ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed at the Clinical Research Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital&#xD;
      Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS Patients are included from the in-patient department of the Department of&#xD;
      Cardiology, Hvidovre University Hospital. Patients are eligible for inclusion if diagnosed&#xD;
      with myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or heart failure, provided they do not suffer&#xD;
      from malignant disease, diabetes mellitus types I or II and have a life expectancy of at&#xD;
      least one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are based upon the fact that serum SDF-1α levels are elevated in malignant&#xD;
      diseases as SDF-1α contributes to neoangiogenesis of the tumour mass, and SDF-1α levels have&#xD;
      recently been demonstrated to be elevated in diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will include 20 patients with each of the cardiac conditions mentioned as&#xD;
      well as a control group of 20 subjects without cardiac disease (including hypertension),&#xD;
      diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS WITH MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (NSTEMI) are included. The diagnostic criteria are symptoms of cardiac ischaemia&#xD;
      (angina or angina-equivalent symptoms) and elevated troponin T (above 14 ng/mL) and/ or ECG&#xD;
      changes of ischemia (horizontal or downsloping ST depression ≥ 0.5 mm at the J-point in ≥ 2&#xD;
      contiguous leads).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are excluded if they are diagnosed with a &quot;type 2 myocardial infarction&quot;, i.e.&#xD;
      myocardial ischaemia due to mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and supply due to&#xD;
      conditions such as severe anaemia, arrhythmia or hypotension. Patients are also excluded if&#xD;
      they are not referred for coronary angiography, if they have atrial fibrillation or if they&#xD;
      have cardiac failure with LVEF ≤ 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SDF-1α levels of patients will be measured on the first day of hospitalization, after&#xD;
      coronary angiography, before discharge (approximately day 3-5), and three months after&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Patients presenting with ECG-documented atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      are included if unstable, i.e. if heart rate exceeds 100 and in-patient treatment is&#xD;
      indicated. Patients are excluded if they suffer from unstable ischaemic heart disease&#xD;
      (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), heart failure with LVEF ≤ 40% or if the&#xD;
      arrhythmia is secondary to another condition such as an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SDF-1α levels will be measured on the first day of the hospitalization, at the time of&#xD;
      discharge (after medical or electrical cardioversion or after stabilization of the heart&#xD;
      rate) and three months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE Patients are included if presenting with decompensated&#xD;
      heart failure. They must have symptoms of heart failure (dyspnoea and/ or oedema) severe&#xD;
      enough to warrant in-patient treatment. The diagnosis must be confirmed by echocardiography&#xD;
      showing LVEF ≤ 40%. Patients are excluded if suffering from unstable ischaemic heart disease&#xD;
      (unstable angina or myocardial infarction) or atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SDF-1α levels of will be measured on the first day of the hospitalization, after medical&#xD;
      stabilization at the time of discharge, and three months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT INCLUSION AND DATA COLLECTION Patient inclusion will take place during three&#xD;
      consecutive months. Patients are included within the first day of hospital admittance. Each&#xD;
      day, members of the project group will screen all patients admitted within the last day and&#xD;
      personally contact those eligible for inclusion. Patients will be informed verbally and given&#xD;
      the written participant information. Patients will be given time for consideration and if&#xD;
      they accept participation, they will be asked to sign the consent form. Due to the project&#xD;
      design, according to which the first blood samples are to be taken within the first day of&#xD;
      hospitalization, patients are asked to consent to project participation on the day of initial&#xD;
      contact with the research group member. Conversations will be held in a private setting in&#xD;
      the department, and patients are invited to bring relations, if they so prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards the control group, these will be included from patients initially referred for&#xD;
      outpatient evaluation at the Department of Cardiology, but in whom no cardiac disease is&#xD;
      found. Members of the project group will screen the patients in the Outpatients Department&#xD;
      and personally contact those eligible for inclusion in the control group. The control group&#xD;
      will be selected so as to be age-matched with the patients. Information about the project&#xD;
      will be provided as for the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon information in the patients' medical files, it will be registered whether patients&#xD;
      suffer from hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, transient cerebral ischaemia,&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or renal insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication at time of admittance to hospital and medication given during the hospitalization&#xD;
      will be registered. Clinical status (dyspnoea, palpitations, oedema, blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate) at the time of inclusion and at the time discharge from hospital will be noted. This&#xD;
      information will be sought from patient files and the Kiso system used for recording vital&#xD;
      parameters in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recorded information (pre-existing conditions, medication and clinical status at the two&#xD;
      time-points) will be available for the project group. This information will be used for&#xD;
      background demographics, in the evaluation of how levels of SDF-1α correlate to clinical&#xD;
      status, and to allow for correction of factors, such as medication, on the levels of SDF-1α.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP All patients are expected to be seen in the Outpatients' Department 2-3 months&#xD;
      after discharge from hospital. This appointment is part of the standard treatment and control&#xD;
      plan for patients with AF, CHF and NSTEMI, respectively and not arranged as a part of the&#xD;
      project. Certain information will be registered from the patient files at the time of&#xD;
      follow-up: Clinical status (NYHA class, oedema, pulmonary congestion, and angina), heart&#xD;
      rhythm, medication, and any intercurrent hospital admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One year after inclusion, patient files will be reviewed and the following information&#xD;
      registered: Whether the patient is alive and any cardiovascular rehospitalisation. In the&#xD;
      case of hospitalization, the date of admission, duration and diagnosis will be registered.&#xD;
      Statistical considerations and data analysis Baseline data of SDF-1α levels and patient&#xD;
      demographics (including comorbidities and use of medication) will be evaluated using&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. Normally distributed data will be presented as mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation, whereas skewed data will be presented as median and range. If necessary, skewed&#xD;
      data will be transformed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The influence of patient characteristics (such as age, sex and comorbidities) on SDF-1α&#xD;
      levels will be evaluated using multiple regression analysis with SDF-1α level as dependent&#xD;
      variable and patient characteristics as explanatory variables. SDF-1α levels will be compared&#xD;
      between the patient groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each group of patients, the changes in SDF-1α levels over time (three time points)&#xD;
      will be analysed using ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously measured SDF-1α levels in patients with various types of AF&#xD;
      (permanent versus paroxysmal). Based upon these results (SDF-1α levels and standard&#xD;
      deviations in the different groups), the investigators have estimated that the proposed&#xD;
      sample size of 20 patients in each disease group will confer the study sufficient statistical&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses will be performed in collaboration with statistician Steen Ladelund&#xD;
      (Clinical Research Centre, Hvidovre University Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>This study aims to evaluate the dynamic changes in SDF-1α levels during and after treatment of three major heart diseases. Results will aid in the understanding of the role of SDF-1α in cardiac disease. If disease progression and treatment effect is reflected in the levels of SDF-1α, measurement of this biomarker will be a valuable tool for monitoring disease course and treatment effect and, in so doing, help in risk evaluation and individualized treatment of patients suffering from cardiac disease.</description>
