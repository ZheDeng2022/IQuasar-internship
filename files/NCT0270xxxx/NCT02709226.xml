      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A glioblastoma is a tumor in the brain. It is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy. However, most people s tumors come back after therapy. When the tumor&#xD;
      grows back, surgery or chemotherapy may not be possible or may no longer work. Repeat&#xD;
      radiation therapy or re-irradiation, is an option for treating these tumors when they regrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out the safety and highest tolerated dose of re-irradiation for people who have&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 50 who have glioblastoma that has been treated with radiation but has regrown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI of the brain: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have baseline tests before they start therapy. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological tests: These test things like memory, attention, and thinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye and hearing tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a CT of the brain prior to radiation start in order to plan the&#xD;
      radiation treatment. Once the plan is completed, they will receive radiation once a day&#xD;
      Monday Friday for a total of 10 17 treatments. They will lie on their back for about 10&#xD;
      minutes while they get the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they finish treatment, participants will have visits 1, 2, and 3 months later. Then&#xD;
      they will have them every 2 months for 3 years. These will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological tests (at some visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 years, participants will be contacted by phone each month.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the survival of gliomas has improved, most high grade gliomas will recur in&#xD;
           field or adjacent to the treatment field within months to years of the original&#xD;
           treatment. In newly diagnosed GBM, the concurrent use of radiation and temozolomide is&#xD;
           standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical resection upon recurrence is possible in less than 50% of patients. For a&#xD;
           significant proportion of recurrent glioma patients in whom reresection is not&#xD;
           favourable and for whom systemic options have been exhausted, re-irradiation has emerged&#xD;
           as a possible treatment option.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using modern precision RT techniques (stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), stereotactic&#xD;
           radiotherapy (SRT) or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), Rapid Arc&#xD;
           techniques), re-irradiation has proven a feasible option with possible benefit in&#xD;
           outcome as these techniques are often able to minimize dose to previously treated organs&#xD;
           at risk in the field (OAR) and treat the recurrence safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from multiple retrospective studies has indicated that not only is re-irradiation&#xD;
           feasible, but it may actually improve survival in the appropriately selected patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this phase I study is to determine maximum tolerated re-irradiation&#xD;
      dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recurrent glioblastoma or gliosarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior standard radiation therapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2 Gy per&#xD;
           fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior irradiation &gt; 12 months from enrollment on protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KPS greater than or equal to 70&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy will be administered daily Monday-Friday at Radiation Oncology Branch&#xD;
           (ROB), NCI. All the protocol related follow-up appointments will occur at NCI ROB.&#xD;
           Radiation therapy dose will be administered on consecutive treatment days, 5 fractions&#xD;
           per week via a linear accelerator using 6 MV photons or greater. Using a 3 plus 3 design&#xD;
           , and three dose escalation levels, with 6 patients per dose level with 9 total patients&#xD;
           at the MTD (provided no DLT), a maximum of 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to progression will be determined by the interval from initiation of treatment on&#xD;
           protocol to progression as per RANO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurologic decline without radiographic evidence of tumor will be designated as&#xD;
           treatment related toxicity. Survival duration will be determined by the interval from&#xD;
           initiation of treatment on protocol to date of death.&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation is as follows: dose level 1 (DL1) 3.5 Gy x 10; dose level 2 (DL2) 3.5 Gy x 12; dose level 3 (DL3) 3.5 Gy x 14. If 2 DLTs are observed in the second dose level a step down dose of 3.0 Gy x 14 fractions will be tested. If 2 DLTs are observed in the third dose level a step down dose of 3.0 Gy x 17 fractions will be tested. The study will have 3 planned re-irradiation dose levels, with 1 to 6 patients per dose level using the 3+3 design to define the MTD. The number of patients may be increased to 9 total patients at the MTD ( provided no DLT) with a maximum of 21 evaluable patients enrolled.</description>

                  (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry&#xD;
                  and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
                  suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study,&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Patients with preexisting known or suspected radiation sensitivity syndromes will be&#xD;
             excluded due to potential confounding effect on outcome.&#xD;
