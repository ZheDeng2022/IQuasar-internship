    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory open-label clinical trial of Rosuvastatin in patients with&#xD;
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). This is an outpatient trial with the goal of enrolling 10 evaluable&#xD;
      adults with genetically confirmed FRDA who are between the ages of 18-65. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 10mg of oral Rosuvastatin daily for three months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of children and adults&#xD;
      for which there is presently no therapy. Much of the current work in FRDA is aimed at finding&#xD;
      new targets for drug therapies. Recent work at the University of Pennsylvania has discovered&#xD;
      that serum ApoA-1 protein levels are lower in people with FRDA when compared with control&#xD;
      levels. ApoA-1 is the main protein found in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and&#xD;
      individuals with FRDA frequently have low HDL levels; the current study proposes to assess if&#xD;
      administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for 3 months alters ApoA-1 protein levels in&#xD;
      FRDA. Although the significance of ApoA-1 levels among FRDA patients is currently unknown,&#xD;
      this study is proposed as an exploratory study to further examine this protein. If ApoA-1&#xD;
      protein levels increase over the course of treatment, future studies may additionally focus&#xD;
      on examining this as a potential therapeutic treatment.&#xD;
