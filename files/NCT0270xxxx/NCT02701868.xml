  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although breast milk is recommended exclusively until 6 months of age, two-thirds of infants&#xD;
      in the U.S. are fed infant formula. Despite an almost identical energy density between infant&#xD;
      formula and breast milk, formula fed infants experience greater weight gain in the first year&#xD;
      of life. The investigators propose that unintentional overfeeding, of nearly one additional&#xD;
      day of calories per week, due to the &quot;over-scooping&quot; of powdered formula contributes&#xD;
      significantly to this phenomenon and potentially to the early development of childhood&#xD;
      obesity, a significant public health problem.&#xD;

      In the proposed study the investigators will assess the literacy and understanding of&#xD;
      individuals to follow commercially available infant formula instructions. The investigators&#xD;
      will collaborate with the LA CaTS Health Literacy Core to improve the reading and&#xD;
      comprehension of the manufacturer package instruction, and will solicit the input of&#xD;
      caregivers and key stakeholders to inform the development of educational intervention around&#xD;
      infant feeding. Following modification of infant formula preparation instructions, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will test the efficacy of the&#xD;
      modified instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the manufacturer package&#xD;
      instructions. One hundred and fifty participants will be asked to complete one study visit&#xD;
      during which they will be asked to measure various serving sizes of infant formula following&#xD;
      either the manufacturer package instructions or the modified instructions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Focus groups were used to evaluate and provide recommendations to improve the reading and comprehension of powdered infant formula package preparation instructions. Five focus groups provided primary recommendations. The percentage of focus group participants reporting specific recommendations are summarized.</description>

    <measure>Percent Error of Dispensed Formula Weight as Compared to Expected Formula Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Percent Error of the formula weight prepared by Phase 2 study participants as compared to the expected formula weight from the manufacturer's label. Phase 2 participants were either randomly assigned the standard instructions or the instructions that were modified as a result of the Phase 1 focus groups.&#xD;
Percent error was calculated as the measured formula weight prepared by Phase 2 study participants subtracted from the expected formula weight found on the manufacturer's label with that result being divided by the expected formula weight found on the manufacturer's label. The final result is multiplied by 100 to provide the percent error. Percent error is presented as opposed to formula weight because each participant prepared two 2, 4, 6, and 8 oz bottles. Percent error analysis includes all bottles prepared regardless of size.</description>

        Up to 40 individuals will be recruited to participate in focus groups at Pennington&#xD;
        Biomedical Research Center. Phase 1 will utilize qualitative data gathered from focus&#xD;
        groups to direct the modification of infant formula manufacturer preparation instructions&#xD;
        to enhance user understanding and accuracy. The modified instructions will be used in Phase&#xD;
        2.&#xD;

        <title>Percent Error of Dispensed Formula Weight as Compared to Expected Formula Weight</title>
        <description>Percent Error of the formula weight prepared by Phase 2 study participants as compared to the expected formula weight from the manufacturer's label. Phase 2 participants were either randomly assigned the standard instructions or the instructions that were modified as a result of the Phase 1 focus groups.&#xD;
Percent error was calculated as the measured formula weight prepared by Phase 2 study participants subtracted from the expected formula weight found on the manufacturer's label with that result being divided by the expected formula weight found on the manufacturer's label. The final result is multiplied by 100 to provide the percent error. Percent error is presented as opposed to formula weight because each participant prepared two 2, 4, 6, and 8 oz bottles. Percent error analysis includes all bottles prepared regardless of size.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study involved two phases: Phase 1 was participatory research where participants were involved in focus groups and Phase 2 was a double-blind randomized controlled trial where participants were randomly assigned to prepare infant formula bottles using the standard manufacturer's instructions or the instructions that were modified as a result of Phase 1 focus groups. Due to the design, primary outcomes were different for Phase 1 and Phase 2. Both primary outcomes are included in the results.</limitations_and_caveats>
