  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal is to develop new clinical approaches to restore upper-limb function after&#xD;
      incomplete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Corticospinal tract (CST) axons are involved in&#xD;
      controlling upper-limb function. Paired pulse induced spike-timing dependent plasticity&#xD;
      (STDP) enhances synaptic strength between residual CST axons and spinal motoneurons (SMNs)&#xD;
      resulting in temporary improvements in upper-limb function in humans with incomplete cervical&#xD;
      SCI. Motor training will be combined with paired-pulse STDP stimulation to further enhance&#xD;
      plasticity and behavioral recovery.&#xD;

        <title>Amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) From TMS</title>
        <description>We measure amplitude of a motor evoked potential evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention.&#xD;
For STDP + Training and Sham STDP + Training we measured the MEPs at baseline and post all training sessions.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured before and after the STDP during the 2-hour session for Arm 1 and measured at baseline and post all training sessions during the 2-hour session for Arm 2 and 3.</time_frame>
        <population>The number differs due to different study visits in each Arm. We collected a 6 month follow up for the STDP + Training and Sham STDP + Training Arm, only 5 participants in each study group could complete the follow-up testing.</population>

            <description>Paired stimulation (STDP) will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
STDP: Paired stimulation will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
Participants will complete study visits each lasting ~2. Changes in TMS measurements in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be measured before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention. The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be measured using surface EMG before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention.</description>

            <description>Paired stimulation (STDP) will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time. Motor training will follow paired stimulation.&#xD;
STDP: Paired stimulation will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
Training: The participant will be asked to perform exercises using their hands and arms.&#xD;
Participants will complete 10 STDP + Training study visits each lasting ~2. Baseline and post measurements will be collected.&#xD;
The following measurements were collected:&#xD;
Changes in TMS measurements in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Changes in the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be measured using surface EMG.&#xD;
Functional measurement, GRASSP, will measure changes in the time it takes to complete hand tasks.</description>

        <title>Maximum Voluntary Contraction</title>
        <description>We measure maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of muscles recorded by electromyography (EMG) before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention.&#xD;
For STDP + Training and Sham STDP + Training we measured MVC at baseline and post all training sessions.</description>
        <time_frame>Measured before and after the STDP during the 2-hour session for Arm 1 and measured at baseline and post all training sessions during the 2-hour session for Arm 2 and 3.</time_frame>
        <population>The number differs due to different study visits in each Arm. We collected a 6 month follow up for the STDP + Training and Sham STDP + Training Arm, only 5 participants in each study group could complete the follow-up testing.</population>

      <time_frame>The adverse event data is collected from baseline to completion of study visits, an average of 35 weeks. The longer experiment arm involves 100 sessions = 20 weeks at 5 sessions per week, and the final follow-up is at 3 months after the final session = 12-15 weeks later. This gives a total of 32-35 weeks.</time_frame>
      <desc>Arm 1 includes all participants who were monitored for adverse events even if they did not complete the study visit.</desc>

          <title>STDP</title>
          <description>Paired stimulation (STDP) will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
STDP: Paired stimulation will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
Participants will complete study visits each lasting ~2. Changes in TMS measurements in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be measured before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention. The maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be measured using surface EMG before and after the 30 minute STDP intervention.</description>

          <title>STDP + Training</title>
          <description>Paired stimulation (STDP) will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time. Motor training will follow paired stimulation.&#xD;
STDP: Paired stimulation will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined time.&#xD;
Training: The participant will be asked to perform exercises using their hands and arms.&#xD;
Participants will complete 10 STDP + Training study visits each lasting ~2. Baseline and post measurements will be collected.&#xD;
The following measurements were collected:&#xD;
Changes in TMS measurements in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Changes in the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be measured using surface EMG.&#xD;
Functional measurement, GRASSP, will measure changes in the time it takes to complete hand tasks.</description>

          <title>Sham STDP + Training</title>
          <description>Sham or fake paired stimulation (Sham STDP) will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined times. Motor training will follow stimulation.&#xD;
Training: The participant will be asked to perform exercises using their hands and arms.&#xD;
Sham STDP: Sham or fake paired stimulation will be given to the brain and to a peripheral nerve so that the messages are received at the spinal cord at predetermined times.&#xD;
Participants will complete 10 Sham STDP + Training study visits each lasting ~2.&#xD;
Baseline and post measurements will be collected.&#xD;
The following measurements were collected:&#xD;
Changes in TMS measurements in the form of motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Changes in the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) will be measured using surface EMG.&#xD;
Functional measurement, GRASSP, will measure changes in the time it takes to complete hand tasks.</description>
