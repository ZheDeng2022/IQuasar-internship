  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pacing from a physiologic His&#xD;
      bundle (HB) lead position versus with the standard coronary sinus (CS) lead position in&#xD;
      subjects with heart failure undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). While&#xD;
      placement of left ventricular leads via the coronary sinus has anatomic limitations, we&#xD;
      hypothesis that the achievement of QRS narrowing with His bundle capture will be superior for&#xD;
      improving systolic function by echocardiographic indices (ejection fraction and strain) and&#xD;
      quality of life and decreased rehospitalization and mortality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blinded study of 40 patients to a strategy of HB pacing versus&#xD;
      CS pacing, and remain blinded to their treatment allocation. Both treatment options use&#xD;
      standard-of-care, FDA-approved devices. The distinction is only in the allocation toward HB&#xD;
      pacing and CS pacing. Treating physicians will be aware of assignment in order to facilitate&#xD;
      routine device follow-up. Echocardiographic and electrocardiographic evaluation will also be&#xD;
      performed in a blinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over is permitted between treatment group allocation if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CS lead cannot be placed due to difficult cannulation of the CS, limited branches at the&#xD;
           posterolateral or lateral wall, or phrenic nerve capture. These subjects may then&#xD;
           cross-over to HB pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HB pacing subjects may cross-over if HB lead cannot be positioned with adequate&#xD;
           stability and reasonable pacing output, or if QRS width does not narrow by at least 20%&#xD;
           or to a QRS width of ≤ 130 msec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant procedure will be per routine percutaneous access, as is standard for pacemaker and&#xD;
      ICDs. All subjects will receive an FDA-approved cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker&#xD;
      or defibrillator device, as per standard of care outlined for the subject. In order to&#xD;
      facilitate optimal lead placement, arterial access for levo-phase CS angiography and/or LV&#xD;
      septal mapping to characterize site of bundle-branch block may also be performed, at the&#xD;
      discretion of the implanting physician per his/her standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be performed at 2 weeks post-implant for incision check and device&#xD;
      interrogation as is standard of care. In addition, routine device and clinical follow-up will&#xD;
      be scheduled at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Electrocardiography (ECG) will be performed&#xD;
      pre-implant, prior to hospital discharge, at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.&#xD;
      Echocardiography will be performed pre-implant and 6 months to evaluate for change in LVEF,&#xD;
      chamber dimension, and wall motion with strain imaging as is standard of care in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. NYHA functional class and quality of life&#xD;
      (utilizing the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) will be assessed pre-implant and at&#xD;
      6 months.&#xD;

    <description>New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class change for baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. NYHA class determines the functional status of the patient. There are classes I-IV. Class I is no symptoms or limitation of physical activity, II is slight limitation of physical activity but comfortable at rest, III marked limitation of physical activity, and IV is unable to carry any physical activity without discomfort, heart failure symptoms at rest, and discomfort increases with any physical activity as described the American Heart Association (AHA).</description>

KCCQ measures physical function, symptoms (specifically frequency, severity, and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life. Subscales and Total Score range from minimum of 0-100 (maximum); higher scores show better health status.

    <intervention_name>CRT Pacemaker</intervention_name>
    <description>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is the use of a pacemaker with two endocardial leads placed in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV). The third lead is traditionally placed in a tributary of the coronary sinus (CS) overlying the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV). Alternatively, the third lead may be positioned based on mapping of the common His bundle and actively fixed to achieve QRS normalization via direct His bundle capture.</description>

          <title>His Bundle Pacing</title>
          <description>Subjects will be randomized to the HB lead position with their cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker. HB lead pacing will be performed with the Medtronic SelectSecure™, Model 3830 lead. Delivery of the lead utilizes a deflectable sheath, the Medtronic SelectSite™, Model C304. Both devices are FDA approved for the purpose of HB pacing. It is the only device available which is presently FDA approved for selective HB pacing.&#xD;
CRT Pacemaker: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is the use of a pacemaker with two endocardial leads placed in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV). The third lead is traditionally placed in a tributary of the coronary sinus (CS) overlying the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV). Alternatively, the third lead may be positioned based on mapping of the common His bundle and actively fixed to achieve QRS normalization via direct His bundle capture.</description>

          <title>Coronary Sinus Pacing</title>
          <description>Subjects will be randomized to the CS lead position with their cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker. CS lead and CRT device generator selected for implant will be left to the discretion of the operator. Only FDA approved CS leads and CRT generators will be utilized in the study. There are five present manufacturers of CS leads and CRT generators: Biotronik, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Sorin, and St. Jude Medical.&#xD;

        <description>New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class change for baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. NYHA class determines the functional status of the patient. There are classes I-IV. Class I is no symptoms or limitation of physical activity, II is slight limitation of physical activity but comfortable at rest, III marked limitation of physical activity, and IV is unable to carry any physical activity without discomfort, heart failure symptoms at rest, and discomfort increases with any physical activity as described the American Heart Association (AHA).</description>

CRT Pacemaker: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is the use of a pacemaker with two endocardial leads placed in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV). The third lead is traditionally placed in a tributary of the coronary sinus (CS) overlying the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV). Alternatively, the third lead may be positioned based on mapping of the common His bundle and actively fixed to achieve QRS normalization via direct His bundle capture.</description>

CRT Pacemaker: Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) is the use of a pacemaker with two endocardial leads placed in the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV). The third lead is traditionally placed in a tributary of the coronary sinus (CS) overlying the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV). Alternatively, the third lead may be positioned based on mapping of the common His bundle and actively fixed to achieve QRS normalization via direct His bundle capture.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This pilot study was underpowered to detect differences less than 10% between groups.The criteria for LBBB definitions impact the outcomes of CRT studies. More precise electrophysiologic definitions are necessary to refine patient selection for His bundle pacing. Longer helices, deflectable sheaths with septal orientation and variable curves may further improve His correction rates and stability of thresholds.</limitations_and_caveats>
