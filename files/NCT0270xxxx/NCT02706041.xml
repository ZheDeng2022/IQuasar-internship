    <textblock>
      Randomized study to compare outcomes of patients undergoing damage control laparotomies&#xD;
      versus definitive closure for which there is surgeon equipoise to randomize.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single center, prospective, randomized study involving seriously injure patients requiring an&#xD;
      emergent laparotomy within 90 minutes of arrival to the emergency department. There are&#xD;
      situations in which the patient is unable to be closed at the end of the emergent laparotomy&#xD;
      (identified as damage control) and there are situations in which the injury has been treated&#xD;
      and the incision can be closed (definitive). There are also situations where it is not clear&#xD;
      if the patient should be kept open or closed and the result of the surgery varies based on&#xD;
      the surgeon performing the case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible subjects for this study will be randomized toward the end of the emergent&#xD;
      laparotomy procedure on a 1:1 basis and will be followed throughout the hospitalization for&#xD;
      complications. Patients will also be contacted at 6 month to complete a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient-centered Outcomes Assessed Using the Standard Gamble</measure>
    <time_frame>at discharge from hospital (about 20 days after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are asked to choose between two hypothetical outcomes: 1 - the sure outcome, that is, remaining in a state of ill health for a period of time; or 2 - the gamble, that is, choosing a medical intervention which has a certain probability of either restoring them to perfect health or killing them. The Standard Gamble identifies the probability (of the intervention delivering perfect health) at which the two alternatives (1 and 2) seem equally attractive. Scores range from 0% to 100%, with a score of 100% indicating that a choices 1 and 2 are equally attractive only when there is a 100% probability that the intervention will deliver perfect health, and a score of 0% indicating that choices 1 and and 2 are equally attractive even when there is a 0% probability that the intervention will deliver perfect health.</description>

        <title>Patient-centered Outcomes Assessed Using the Standard Gamble</title>
        <description>Participants are asked to choose between two hypothetical outcomes: 1 - the sure outcome, that is, remaining in a state of ill health for a period of time; or 2 - the gamble, that is, choosing a medical intervention which has a certain probability of either restoring them to perfect health or killing them. The Standard Gamble identifies the probability (of the intervention delivering perfect health) at which the two alternatives (1 and 2) seem equally attractive. Scores range from 0% to 100%, with a score of 100% indicating that a choices 1 and 2 are equally attractive only when there is a 100% probability that the intervention will deliver perfect health, and a score of 0% indicating that choices 1 and and 2 are equally attractive even when there is a 0% probability that the intervention will deliver perfect health.</description>
