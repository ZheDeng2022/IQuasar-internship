      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of lifestyle intervention (diet and physical&#xD;
      activity) by applying modern approaches to lifestyle changes on the prevention of incident&#xD;
      T2DM and the worsening of hyperglycemia in people with high number of T2DM risk alleles and&#xD;
      in people with low number of T2DM risk alleles compared to corresponding control groups.&#xD;

      AIM: The aim of the study is to compare the effect of lifestyle intervention (diet and&#xD;
      physical activity) by applying modern approaches to lifestyle changes on the prevention of&#xD;
      incident type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and the worsening of hyperglycemia in people with high number&#xD;
      of T2DM risk alleles and in people with low number of T2DM risk alleles compared to&#xD;
      corresponding control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY GROUPS. A total of 600 participants will be selected from the METabolic Syndrome In Men&#xD;
      (METSIM) study. They are divided into two groups: a) high genetic risk for T2DM on the basis&#xD;
      of the genetic risk score (N=300), and b) low genetic risk score for T2DM on the basis of the&#xD;
      genetic risk score (N=300). For both of these groups a corresponding control group (N=300)&#xD;
      will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL. 1) The first visit at entry (visit 1) for both intervention and control groups: an&#xD;
      interview about physical activity at work and leisure time, smoking, alcohol use, education,&#xD;
      occupation, diet, history of medication; clinical measurements: blood pressure, body weight,&#xD;
      height, bioimpedance; laboratory measurements including an oral glucose tolerance test,&#xD;
      fasting measurements (HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, ALT,&#xD;
      GAD antibodies); 2) Group sessions (about 15 participants in each) 1-7 described below for&#xD;
      the intervention group but not for the control group, 3) A 6 month and 24 month visits&#xD;
      (identical to visit 1) for the intervention group but not for the control group; 4) A 3-year&#xD;
      visit for both intervention and control groups (identical to visit 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed protocol for the intervention group: Dietary guidance in the intervention group is&#xD;
      based on the Nordic and Finnish nutrition recommendations and they emphasize appropriate&#xD;
      energy intake, meal frequency, consumption of fruits vegetables and berriers, quality of&#xD;
      dieatry fat and cardohydrates, including sugar and fiber intake. During the intervention the&#xD;
      goals for nutrient and food intake (healthy diet) are: Vegetables, fruits and berries &gt;= 500&#xD;
      g/day, carbohydrates 45-60 E%, sucrose &lt; 10 E%, fiber &gt;=35 g/day, fat 25-40 E%, saturated fat&#xD;
      &lt; 10 E%, unsaturated fat &gt;= 2/3 of total fat E%, monosaturated fat 10-20 E%, polysaturated&#xD;
      fat 5-10 E%, n-3 fatty acids &gt;= 1E%. The goal for physical activity is brisk walking a&#xD;
      minimum of 30 min/day at least five days a week. Walking could be replaced by other types of&#xD;
      exercise (e.g. cycling, crioss-country skiing, resistance training, and housework such as&#xD;
      leaft raking);&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first year of the intervention will be the most active and includes 4-6 group sessions&#xD;
      depending on participants' needs. Group sessions for the intervention group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session1 (month 1): Motivation and a 4-day food record and personal feedback from food&#xD;
      records to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sessions 2 and 3 (month 1-2): Healthy dietary pattern and physical activity (see above)&#xD;
      Sessions 4 and 5 (month 2-3): Dietary advice for weight loss for the participants with BMI &gt;&#xD;
      28 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 months visit: 4-day food record and personal feedback from food records to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 6: month 12: 4-day food record and personal feedback from food records to&#xD;
      participants. Advice for healthy diet and physical activity. Adidtionally a measurement of&#xD;
      HbA1c; Session 7 (month 24): 4-day food record and personal feedback from food records to&#xD;
      participants. Advice for healthy dietary pattern and physical activity and performance of an&#xD;
      oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final visit at 36 months: An oral glucose toletance test, HbA1c, and food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire for both intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoughout the study the subjects in the intervention groups will be regularly contacted by&#xD;
      the researchers via the website in order to ensure that the subjects stay active regarding&#xD;
      the intervention. The web portal also enables the distribution of material and makes virtual&#xD;
      discussion possible between the participants and clinical nutritionists. Printed material and&#xD;
      discussions by phone will be provided to the participants who do not have access to the&#xD;
      internet. In order to help the participants recognize their needs for changes in the diet,&#xD;
      available tests (e.g. fiber test, sugar test, fat quality test) provided by the Finnish Heart&#xD;
      Association and the Finnish Diabetes Association will be used.&#xD;
