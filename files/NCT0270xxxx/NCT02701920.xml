      This study will compare a newborn heart rate sensor (HeartLight) that is integrated into a&#xD;
      hat with other common forms of heart rate monitoring such as electrocardiography (ECG),&#xD;
      stethoscope and pulse oximetry (PO) in newborn babies. This will help to evaluate the new&#xD;
      heart rate sensor's reliability and accuracy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 10% of newborns require some form of resuscitation at birth. Heart rate (HR) is the&#xD;
      most sensitive indicator of resuscitation efficacy. HR is most commonly estimated using a&#xD;
      stethoscope. However, in simulation studies it has been shown that newborn healthcare&#xD;
      providers estimate HR incorrectly in up to 1/3 of cases. Common techniques for monitoring&#xD;
      heart rate such as electrocardiography (ECG) and pulse oximetry (PO) were not developed for&#xD;
      resuscitation at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG, an established and accurate method of monitoring HR, is rarely used in the delivery room&#xD;
      for a number of reasons including difficulty ensuring adhesion to the skin (the baby is&#xD;
      wet/covered in vernix) and skin damage in premature babies caused by stripping of the&#xD;
      electrodes. Current ECG systems also require 3 electrodes to be positioned which can delay&#xD;
      resuscitation further. The usual site for transmission PO is the foot or hand. However, in&#xD;
      newborn babies, and particularly those requiring resuscitation when the HR is low, blood flow&#xD;
      is reduced so physiological mechanisms preserve brain and heart blood flow at the expense of&#xD;
      other less important organs and limbs. As a consequence of this and the choice of&#xD;
      wavelengths, it can be more difficult to obtain a reliable HR from POs on the limbs, and they&#xD;
      typically obtain an HR after 1-2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the delivery room, ECG and PO systems have a requirement for cables to connect to the main&#xD;
      monitors. These can get in the way and it is now recommended for many babies to delay cutting&#xD;
      the umbilical cord (to ensure more blood enters the baby from the placenta) which often&#xD;
      requires the baby to be resuscitated very close to the mother and even between their legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HeartLight system is a wireless optical sensor within a custom newborn hat to allow quick&#xD;
      and accurate HR monitoring. It will be compared to ECG, PO and electronic stethoscope to&#xD;
      determine the accuracy and reliability. The trial has 4 phases; Phase 1 evaluates the thermal&#xD;
      properties of the hat, Phase 2 evaluates the accuracy and reliability of the HeartLight&#xD;
      sensor on babies within the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit environment, Phase 3 evaluates the&#xD;
      HeartLight sensor in newborn babies born by cesarean section and Phase 4 evaluates the&#xD;
      performance of the HeartLight sensor in babies of all gestations requiring resuscitation and&#xD;
      stabilisation at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate the HeartLight sensor and hat will allow swift and effective&#xD;
      deployment, reduce delays in resuscitation (due to using a stethoscope) and improve HR&#xD;
      accuracy (as a result of avoiding errors in the usual manual mental calculations made in the&#xD;
      stressful environment of the delivery room) when it is needed most. However, an additional&#xD;
      benefit is that it will not require significant modification to the existing care pathway or&#xD;
      resuscitation protocols, and therefore a potential barrier to clinical uptake is removed.&#xD;
