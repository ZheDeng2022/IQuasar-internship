      The CO2RE laser system is a fractional CO2 laser that is FDA approved under a 510(k) K101321&#xD;
      for dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and coagulation of soft tissues, including the&#xD;
      skin Eligible subjects will undergo 3 treatments in 4±1 weeks interval on the Vagina&#xD;
      (External/Vulva and Internal/Vagina) with the CO2RE device according to study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will return for to 5 follow-up (FU) visits: 1 week ± 2 days post first treatment&#xD;
      visit and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after last (third) treatment (± 2 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at&#xD;
      each visit at the clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Prospective clinical study to demonstrate the CO2RE laser device for safety&#xD;
      and efficacy for Vaginal Atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, seeking vaginal treatment from the participating&#xD;
      investigator will be enrolled at a participating study site. Subjects will receive three (3)&#xD;
      CO2RE treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be followed for additional 5 post treatment visits (FU visits) that will be&#xD;
      conducted at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week post first treatment - 1wk FU ± 2 days (Safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month post last treatment - 1m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 months post last treatment - 3m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 months post last treatment - 6m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  12 months post last treatment - 12m FU ± 2 weeks (efficacy &amp; Safety).&#xD;
