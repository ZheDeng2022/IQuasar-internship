  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB or sleep apnea) is very common among elderly Veterans and&#xD;
      leads to increased morbidity and mortality in this population. The proposal aims to identity&#xD;
      whether oxygen, finasteride and acetazolamide can be effective in reducing unstable breathing&#xD;
      and eliminating sleep apnea in the elderly via different mechanisms. This proposal will&#xD;
      enhance the investigators' understanding of the pathways that contribute to the development&#xD;
      of sleep apnea in the elderly. The investigators expect that the results obtained from this&#xD;
      study will positively impact the health of Veterans by identifying new treatment modalities&#xD;
      for sleep apnea. A cumulative effect of the investigators' research will fulfill the&#xD;
      long-term goal of improving the quality of life of elderly Veterans suffering from sleep&#xD;
      apnea and its potential life-threatening complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) has a high prevalence and is associated with adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular consequences in elderly Veterans. Positive airway pressure therapy is deemed&#xD;
      cumbersome and often associated with non-adherence to therapy. This proposal will investigate&#xD;
      whether alternative therapies can be developed by modulating specific physiologic mechanisms&#xD;
      of ventilatory control. Specifically, the investigators will study whether interventions with&#xD;
      sustained hyperoxia (Aim 1), finasteride (Aim 2) and acetazolamide (Aim 3) will reduce&#xD;
      breathing instability during sleep by reducing chemoresponsiveness and/or increasing&#xD;
      cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in order to alleviate sleep disordered breathing in the&#xD;
      elderly with sleep apnea. The proposed aims will also allow us to delineate key mechanisms of&#xD;
      breathing instability in the elderly. The investigators envision that the results obtained&#xD;
      from this project will ultimately allow us to develop novel alternative therapies for sleep&#xD;
      apnea in the elderly. We will also compare CVR in young vs older adults&#xD;
