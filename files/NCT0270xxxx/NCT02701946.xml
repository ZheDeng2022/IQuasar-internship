    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most successful procedures in orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgery. Nevertheless, significant postoperative blood loss and requirement of blood&#xD;
      transfusion are still problematic. Total blood loss in TKA can be divided into visible and&#xD;
      invisible blood loss. Visible blood loss (VBL) means blood loss from the surgical field and&#xD;
      wound drainage while invisible blood loss (IBL) means residual blood in the knee,&#xD;
      extravasation into the tissues and loss due to haemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In usual practice, TKA is performed with a bloodless field using a tourniquet. Thus&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss can be negligible and postoperative drainage is only considered as&#xD;
      VBLvisible. In terms of IBL, Sehat et al. found that TKA carried a substantial IBL. Their&#xD;
      results shown the mean IBL was 765 ml or 49% of the mean total blood loss after TKA.&#xD;
      Therefore, the true total blood loss was underestimated if not takes IBL into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified Robert Jones bandage (MRJB) is a bulky compressive dressing that often used in&#xD;
      orthopaedic practice. Various techniques of application have been proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the previous study, MRJB could make and maintain the anterolateral muscle compartment&#xD;
      pressure for at least 24 hours after TKA. Therefore, theoretically, this bandage can cause&#xD;
      the tamponade effect that helps to reduce tissue edema and postoperative bleeding especially&#xD;
      IBL after TKA. However this potential benefit of MRJB is unclear and the use of this bandage&#xD;
      after TKA is still controversy in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In preoperative period, all eligible participants are admitted to the hospital for undergoing&#xD;
      TKA. The detailed protocol, including how to rate visual analog pain score, times to take the&#xD;
      blood for checking hematocrit levels, criteria for blood transfusion, time to measure the&#xD;
      knee and thigh circumferences and plan of ambulation program, is informed again. The routine&#xD;
      preoperative preparation is done. The participant is asked for answering preoperative Oxford&#xD;
      Knee Score questionnaire. Participants' baseline characteristics are also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During intraoperative period, all participants receive the same anesthetic method (spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia without morphine and peripheral nerve block). Two experienced surgeons (CK and NR)&#xD;
      perform all procedure with the same surgical technique. A 750 mg intravenous tranexamic acid&#xD;
      is administrated before inflating tourniquet and 3 hours after the operation. A tourniquet&#xD;
      pressure of 300 mmHg is used and inflated before skin incision. Pre-incisional local&#xD;
      injection with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine with adrenaline is done. A mini-medial parapatellar&#xD;
      approach is performed. Cemented TKA prostheses (Nexgen LPS-Flex, Zimmer, Warsaw, Indiana) are&#xD;
      implanted in all participants without patellar resurfacing. Periarticular analgesic injection&#xD;
      is done with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 20 ml of normal saline, 30 mg of ketorolac and 1 ml&#xD;
      of 1% lidocaine with adrenaline. A number-10-gauge drain is placed intra-articularly and&#xD;
      connected to the Ultravak pressure drainage bottle (Poly Medicure Limited, India). Extensor&#xD;
      mechanisms are repaired and the wound closure is performed in the routine fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of operation, the randomized sequence is opened by a scrub nurse. Then, the&#xD;
      participants are randomly assigned into two groups; Group 1 or MRJB group and Group 2 or&#xD;
      non-compressive dressing (NCD) group. A tourniquet pressure is deflated after the dressing is&#xD;
      applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In postoperative period, MRJB is left in place for 24 hours and then changed to NCD. All&#xD;
      participants obtain the three-hour interval drain clamping protocol. After tourniquet&#xD;
      release, the drain is clamped for three hours, released for three hours, re-clamped for three&#xD;
      hours, and then the clamp is run continuously. Mechanical prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      by ankle pumping exercise and ambulation on the bed is started as soon as possible. After 24&#xD;
      hours postoperatively, range of motion exercise and out-of-bed ambulation program are&#xD;
      started. Ice packs are placed around the knee for at least 8 hours per day. The drain is&#xD;
      removed at 48 hours after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For operational definition, MRJB is defined as a three-layers of thick cotton wool and&#xD;
      two-layers of elastic bandages. The wool layers are put on firmly and overlapped the previous&#xD;
      one by half at each turn. The elastic layers were pulled snugly with more tension distally&#xD;
      than proximally. Before wrapping in each turn, the elastic bandage was stretched&#xD;
      approximately 2 and 1.5 inches at below and above tibial tuberosity level, respectively. The&#xD;
      whole bandage attains a thickness of about two inches and extends above the ankle joint to&#xD;
      six inches above the knee joint. Before applying this bandage, the sterile gauze pads were&#xD;
      placed over the wound and followed by WebrilTM padding (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, US). While&#xD;
      NCD is made by placing the sterile gauze pads over the wound and covering with the&#xD;
      hypoallergenic self-adhesive, non-woven fabric tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive the same postoperative pain managements, including (1) parecoxib 40 mg&#xD;
      administrated as intravenous bolus every 12 hours for 2 days, then diclofenac 25 mg orally&#xD;
      every 8 hours until discharge, (2) acetaminophen 300 mg with codeine 15 mg orally every 8&#xD;
      hours until discharge, (3) morphine 2 mg intravenously pro re nata (prn) for pain every 2&#xD;
      hours as a rescue drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first and second 24 hours after surgery, the maximum of visual analog pain scores&#xD;
      at rest and during the ambulation are assessed. The circumferences of knee and thigh at&#xD;
      postoperative 24 and 48 hours are measured by single blinded assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate of blood loss and determine criteria for blood transfusion, hematocrit levels are&#xD;
      measures at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. The patients will receive a transfusion of one&#xD;
      unit of packed red cells, if their hematocrit levels are less than 30% or if the compromised&#xD;
      clinical criteria (such as hypotension, tachycardia, symptoms of anemia that are relative to&#xD;
      the preoperative medical condition) necessitated blood transfusion. If hematocrit levels are&#xD;
      less than 24%, two units of packed red cells are transfused. The hematocrit levels are&#xD;
      reevaluated at 4 hours after the end of transfusion and blood transfusion is considered again&#xD;
      using the same criteria. Drainage blood loss and amount of blood transfusion are recorded at&#xD;
      24 and 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge, range of motion is measured again. Clinical venous thromboembolism, peroneal&#xD;
      nerve palsy, infection and wound complications are also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up period, range of motion, clinical venous thromboembolism, infection, wound&#xD;
      condition and other complications are reassessed at 2 and 6 weeks after TKA. The functional&#xD;
      outcomes, including Oxford Knee Score and time up and go test, are evaluated at 6 weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome in this study is IBL. It means invisible red blood cell (RBC) volume loss&#xD;
      that can be calculated according to the following steps; first, the patient's blood volume&#xD;
      (PBV) is calculated using the Nadler formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PBV = k1 x height (m)3 + k2 x weight (kg) + k3 When k1= 0.3669, k2 = 0.03219, k3 = 0.6041 for&#xD;
      men; k1= 0.3561, k2 = 0.03308, k3 = 0.18331 for women Then, multiplying the PBV by the&#xD;
      hematocrit (Hct) will give the total RBC volume. The change in RBC volume can be calculated&#xD;
      from the change in Hct [20]. In this study, total RBC volume loss at postoperative 48 hours&#xD;
      is calculated using the following formula; Total RBC volume loss = PBV x (Preoperative Hct -&#xD;
      Postoperative Hct at 48 hours) At 24 hours after surgery, the volume of drained blood is&#xD;
      measured and then multiplying by the preoperative Hct will give the drainage RBC blood volume&#xD;
      at 24 hours. During 24-48 hours after surgery, the volume of drained blood is measured and&#xD;
      then multiplying by the postoperative Hct at 24 hours will give the drainage RBC blood volume&#xD;
      at 24-48 hours. The summation of drainage RBC blood volume at 24 hours and at 24-48 hours is&#xD;
      total drained RBC volume. If the patient receives blood transfusion, the volume of packed red&#xD;
      cell is also recorded. Finally, invisible blood loss is calculated using the following&#xD;
      formula; Invisible blood loss = Total RBC volume loss - Total drained RBC volume + Transfused&#xD;
      blood volume&#xD;
