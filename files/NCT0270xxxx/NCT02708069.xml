      The goal of this project is to develop and test e-Unstuck, an e-learning intervention that&#xD;
      (1) provides advanced training to parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder without&#xD;
      Intellectual Disability (ASDwoID) on how to implement the evidence-based Unstuck and On&#xD;
      Target (UOT) curriculum at home and (2) is built on 3C's proprietary, state-of-the-art,&#xD;
      Dynamic e-Learning Platform, an established platform with high ratings of quality, value,&#xD;
      usability, and feasibility from end users. As a result of the pilot efficacy test, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that (1) parents who interact with the e-Unstuck software will&#xD;
      report greater knowledge and use of UOT principles, less parenting stress and greater&#xD;
      parenting sense of competence, and improved child executive function (EF) and social skills&#xD;
      compared to control parents, (2) parents who spend more time engaged with the intervention&#xD;
      will show greater improvements in outcome variables, and (3) parents who interact with the&#xD;
      e-Unstuck software will find the software to be of high quality, value, usability, and&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Significance: The current prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder is 1 in 68&#xD;
      children, and 69% of these children do not have an intellectual disability (ASDwoID).&#xD;
      Individuals with ASDwoID are at considerable risk for maladaptive adult outcomes (e.g., un-&#xD;
      or underemployment), and executive functioning (EF) impairments significantly contribute to&#xD;
      this risk. Unstuck and On Target (UOT) is the only empirically supported EF intervention&#xD;
      specifically targeted to the needs of the ASDwoID population. It has improved both EF and&#xD;
      social skills in children with ASDwoID in a randomized controlled trial. Despite its&#xD;
      demonstrated success, there are significant geographical, scheduling, and financial barriers&#xD;
      to parental adaptation of the Unstuck and On Target (UOT) curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal and Innovation: The goal of this project is to develop and test e-Unstuck, an e-learning&#xD;
      intervention that (1) provides advanced training to parents of children with ASDwoID on how&#xD;
      to implement the evidence-based UOT curriculum at home and (2) is built on 3C's proprietary,&#xD;
      state-of-the-art, Dynamic e-Learning Platform, an established platform with high ratings of&#xD;
      quality, value, usability, and feasibility from end users. e-Unstuck will make UOT more&#xD;
      accessible to parents with geographical, scheduling, and/or financial constraints and will&#xD;
      provide parents with key tools (e.g., video modeling, virtual simulations, personalized&#xD;
      reports) to increase efficacious adoption of UOT principles, above and beyond those provided&#xD;
      in the UOT manual. e-Unstuck will be the first dynamically adaptive, personalized,&#xD;
      interactive software product specifically designed to deploy an evidence-based EF&#xD;
      intervention to parents of children with ASDwoID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: The investigators will accomplish five specific aims, two in Phase I, and&#xD;
      three in Phase II: (1) develop a prototype of e-Unstuck, (2) conduct a feasibility test of&#xD;
      e-Unstuck with parents of children with ASDwoID between the ages of 8-12, (3) fully develop&#xD;
      the e-Unstuck software and conduct iterative usability testing with parents of children with&#xD;
      ASDwoID, (4) conduct a pilot efficacy test in which 110 parents of children with ASDwoID are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the e-Unstuck intervention or to a control condition in which they&#xD;
      receive in-person training on the UOT curriculum, and (5) prepare e-Unstuck for&#xD;
      commercialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: As a result of the pilot efficacy test, the investigators hypothesize that (1)&#xD;
      parents who interact with the e-Unstuck software will report greater knowledge and use of UOT&#xD;
      principles, less parenting stress and greater parenting sense of competence, and improved&#xD;
      child EF and social skills compared to control parents, (2) parents who spend more time&#xD;
      engaged with the intervention will show greater improvements in outcome variables, and (3)&#xD;
      parents who interact with the e-Unstuck software will find the software to be of high&#xD;
      quality, value, usability, and feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commercialization Plan: e-Unstuck will be a unique commercial offering within a large&#xD;
      underserved niche market. Revenue will be generated through direct sales to parents of&#xD;
      children with ASDwoID and volume sales to organizations (e.g., schools, clinics, parent&#xD;
      support agencies) who work with children with ASDwoID and their parents.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in ratings of top three child EF difficulties interference with daily functioning as measured on the Top Executive Functioning Difficulties.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 9 weeks of parental UOT Training</time_frame>
    <description>On this parent-report measure parents rank their child's top 3 EF difficulties and, using a 4 point likert scale (1-no interference to 4-severely interfering), indicate to what extent each difficulty interferes with 5 aspects of their child's daily functioning-daily activities, social activities, follow directions, independence, and task completion. Each difficulty interference score is calculated by summing the 5 rated items and weighted by rank.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in child executive function using the Behavior Rating of Executive Function-II (BRIEF-II).</measure>
    <time_frame>After 9 weeks of parental UOT Training</time_frame>
    <description>This parent-report questionnaire contains 86 items and assesses child EF skills, including flexibility and planning/organization. For this scale, higher T-scores corresponding to higher levels of executive function impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in parental self-efficacy on the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 9 weeks of parental UOT Training</time_frame>
    <description>In this 17-item scale, parents report on their satisfaction (e.g., anxiety, motivation) and self-efficacy (e.g., competence, capability) as parents. The index uses a 6 point likert scale (1-strongly agree to 6-strongly disagree). Scoring for multiple items is reverses so that for all items, higher scores indicate greater self-esteem and self-efficacy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in parental perceptions of caregiving as measured on the Caregiver Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After 9 weeks of parental UOT Training</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire contains 21 items and parents report on their sense of child-related strain, competence and empowerment. The items are rated on a 5 point likert scale (1-not at all to 5-very much). Each subscale score is the sum total of the appropriate 7 items, with higher scores indicating higher perceived strain, sense of competence and empowerment.</description>
