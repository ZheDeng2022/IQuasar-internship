      Clinical evaluation of GCB-70 in overweight subjects: An Add-On Study&#xD;

      In recent years the prevalence of obesity has increased reaching epidemic levels. Obesity can&#xD;
      be defined as excess accumulation of body fat arising from a sustained or a periodic positive&#xD;
      energy balance that is when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure. Overweight and obesity&#xD;
      is based on Body Mass Index (BMI) Accordingly to the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      classifies individuals with BMI 25-29.99 kg/m2 as overweight while individuals with BMI≥ 30&#xD;
      kg/m2 are termed obese. Apart from being a major contributor to chronic disease burden and&#xD;
      mortality, obesity-particularly abdominal obesity, is also closely related to the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, a cluster of diseases that encompasses the following conditions Dyslipidemia,&#xD;
      Hypertension Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance.Abdominal obesity The World Health&#xD;
      Organization predicts there will be 2.3 billion overweight adults in the world by 2015, and&#xD;
      more than 700 million of them will be obese. Worldwide obesity has more than doubled since&#xD;
      1980. In 2008, 1.5 billion adults, 20 years of age and older, were overweight. Of these, over&#xD;
      200 million men and nearly 300 million women were obese. Over 65% of the world population&#xD;
      lives in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and obesity have become a serious health concern . Diﬀerent weight management&#xD;
      strategies are presently utilized and a variety of weight loss supplements sold as &quot;slimming&#xD;
      aids&quot; are readily available. However, the eﬃcacy of some of these food supplements remains&#xD;
      uncertain. With the high cost of prescription weight loss drugs and the fear of side effects,&#xD;
      the general public is turning to nutraceuticals. One such supplement is the green coﬀee&#xD;
      extract (GCE).GCE is present in green or raw coﬀee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coffee (Coffea L.) is the world's favourite beverage and the second-most traded commodity&#xD;
      after oil. In 2009/10 coffee accounted for exports worth an estimated US$ 15.4 billion, when&#xD;
      some 93.4 million bags were shipped, with total coffee sector employment estimated at about&#xD;
      26 million people in 52 producing countries. Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and robusta&#xD;
      coffee (C. canephora Pierre ex A.Froehner) are the two main species used in the production of&#xD;
      coffee. 66% of the world production mostly comes from Coffea arabica L. and 34% from Coffea&#xD;
      canephora. Coffee belongs to family Rubiaceae in the genus Coffea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCB-70 is obtained from raw seeds or beans of Coffee. In producing the normal coffee for&#xD;
      sale, the berries are roasted to produce the traditional beverage. However, no roasting is&#xD;
      done for green extract so as to preserve important components&#xD;
