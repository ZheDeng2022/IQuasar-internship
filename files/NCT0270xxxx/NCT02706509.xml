    <textblock>
      A multicenter prospective interventional comparative study that investigate pain management&#xD;
      during Jaydess insertion in nulliparous women that will be tested by the analgesic affects of&#xD;
      oral tramadol or 'verbal anesthesia' on the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most intrauterine contraception (IUC) insertions do not require pain management. However,&#xD;
      small proportions of nulliparous women experience substantial pain that needs to be&#xD;
      proactively managed No prophylactic pharmacological intervention has been adequately&#xD;
      evaluated to support routine use for pain reduction during or after IUC insertion. Women's&#xD;
      anxiety about the procedure may contribute to higher levels of perceived pain, which&#xD;
      highlights the importance of counselling, and creating a trustworthy, unhurried and&#xD;
      professional atmosphere in which the experience of the provider also has a major role; a&#xD;
      situation frequently referred to as 'verbal anaesthesia'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proven in the past that the use of oral Tramadol can reduce the pain in the&#xD;
      insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study investigators will compare the analgesic affects of oral Tramadol and verbal&#xD;
      anesthesia on pain relief during Jaydess insertion in nulliparous women.&#xD;
