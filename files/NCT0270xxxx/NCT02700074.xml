    <textblock>
      The main goal of our study is to find out why some people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)&#xD;
      do not develop verbal abilities or remain minimally-verbal throughout adolescence and&#xD;
      adulthood. Current research focuses on investigating brain differences related to processing&#xD;
      sounds and initiating speech in adolescents and young adults with ASD varying in language&#xD;
      skills, compared to adolescents who do not have ASD, in order to clarify whether atypical&#xD;
      processes of auditory perception, perceptual organization and/or neural oscillation patterns&#xD;
      may explain why some individuals with ASD fail to acquire functional speech.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 30% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) fail to acquire spoken language.&#xD;
      This group of children has been seriously neglected in research conducted over the past 2&#xD;
      decades. Little is known about them, in part because the field lacks the tools to assess&#xD;
      them, and they often pose significant behavioral challenges that preclude their participation&#xD;
      in research studies. Among the ~70% individuals with ASD who have spoken language skills,&#xD;
      about 50% are language impaired; the remaining group have normal language scores on&#xD;
      standardized tests. Thus, there is enormous heterogeneity in verbal abilities in ASD. To&#xD;
      date, studies of the brain and cognitive mechanisms that underlie this heterogeneity remain&#xD;
      quite limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the cognitive level, current research suggests that language impairment in verbal children&#xD;
      with ASD involves deficits in phonological working memory, as evident on tests of nonsense&#xD;
      word repetition. The areas of language that are most affected in this group include complex&#xD;
      syntax and morphology related to marking tense (Tager-Flusberg et al., 2005). There is also&#xD;
      considerable evidence from MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) studies of both children and&#xD;
      adults that there are differences in volume and asymmetry in language regions of the cortex,&#xD;
      specifically Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Recent studies suggest that these differences do&#xD;
      not necessarily track with degree of language impairment, though there are conflicting&#xD;
      findings in the literature. Importantly, most of the participants in cognitive and&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies of ASD have been adults and individuals who have relatively intact&#xD;
      language. Far less is known about the processes (either cognitive or neural) that might be&#xD;
      implicated in the minimally verbal group. This project is designed to address this issue&#xD;
      using two different brain imaging methods and approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. fMRI and DTI: Converging lines of evidence support the view that ASDs are disorders of&#xD;
           connectivity, in which abnormalities in white matter integrity and reduced coordination&#xD;
           of activity across brain regions give rise to core features. Recent results from our&#xD;
           group (Guenther; Manoach) have identified white matter anomalies in the speech network&#xD;
           of high-functioning verbal adults with ASD, specifically in the pathway between the left&#xD;
           supplementary motor area (SMA) and left ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), a pathway&#xD;
           involved in the initiation of speech output according to the Directions into Velocities&#xD;
           of Articulators (DIVA) model of speech production, a leading model of the neural&#xD;
           computations underlying speech. These connectivity abnormalities are revealed in both&#xD;
           DTI and functional connectivity analyses collected using fMRI. NOTE: IRB approval for&#xD;
           the collection of fMRI/DTI data will be obtained from MGH, where this portion of the&#xD;
           study will be carried out. Data analyses will be carried out at MGH and BU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrophysiology: EEG/ERP It has long been known that some children with ASD fail to&#xD;
           respond when spoken to, cover their ears in the presence of certain sounds, yet show&#xD;
           highly acute hearing in other contexts. Little is known about the mechanisms that might&#xD;
           underlie these unusual auditory processing profiles. Abnormal neural oscillations have&#xD;
           been found to be an endophenotype for ASD in infants and adults. However, the picture of&#xD;
           how oscillations differ from those of non-clinical subjects is unclear and depends on&#xD;
           the age at testing. Characterizing the oscillations present in the brains of a range of&#xD;
           adolescents will allow us to quantify the relationship between neural activity and&#xD;
           severity of language impairment. The main hypothesis that will be tested in this project&#xD;
           is that abnormal neural connectivity in minimally verbal children with ASD profoundly&#xD;
           impedes the ability to perceptually organize auditory scenes into meaningful units or&#xD;
           objects, which has a direct effect on language development in these individuals.&#xD;
           Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and frequency-based analysis of the&#xD;
           electroencephalogram (EEG) will be collected during passive listening tasks, to evaluate&#xD;
           auditory perception and the perceptual organization of tones and speech using the&#xD;
           mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm (the MMN reflects passive deviance detection&#xD;
           processes indexing low-level acoustic processes in automatic sensory memory mechanisms,&#xD;
           and it has been widely investigated in studies of auditory perceptual discrimination of&#xD;
           tones and speech).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to collect these data from 3 groups of adolescents with ASD varying in&#xD;
      language skills (minimally verbal, verbal-language impaired, verbal-language normal) and age&#xD;
      and gender matched non-ASD typical adolescents. The participants will be diagnosed and tested&#xD;
      using a range of standardized and non-standardized assessments including IQ/cognitive level;&#xD;
      social abilities; ASD severity; communication skills (nonverbal). These assessments will be&#xD;
      carried out by trained examiners in the clinical core housed at BU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because many of the participants present with highly challenging behaviors and are difficult&#xD;
      to test, a number of innovative approaches will be taken to maximize participants' success in&#xD;
      completing the behavioral assessments, and then to tolerate and provide artifact-free data in&#xD;
      the electrophysiological and MRI portions of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the investigators hypothesize that the groups tested will differ in their neural&#xD;
      indices of auditory perception, neural indices of perceptual organization, and induced neural&#xD;
      oscillations. Further, the investigators hypothesize that differences in the degree of&#xD;
      language impairment across these groups will be correlated with differences in the degree of&#xD;
      abnormality of the measured neural indices, but not in the form of the abnormality,&#xD;
      suggesting that the root causes of the differences across the tested subject groups are&#xD;
      quantitative rather than qualitative.&#xD;
