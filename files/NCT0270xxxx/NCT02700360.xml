      A Randomized, Open-Label, Single -Dose, Crossover, Phase I Clinical Trial to Evaluate the&#xD;
      Effect of Food on the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after Oral&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro and in vivo efficacy studies and clinical trials have shown that EC-18 has a mode of&#xD;
      action of improving neutropenia by promoting neutrophil production from hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cells and at the same time, efficiently controlling STAT6/Complement 3(C 3), suggesting its&#xD;
      potential to be developed as an orally administered new drug for treatment of neutropenia&#xD;
      resulting from decreased neutrophils caused by administration of an anticancer agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, open-Label, single -dose, crossover, phase I clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18 after&#xD;
      oral administration in healthy volunteers&#xD;

    <description>This trial is conducted as a randomized, open-label, single -dose, crossover, phase I to evaluate the effect of food on the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of EC-18. EC-18 is given at an oral, once daily in condition of empty stomach and a high fat diet(900~1,000 kcal, contains 50~60%lipid).This trial is divided into Part 1(1,000mg dose) and Part 2(500mg dose and 2,000mg dose), 12 subjects are included in each dose and cross-over period is 7 days. After Part 1 study, If primary PK parameters of EC-18 is affected by food and AEs meeting study discontinuation criteria are not reported, Part 2 will proceed in consecutive order with registering new subjects.</description>
