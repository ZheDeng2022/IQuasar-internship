  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder that is increasingly&#xD;
      recognized in our ageing population. It is characterized by cardinal clinical features&#xD;
      including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. For most people with PD,&#xD;
      the most serious concern is with the motor system: stiffness, slowness of movement, impaired&#xD;
      handwriting and coordination, poor mobility and balance. However, more than half of all&#xD;
      people with PD have experienced painful symptoms. Most people experience aching, stiffness,&#xD;
      numbness and tingling at some point in the course of the illness. Defazio et al reported that&#xD;
      pain may begin at clinical onset of PD or thereafter as a non-motor feature of PD.5 Aching&#xD;
      muscles and joints are especially common in PD. Rigidity, lack of spontaneous movement,&#xD;
      abnormalities of posture and awkward mechanical stresses all contribute to musculoskeletal&#xD;
      pain in PD.&#xD;

      One of the most common musculoskeletal complaints is shoulder pain or shoulder disorders,&#xD;
      including frozen shoulder, bursitis, and rotator cuff lesions. Actually, shoulder pain or&#xD;
      shoulder disorder can be the first sign of PD. The prevalence and severity of shoulder&#xD;
      disorders in Parkinson's disease are not totally clear. In a retrospective study, Stamey&#xD;
      found shoulder pain was present in 11% of patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past ten years ultrasound (US) has become popular in the evaluation of shoulder&#xD;
      disorders. It allows for the detailed assessment of a wide range of changes involving&#xD;
      different anatomic structures of the shoulder joint, including rotator cuffs, biceps tendon,&#xD;
      and subdeltoid bursa. Koh et al found among 33 PD patients, 22 patients had abnormal US&#xD;
      findings on the dominant side, and all 22 patients with abnormal US finding had a tendon tear&#xD;
      and 9 patients had frozen shoulder. However, there were no control group in Koh' s study, and&#xD;
      diagnosis of frozen shoulder with US findings is still controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate patients with PD with a combination of physical&#xD;
      examination and US study of the shoulder, and to compare the frequency and type of shoulder&#xD;
      lesion in US between patients with PD and normal subjects. The investigators also plan to&#xD;
      test the correlation between shoulder disorders or US abnormality and the severity of PD.&#xD;

    <description>The VAS scores were obtained using a horizontal lines of 100 mm, with 0 on the left indicating no pain and 100 on the right indicating very severe pain. A VAS has been shown to be reliable and sensitive for quantifying pain, with test-retest reliability of &gt;0.90.19 In previous studies of patients treated for various shoulder disorders, the responsiveness of VAS for pain was moderate to good.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SPADI is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the pain and disability associated with shoulder disease. The total SPADI score is ranges between 0 and 100. The SDQ is a symptoms in patients with shoulder disorders. The final score is obtained by dividing the number by 100, which results in a final score ranging between 0 (no disability) and 100 (the worst situation).</description>
