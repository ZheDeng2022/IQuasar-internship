    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an investigational device to record brain activity for&#xD;
      12-24 months following surgical implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems. The&#xD;
      goal of the study is better understanding of brain activity in Parkinson's disease and how&#xD;
      they relate to DBS and pharmacological management, not to bring new devices to market.&#xD;

      Experimental: chronic brain recording This is a one-arm, single-center study of the&#xD;
      neurophysiology of human movement disorders with two goals: 1) Assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      chronic brain recording using a novel fully implantable pulse generator (Medtronic Activa&#xD;
      PC+S), which has the capability of sensing and storing local field potentials (LFPs) recorded&#xD;
      from implanted electrodes, in addition to providing therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS).&#xD;
      2) Study acute and chronic effects of therapeutic DBS on cortical LFPs. 3) Study feasibility&#xD;
      of the use of brain signals as feedback either directly to the patient or for DBS stimulation&#xD;
      adjustments.&#xD;

             assessed by total UPDRS III score (off and on meds)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Approved for unilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN)- or globus pallidus internus&#xD;
             (GPi)-DBS surgery to treat their clinical motor signs and plan to undergo the standard&#xD;
