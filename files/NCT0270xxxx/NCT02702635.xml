      Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI gives quantitative and semi-quantitative information&#xD;
      about the integrity of the vascular system and can be used to quantify blood-brain barrier&#xD;
      (BBB) integrity. The BBB plays a pathophysiological role in diabetes, cognitive disorders&#xD;
      such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and chronic&#xD;
      traumatic encephalopathy. Although dysfunctional, changes in BBB integrity for these&#xD;
      conditions are thought to be subtle and close to intact values. Recent studies have shown it&#xD;
      is possible measure small changes in the BBB integrity as an early sign of disease using DCE&#xD;
      MRI. The objective of this study is to apply an optimized DCE imaging protocol and novel&#xD;
      image post-processing to obtain new information about the BBB integrity in aging. These&#xD;
      techniques show promise for both improving clinical diagnosis, and elucidated the physiology&#xD;
      or various disease processes.&#xD;

      Objectives The objective of this investigator-initiated study is to continue and extend this&#xD;
      research by applying our optimized DCE imaging protocol (using the standard FDA approved DCE&#xD;
      sequence) and our novel image post-processing to obtain new information about the BBB&#xD;
      integrity in aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure Overview: Subjects will be recruited either from patient's at LLUMC with an&#xD;
      existing order for a MRI study of the head with contrast, or from an exisiting cohort at LLU&#xD;
      that participated in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health controls will be asked if they would like to participate in the study in order to&#xD;
      evaluate if the optimized DCE sequence can provide useful information about various CNS&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging: Following consent, subjects will be imaged at LLUMC using the 3T MRI scanner&#xD;
      (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA) after MRI safety screening questionnaire is&#xD;
      complete. Subjects will be asked to lie on or be positioned on their backs in the MRI&#xD;
      scanner. The coil will be placed around their head and the subject will be provided with&#xD;
      headphones and/or earplugs during the scan. Imaging will consist of the diagnostic MR&#xD;
      protocol requested by the ordering physician and the addition of the standard FDA approved&#xD;
      DCE sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis The collected DCE data may be processed using standard FDA&#xD;
      approved DCE software (which the department already owns and uses clinically), used for&#xD;
      clinical decision making purposes, and added to the patients record. The data will also be&#xD;
      processed using specialized research software, this processing will not be used for&#xD;
      diagnostic or clinical decision making purposes, and will not be added to the patients&#xD;
      record. Ktrans values will be measured using region of interest analysis from the processed&#xD;
      DCE data to determine if there are differences between the pathology of interest and healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
