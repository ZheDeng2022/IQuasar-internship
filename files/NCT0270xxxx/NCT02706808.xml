  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess whether supplementation with resistant starch from&#xD;
      the rice-flour coffee developed by EMBRAPA, as well as from an already industrialized product&#xD;
      (Hi-Maize of Ingredion®) could modulate the intestinal microbiota of patients with CKD ( both&#xD;
      patients under conservative treatment, such as dialysis treatment), as well as exerting a&#xD;
      beneficial effect with respect to reducing levels of inflammatory markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress, uremic toxins and in addition, markers of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those who are on dialysis have a high&#xD;
      prevalence of cardiovascular mortality and, among the risk factors include inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Recently this scenario, beyond those alterations found in these patients,&#xD;
      it has been suggested that the balance of the intestinal flora in these patients might be a&#xD;
      new factor of cardiovascular risk. Some treatment strategies have been studied in order to&#xD;
      modulate the gut microbiota as the use of pre, pro or synbiotics. Although few studies,&#xD;
      supplementation with prebiotics has been recommended. However, the use of resistant starch as&#xD;
      a source of prebiotic for modulation of the intestinal flora in these patients has not yet&#xD;
      been evaluated, but the study of Prof. Vaziri the University of California Irvine, USA, with&#xD;
      nephrectomized rats showed that the resistant starch was able to attenuating the progression&#xD;
      of failure of renal function, inflammation and oxidative stress and minimize the&#xD;
      abnormalities of intestinal epithelial barrier. The objective of this study is to assess&#xD;
      whether supplementation with resistant starch from the rice-flour coffee developed by&#xD;
      EMBRAPA, as well as from an already industrialized product (Hi-Maize of Ingredion®) could&#xD;
      modulate the intestinal microbiota of patients with CKD ( both patients under conservative&#xD;
      treatment, such as dialysis treatment), as well as exerting a beneficial effect with respect&#xD;
      to reducing levels of inflammatory markers of oxidative stress, uremic toxins and in&#xD;
      addition, markers of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
