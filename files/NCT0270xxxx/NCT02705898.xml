  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Building on the large body of evidence for the effect of exercise in decreasing depressive&#xD;
      symptoms and the few preliminary findings of its effect on craving and drinking outcomes, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to develop a lifestyle physical activity (LPA) intervention that&#xD;
      harnesses the technological advantages of the Fitbit tracker (plus its web and mobile&#xD;
      platforms) for depressed women with alcohol use disorders (AUDs). The intervention will&#xD;
      provide women with an acceptable, flexible and effective alternate coping strategy during&#xD;
      early recovery, when relapse risk is highest. The overall objective of this work is to fully&#xD;
      develop this LPA+Fitbit intervention, modify it based on initial piloting and feedback to&#xD;
      ensure its feasibility and acceptability for depressed women with AUDs in early recovery,&#xD;
      propose potential mechanisms of its effect, and to obtain preliminary data on its efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are the 3rd leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. and&#xD;
      are associated with significant economic burden and health-related negative consequences.&#xD;
      While women may be less likely to develop AUDs, they experience more significant negative&#xD;
      health consequences of alcohol use than men. Due to stigma, shame, and child care issues;&#xD;
      women are less likely to receive specialty addiction treatment. The comorbidity of depression&#xD;
      and AUDs is much higher in women, and compared to men, women depression often has a temporal&#xD;
      onset prior to an AUD. Relapse rates are very high in both men and women but significant&#xD;
      gender differences emerge in the predictors of relapse. Women are more likely to relapse in&#xD;
      unpleasant, negative emotional states and depressive symptoms and negative affect mediate the&#xD;
      relationship between these stressors and drinking outcomes. More so than men, women with AUDs&#xD;
      report drinking to cope with negative emotions. Therefore, intervention approaches that help&#xD;
      women develop alternate coping strategies can have an important role in decreasing alcohol&#xD;
      relapse among depressed women with AUDs. Given the demonstrated benefits of exercise for&#xD;
      decreasing depression, negative affect, and urges to drink, helping women engage in a&#xD;
      flexible and acceptable lifestyle physical activity (LPA) intervention may provide them a&#xD;
      tool they can utilizing &quot;in the moment&quot; to cope with negative emotional states and alcohol&#xD;
      craving during early recovery when relapse risk is highest. Exciting new digital fitness&#xD;
      technologies (e.g., Fitbit activity monitor with web and mobile applications) have emerged in&#xD;
      recent years that include features able to further enhance critical components for increasing&#xD;
      physical activity - goal setting and self-monitoring. The investigators propose to develop a&#xD;
      12-week LPA+Fitbit intervention for depressed women in alcohol treatment. This will include:&#xD;
      1) an in-person physical activity (PA) counseling orientation session; 2) 4 brief,&#xD;
      phone-based PA counseling sessions focused on increasing PA and strategically using bouts of&#xD;
      PA to cope with affect and alcohol cravings; 3) use of the Fitbit fitness tracker for&#xD;
      physical activity goal-setting and daily self-monitoring; and 4) weekly supportive messages&#xD;
      delivered by text message. The overall objective of this application is to develop this&#xD;
      LPA+Fitbit intervention, modify it based on a initial open pilot (n=20) and feedback to&#xD;
      ensure its feasibility and acceptability for depressed women with AUDs in early recovery,&#xD;
      propose potential mechanisms, and to obtain preliminary data on its efficacy in a small&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial (n=50). The LPA+Fitbit intervention proposed in this application is&#xD;
      simple, low-cost, and easily transportable to the varied clinical settings women with AUDs&#xD;
      receive treatment. If women with AUDs find the LPA+Fitbit intervention feasible, acceptable,&#xD;
      and helpful during early recovery, they could be afforded with a much needed alternate coping&#xD;
      strategy that would reduce relapse risk and decrease the overall negative impact of alcohol&#xD;
      use on their health and well-being.&#xD;
