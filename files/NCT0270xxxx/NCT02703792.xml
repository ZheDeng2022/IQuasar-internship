      This qualitative study uses focus group methodology and purposive sampling with the aim of&#xD;
      obtaining views of Care Home Support Service staff and other stakeholders about their&#xD;
      experiences of a redesigned National Health Service (NHS) Care Home Support Service.&#xD;
      Individual stakeholder focus groups will be conducted with General Practitioners (GP), care&#xD;
      home staff, relatives of residents in care homes, service-user representatives (Total N=32,&#xD;
      across 4 focus groups). This study forms part of a larger evaluation of the CHSS service;&#xD;
      service improvement workshops will be conducted with Oxford Health NHS Care Home Support&#xD;
      Service, Community Nursing and Community Mental Health staff that are working in the 102&#xD;
      participating homes. Each participant who consents will take part in a focus group to explore&#xD;
      their experiences of a redesigned NHS care home support service. Participants will be&#xD;
      involved in the study for up to six months from gaining informed consent until last contact&#xD;
      with the research team when a summary of the research will be sent. The data will be analysed&#xD;
      using thematic analysis and applied with the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation&#xD;
      and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently 800 000 people in the United Kingdom (UK) living with dementia and this&#xD;
      is predicted to grow to 1 million people by 2021. Studies suggest that 250 000 of people with&#xD;
      dementia reside in care homes. Reports such as the National Dementia Strategy and subsequent&#xD;
      government initiatives, such as the Dementia Challenge and the Prime Minister's Challenge on&#xD;
      Dementia 2020 have helped the nation focus on provision of services for people with dementia.&#xD;
      Further, our media remind us that the quality of care being delivered in care homes needs&#xD;
      significant improvement. With an ageing population effective, safe, good quality care for our&#xD;
      older people is paramount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A high proportion of people in care homes have dementia and many have co-existing physical&#xD;
      health problems and/or additional mental health needs. An integrated Care Home Support&#xD;
      Service (CHSS) delivers care and treatment of both physical and mental health problems at an&#xD;
      early stage of development. This integrated service combines two approaches which have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in randomised control trials and open studies in a stepped care model.&#xD;
      Evidence suggests it is feasible to implement some elements of such approaches into a&#xD;
      specialist mental health NHS context. However, no widespread implementation of this combined&#xD;
      approach had been undertaken in an NHS context until the integration of this Care Home&#xD;
      Support Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluating the implementation of health care initiatives is crucial in determining their&#xD;
      impact and sustainability in a routine NHS setting. This qualitative evaluation is part of a&#xD;
      broader evaluation of the service. Focus groups and service improvement workshops will be&#xD;
      conducted with NHS staff and other stakeholders. The data will be analysed using thematic&#xD;
      analysis and applied to the RE-AIM framework to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide valuable information from NHS staff and stakeholders regarding the impact and&#xD;
           sustainability of this model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore key factors to consider when integrating physical and mental health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase understanding of the potential barriers and facilitators of integrating&#xD;
           evidence-based practice into a routine NHS setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On completion of the research the findings of the study will be disseminated to research&#xD;
      participants and health professionals to support learning and best practice both locally and&#xD;
      nationally.&#xD;
