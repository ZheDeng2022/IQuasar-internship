  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      14,000 new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed each year, frail and elderly patients&#xD;
      represent a rising proportion of these patients. Whilst the gold standard is often to remove&#xD;
      the tumour and restore bowel continuity, surgeons will often avoid this procedure in this&#xD;
      group of patients as they unfortunately tolerate surgical complications very poorly. Such&#xD;
      surgical complications may present with life threatening sepsis, can prolong hospital stay,&#xD;
      delay further cancer therapy and in the elderly or frail patient often leads to loss of&#xD;
      independence and quality of life. In this setting, there are two alternative procedures&#xD;
      (Hartmann's procedure OR intersphincteric APE) that may be used and these are employed in&#xD;
      roughly equal measure in the UK (nationwide survey, Dec 2013, unpublished data). It is&#xD;
      anecdotally felt that Hartmann's procedure (HP) has a greater risk of surgical complications&#xD;
      (30%) and a few small retrospective studies have shown this (1-3), however there are no&#xD;
      prospective data to support this view. Whilst some surgeons do choose intersphincteric APE&#xD;
      (IAPE) on the basis of a lower surgical complication rate, many do not due to perceived&#xD;
      limitations in the technique (longer operating time, risk of tumour perforation), which are&#xD;
      unproven. We feel that a larger, prospective dataset is required to demonstrate the&#xD;
      superiority of IAPE over HP and convince the remaining surgeons to change procedure. We have&#xD;
      explored the possibility of a full randomised trial to answer this question, however this is&#xD;
      not feasible due to the difficulty of randomisation of patients. Very little data are&#xD;
      available regarding the use of IAPE in the setting of rectal cancer, however many surgeons&#xD;
      who do employ the technique, specifically adapt their technique in this setting to reduce the&#xD;
      chances of tumour perforation (two stage, stapling off rectum before removing anal canal&#xD;
      separately). It is possible that those surgeons who prefer HP have not considered this, and&#xD;
      combined with the lack of prospective data are reluctant to change technique. We are&#xD;
      confident that if we can demonstrate a significant difference in surgical complication rate&#xD;
      and promote a modification to the IAPE surgical technique then we can significantly reduce&#xD;
      surgical harm to these frail patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Having established a network of units (UK and Europe) who are also keen to answer this&#xD;
      question we have powered a prospective observational cohort study to demonstrate a&#xD;
      significant reduction in surgical complication rate (30% to 15%). In conjunction with an on&#xD;
      going Swedish randomised trial we hope that the data from this study will provide compelling&#xD;
      evidence for UK surgeons to change practice. If the study reveals only a modest difference in&#xD;
      complications, we will use the data gathered to design and reapply again for full funding for&#xD;
      an RCT with the additional advantage of being able to clearly demonstrate a network of units&#xD;
      capable of recruiting the necessary number of patients. The overarching aims of this study&#xD;
      are therefore to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the difference in surgical complication rates between HP and IAPE&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effect of IAPE technique on intra operative tumour perforation rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine surgical complication rate for each procedure (graded by Clavien-Dindo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess impact on secondary outcomes (length of stay, readmission, reintervention,&#xD;
           medical complications, time to chemotherapy, quality of life)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine if the complication rate in IAPE is dependant on surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine patient and clinician acceptability to randomisation if required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on specific CRF at baseline and 30 post operative days, all data will&#xD;
      be completely anonymised and no further data will be collected past 30 days. The easy to use&#xD;
      and well validated Clavien-Dindo scale will be use to grade surgical complications, but we&#xD;
      will also calculate the Comprehensive Complication Index which integrates all medical and&#xD;
      surgical complications and is felt to represent a more accurate estimation of post operative&#xD;
      complications (4). Data will be collected at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE INTRAOPERATIVE POST OPERATIVE (30 days) Age Surgical approach (lap, open)&#xD;
      Pathological stage Sex Anaesthetic type TME quality BMI Operative time Length of stay&#xD;
      Comorbidities Intra operative perforation Readmission ASA score Length of anorectal stump&#xD;
      (HP) Surgical complications (Clavien-Dindo scale) Radiological stage Antibiotics Medical&#xD;
      complications Distance of tumour from anal verge Method of IAPE (one vs two stage)&#xD;
      Comprehensive Classification Index score Preoperative therapy 30 day quality of life Quality&#xD;
      of life Patient willingness to randomise Reason for avoiding primary anastomosis Surgeon&#xD;
      willingness to randomise Surgeon's reason for op choice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis As this is an observation analysis, reporting only the unadjusted difference&#xD;
      between HP and IAPE may result in a biased comparison. The primary analysis will therefore be&#xD;
      a multivariable analysis adjusting for any confounding factors. To ensure the analysis is in&#xD;
      keeping with the sample size calculation, evaluations of the primary outcome will be based on&#xD;
      a 90% confidence interval.&#xD;
