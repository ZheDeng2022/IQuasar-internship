    <textblock>
      To evaluate the role of DCB angioplasty for venous anastomotic stenosis of hemodialysis&#xD;
      graft, investigators would like to perform randomized study comparing the results of drug-&#xD;
      coated balloon angioplasty with conventional balloon angioplasty in the treatment in venous&#xD;
      anastomotic stenosis of AVG in terms of patency.&#xD;

      Study Procedure The Interventional angiographic suit will follow the standard hemodialysis&#xD;
      related interventional procedure for PTA. Fistulogram will be performed prior to PTA. All&#xD;
      enrolled patients should undergo 3 and 6-month follow-up fistulogram and information will be&#xD;
      collected and recorded on the treated study vessel and pictures through angiographic image.&#xD;
      These data will be recorded on clinical recording form using an excel program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pretreatment evaluation 1.1 All procedures will be performed after obtaining written&#xD;
           informed consent from patients. No specific pre-treatment regimen will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 After sterile preparation and draping, percutaneous access will be gained in an&#xD;
           appropriately chosen hemodialysis graft after application of local anesthesia.&#xD;
           Diagnostic fistulogram was performed to identify and evaluate the target lesion and any&#xD;
           possible secondary lesions. In case of thrombotic occlusion of AVG, diagnostic&#xD;
           fistulogram will be done after successful aspiration thrombectomy though a sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 All lesions were characterized by location, length, and degree of stenosis. The&#xD;
           degree of stenoses was evaluated in two orthogonal planes, and the greatest degree of&#xD;
           stenoses was used for subsequent anatomic measurements. Anatomic measurements were made&#xD;
           with use of a calibrated reference marker or software within the angiographic imaging&#xD;
           system. The reference vessel was defined as an adjacent segment of normal vein or graft&#xD;
           located adjacent to the target lesion. The degree of stenosis was reported as the&#xD;
           maximum diameter reduction compared with the reference vessel diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PTA in venous anastomosis of AVG 2.1 Vascular sheaths will be used in all cases. 2.2&#xD;
           Balloon diameter will be chosen at the operator's discretion, generally starting with a&#xD;
           balloon 10% oversized compared with the adjacent normal vein or graft in both groups&#xD;
           (Reference Vessel Diameter: RVD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3 Balloon length will be also chosen at the discretion of the operator: In general,&#xD;
           4-cm- or 6cm-long balloons can be used for some long lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4 If patient requested the sedation, conscious sedation can be done. 2.5 After&#xD;
           crossing the stenosis with a guide wire, the conventional balloon catheter was&#xD;
           appropriately positioned across the lesion under fluoroscopic guidance. With the use of&#xD;
           an inflation device with a pressure gauge, the balloon catheter was gradually inflated&#xD;
           until the stenosis was eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6 Randomization will be assigned after successful conventional balloon angioplasty in&#xD;
           venous anastomotic stenosis of AVG. After conventional angioplasty, patients will be&#xD;
           randomly assigned to undergo DEB angioplasty or to receive conventional balloon&#xD;
           angioplasty for 3 minutes (upto norminal pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.7 If the patient will be randomly assigned to the DEB group, an In.Pact® Drug-eluting&#xD;
           balloon catheter (6, 7mm in diameter, ≦6cm in length) will be used in addition to&#xD;
           conventional balloon angioplasty. A balloon diameter and length will be equal to that&#xD;
           used in the conventional balloon angioplasty group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Procedure Materials PRODUCT SIZE LENGTHS Drug Eluting balloon In.Pact® 6,7mm 4, 6cm&#xD;
           Conventional balloon Various conventional balloon catheter 6,7mm 4, 6cm&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will be followed after PTA. When patients visit hemodialysis unit 3&#xD;
                and 6 months after PTA, the patient's record will be updated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients that visit hemodialysis unit will be brought to angiographic suit to&#xD;
                undergo follow-up fistulogram and evaluate the re-stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical follow-up will be performed in hemodialysis unit, including checking the&#xD;
                status of hemodialysis using a those circuits and general work-up.&#xD;
