      The proposed study design is a randomized controlled trial, split mouth design, to compare&#xD;
      the two different vertical augmentation procedures: Titanium mesh (Ti-mesh) technique and&#xD;
      Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) technique with a high-density polytetrafluoroethylene (d-PTFE)&#xD;
      membrane.&#xD;

      E) Study Procedures Visit 1: Screening (Approximately 30 mins) Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by the principal investigator or a co-investigator. The subjects will be instructed&#xD;
      to read the informed consent form (ICF), given ample time to have any questions answered, and&#xD;
      then instructed to sign the ICF. Subject will be given a copy of the ICF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject will be asked to complete demographic information and a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative height of the bony crest will be evaluated on the pre-existing radiographs&#xD;
      from the referring clinic if they are less than 6 months old. If recent radiographs do not&#xD;
      exist, radiographs will be taken at this visit. It is standard of care to have radiographs&#xD;
      from within the past 6 months prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Surgery (Approximately 180 mins) Medical history will be reviewed as standard of&#xD;
      care. Eligibility and subject withdrawal criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject&#xD;
      still qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeries will be performed by either of two investigators, Yong Hur (Co-I) and Yumi Ogata&#xD;
      (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of d-PTFE for vertical ridge augmentation will be randomly assigned to one side of&#xD;
      the mouth of each subject (randomization is for research purposes) and Ti-mesh to the other&#xD;
      side of mouth, and therefore, subjects will receive both of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guided Bone regeneration (GBR) procedure using a d-PTFE: (standard of care excluding&#xD;
           clinical measurements) The following steps will be performed following standard of care&#xD;
           procedures: local anesthesia, muco-periosteal incision, full thickness flap reflection,&#xD;
           de-cortication of the alveolar ridge, bone harvesting using bone scrapers, tenting screw&#xD;
           placement, clinical measurements, DBBM graft material placement, the placement and&#xD;
           stabilization of the d-PTFE membrane according to manufacturer's instructions, sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Guided Bone regeneration (GBR) procedure using Ti-mesh: (standard of care excluding&#xD;
           clinical measurements) The following steps will be performed following standard of care&#xD;
           procedures: local anesthesia, muco-periosteal incision, full thickness flap reflection,&#xD;
           de-cortication of the alveolar ridge, bone harvesting using bone scrapers, tenting screw&#xD;
           placement, clinical measurements, DBBM graft material placement, the placement and&#xD;
           stabilization of the titanium mesh according to manufacturer's instructions, sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone harvesting using bone scrapers will be performed during GBR procedures with both&#xD;
      techniques (d-PTFE and Ti-mesh). Bone harvesting using bone scrapers is for harvesting&#xD;
      particulate autogeneous bone graft material. The investigators will use a mixture of 50:50&#xD;
      DBBM and autogenous bone graft material for all vertical augmentation procedures in the&#xD;
      study. Particulate autogenous bone graft will be harvested from the retromolar region of the&#xD;
      mandible. This area is just next to the area of GBR procedures (posterior mandible) and will&#xD;
      be visible after flap elevation for vertical augmentation. Therefore, the investigators do&#xD;
      not need any additional steps except harvesting autogenous bone graft. Intraoral harvesting&#xD;
      by bone scrapers from the retromolar region is a simple and safe method for collecting&#xD;
      cortical bone chips.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intrasurgical clinical measurements of the ridge height will be taken during surgery. The&#xD;
      distance between the top of the tenting screw and bone crest will be measured with a&#xD;
      periodontal probe during the procedure. Duration of each procedure and surgical complications&#xD;
      including flap tear and bleeding will be collected. All outcome measurements will be&#xD;
      performed by a Co-I who did not perform the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to complete a pain/discomfort survey using VAS scale from zero to&#xD;
      ten. A medication log will be given to the patient to track the number of pills of the&#xD;
      prescribed painkiller they have taken in order to examine the amount of pain after the&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The mean number of pills used after surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative medication will be prescribed following TUSDM standard of care guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (7±3 days after procedure): Post-operative Follow-up (Approximately 20 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will be reviewed as standard of care. Eligibility and subject withdrawal&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject still qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have a post-operative visit, which is standard practice at TUSDM&#xD;
      periodontology clinic. Standard of care procedures including suture removal and evaluation of&#xD;
      surgical site will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research, information regarding bleeding, presence of infection, bruising, and/or other&#xD;
      complications will be collected. Each subject will complete a survey to evaluate the level of&#xD;
      pain/discomfort, bleeding, and swelling following the surgical procedure for each side - each&#xD;
      classified on a VAS scale from zero to ten. In addition, the subject will return his or her&#xD;
      completed medication log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (21±3 days after procedure): Post-operative Follow-up (Approximately 20 mins)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history will be reviewed as standard of care. Eligibility and subject withdrawal&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject still qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have a post-operative visit, which is standard practice at TUSDM&#xD;
      periodontology clinic. Standard of care procedures including suture removal and evaluation of&#xD;
      surgical site will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For research, information regarding bleeding, presence of infection, bruising, and/or other&#xD;
      complications will be collected. Each subject will complete a survey to evaluate the level of&#xD;
      pain/discomfort, bleeding, and swelling following the surgical procedure for each side - each&#xD;
      classified on a VAS scale from zero to ten.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits during the six month post-operative period of the vertical ridge&#xD;
      augmentation surgery will be scheduled. Standard of care procedures and evaluations will be&#xD;
      completed during follow-up visits. The surgical sites will be evaluated after the vertical&#xD;
      ridge augmentation procedures, in order to assess the presence of postoperative&#xD;
      complications, such as the exposure of a d-PTFE membrane or Ti-mesh, infection, swelling,&#xD;
      paresthesia or any other complications. All will be noted in the subject's axiUm record and&#xD;
      reviewed at the time of Visit 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 (6±1 months after Visit 4): Evaluation visit (Approximately 20 mins) Medical history&#xD;
      will be reviewed as standard of care. Eligibility and subject withdrawal criteria will be&#xD;
      reviewed to ensure the subject still qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical sites will be evaluated and the subject's axiUm record will be reviewed for any&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will complete a survey to evaluate the level of pain/discomfort, bleeding, and&#xD;
      swelling following the surgical procedure for each side - each classified on a VAS scale from&#xD;
      zero to ten, as at Visit 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs will be taken. It is standard of care to have radiographs taken prior to implant&#xD;
      placement. The post-operative (after the vertical GBR augmentation procedure) height of the&#xD;
      bony crest will be evaluated on the radiographs taken as part of standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 6 (Up to 1 month after Visit 5): Bone core harvesting, implant placement visit&#xD;
      (Approximately 120 mins) Medical history will be reviewed as standard of care. Eligibility&#xD;
      and subject withdrawal criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject still qualifies for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will present for their regularly scheduled implant placement. The following steps&#xD;
      will be performed following standard of care procedures: local anesthesia, muco-periosteal&#xD;
      incision, full thickness flap reflection, membrane (Ti-mesh/d-PTFE) removal, clinical&#xD;
      measurements, tenting screws removal, bone core harvesting, implant osteotomy, implant&#xD;
      placement, and sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intrasurgical clinical measurements of the ridge height will be taken at during implant&#xD;
      placement surgery. The distance between the top of the tenting screw and bone crest will be&#xD;
      measured with a periodontal probe during the procedure. The bone height gain will be&#xD;
      calculated by subtracting the second measurement form the first measurement (taken during&#xD;
      initial surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the implant placement a bone core will be harvested from each site of the&#xD;
      implant locations for histological analysis. For the bone samples in this study, a hollow&#xD;
      (trephine) bur, rather than solid bur, will be used to allow for sampling. A trephine bur&#xD;
      with 3-4 mm diameter will be used. The core size will not exceed the amount of bone removal&#xD;
      required for designated implants. Removal of bone is standard during implant placement in&#xD;
      order to create space for the fixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone core biopsies will be placed in fixative and labeled with subject ID. The collected&#xD;
      bone samples will be placed in alcohol for storage and stored in a basic science laboratory&#xD;
      DHS-635.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implant placement will not be considered a part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Visit 6 - Laboratory analysis of bone core sample Histological slides will be prepared&#xD;
      and histomorphometric analysis will be performed by the commercial laboratory (CBSET). The&#xD;
      samples will be coded as subject numbers and histological analysis will be blinded. All&#xD;
      collected bone core samples will be shipped to the laboratory (CBSET) by Yumi Ogata (PI) or&#xD;
      Yong Hur (Co-I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histomorphometric measurements of the tissue fractions (DBBM, autogenous bone, newly formed&#xD;
      bone and marrow and/or connective tissue) will be performed for the grafted area. The&#xD;
      sections will be digitally photographed with computerized software.&#xD;
