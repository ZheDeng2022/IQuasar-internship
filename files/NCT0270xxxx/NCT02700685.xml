      This double blind, randomised controlled trial examines the effect of a commercially&#xD;
      available nutritional supplement on behaviour of ADHD patients, as well as on their physical&#xD;
      and psychiatric co-morbidities, and level of oxidative stress and immune activity, as&#xD;
      compared to placebo and standard pharmaceutical treatment for ADHD.&#xD;
