      This study involves a randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth)-enhanced physical activity (PA) intervention to&#xD;
      increase daily bout-related and total moderate-intensity PA and to reduce sedentary behavior&#xD;
      (SB) in non-physically impaired patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
      (TIA).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke recently declined from the third to the fifth leading cause of death in the United&#xD;
      States. However, Stroke remains the leading cause of long-term disability and is among the&#xD;
      most expensive chronic diseases, costing the US approximately 34 billion dollars per year.&#xD;
      The decrease in stroke-related mortality has led to an increase in stroke survivors, and it&#xD;
      is estimated that the overall prevalence will increase by 25% by 2030 to a record 11 million&#xD;
      stroke survivors. Importantly, two-thirds of the nearly one million Americans experiencing&#xD;
      ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) will regain functional independence. In&#xD;
      these patients, engagement in habitual purposeful physical activity (PA) is a powerful means&#xD;
      of secondary stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Habitual PA can improve several other important health indicators in stroke survivors,&#xD;
      including cardiorespiratory fitness, functional independence, gait stability, overall&#xD;
      vascular health, and cognition, while also reducing the risk for falls, cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disease, and adverse recurrent events. Consequently, the American Heart Association/American&#xD;
      Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommends patients who have survived a stroke and regained&#xD;
      functional independence both increase PA and reduce sedentary behaviors (SB). However, these&#xD;
      recommendations are not always prescribed, and when they are prescribed, patient compliance&#xD;
      is often poor. Recent research involving the use of objective PA monitors shows that stroke&#xD;
      survivors are significantly less active than controls and maintain a high level of SB&#xD;
      one-year after discharge, regardless of functional capacity. This is especially problematic&#xD;
      given that patients who engage in low PA and high SB levels after stroke experience&#xD;
      cardiovascular deconditioning, worsening PA intolerance, and additional disability,&#xD;
      ultimately increasing risk for recurrent events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several barriers may account for low PA and high SB levels in stroke survivors. Many avoid&#xD;
      engaging in PA due to fear of falling or triggering a recurrent event. However, the risk of&#xD;
      inactivity in this regard is far greater than any risks associated with adopting habitual PA.&#xD;
      Other barriers may include post-stroke fatigue, depression, lack of interest, or motivation,&#xD;
      negative beliefs towards PA, and lack of support for PA behavior change. Despite the obvious&#xD;
      need for behavioral interventions to assist stroke survivors in overcoming barriers to&#xD;
      adoption and maintenance of habitual PA, there have been relatively few. Most interventions&#xD;
      to date have only included intensive and costly supervised exercise components and have not&#xD;
      included instruction in standard PA behavior change strategies (e.g., self-monitoring,&#xD;
      goal-setting, reinforcement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent advent of commercially available mobile health (mHealth) technologies that&#xD;
      automatically monitor and provide feedback on time spent in PA and SB (i.e., fitness/activity&#xD;
      trackers) provide a potentially powerful means to enhance the efficacy and reach of&#xD;
      interventions targeting stroke survivors. While a recent randomized controlled trial showed&#xD;
      that providing a similar fitness/activity tracker in combination with a single in-person goal&#xD;
      setting/counseling session and related printed behavior change materials was more effective&#xD;
      than a pedometer and printed materials for increasing both daily moderate-to-vigorous PA&#xD;
      (MVPA) and steps in older overweight women, the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy to&#xD;
      this approach in post-stroke and TIA patients is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project involves a randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a mHealth-enhanced PA intervention to increase&#xD;
      daily bout-related (≥10-minute bouts) and total (≥1-minute bouts) moderate-intensity PA (MPA)&#xD;
      and decrease daily SB in 70 non-physically impaired patients with ischemic stroke or TIA.&#xD;
      After visiting the Weight Control Diabetes Research Center (WCDRC) and completing a baseline&#xD;
      assessment that includes wearing a multi-sensor armband for 7 days to monitor daily MPA and&#xD;
      SB, participants will be randomized to 12 weeks of either: mHealth-enhanced PA intervention&#xD;
      (Tech-PAI; n=35) or a standard PA intervention (PAI; n=35), which will serve as an active&#xD;
      control group. Participants assigned to Tech-PAI will receive 2 face-to-face&#xD;
      goal-setting/counseling sessions (one at baseline to set individualized goals using data&#xD;
      observed on the baseline armband monitor) for the first 6 weeks of the intervention and the&#xD;
      other at the mid-intervention point (i.e. to evaluate progress and refine individualized&#xD;
      goals), a fitness/activity tracker and access to the accompanying website to monitor and&#xD;
      observe their progress towards set goals, weekly online skills training videos (during weeks&#xD;
      1-6) to help change PA and SB behaviors, and weekly e-mail feedback from research staff on&#xD;
      their progress towards goals (during weeks 1-12). Participants assigned to PAI will also&#xD;
      receive two face-to-face PA goal-setting counseling sessions, a pedometer, and printed&#xD;
      materials to assist with recording and increasing MPA and steps. Participants in both groups&#xD;
      will wear the multi-sensor armband monitor again for 7 days both at mid-intervention (end of&#xD;
      week 6) and post-intervention (end of week 12). The Tech-PAI and PAI groups will be compared&#xD;
      on changes in daily time spent in MPA and SB from baseline at mid- and post-intervention. At&#xD;
      these same time points, the groups will be compared on changes in performance-based measures&#xD;
      of cardiorespiratory/physical and cognitive function; questionnaire-based assessments of&#xD;
      stroke-specific impact and quality of life and PA-related attitudes and beliefs; and blood&#xD;
      pressure and inflammation (i.e. C-reactive protein levels collected via blood samples).&#xD;
      Finally, the acceptability of the Tech-PAI will be examined as indicated by fitness tracker&#xD;
      and related website usage patterns, completion of online skills training sessions, and&#xD;
      participant satisfaction ratings.&#xD;

    <description>Tech-PAI participants will be given 3 goals: 1) to increase their average baseline daily walking exercise by 30 minutes at week 12; 2) to increase their average baseline daily steps by 4,000 at week 12; and 3) to get up and walk for at least 2 minutes after every 60 minutes of sitting. Participants will receive instruction on how to gradually and safely increase their bout-related walking exercise and steps over the 12 week period. In addition to goal setting, Tech-PAI participants will receive a commercially available activity tracker and accompanying that provides real-time monitoring of steps, activity minutes, and issues a text-based prompt after 60 minutes of sitting to get up and move. Also, participants will receive a weekly e-mail feedback message from research staff on goal progress and will be asked to view weekly Internet-based video lessons that will provide behavioral strategies to increase MPA and steps and decrease SB during the first 6 weeks of the intervention period.</description>
