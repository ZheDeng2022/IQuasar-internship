  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single center, two-part, randomized, open label, cross-over study. Part 1&#xD;
      of this study will evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of GSK525762 when administered&#xD;
      alone and when co-administered following repeat dosing of itraconazole, a known strong&#xD;
      inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and a Para-glycoprotein (Pgp) inhibitor. Part 1&#xD;
      will consist of 2 Cohorts with preliminary PK and safety data obtained from Cohort 1&#xD;
      informing Cohort 2. Part 2 (one Cohort) of the study will evaluate the PK, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of GSK525762 when administered alone and when co-administered following repeat&#xD;
      dosing of rifampicin, a known potent inducer of CYP3A4. In vitro inhibition data indicate&#xD;
      CYP3A4 may be the major route of clearance for GSK525762 and co-administration of drug&#xD;
      therapies which modulate CYP3A4 (i.e.CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers) is likely to alter the&#xD;
      exposure of GSK525762 (i.e. increase or decrease exposure, respectively). The data generated&#xD;
      from this current study to justify exclusion criteria on concomitant medications which affect&#xD;
      CYP3A4 or Pgp and also inform potential dose modification in case of co-administration with&#xD;
      medication affecting CYP3A4 activity. All subjects will undergo a screening visit within 28&#xD;
      days of the first dose of study drug followed by one treatment period and a follow-up visit&#xD;
      7-10 days after the last dose of GSK525762. Subjects in Part 1 will participate in the study&#xD;
      for up to 45 days and subjects in Part 2 will participate for up to 56 days.&#xD;
