      For women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, lumpectomy followed by radiation is a&#xD;
      common treatment option. Radiation treatment is typically delivered to the whole breast, five&#xD;
      times per week, for anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks. The radiation helps kill any cancer cells&#xD;
      that may have been left over following the surgery but causes skin burns. Many studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that radiation to the whole breast is not necessary, that it can be delivered to&#xD;
      a portion of the breast where the cancer is more likely to recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technique called a Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) involving the implantation of&#xD;
      radioactive seeds has been developed to deliver the radiation to a portion of the breast. The&#xD;
      procedure is performed on an out-patient basis under local anesthesia and light sedation.&#xD;
      Because the radioactive seeds are permanently implanted in the breast, the patient is able to&#xD;
      live a normal life while the seeds deliver the prescribed radiation to the breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies on PBSI demonstrate that it is a safe and effective alternative form of&#xD;
      radiation for appropriately selected patients after lumpectomy. However, those results have&#xD;
      been obtained mainly from a single institution, with only 4 patients treated in another&#xD;
      center. Further research is still needed to evaluate its safety in a multi-center setting.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to ensure the appropriate training of clinicians who will be&#xD;
      performing this procedure and to capture long term outcomes and rare complications if any.&#xD;

      Because the radioactive seeds are permanently implanted in the breast, the patient is able to&#xD;

&#xD;
      Previous studies on Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) demonstrate that it is a safe and&#xD;
      effective alternative form of radiation for appropriately selected patients after lumpectomy.&#xD;
      However, those results have been obtained mainly from a single institution, with only 4&#xD;
      patients treated in another center. Further research is still needed to evaluate its safety&#xD;
      in a multi-center setting. The purpose of this study is to ensure the appropriate training of&#xD;
      clinicians who will be performing this procedure and to capture long term outcomes and rare&#xD;
      complications if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the wide-spread use of mammography, breast cancer is commonly diagnosed at an early&#xD;
      stage. The standard treatment for early-stage disease is breast conserving surgery followed&#xD;
      by adjuvant radiation therapy to the whole breast. This approach leads to low recurrence&#xD;
      rates with a good cosmesis and provides an effective alternative to mastectomy. However, half&#xD;
      of these women will develop significant acute skin toxicity following whole breast&#xD;
      irradiation. These reactions occur more frequently in the infra-mammary fold, are associated&#xD;
      with pain, and are associated with a reduction in health-related quality of life. Whole&#xD;
      breast radiotherapy involves several daily treatments delivered over a period of 3 to 7 weeks&#xD;
      which can be disruptive for the patient's life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these drawbacks, the concept of accelerated partial breast irradiation was&#xD;
      proposed. It arose out of the realization that the majority of tumor recurrences occur at or&#xD;
      near the region of the prior lumpectomy site, suggesting that for well selected patients only&#xD;
      the breast tissue surrounding the tumor bed might need radiation treatment. Accelerated&#xD;
      partial breast irradiation limits the radiation to a smaller portion of the breast&#xD;
      (surrounding the tumor cavity) and has the advantages of reducing radiation-induced toxicity&#xD;
      at increased convenience because it is delivered within a much shorter period of time. In&#xD;
      reducing the volume of breast treated, a higher dose of radiation can be delivered in each&#xD;
      treatment session. Accelerated partial breast irradiation advantages include a reduction of&#xD;
      the amount of irradiated skin and therefore the possibility to reduce radiation-induced skin&#xD;
      toxicity, and an increased convenience because it can be accelerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several accelerated partial breast irradiation techniques have been reported including&#xD;
      external beam conformal irradiation, intra-operative radiotherapy and brachytherapy&#xD;
      techniques. Brachytherapy has been the most widely evaluated accelerated partial breast&#xD;
      irradiation technique. It involves the insertion of radioactive material directly into the&#xD;
      surgical cavity using tubes or catheters. Treatments are generally delivered as an outpatient&#xD;
      procedure using high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, delivering multiple treatments (8 to 10)&#xD;
      over a period of 5 to 8 days. Intra-operative radiotherapy is delivered in a single session&#xD;
      at the time of initial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) technique of partial breast irradiation using&#xD;
      palladium (103Pd) seeds has been proposed. Similar to a permanent seed implant used to treat&#xD;
      prostate cancer, permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) involves the insertion of stranded&#xD;
      radioactive seeds under ultra-sound guidance. The advantages of the permanent breast seed&#xD;
      implant (PBSI) technique over other brachytherapy techniques include: i/- it is an&#xD;
      out-patient procedure performed in a single one-hour session under local anesthesia and light&#xD;
      sedation; ii/- it is performed after the surgery when the final pathology report is available&#xD;
      and the scar is completely healed; and iii/- the use of a low dose rate technique presents&#xD;
      the possible advantage to be more efficient and better tolerated compared to high dose rate&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local recurrence rate, immediate and delayed toxicity, the radiation safety and quality&#xD;
      assurance data suggest that permanent breast seed implant (PBSI) is a safe and acceptable&#xD;
      option of accelerated partial breast irradiation, capable of delivering the right amount of&#xD;
      dose in the right location for selected early stage breast cancer. However, those results&#xD;
      have been obtained mainly from a single institution, with 4 patients treated in another&#xD;
      center. Further research is still needed to evaluate its safety in a multi-center setting and&#xD;
      also to detect serious adverse events when a larger number of patients are treated by a&#xD;
      larger group of practitioners. Since brachytherapy is operator dependent, a registry&#xD;
      represents a unique opportunity to ensure the appropriate training of radiation oncologist&#xD;
      and to capture capturing long terms outcomes.&#xD;
