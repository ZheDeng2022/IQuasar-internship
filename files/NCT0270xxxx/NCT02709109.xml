    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 28 days post last administration of study drug (up to 112 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs included abnormal clinically significant findings for spirometry, clinical laboratory parameters, standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs and ophthalmologic examinations. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 112 days (up to 28 days after last dose) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in one second, after full inspiration. Study Baseline was defined as the most recent non-missing measurement before the first dose of inhaled study drug in the study. Day 28 measurements after treatment discontinuation from the treatment period in which discontinuation occurred were included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Safety and Tolerability as Assessed by Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious TEAEs</title>
        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AEs included abnormal clinically significant findings for spirometry, clinical laboratory parameters, standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs and ophthalmologic examinations. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 112 days (up to 28 days after last dose) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs.</description>
