  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The last decade has seen progressive advances in RT delivery, such as intensity modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (IMRT)and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), which now allow highly&#xD;
      precise radiation dose delivery. Together, IMRT and IGRT offer the potential of more&#xD;
      selective treatment of the primary tumour and surrounding neck nodes by reducing the dose&#xD;
      inflicted on critical organs at risk without compromising tumour dose and. IMRT has been&#xD;
      shown to significantly decrease radiation-induced toxicity, and is now considered standard&#xD;
      treatment for H&amp;N tumors. With these advances in delivery technology, the accurate definition&#xD;
      of the target is emerging as the weakest link in the radiotherapeutic treatment chain.&#xD;
      Accurate target definition is the primary link on which all subsequent treatment planning and&#xD;
      delivery depend and is therefore critical for successful RT. Incorrect target definition can&#xD;
      result in poorer outcomes through either less tumour control, more normal tissue toxicity, or&#xD;
      both. Computed x-ray tomography (CT) is the standard volumetric imaging modality for RT&#xD;
      because of its high resolution, accurate definition of anatomy and its intrinsic measure of&#xD;
      electron density necessary for accurate dose calculation. However, its ability to distinguish&#xD;
      between tumour and normal tissue is limited due to a lack of contrast for structures of&#xD;
      similar electron density and image artifacts for objects of high density. This additional&#xD;
      noise can result in large inter-observation variability. Disease visible on endoscopy can be&#xD;
      contoured and registered to the planning CT, allowing inclusion of superficial disease&#xD;
      invisible on the volumetric CT image dataset into the treatment plan.&#xD;
