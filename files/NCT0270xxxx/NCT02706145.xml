      The project will utilize a quasi-experimental design to examine the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      community-level, three-year social norming campaign aimed at changing norms of violence among&#xD;
      youth 10-24, with West Louisville (WL) as the intervention community and East Nashville,&#xD;
      Tennessee as the control community. The project will address the following research questions&#xD;
      (RQs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ1: To what extent is a social norming campaign effective in changing the descriptive and&#xD;
      injunctive norms of violence among youth in WL?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ2: To what extent are the descriptive and injunctive norms of violence among youth in WL&#xD;
      related to violent behavior (by type)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ3: To what extent is a social norming campaign effective in reducing population rates of&#xD;
      youth violence in WL?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ4: Which forms of media are most effective in reaching youth of different ages with&#xD;
      campaign messages?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ5: How is community readiness related to implementation of a community-level social norming&#xD;
      campaign?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ6: How is community capacity related to implementation of a community-level social norming&#xD;
      campaign?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ7: How does community capacity to address youth violence change over time with the&#xD;
      implementation of a community-level social norming campaign?&#xD;
&#xD;
      RQ8: To what extent is a social norming campaign cost-effective in reducing incidents of&#xD;
      serious violence among youth?&#xD;

      The Center of Excellence in Youth Violence Prevention at the University of Louisville (UofL)&#xD;
      School of Public Health &amp; Information Sciences capitalizes on a specific window of&#xD;
      opportunity-where there is currently alignment of a public consciousness of the issue of&#xD;
      youth violence, the availability of expertise to implement a feasible intervention, and&#xD;
      substantial political will across community sectors to address the issue. This provides an&#xD;
      ideal context for the creation of the UofL Center for Youth Violence Prevention, allowing us&#xD;
      to partner with residents and organizations in West Louisville (WL) to develop, implement,&#xD;
      and evaluate a community-level intervention to reduce youth violence. To this end, we plan to&#xD;
      achieve five specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Strengthen the infrastructure to support youth violence prevention research and&#xD;
      practice at the University of Louisville.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Develop, implement and evaluate a community-level social norming campaign to change&#xD;
      the norms of violence among youth in West Louisville using mass and social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Document the development and implementation of the social norming campaign to improve&#xD;
      replication and scalability in other settings or communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: Evaluate the relationship between community readiness, community capacity, and the&#xD;
      implementation of the community-level social norming campaign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 5: Facilitate knowledge translation and dissemination initiatives to relevant audiences&#xD;
      (i.e., community, local organizations and leaders, youth violence prevention researchers and&#xD;
      practitioners, academic peers, and policy-makers) that produce actionable community- and&#xD;
      policy-level approaches.&#xD;
