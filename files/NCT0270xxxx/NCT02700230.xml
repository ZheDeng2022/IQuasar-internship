    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of a vaccine therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that cannot be removed by&#xD;
      surgery (unresectable) or has come back after a period of improvement (recurrent). Vaccines&#xD;
      made from a gene-modified virus may kill tumor cells expressing a gene called neurofibromin 1&#xD;
      (NF1) without affecting surrounding normal cells and may also help the body build an&#xD;
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of an&#xD;
      Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineered to express neurofibromatosis type 1&#xD;
      (NIS) (oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter [MV-NIS]) in&#xD;
      patients with inoperable or recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-NIS in patients&#xD;
      with inoperable recurrent MPNST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To preliminarily assess antitumor efficacy of intratumoral MV-NIS administration by the&#xD;
      rate of progression-free survival at 3 months, achieved by following radiographic response of&#xD;
      the treated lesion using World Health Organization (WHO) response criteria guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and&#xD;
      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS&#xD;
      using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following&#xD;
      intratumoral administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. IV. To assess&#xD;
      the quality-of-life of patients treated with MV-NIS, using two inventories (Pain and&#xD;
      Fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess time to progression and differences in growth rates between treated and&#xD;
      untreated tumor lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To assess the overall survival time of patients treated with MV-NIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive MV-NIS intratumorally on day 1. Patients also undergo SPECT/CT at baseline&#xD;
      and at 3 and 8 days after MV-NIS. Patients may also undergo SPECT/CT at 15 and 28 days, and&#xD;
      at 6 weeks based on whether there is uptake on prior imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
