  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-blind randomized cross over design trial that will compare&#xD;
      the impact of intra-nasal naloxone vs. intra-nasal saline administration during experimental&#xD;
      hypoglycemia on day one on responses to experimental hypoglycemia on day two. Investigators&#xD;
      intend to enroll 18 individuals to obtain the complete data sets from 15 participants.&#xD;
      Expected duration of subject participation is 10-12 weeks. This study will consist of two&#xD;
      2-day intervention visits separated by approximately 8 weeks.&#xD;

      This is a single center, single-blinded randomized cross over design trial, that will compare&#xD;
      the impact of IN naloxone vs. IN saline during experimental hypoglycemia on day one on the&#xD;
      responses to experimental hypoglycemia on day two. 18 participants will be studied twice, 8&#xD;
      weeks apart. On each occasion participants will undergo a 2 hour hypoglycemic clamp (target&#xD;
      50 mg/dl) in the morning and in the afternoon on day one and then again on the morning of day&#xD;
      2. During the morning clamps, samples will be collected for later measurement of serum&#xD;
      epinephrine, glucagon and cortisol levels and participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      hypoglycemia symptom questionnaire. 3 intranasal doses (4 mg each) of naloxone hydrochloride&#xD;
      or IN saline will be administered to the subject on day 1. Plasma will be collected for&#xD;
      measurement of naloxone concentrations on day 1 primary outcome is the difference in peak&#xD;
      epinephrine secretion during the morning episodes of hypoglycemia on days one and two, thus&#xD;
      each participant will have two observations: one from their naloxone experiment and one from&#xD;
      their saline experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint will be naloxone pharmacokinetics including maximum concentration (Cmax),&#xD;
      time to maximum concentration (Tmax) and area under the curve (AUC)&#xD;
