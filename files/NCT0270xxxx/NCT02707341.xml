      The primary objective of the Corrona Psoriasis Registry is to study the comparative safety of&#xD;
      approved psoriasis therapies in a North American cohort of psoriasis subjects treated by&#xD;
      dermatologists. This includes assessing the incidence and nature of adverse events of special&#xD;
      interest, including malignancy, in a real world population of psoriasis patients on new&#xD;
      biologic therapies (e.g. secukinumab). Secondary objectives include analyzing the&#xD;
      epidemiology and natural history of the disease, comorbidities, current treatment practices,&#xD;
      and comparative effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the operating procedures established by the Corrona Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)&#xD;
      Registry, the Psoriasis Registry will use a parallel structure based on a design and strategy&#xD;
      developed by Corrona, LLC. This registry will be cooperatively managed by scientific,&#xD;
      operational, and quality leaders at Corrona and medical leaders appointed by the National&#xD;
      Psoriasis Foundation (NPF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators may enroll patients who have started on or switched to a systemic agent for&#xD;
      psoriasis within the previous twelve months. Currently approved subcutaneous biologics are&#xD;
      indicated for adult patients with chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are&#xD;
      candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. The currently approved intravenous biologic&#xD;
      agent is indicated for adult patients with chronic severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates&#xD;
      for systemic therapy, and when other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate. All&#xD;
      patients will receive standard of care treatments prescribed by the investigator, in&#xD;
      accordance with the FDA-approved drug labeling, and all treatment decisions are the sole&#xD;
      responsibility of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at approximately 200 sites across North America. Sites are&#xD;
      assessed and selected through interviews with potential investigators and a corresponding&#xD;
      site feasibility survey that includes information on the investigator's qualifications,&#xD;
      previous research experience, and the availability of support staff, sub-investigators, and&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Corrona Psoriasis Registry is a longitudinal, observational study; therefore, the&#xD;
      duration is indefinite with no pre-determined stop date. The enrollment period is estimated&#xD;
      to take approximately four years, and subjects will be followed for a minimum of eight years&#xD;
      beginning from the time the subject is enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a prospective, multicenter, observational registry for subjects with psoriasis.&#xD;
      Longitudinal follow-up data is obtained via Corrona Questionnaires completed by both subjects&#xD;
      and their treating dermatologists (also known as &quot;Providers&quot; for a Corrona registry study)&#xD;
      every 6 months (+/- 30 days). The registry is designed to collect data on patient&#xD;
      demographics, smoking history, disease duration, disease severity, disease activity, history&#xD;
      of prior psoriasis treatment, comorbidities, hospitalizations, adverse events of special&#xD;
      interest, medication use, and laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry is linked to external data sources including the Centers for Disease Control's&#xD;
      National Death Index (NDI), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and other&#xD;
      administrative data sources to support drug safety monitoring and other research activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse events that are spontaneously volunteered by the subject or discovered as a&#xD;
      result of general questioning by the investigator should be recorded on the Provider&#xD;
      Follow-up Questionnaire for that visit.&#xD;

        Patients are enrolled in the Psoriasis Registry during regularly-scheduled office visits.&#xD;
        Selected dermatologists are invited to participate as investigators in the Registry.&#xD;
        Physicians are selected carefully in an effort to ensure enrollment of subjects that&#xD;
        represent a reasonable representation of a cross-section of the population throughout North&#xD;
        America with Psoriasis. All potential sites are screened for clinical research experience&#xD;
        and adherence to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.&#xD;

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA∗ To be eligible for enrollment into the Corrona Psoriasis Registry, a&#xD;
        patient must satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
        listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patient must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have been diagnosed with psoriasis by a dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Be at least 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be willing and able to provide written consent for participation in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be willing and able to provide Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that includes&#xD;
             the following types of personal information at a minimum: 1) Full Name and 2) Date of&#xD;
             Birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Meet one of the following criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have started on or switched to a systemic psoriasis treatment within the previous 12&#xD;
        months†▲:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Eligible medications± for enrollment include the FDA-approved biologic and biosimilar&#xD;
             treatments for psoriasis (adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab Biosimilar, brodalumab&#xD;
             (Siliq), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept Biosimilar,&#xD;
             guselkumab (Tremfya), infliximab (Remicade), infliximab Biosimilar, ixekizumab&#xD;
             (Taltz), risankizumab (Skyrizi), secukinumab (Cosentyx), tildrakizumab (Ilumya), and&#xD;
             ustekinumab (Stelara) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eligible medications for enrollment include apremilast, methotrexate, cyclosporine and&#xD;
             acitretin. If enrolling on one of these medications the patient must also be&#xD;
             biologic-naïve.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patient is participating in or planning to participate in a double-blind randomized&#xD;
             of a psoriasis drug. Of note, concurrent participation in another observational&#xD;
             registry or open-label Phase 3b/4 trial is not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             EARLY Follow-Up Visit Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A registry Follow-Up Visit should be conducted whenever a patient is prescribed or&#xD;
             starts a new eligible medication (FDA-approved biologic and biosimilar treatments for&#xD;
             psoriasis) that has not been used in the previous 12 months, regardless of when the&#xD;
             last registry visit submission was made.Ω&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Past use of an Eligible Medication does not exclude a patient from an Early&#xD;
                  Follow-Up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The next anticipated visit that registry CRFs should be completed is then&#xD;
                  calculated from the Early Follow-Up Visit date (≥ 150 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Follow-Up Visit Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Registry Follow-Up data collection should be done at the time of routine clinical&#xD;
             encounters approximately every 6 months. Routine or standard of care clinical&#xD;
             encounters may occur between two Corrona visits, but the data collected in the&#xD;
             Follow-Up CRFs should cover the time period since the last Corrona visit. For planning&#xD;
             purposes, each subsequent Follow-Up Visit is anchored to the date of the last eligible&#xD;
             Corrona visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A Follow-Up Visit is eligible for payment as long as 150 days have passed since the&#xD;
             last visit submission. A Follow-Up Visit is not eligible for payment if conducted less&#xD;
             than 150 days since the last registry visits except when the &quot;Early&quot; Follow-Up Visit&#xD;
             criteria is satisfied.&#xD;
&#xD;
             † If a potential subject is being prescribed an eligible systemic psoriasis treatment&#xD;
             on the day of the Enrollment Visit, the subject is eligible for enrollment into the&#xD;
             registry the same day. If a subject is prescribed an eligible medication at the&#xD;
             enrollment visit, in order for the subject to remain in the registry, one of the&#xD;
             following conditions must be met at the time of the first registry follow-up visit or&#xD;
             within 6 months (180 days) of the enrollment visit, or which occurs first:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1) The eligible medication was started; OR 2) Another eligible medication was started&#xD;
             that has not been used in the previous 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a patient has experienced an interruption in treatment of an eligible&#xD;
                  medication in the 12 months after initiation, in order for the patient to be&#xD;
                  eligible for enrollment the following two conditions must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. The interruption in treatment lasted &lt;180 days; AND&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. No other systemic psoriasis medications were initiated during the time&#xD;
                       period when the eligible medication was not in use.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       If both conditions are not met, the patient is ineligible for enrollment&#xD;
                       based on the interrupted eligible medication. In order for the patient to be&#xD;
                       eligible for enrollment by this medication, they would need to be off the&#xD;
                       drug for at least 12 months prior to restarting therapy and enrolled within&#xD;
                       12 months from the time they restart the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  An enrollment cap is placed on each TNF-inhibitor (Humira, Enbrel,&#xD;
                            Remicade, Cimzia) and Stelara at 150 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       NOTE: Corrona will monitor annual enrollment for each TNF-inhibitor and&#xD;
                       Stelara and provide updates as needed. The cap is for the overall registry.&#xD;
                       Biosimilars will not count toward the originator biologic&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Once clinical trial participation has ended, a patient is permitted to&#xD;
                            enroll in the registry if they satisfy the eligibility requirements. If&#xD;
                            exited from the registry for the exclusion, the patient is not&#xD;
                            permitted to re-enroll once their clinical trial participation ends. Ω&#xD;
                            Only one (1) early Follow-Up Visit is allowed for each new eligible&#xD;
                            medication initiated during long-term follow-up. This means that the&#xD;
                            early registry visit can either be conducted on the day the patient is&#xD;
                            prescribed the new medication or on the day the drug is started (i.e.&#xD;
                            when the first does is received).&#xD;
&#xD;
                              -  These criteria are subject to change with the needs of the&#xD;
                                 registry at the sole discretion of the Sponsor (Corrona).&#xD;
