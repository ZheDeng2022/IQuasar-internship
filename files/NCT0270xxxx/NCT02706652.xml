  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People's genetic markers and other genetic characteristics can affect their response to drug&#xD;
      therapy. Researchers want to screen people for these markers and characteristics. They want&#xD;
      to do this before the people are screened for studies at the National Cancer Institute. That&#xD;
      should save time that can be lost when people go through the whole screening for a study only&#xD;
      to find out they cannot join. The data collected may also be used to select the proper dose&#xD;
      of anticancer agents that are being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To screen people for genetic markers and/or baseline characteristics. These will be used to&#xD;
      determine if they can enroll in a clinical trial. They may also be used to select the proper&#xD;
      dose of anticancer agents that are being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 and older who are being considered for or being treated in a National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have their blood drawn for genetic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have a cheek swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants genetic data will be stored for future research. It could be shared with other&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic sequence of drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters/receptors, transcription factors,&#xD;
      drug targets, and patient baseline characteristics often affect an individual s response to&#xD;
      drug therapy. Expression of such genes is also influenced by the epigenome and regulation by&#xD;
      a variety of other factors: RNA expression, protein expression, disease state, comorbidities,&#xD;
      concomitant therapies, etc. Therefore, inter-patient variability in drug pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      outcome is often a function of these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-individual differences in efficacy and toxicity of cancer chemotherapy are especially&#xD;
      important given the narrow therapeutic index of these drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During analysis of investigational agents, inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics, clinical outcome, and toxicity are often noted. Many of these differences&#xD;
      are potentially clinically actionable and depend on the aforementioned markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To screen patients for genomic markers, epigenomic markers, RNA markers, protein markers,&#xD;
      and/or baseline characteristics that are used inform either enrollment in therapeutic&#xD;
      clinical trials or dose selection of investigational anticancer agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals seeking enrollment on National Cancer Institute clinical trials that include&#xD;
      a priori assessment of a patients genome, epigenome, proteome, or baseline characteristics as&#xD;
      eligibility criteria for enrollment or dose selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be used as a screening protocol to enroll patients for a priori screening&#xD;
      that is necessary for inclusion in IRB-approved clinical trials taking place at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the rationale for ascertaining the status of a marker prior to study inclusion will be&#xD;
      presented in the associated clinical trial, the present study will be amended on a&#xD;
      case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accrual ceiling for this study is 900 patients.&#xD;
