  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how weight loss by a very low fat plant-based diet&#xD;
      with an exercise program affects metabolic and cardiovascular health in overweight adults at&#xD;
      high risk for disease. Outcome measures will include assessment of insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      β-cell function, body fat distribution, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue biology,&#xD;
      cardiovascular function, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, immune function, and&#xD;
      the gut microbiome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced energy intake and increased physical activity have profound effects on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic health as assessed by insulin sensitivity, β-cell function, serum lipids,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal fat mass, intrahepatic triglyceride content, and blood pressure, and is the&#xD;
      cornerstone of treatment for people with obesity. However, the specific additional&#xD;
      therapeutic effects of regular exercise in conjunction with diet-induced weight loss are not&#xD;
      clear. In addition, the optimal dietary macronutrient composition needed to reduce&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk is not known. The use of a very low fat, plant-based (PB) diet is&#xD;
      becoming increasingly popular to treat people with obesity and is the only diet therapy that&#xD;
      is reimbursed by Medicare in the treatment of people with coronary heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo nutritional counseling and have supervised exercise training 4 days&#xD;
      per week until 7-10% weight loss is achieved. Meals will be provided and food diaries will be&#xD;
      kept during weight loss. Tests before and after the intervention will include muscular&#xD;
      strength and aerobic fitness, cardiovascular assessments, glucose tolerance tests,&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp test for insulin sensitivity, heavy water metabolism,&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure/metabolic rate, muscle and fat biopsies, body composition scans,&#xD;
      blood tests, and urine and stool collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive characterization of weight&#xD;
      loss induced by using a PB diet with regular exercise in people with MAO, followed by a&#xD;
      comparison of the effects of this study with those from another study that is evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of the same amount of weight loss induced by using a PB diet alone, without exercise.&#xD;
      Specifically, we will evaluate changes in body composition, body fat distribution,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function, muscle strength, the plasma metabolome, insulin sensitivity,&#xD;
      beta-cell function, systemic and adipose tissue inflammation and immune system function,&#xD;
      adipose tissue and muscle cellular metabolic pathways, and the gut microbiome to determine&#xD;
      cellular, multiorgan, and whole-body effects of PB diet alone and PB diet plus exercise.&#xD;
      Accordingly, this study will fill two important gaps in our knowledge that have considerable&#xD;
      physiological and clinical significance; the data from this study will provide: 1) a better&#xD;
      understanding of the effects of a PB diet plus exercise on a series of key outcome measures,&#xD;
      and 2) the potential additional benefit of adding regular exercise to a PB diet.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Weight loss with very low fat plant-based diet and regular exercise</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will lose 7-10% of their body weight while on a calorie-restricted very low fat plant-based (PB) diet and performing exercise 6 days/week (4 sessions/week under direct supervision). The macronutrient composition of the diet is approximately 70% of energy from carbohydrate, 15% from protein, and 15% from fat. Food will be provided in the form of take-out meals and will be picked up by participants during weekly study visits with a weight management dietitian. To promote adherence to the diet and exercise intervention, subjects will participate in a lifestyle intervention program that includes dietary and behavioral education topics. Treatment will be provided in weekly individual or group sessions depending on subject availability. (Note: this is the only intervention for the study; the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp is not an intervention but is the gold standard for evaluating insulin sensitivity, a primary study outcome.)</description>
