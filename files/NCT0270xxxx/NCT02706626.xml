  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this investigational&#xD;
      drug, brigatinib (AP261136) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer Non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have had first-line treatment for their cancer and it still got&#xD;
      worse, even after, or while taking drugs called ALK inhibitors, or anti-cancer drugs that act&#xD;
      on tumors. Some examples of these anti-cancer drugs are: KEYTRUDA® or ALECENSA®).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant population of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) plus Non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      patients exist that have progressed on or who were intolerant of second generation anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase inhibitor (e.g. ceritinib or alectinib). Brigatinib has demonstrated activity&#xD;
      in patients who have progressed on crizotinib, but the activity of brigatinib in patients who&#xD;
      have progressed on ceritinib, alectinib, or other second generation anaplastic lymphoma&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors is unknown. Based on the preclinical data. 3, , brigatinib has activity&#xD;
      against known secondary anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations suggesting it may retain&#xD;
      activity after second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in ARI-AT-002 must have previously received a second generation Anaplastic&#xD;
      lymphoma kinase inhibitor other than brigatinib. We have chosen 20% as a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful response rate that would justify further study of brigatinib in previously treated&#xD;
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase plus disease.&#xD;
