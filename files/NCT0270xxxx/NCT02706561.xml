    <description>The EFD score of &gt;= 24 will be used to indicate &quot;good&quot; erectile function. This is both a face valid cut-off, and a cut off that is commonly used in the literature as &quot;good&quot; erectile function following radical prostatectomy.</description>

    <description>SC + ACT-ED-Group A uses Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). In this group, men focus on: long-term goals of rehabilitation; acceptance of the frustration related to ED; identifying and overcoming barriers; and committing to an erectile rehabilitation program. All participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires (baseline). The participants can complete it using your personal computer, one of MSKCC computers, in-person or over the phone. The questionnaires will take about 45-60 minutes to complete. You will also complete the same set of questionnaires at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following study entry. In both groups, the participant will receive three in-person sessions or phone (30-45 minutes), six brief telephone sessions (5-10 minutes), and six monthly phone calls (5-10 minutes)</description>

    <description>SC + EME-Group B uses enhanced monitoring and education. This group focuses on answering questions about the rehabilitation program, manage technical issues related to injections, and the dose titration of injection medication. Participants in this group will also receive education on the side effects and impact of prostate cancer surgery, and strategies for restarting sexual activity. All participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires (baseline). You can complete it using your personal computer, one of MSKCC computers, in-person or over the phone. The questionnaires will take about 45-60 minutes to complete. The participant will also complete the same set of questionnaires at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months following study entry.
