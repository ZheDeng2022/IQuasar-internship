  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at comparing different perioperative statin regimens for the prevention of&#xD;
      post CABG adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized, prospective clinical trial. Ninety four patients scheduled for&#xD;
      elective, isolated on- or off- pump CABG were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups;&#xD;
      80 mg atorvastatin/day for 2 days preoperatively (N=37), 80 mg atorvastatin/day for 5-9 days&#xD;
      preoperatively (N=28) or 40 mg atorvastatin/day for 5-9 days preoperatively (N=29). The&#xD;
      corresponding preoperative doses were restarted postoperatively (post-op) when patients were&#xD;
      able to take the medication orally and were continued for one month. Cardiac troponin I&#xD;
      (TnI), Creatine Kinase (CK-MB) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assayed preoperatively and&#xD;
      post-operatively at 8, 24, 48 hours, and at discharge. Marker levels were compared among the&#xD;
      three groups. The incidence of post-operative major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular&#xD;
      events (MACCE) was assessed including; 30-day all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation, stroke and&#xD;
      target-vessel revascularization. The incidence of renal or hepatic impairment and&#xD;
      post-operative infections were also assessed. A Quality of life (QoL) questionnaire&#xD;
      (EQ-5D-3L) was administered preoperatively and 1 month after CABG.&#xD;

      This study was conducted at the National Heart Institute (NHI), Cairo, Egypt, during the&#xD;
      period between June 2013 and February 2015. It was approved by the ethics committee at the&#xD;
      Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, and the scientific committee at the NHI. An informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all study participants after they have been approached with the&#xD;
      nature, purpose and possible risks of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative baseline demographic characteristics, preoperative medications, comorbid&#xD;
      conditions and risk factors were identified and summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a randomized, prospective, interventional, open label study. Upon admission&#xD;
      to the NHI, eligible patients were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups; group I&#xD;
      (80 mg atorvastatin/day for 2 days preoperatively), group II (40 mg atorvastatin/day for 5-9&#xD;
      days preoperatively) or group III (80 mg atorvastatin/day for 5-9 days preoperatively).&#xD;
      Atorvastatin doses were reinitiated postoperatively as soon as patients could take the&#xD;
      medication orally and was continued for one month after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following intra-operative data were recorded for each patient; cardiopulmonary bypass&#xD;
      time, aortic clamp time, type of anesthesia, number of grafts and need for blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were drawn preoperatively (baseline) then at 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively and before hospital discharge. Blood samples were spun and sera were&#xD;
      separated, stored according to the storage conditions specified by the manufacturer, and used&#xD;
      to measure the TnI, CK-MB and CRP at the time of analysis. Cardiac TnI was assayed by the&#xD;
      Dimension® TNI method, a homogenous sandwich chemiluminescent assay based on LOCI®&#xD;
      technology, using SIEMENS Dimension® EXL™, LOCI® Module system. Siemens Healthcare&#xD;
      Diagnostics Inc. Newark, USA. CK-MB isoenzyme was measured by the Mass MMB method, a one-step&#xD;
      enzyme immunoassay based on the sandwich principle, using SIEMENS Dimension® Heterogeneous&#xD;
      Immunoassay Module system. Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Newark, USA. CRP was measured&#xD;
      by the C-Reactive Protein Extended Range (RCRP) method, a method based on a particle enhanced&#xD;
      turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) technique, using SIEMENS Dimension® system. Siemens&#xD;
      Healthcare Diagnostics Inc. Newark, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A-12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was performed pre-operatively, in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      (ICU) and upon patient transfer to the ward. The appearance of new Q-waves indicating&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI) or incidence of any arrhythmias was reported. Echocardiography was&#xD;
      performed pre-operatively and post-operatively after ICU discharge to detect any new wall&#xD;
      movement abnormalities as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured end points were as follows: 1) Incidence of post-operative major adverse cardiac and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE) including; 30-days all-cause mortality, MI, AF, ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, debilitating stroke or transient ischemic attack&#xD;
      (TIA) or target-vessel revascularization; 2) renal impairment; 3) hepatic impairment; 4)&#xD;
      postoperative infections; 5) persistent blood glucose abnormalities; 6) length of ICU and&#xD;
      hospital stays, and a health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). HRQoL was assessed using the&#xD;
      Euro Quality of Life 5-Dimensional Classification (EQ-5D-3L) 19 at baseline (preoperatively)&#xD;
      as patients were admitted to the NHI and then one month postoperatively during the follow-up&#xD;
      visit or by contacting the patient via a phone call.&#xD;
