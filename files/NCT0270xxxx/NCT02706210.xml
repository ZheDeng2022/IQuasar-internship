  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is one of the main chronic non-communicable diseases associated with disability,&#xD;
      institutionalization, and mortality among elderly individuals. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and&#xD;
      vascular dementia (VD) are considered to be the main types of dementia. A widely shared view&#xD;
      is that future treatment strategies need to focus on treatment of the earliest stages of the&#xD;
      disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) constitutes an intermediate stage between normal&#xD;
      aging and dementia. Vascular cognitive disorders (VCD) is an umbrella term representing a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of cognitive disorder evoked by or associated with vascular causes. It&#xD;
      encompasses patients suffering from a range of types of cognitive impairment, from mild&#xD;
      impairment to VD. VCD predementia (VCD-P) is at the same stage of MCI. Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is&#xD;
      a subtype of MCI, which is also considered to be the clinical transition stage between normal&#xD;
      aging and AD, and has been applied to detect the emerging dementia. In VCD, infarcts or&#xD;
      profuse white matter disease are considered the cause of cognitive decline. By contrast, AD&#xD;
      is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorders thought to be caused by&#xD;
      amyloid aggregation and the formation of tau tangles. Both VCD-P and aMCI have a deficit in&#xD;
      cognitive domains, and may have the same chief complaints of memory deficit. If it can be&#xD;
      clear which will turn into what type of dementia in patients with cognitive impairment stage,&#xD;
      it can not only make us more early intervention treatment to the patients, but also can save&#xD;
      a lot of social resources and economic costs in clinic. By applying the resting state&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and&#xD;
      diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) multimodal magnetic resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      technology, the project comprehensive analysis comparison of neurodegenerative and blood&#xD;
      vessels of brain function in patients with mild cognitive impairment and structural&#xD;
      abnormalities connection mode. This project in order to reveal the cognitive impairment&#xD;
      disease neural circuits in the development of the network connection and its change rule.&#xD;
      People can further understand the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment, discover new will&#xD;
      provide a scientific basis for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      The investigators use both psychological tests and neuroimage to compare the differences&#xD;
      between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants received a battery of neuropsychological tests to assess general mental&#xD;
      status and other cognitive domains, including visual-spatial ability, executive function,&#xD;
      language, memory, attention, and general intellectual ability. These tests included the CDR&#xD;
      scale, the Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA),&#xD;
      clock drawing test (CDT), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), activities of daily living&#xD;
      scale(ADL) and Hamilton Depression Scale and HIS. All these evaluations were performed by two&#xD;
      attending neurologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were scanned on a 3.0 T Siemens scanner within a single session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant received a magnetization prepared rapidly acquired gradient echo (MPRAGE)&#xD;
      T1-weighted scan (repetition time [TR], 1900 ms; echo time [TE], 2.2 ms; inversion time, 900&#xD;
      ms; matrix, 256×256; number of excitations, 1; thickness, 1 mm; 176 slices) Resting state&#xD;
      functional images were collected using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with the&#xD;
      following parameters: repetition time (TR)= 2000 ms; echo time (TE)=40 ms; flip angle=90°;&#xD;
      number of slices=28; slice thickness=4 mm; gap=1 mm; voxel size=4×4×4 mm3; and matrix=64×64.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to lie quietly in the scanner with their eyes closed during the data&#xD;
      acquisition. This scan lasted for 478 s. For each subject, the first five volumes were&#xD;
      discarded to allow for T1 equilibration effects and the adaptation of the subjects to the&#xD;
      circumstances, leaving 234 images for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diffusion weighted imaging scans were acquired on a 3.0T Siemens Tim Trio MRI scanner.&#xD;
      Three diffusion echo-planar imaging sequence with one zero-weighted image (b =0 s/mm2) and&#xD;
      thirty diffusion sensitizing orientations (b =1000 s/mm2) was used with the following&#xD;
      specifications: slice thickness=2 mm; 90 slices; repetition time = 11000 ms; echo time = 98&#xD;
      ms; voxel size = 2 mm isotropic; flip angle=90°; acquisition matrix = 128 mm×116 mm .&#xD;

    <measure>fractional anisotropy (FA)</measure>

    <description>The diffusion tensor matrix would be generated from a series of diffusion weighted images, then the three eigenvalues or diffusivities, would be calculated by matrix diagonalization. FA represents the degree of anisotropy of the diffusion of water molecules in axons and decreased FA is a frequent correlate of brain tissue injury. It is a DTI parameter without units.</description>

    <measure>axial diffusivity (AxD)</measure>
    <time_frame>about 3-5 years after they had a complaint of cognitive deficit</time_frame>
    <description>AxD represents the water diffusivity parallel to the axonal fibers, and therefore commonly linked to the microstructure of myelin. It is a DTI parameter without units.</description>

    <measure>radial diffusivity (RD)</measure>
    <time_frame>about 3-5 years after they had a complaint of cognitive deficit</time_frame>
    <description>RD components of the diffusion metric provide indices of axonal integrity, measured as longitudinal diffusivity, and myelin integrity. It is a DTI parameter without units.</description>
