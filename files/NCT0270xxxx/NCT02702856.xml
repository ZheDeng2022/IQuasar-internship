      Validate a non-DRE exosome gene expression test, with an NPV &gt;/= 90% certainty, will exclude&#xD;
      the presence of high gleason grade/ score (&gt;/=7) prostate cancer in a prostate needle biopsy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this multi-center clinical study is to determine the association of an Exosome&#xD;
      Urine Test score with the presence of high Gleason grade / score (GS&gt;/=7) prostate cancer on&#xD;
      a prostate needle biopsy and validate the assay's performance characteristics in men&#xD;
      presenting to their urologist with or without a previous negative biopsy, and recommended for&#xD;
      an initial or subsequent biopsy. The results of this study are to support the use of this&#xD;
      assay as a laboratory developed test. A secondary objective is to develop an assay that&#xD;
      accurately predicts the presence of any Gleason grade prostate cancer in men at risk for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Validate various thresholds utilizing the exosome RNA gene signature to stratify patients based on the likelihood of having any Gleason pattern 4 disease present within the biopsy (or when available the prostatectomy specimen surgical pathology report) for first time biopsy patients in the PSA gray zone of 2.0-10 ng/mL. In our earlier cohort analyses and in the literature there is an expected 20-25% of patients who will present with Gleason score &gt;/=7 and the prevalence of a dominant Gleason 4 varies considerably dependent upon studies from 17-30%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male, &gt;50 years of age with a clinical suspicion for prostate cancer based in part on&#xD;
             an elevated PSA (limit range: 2.0 - 20 ng/ mL), and or suspicious DRE, with or without&#xD;
             the clinical history of a single prior negative biopsy, and who have been recommended&#xD;
             for a repeat and or first time biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject must be able to comprehend and sign an approved informed consent form and&#xD;
             other applicable study documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Use of medications or hormones that are known to affect serum PSA levels within 3-6&#xD;
             months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical symptoms of urinary tract infection (including prostatitis) at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of invasive treatments for benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) or lower urinary&#xD;
             track symptoms within 6 months of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Medical history or concurrent illness that the investigator considers sufficiently&#xD;
             serious to interfere with the conduct, completion or results of this trial, or&#xD;
             constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participation in pharmaceutical or treatment related clinical study within 6 months of&#xD;
             study enrollment. Exception: Trials for non-prostate conditions may be acceptable,&#xD;
             with approval by the investigator and Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No known hepatitis (all types) and/or HIV documented in patient's medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with history of concurrent renal/bladder tumors within 6 months of study&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
