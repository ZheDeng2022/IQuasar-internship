  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Bone metastases arise in 50% of all patients dying of cancer, increasing up to 70%&#xD;
      in patients with breast and prostate cancer. The lesions can cause pain and fractures,&#xD;
      leading to diminished quality of life and poorer survival. Current knowledge concerning&#xD;
      adequate, personalized treatment of metastatic lesions of the long bones in patients with&#xD;
      disseminated cancer is insufficient and inconclusive due to lack of large, prospective series&#xD;
      with patient reported outcome measures. One of the debatable issues is the effectiveness of&#xD;
      postoperative radiotherapy. It has become common practise due to professional opinion, but&#xD;
      research evidence is lacking. It is thought that adjuvant radiotherapy improves the&#xD;
      durability of an implant, prevents progression of the lesion, promotes bone healing, improves&#xD;
      limb function, minimises pain and reduces the need for reoperations, however none of these&#xD;
      are certain. Moreover, it is a burden on patient's quality of life (e.g. multiple extra&#xD;
      hospital visits) causing toxicity and possible side effects (e.g. skin irritation). The true&#xD;
      beneficial effect, weighing up the possible pros and certain cons, of adjuvant radiotherapy&#xD;
      is thus unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The PORT study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 'surgery only' compared&#xD;
      to surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy as treatment of impending and actual pathological&#xD;
      fractures on the pain experienced by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A multicentre, prospective, randomised non-inferiority trial nested within the&#xD;
      OPTIMAL study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients with metastases of the long bones undergoing surgery for a(n)&#xD;
      (impending) pathologic fracture in the participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention: One study arm (A) will receive surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy; the&#xD;
      other study arm (B) will receive surgery only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint is patient reported pain according to a&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (NRS). Clinical functioning, radiological status, complications and&#xD;
      survival are secondary endpoints.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The PORT study aims to demonstrate the non-inferiority of 'surgery only' compared to 'surgery&#xD;
      with adjuvant radiotherapy' for the fixation of impending and actual pathological fractures&#xD;
      of the long bones. We hypothesize that patients without post-operative radiotherapy will not&#xD;
      have more pain than those receiving post-operative radiotherapy. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint will be the pain level (as measured by an eleven point numeric rating scale (NRS))&#xD;
      12 weeks after treatment. Pain has been chosen as primary endpoint because it can be&#xD;
      interpreted as a &quot;proxy&quot; for mechanical loosening or other complications. It was undesirable&#xD;
      to select revision surgery as endpoint, because the number of revision surgeries will be very&#xD;
      low in this patient population. A revision will only be performed for serious complications&#xD;
      with large effects on the quality of life. In other cases, conservative options will be&#xD;
      chosen over revision surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are complications, quality of life and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to conduct cost-effectiveness and costs-utility analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicentre, prospective, randomised non-inferiority trial nested within the&#xD;
      OPTIMAL study. The OPTIMAL study is the backbone of the (OPTIMAL-) PORT study, encompassing&#xD;
      the prospective cohort and providing the infrastructure for collection patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures. If patients do not have an indication for surgery, they can only be&#xD;
      included in the OPTIMAL study. If patients have an indication for surgery, they are recruited&#xD;
      for the OPTIMAL-PORT study. However, if patients do not give consent for randomisation for&#xD;
      radiotherapy, they can give partial consent and participate in the prospective cohort and&#xD;
      complete questionnaires. This data will contribute to the OPTIMAL study. Details concerning&#xD;
      the OPTIMAL study are described in the respective protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PORT trial is a non-inferiority trial between ' surgery with post-operative radiotherapy'&#xD;
      (Arm A) with 'surgery only (no post-operative radiotherapy)' (Arm B). A non-inferiority&#xD;
      design is appropriate for this study because we expect that the clinical outcomes with&#xD;
      surgery only are not worse than with post-operative radiotherapy. 'Surgery only' however has&#xD;
      evident advantages, as it will lessen the burden on patients of visiting the hospital,&#xD;
      prevent toxicity and cost less. Furthermore, as mentioned in the introduction, the focus of&#xD;
      treatment is on maintaining and improving quality of life. The goal is to do what is right,&#xD;
      safe, and efficient and not to provide more care than is needed. Rethinking whether we need&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy is part of achieving that goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with (impending) fractures of the long bones due to bone metastases and an&#xD;
      operation indication will be asked to participate in the OPTIMAL cohort and provide patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes. In addition, they will be informed about the PORT trial. Post-operatively,&#xD;
      shortly before discharge from the hospital, they will be asked for informed consent for the&#xD;
      PORT trial by the treating physician or a researcher. This assures a waiting period of 3-7&#xD;
      days between information and consent. Patients are informed that they are free to decide&#xD;
      whether they wish to participate in the trial and will receive written information in&#xD;
      addition to oral information. If patients do not wish to participate in the trial, they will&#xD;
      receive standard care (which is post-operative radiotherapy in most cases). The first&#xD;
      post-operative questionnaire will be sent 4 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: To describe patient characteristics and outcomes, descriptive&#xD;
      statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and proportions) will be used. For univariate&#xD;
      testing, p-values will be one tailed and considered significant if less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is pain response after surgery with or without&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy. This will be expressed in absolute numbers (difference in NRS).&#xD;
      A linear regression model to adjust for patients' characteristics will be used to compare the&#xD;
      difference in mean pain level between the two arms with the centre from which the patient&#xD;
      originates as a random effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of non-inferiority primarily an intention to treat (ITT) will be performed.&#xD;
      However, an ITT analysis is more likely to narrow the difference between treatments in a&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial and yield a non-inferior result, thus a per protocol (PP) analysis is&#xD;
      needed to cross-validate the ITT analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences in the occurrence of complications will be compared by Fisher's exact test or&#xD;
      chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QoL will be analysed using the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22. A comparison will be&#xD;
      made between the baseline QoL and at predefined intervals after treatment (at 4 and 8 weeks,&#xD;
      3, 6 and 12 months following radiotherapy). A change of 10% of the scale width will be&#xD;
      considered a clinically relevant change of QoL (Osoba 2005). The data will be presented as&#xD;
      stable, worsened (≥ 10% decrease in QoL) or improved (≥ 10%increase in QOL). These time&#xD;
      points will be compared using a Chi square test with a conservative p-value of 0.01 to&#xD;
      correct for multiple testing. We will also evaluate the pattern of QoL as a continuous&#xD;
      outcome over time during follow up with the mixed models approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival and progression free survival will be estimated by applying Kaplan-Meier's&#xD;
      methodology analysis. Time to event will be measured from time of treatment to death or to&#xD;
      progression of the disease. Comparisons in outcomes between treatment groups will be&#xD;
      performed by Log Rank test.&#xD;
