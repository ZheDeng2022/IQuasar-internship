    <textblock>
      Rationale: Bone metastases arise in 50% of all patients dying from carcinoma, increasing up&#xD;
      to 70% in patients with breast and prostate cancer. The lesions can cause pain and fractures,&#xD;
      leading to diminished quality of life and poorer survival. Current knowledge concerning&#xD;
      adequate, personalized treatment of metastatic lesions of the long bones in patients with&#xD;
      disseminated cancer is insufficient and inconclusive due to lack of large, prospective series&#xD;
      with patient reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The OPTIMAL cohort aims to describe the quality of life and pain perception of&#xD;
      patients after local treatment (radiotherapy and/or surgery) of metastases of the long bones,&#xD;
      for both the entire cohort as well as for specific treatments separately. With this a more&#xD;
      personalized treatment for metastases in the long bones based on expected survival and&#xD;
      impending fracture risk can be provided in order to improve functioning and the quality of&#xD;
      life for the remaining lifetime in patients with disseminated cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational, prospective, multicentre cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients with metastases of the long bones visiting a radiation&#xD;
      oncologist or orthopaedic surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoints are patient reported quality of life&#xD;
      (including functioning) and pain levels. Complications and survival are secondary endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients in the OPTIMAL cohort will perhaps not directly benefit from their&#xD;
      participation. Participation will contribute to deriving patient-specific treatment&#xD;
      modalities for future patients with bone metastases of the long bones. Risks associated with&#xD;
      participation in the prospective cohort are considered negligible due to the observational&#xD;
      nature of the study. The burden for the patients lies in completion of questionnaires, which&#xD;
      is considered to be in proportion with the potential value of this research.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OPTIMAL Study in its entirety aims to provide a more personalized treatment for&#xD;
      metastases in the long bones based on expected survival and impending fracture risk in order&#xD;
      to improve functioning and the quality of life for the remaining lifetime in patients with&#xD;
      disseminated cancer. The OPTIMAL Study will provide the infrastructure for a prospective&#xD;
      cohort (OPTIMAL cohort) and multiple independent trials. The specific aims of the cohort are&#xD;
      discussed in this protocol. The objectives and plan of the first trial (Post-Operative&#xD;
      Radiotherapy; PORT study) are discussed in a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the cohort is to describe the quality of life and pain perception of&#xD;
      patients after local treatment (radiotherapy and/or surgery) of metastases of the long bones,&#xD;
      for both the entire cohort as well as for specific treatments separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to describe the complication rate and survival of patients after local&#xD;
      treatment (radiotherapy and/or surgery) of metastases of the long bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of further future individual trials will be described in separate protocols&#xD;
      and submitted to the medical research ethics committee (METC) independently. In general&#xD;
      however, all trials will be pragmatic research trials in search of answers to which treatment&#xD;
      (radiotherapy or surgery) fits specific patients (categorised by metastasis location,&#xD;
      expected survival and fracture risk) best.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The cohort will be prospectively collected and multicentre, including all&#xD;
      consecutive patients with bone metastases of the long bones (BMLB) who have signed informed&#xD;
      consent. These patients will be followed prospectively, and data concerning patient and&#xD;
      treatment characteristics as well as patient reported outcomes on quality of life will be&#xD;
      collected. Baseline data will be collected by the physician and entered into the OPTIMAL&#xD;
      database. These baseline data match the information that is obtained for standard care. For&#xD;
      the assessment of patient reported outcomes a set of internationally and nationally validated&#xD;
      questionnaires will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At moment of inclusion baseline patient data will be collected for the OPTIMAL cohort, which&#xD;
      will also be used for the Post-Operative RadioTherapy (PORT) study. Data will comprehend&#xD;
      information concerning demographics, medical history, and clinical status and functioning.&#xD;
      Details concerning the treatment(s) will be reported when relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to fill out questionnaires about quality of life (QoL) at baseline&#xD;
      (pre-treatment; if possible), and 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after initial treatment, then every&#xD;
      six months for minimal two years or until death. All subsequently or concomitantly&#xD;
      symptomatic metastases will be registered (including treatment and follow-up), but a new&#xD;
      course of questionnaires will generally not be initiated. These outcome measures will be&#xD;
      applied in the entire OPTIMAL cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain has been chosen as primary endpoint because it can act as a proxy for mechanical&#xD;
      complications (i.e. loosening). Mechanical complications are only relevant for these patients&#xD;
      if they give clinical complaints needing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the primary endpoint patients will be asked to score the worst pain in the past 24&#xD;
      hours on a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0-10. In addition, patients will be asked to list&#xD;
      their usual pain medication and the escape medication they used the previous 24 hours. These&#xD;
      questions are derived from the Brief Pain Intervention (BPI) score, which is advised by the&#xD;
      International Consensus Statement for Bone Metastasis Research. The BPI is a pain assessment&#xD;
      tool for use with cancer patients developed by the Pain Research Group of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Symptom Evaluation in Cancer Care and is also&#xD;
      available in Dutch. However, multiple questions are similar to questions in the European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life questionnaire for&#xD;
      palliation (QLQ-PAL15) and EORTC Quality of life questionnaire for bone metastases (QLQBM-22)&#xD;
      (described below). Thus to spare patients answering the same questions twice, the&#xD;
      investigators have selected only 2 questions from the BPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For longitudinal assessment of quality of life after treatment, the investigators will use&#xD;
      nationally and internationally used, validated and recommended questionnaires: European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C15-PAL and EORTC QLQ-BM22. In&#xD;
      addition, the EQ-5D (5 dimension) questionnaire will be conducted. The EORTC is currently&#xD;
      developing a utility scoring instrument for the EORTC QLQ-C30 (from which the QLQ-C15-PAL&#xD;
      originates). The investigators expect this scoring instrument will also be applicable for the&#xD;
      QLQ-C15-PAL. After validation of this scoring instrument has taken place, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to apply it to the data. This would make the addition of the EQ-5D questionnaire&#xD;
      redundant and it will then be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Function:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For assessing improvements in functional outcomes after treatment, the Toronto Extremity&#xD;
      Salvage Score (TESS) for upper and lower extremities will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational clinical data will be collected at baseline (pre-treatment; if possible) and at&#xD;
      first, and possibly second, post-operative follow-up (generally, patients are subsequently&#xD;
      only seen if there are complications or new complaints):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For complication rate, the Henderson classification of complications will be applied. This&#xD;
      classification identifies five primary modes of endoprosthetic failure: soft tissue failure&#xD;
      (type 1), aseptic loosening (type 2), structural failure (type 3), infection (type 4), and&#xD;
      tumour progression (type 5). Wound complications with clinical consequences will be&#xD;
      registered separately. Re-operations due to complications will be registered as such in the&#xD;
      treatment field as a new operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of BMLB will be monitored with conventional radiography and on indication with CT&#xD;
      scan. This is according to usual care, generally at six weeks and 3 months. No additional&#xD;
      outpatient visits or imaging will be requested for study purposes only. The radiological&#xD;
      images will be used to place the subjective reports of pain (as reported by the patient on a&#xD;
      numeric rating scale) into perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates of death will be derived from the Hospital Electronic Patient Registry, which is linked&#xD;
      to the Municipal Personal Records Database. If this is not possible or not up to date, data&#xD;
      will be derived from the general practitioner. The utmost will be tried to prevent sending&#xD;
      questionnaires to deceased patients.&#xD;

        All patients visiting the radiation oncologist or the orthopaedic surgeon of participating&#xD;
        centres, for possible local treatment of a symptomatic BMLB or impending fracture, will be&#xD;
        registered in the OPTIMAL registry. This includes patients with newly diagnosed metastatic&#xD;
        bone disease as well as patients undergoing re-treatment of the same lesion or patients who&#xD;
        have received previous treatment for other lesions. Preferably patients are included before&#xD;
        the start of treatment, but inclusion can also take place during treatment. When patients&#xD;
        are already included in the cohort (for treatment of another metastasis), they will not be&#xD;
        included a second time when they present with a second lesion of the long bones. This&#xD;
        second lesion will be registered under the same patient number.&#xD;
