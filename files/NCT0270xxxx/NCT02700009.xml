  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy, a treatment that has been shown to be effective&#xD;
      in previous studies in psychiatric settings, will be disseminated into primary care - a&#xD;
      health care setting where there are significant problems in receiving adequate treatment for&#xD;
      depression. Computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy will feature a low-cost method of&#xD;
      delivering therapy designed to be replicated and sustained in other primary care settings.&#xD;
      Feasibility and effectiveness will be tested by randomly assigning 320 primary care patients&#xD;
      with depression to receive either computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy or treatment&#xD;
      as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Computer-assisted cognitive-behavior therapy (CCBT) for depression in primary care will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a trial with 320 patients randomly assigned to CCBT or treatment as usual (TAU).&#xD;
      The study will disseminate a therapy method found to be effective in psychiatric settings&#xD;
      into primary care - a setting where there have been significant problems in delivery of&#xD;
      adequate, evidence-based treatment for depression. The study will include a high percentage&#xD;
      of disadvantaged patients - a population that has been largely ignored in previous research&#xD;
      in CCBT. There have been no previous studies of CCBT for depression in primary care that have&#xD;
      enrolled large numbers of disadvantaged patients. The form of CCBT used in this study is&#xD;
      designed to increase access to effective therapy, provide a cost-effective method, and be a&#xD;
      sustainable model for wide-spread use in primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to deliver therapy in a practical manner that can be replicated in other primary&#xD;
      care practices, patients with significant symptoms of depression will receive treatment with&#xD;
      an empirically supported computer program that builds cognitive-behavior therapy skills.&#xD;
      Support for CCBT will be provided by telephone and/or e-mail contact with a care coordinator&#xD;
      instead of the face-to-face treatment with a cognitive-behavior therapist that has been a&#xD;
      part of CCBT delivery in mental health settings. Novel features of this treatment program&#xD;
      include: 1) fully detailed and replicable method for integrating clinician support with CCBT&#xD;
      in primary care; 2) delivery of CCBT to a population with high percentage of disadvantaged&#xD;
      patients; 3) integration of CCBT into the primary care delivery model; 4) highly interactive,&#xD;
      multimedia computer program with adaptations for persons who may have lower levels of&#xD;
      education or computer experience; 5) advanced cost-benefit analysis including data on actual&#xD;
      health care utilization and costs; 6) exploration of moderators and predictors of treatment&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome will be assessed by measuring CCBT completion rate, comprehension of CBT concepts,&#xD;
      and satisfaction with treatment; in addition to ratings of depressive symptoms, negative&#xD;
      thoughts, and quality of life. The cost-effectiveness analysis and exploration of possible&#xD;
      predictors of outcome should help clinicians, health care organizations, and others plan&#xD;
      further dissemination of CCBT in primary care.&#xD;
