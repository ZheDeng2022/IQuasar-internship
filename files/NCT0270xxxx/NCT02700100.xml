  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomised, open label clinical study to assess the safety of&#xD;
      the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved (PV) conduit (PV-001) in subjects &gt; 2 years and &lt; 22 years&#xD;
      of age, undergoing Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) reconstruction. It is a first in&#xD;
      man feasibility study which will include 10-12 patients in up to 6 sites in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the survival rate of subjects at 6 months&#xD;
      following implantation of the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The survival rate of subjects at 12 months following implantation of the Bioabsorbable&#xD;
           Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The percentage of conduit failure at 6 months and 12 months, where conduit failure&#xD;
           includes the need for reintervention or reoperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The pressure gradient across the pulmonary valve will have an acceptable level at 12&#xD;
           months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The pulmonary regurgitation measured will not exceed a moderate grading at 12 months&#xD;
           follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the usability of the Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved Conduit (PV-001) during&#xD;
           the surgical procedure, using exploratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term safety will be assessed up to 60 months post implantation.&#xD;

    <description>The Bioabsorbable Pulmonary Valved (PV) Conduit (PV-001) is a polymer-based medical device, with a total length of 8 cm with inner diameters of 16 or 18 mm. The valve itself is formed by three leaflets, incorporated within the conduit wall.&#xD;
The PV conduit is used for correction or reconstruction of the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract (RVOT) in patients with any of the following congenital heart malformations:&#xD;
Tetralogy of Fallot&#xD;
Truncus Arteriosus&#xD;
Pulmonary Atresia&#xD;
Transposition of Great Arteries with Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)&#xD;
Pulmonary Stenosis in combination with other defects in congenital heart defect (CHD) syndromes&#xD;
The PV conduit can also be used for replacement of previously implanted, but dysfunctional, pulmonary homografts or valved conduits.</description>
