    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically modified T-cell&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 positive&#xD;
      (ROR1+) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia (ALL), stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      (TNBC) that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled&#xD;
      with treatment (advanced). Genetically modified therapies, such as ROR1 specific chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, are taken from a patient's blood, modified in the laboratory&#xD;
      so they specifically may kill cancer cells with a protein called ROR1 on their surfaces, and&#xD;
      safely given back to the patient after conventional therapy. The &quot;genetically modified&quot;&#xD;
      T-cells have genes added in the laboratory to make them recognize ROR1.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous&#xD;
      cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ ROR1 CAR-T cells for patients with advanced ROR1+&#xD;
      hematologic (Cohort A) and epithelial (Cohort B) malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred T cells, and the&#xD;
      phenotype of persisting T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine trafficking of adoptively transferred T cells traffic to the bone marrow or&#xD;
      other tumor site and function in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine preliminary antitumor activity of the adoptive transfer of ROR1 CAR-T cells&#xD;
      in patients with measurable tumor burden prior to T cell transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ROR1 CAR-specific autologous T-lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive chemotherapy comprising fludarabine phosphate and cyclophosphamide as&#xD;
      determined by the referring physician in consultation with the protocol principal&#xD;
      investigator (PI). Beginning within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy, patients receive ROR1 CAR-specific autologous T-lymphocytes intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over 20-30 minutes. Patients may receive a second infusion of ROR1 CAR-specific autologous&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes with or without additional cytoreductive therapy at the same (for those that&#xD;
      received the highest cell dose) or up to the next highest dose level and there is persistent&#xD;
      disease, there were no toxicities attributed to the first infusion, and the patient is at&#xD;
      least 21 days from the first T cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 15 years.&#xD;
