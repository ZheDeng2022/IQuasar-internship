    <textblock>
      Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a firmly&#xD;
      established modality for diagnostic evaluation of mediastinal lesions. The procedure is&#xD;
      routinely performed at the Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Disorders, AIIMS, New&#xD;
      Delhi since 2012. Transesophageal approach for fine needle aspiration of mediastinal lesions&#xD;
      using the Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) scope [also described as Transesophageal&#xD;
      Bronchoscopic Ultrasound Guided Fine Needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA)] (also routinely performed&#xD;
      in the department) and has been described as a safe and efficacious modality. EUS-B-FNA is&#xD;
      usually employed when EBUS-TBNA is not feasible or excessive cough or secretions necessitate&#xD;
      switch to esophageal route. We hypothesize that EUS-B-FNA as the primary approach has similar&#xD;
      diagnostic performance as EBUS-TBNA and is associated with greater patient and operator rated&#xD;
      procedure comfort and lesser requirement of anaesthesia medications for evaluation of&#xD;
      patients with mediastinal lesions easily accessible with either of the two approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to undertake a prospective randomized comparison of Transesophageal (EUS-B-FNA)&#xD;
      versus Transtracheal (EBUS-TBNA) approach for fine needle aspiration using the same EBUS&#xD;
      scope in patients referred for endo-sonographic evaluation of mediastinal lesions. A total of&#xD;
      100 serial patients (with Subcarinal and/or Lower Left paratracheal located mediastinal&#xD;
      lymphadenopathy at least &gt;1cm in Short axis diameter) shall be included. After consent and&#xD;
      preliminary investigations, patients shall be randomized equally into the two approaches.&#xD;
      Procedure will be performed under local anaesthesia (topical lignocaine) and i.v. sedation&#xD;
      (midazolam and fentanyl) in the bronchoscopy laboratory. The primary objective will be&#xD;
      comparison of proportion of diagnostic and adequate aspirates in the two groups. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will include operator rated cough (VAS), Operator rated overall procedure&#xD;
      satisfaction (VAS), dose of midazolam and fentanyl administered, lignocaine dose and total&#xD;
      procedure duration.The primary data analysis shall be for the performance characteristics of&#xD;
      the primary approach. All the aspirates shall be analysed by the same pathologist for final&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of Proportion of Adequate and Diagnostic Aspirates in the EUS-B-FNA versus&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA arms as the primary approach for mediastinal fine needle aspiration during Convex&#xD;
      probe EBUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Topical Anaesthetic requirement between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intravenous Sedative / analgesic requirement between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operator rated overall procedure satisfaction (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Operator rated cough (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Overall duration of procedure Methods Study Design: Prospective randomised study. Sample&#xD;
           Size: Number of Patients: 100 (50 -EBUS-TBNA arm, 50- EUS-B-FNA arm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 years and Older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with predominant Subcarinal or Lower Left paratracheal located mediastinal&#xD;
           lymphadenopathy/mediastinal lesions at least &gt;1cm in Short axis diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who give consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal of consent for the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindications to Bronchoscopy or Endobronchial Ultrasound procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Controls: None For all patients, a targeted history will be obtained to screen&#xD;
           for diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, bleeding disorders, cardiac disease,&#xD;
           previous anaesthetic complications and any medication history including antiplatelet&#xD;
           therapy. Baseline investigations like complete hemogram and prothrombin time will be&#xD;
           done, and imaging prior to the procedure will include a chest radiograph and computed&#xD;
           tomography (CT) scan of the chest (plain and contrast enhanced).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be randomised to 2 groups of 50 patients each. 50 patients in one&#xD;
      group will undergo Transtracheal (EBUS-TBNA) approach, whereas in the other group, 50&#xD;
      patients will undergo Transesophageal (EUS-B-FNA) route as the primary approach using the&#xD;
      EBUS scope. Procedures will be performed under moderate sedation. Procedures will be&#xD;
      performed in the Bronchoscopy Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The size and characteristics of the mediastinal lymph nodes as visualised during EBUS/EUS&#xD;
      will be recorded. The concerned mediastinal lymph nodes will be sampled by EBUS-TBNA/EUS-FNA&#xD;
      under direct ultrasonic visualisation. The aspirates will be expressed on to slides and will&#xD;
      be placed into alcohol cytology bottles. The slides will then be dispatched to the&#xD;
      Cytopathology Lab for appropriate stains and further analysis. Lymph node core if obtained&#xD;
      will be sent in formalin for Histopathological analysis. Post procedure, the patients will&#xD;
      remain in observation for a few hours and will be discharged on the same day. A patient&#xD;
      proforma will be completed for each patient separately. The size and stations of the sampled&#xD;
      nodes will be recorded. The total duration of procedure, the nature and total dose of&#xD;
      anaesthesia or sedation will also be recorded. A Visual-analogue scale (VAS) will be used to&#xD;
      assess operator rated procedure related cough and overall operator rated procedure&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis - Descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation and&#xD;
      range will be calculated for all continuous variables. Frequency distributions will be&#xD;
      calculated for all qualitative data. Frequency data across categorical variables will be&#xD;
      compared using chi-square and fisher's exact test. Among patients with adequate sample on&#xD;
      EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive&#xD;
      values will be calculated using standard formulas. P-value of P&lt;0.05 is considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
