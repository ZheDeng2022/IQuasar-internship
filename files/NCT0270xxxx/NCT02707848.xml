      This 3-year school-based epidemiological study on child and adolescent mental disorders aims&#xD;
      to obtain the prevalence rate and identify the psychosocial, individual, environmental, and&#xD;
      familial risk factors for mental disorders including learning disability, autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct&#xD;
      disorder, mood disorders (major depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders,&#xD;
      phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep disorders, eating disorders, and substance use&#xD;
      disorders in Taiwan.&#xD;

      Despite several waves of epidemiological studies in adult and elderly mental disorders in the&#xD;
      past decades, revealing inconsistent results, little is known about the prevalence of mental&#xD;
      disorders in the child and young adolescent population in Taiwan. However, there is an&#xD;
      increasing trend of child and adolescent mental disorders over the past decades consistently&#xD;
      reported across countries. With the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
      Mental Disorders to the current version-5th edition (DSM-5), there has been no&#xD;
      epidemiological study using DSM-5 in youth population in the world. The DSM-5 was published&#xD;
      in October 2014. It warrants an epidemiological study on child and adolescent mental&#xD;
      disorders using the DSM-5 as diagnostic criteria in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-stage design to conduct screening for mental disorders including autism and all&#xD;
      neuropsychological studies in addition to questionnaires. Moreover, clinical assessment will&#xD;
      be conducted among urban students (n = 3000) and rural students (n = 1500) from a three-stage&#xD;
      cluster sampling. All the screen positive (estimated n = 900) and 10% of screen negative&#xD;
      (estimated n = 360) will receive the full diagnostic interview (K-SADS-E to obtain the&#xD;
      pregnancy, developmental and medical history. For students who leave of absence, we will&#xD;
      visit them at home to complete all the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate this study will provide the prevalence of a wide range of&#xD;
      developmental and psychiatric disorders in children and our results will also provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive risk factors for each psychiatric disorder identified in this study, including&#xD;
      neurocognitive, developmental, familiar, and environmental factors. The individual, combined,&#xD;
      and interactive effects of these predictors can be identified in this study. This study will&#xD;
      definitely provide precious data for the government to develop a preventive program for&#xD;
      mental disorders and a promotion program for mental health and well-being.&#xD;
