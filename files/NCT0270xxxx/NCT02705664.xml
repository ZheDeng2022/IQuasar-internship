      The main objective of this study is to compare subject adherence and satisfaction for two&#xD;
      modes of treatment toenails infection (Onychomycosis) with Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL)&#xD;
      and a Fungal Nail Treatment Set containing Urea 40% ointment (Urea) and Bifonazole cream 1%&#xD;
      (Bifonazole).&#xD;

      A total of 20 subjects are to be included in 1 site in Iceland&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive following treatments on the right or left toenails:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl NL) to be applied once weekly for 7 weeks on all affected&#xD;
           toenails of one foot (including great toenail)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fungal Nail Treatment Set to be used on all affected toenails (including great toenail)&#xD;
           of the opposite foot in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase I: Urea ointment (Urea) to be applied once a day under occlusion for 2-3&#xD;
                weeks depending on the achievement of optimal diseased toenail plates removal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Phase II: Bifonazole cream to (Bifonazole) be applied for 4 weeks on affected&#xD;
                toenails (after the maximum 3-week treatment period with Urea ointment)&#xD;
