    <textblock>
      This randomised prospective controlled trial will investigate patients with impingement&#xD;
      syndrome who undergo arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The intervention group will&#xD;
      receive physiotherapy aided by automated sensor-based technology which will help them perform&#xD;
      exergames and track their rehabilitation progress. The control group will be treated by&#xD;
      standard physiotherapy protocols. The two groups will be compared using patient reported&#xD;
      outcome measures and assessment of shoulder range of movement before and after the shoulder&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected on patient experience, engagement with the rehabilitation process and&#xD;
      the usability of the sensor-based technology through the use exergames. This will guide&#xD;
      development of methods to quantify patient activation and engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be a significant clinical difference in post-surgical improvement measured by&#xD;
           patient reported outcomes when physiotherapy is aided by automated sensor-based&#xD;
           technology to perform Exergames and track progress, compared to standard physiotherapy&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be a significant difference in post-surgical improvement in range of shoulder&#xD;
           movement and patient improvement, measured by patient reported out-comes when&#xD;
           physiotherapy is aided by automated sensor-based technology to perform exergames and&#xD;
           track progress, compared to standard physiotherapy protocols.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal problems are one of the most common reasons for seeking medical advice, with&#xD;
      estimates of up to 20% of adults annually consulting their general practitioner. The&#xD;
      prevalence of shoulder problems in the population is approximately 2.5%(Jordon et al 2010).&#xD;
      In 2012/13, there were over 7.1 million outpatient appointments for trauma and orthopaedics&#xD;
      in England (accounting for 9.3% of all outpatient attendances) and over 4 million of these&#xD;
      visits were followup after the initial consultation (Hospital Episode Statistics). The&#xD;
      average cost for each outpatient follow up is £76. At a time when the NHS is under&#xD;
      considerable financial burden we are constantly looking at ways and means of reducing the&#xD;
      number of outpatient appointments and the length of time for which a patient required&#xD;
      followup. By improving rehabilitation protocols patients may complete their recovery more&#xD;
      rapidly which may reduce clinician patient face-to-face interactions. This may free up this&#xD;
      valuable resource which can be directed towards more complex clinical requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Engagement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major factors that influence patient outcomes is their engagement with the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rehabilitation professionals have long suspected that a patient's motivation plays an&#xD;
      important role in determining the outcome of therapy, despite the lack of a clear definition&#xD;
      of the phenomenon (Maclean et al. 2002). It is estimated that up to 65% of patients are&#xD;
      non/partially adherent to their home exercise program (Meichenbaum 1987). Classically,&#xD;
      patients have completed home exercise diaries. However, studies have suggested that these are&#xD;
      often completed retrospectively. This may encourage patients to exaggerate the amount of&#xD;
      activity performed. Hoelscher at al (1984), timed patients at home performing a relaxation&#xD;
      exercise program and compared this to patient reported duration. They found that the latter&#xD;
      tended to suggest a higher level of adherence. The Exergames programmes actively track&#xD;
      patient interaction with the software. Each activity records the length of interaction,&#xD;
      progress through rehabilitation allowing the clinician to have a clearer indication of&#xD;
      patient engagement in rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient activation describes the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing&#xD;
      their own health and health care. Intervening to increase activation can improve a patient's&#xD;
      engagement and health outcomes. This is an important factor in helping patients manage their&#xD;
      health (Kings Fund 2015). As a part of this study we will quantify patient engagement.&#xD;
      Through this we can develop and validate a new tool to comprehensively measure patient&#xD;
      outcomes using four domains. These will be Patient reported pain and function (P), shoulder&#xD;
      range of movement i.e.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematics (K), patient activation or engagement (E) and patient experience (X).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gamification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional evaluation of the patient's range of motion usually occurs in a clinic, often&#xD;
      using subjective and informal methods of angle measurement. This has the potential to create&#xD;
      discrepancies in findings between clinicians. To reduce the use of healthcare resources, make&#xD;
      the clinical assessment more convenient for the patient, to improve the quality of the&#xD;
      information collected and the assessment conducted, electronic measurement has the potential&#xD;
      to perform repeatable validated objective results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If combined with appropriate principles of gamification, these measurements can become a part&#xD;
      of the rehabilitation process with potentially faster clinical improvement and comprehensive&#xD;
      analysis of patient generated outcomes. In light of this, there has been a wave of support&#xD;
      for the implementation of gaming elements in healthcare technologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Gamification' involves the incorporation of game mechanics in a non-game setting and a&#xD;
      tailored user interface for better learning which encourages engagement (King 2013). Reward&#xD;
      systems, competition and immediate feedback improve user experience and have been implemented&#xD;
      in healthcare related fields where patients have become a niche target group (Lin 2013). This&#xD;
      may in turn increase patient activation allowing them to manage their own health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIRA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MIRA Rehab is a company who has developed software designed for the rehabilitation of medical&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with a Microsoft Kinect sensor it accurately traces the range of motion in the&#xD;
      shoulder. MIRA uses games which are built based upon the best clinical practice and expertise&#xD;
      from specialist clinicians. The MIRA programme enables patients to progress through different&#xD;
      levels within the games whilst engaging in their rehabilitation programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      90 patients will be recruited to a 3 month rehabilitation programme following a standard&#xD;
      subacromial decompression&#xD;
&#xD;
      +/biceps tenotomy for impingement syndrome. Patients will be randomised into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard postoperative physiotherapy regime without the use of accessory software&#xD;
           (Treatment as usual Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative regime of physiotherapy plus Exergames utilizing principles of&#xD;
           gamification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size calculation was performed using Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) sample data&#xD;
      collected on patients previously undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression. [Alpha&#xD;
      error set at 0.05, and beta error at 0.8, mean difference of 5 points12 in the OSS, standard&#xD;
      deviation 6.96] Based upon this, a sample size of 32 patients in each group would be&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second sample size calculation was performed based on the disabilities of arm shoulder and&#xD;
      hand (DASH) outcome measure. [Alpha error set at 0.05, and beta error at 0.8, mean difference&#xD;
      of 15 points in the DASH13, standard deviation 23] Based upon this, a sample size of 37&#xD;
      patients in each group would be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a target of 45 patients per group was chosen to allow for some participants&#xD;
      withdrawing from the study (20%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as usual Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will attend physiotherapy on a weekly basis for assessment. They will be assessed&#xD;
      for progression and be provided with a home exercise program. Range of motion in their&#xD;
      shoulder will be collected on a weekly basis using the MIRA technology. Patients will be&#xD;
      required to complete an exercise diary documenting the exercises performed as well as&#xD;
      duration and frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment as usual plus Exergames Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencing the study the physiotherapists will set up and initially demonstrate the&#xD;
      Exergames to the intervention participants in the home setting. This will ensure the safety&#xD;
      of the patients and address any technological issues that may arise. Patients will attend&#xD;
      physiotherapy on a weekly basis as well as partaking in a set of tailored Exergames to play&#xD;
      in the home system. The MIRA software will record the patient engagement with the system&#xD;
      including number of sessions and duration of play. Patients will also be asked to complete an&#xD;
      exercise diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (Clinic Consultation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's eligibility to participate in the study will be assessed; inclusion/ exclusion&#xD;
      criteria must be met. The Patient Information Sheet will be given to the patient when they&#xD;
      are listed for surgery. Prior to their surgery date, the patient will be contacted by a&#xD;
      member of the research team, to see if they would like to participate in the study. Patient&#xD;
      will be asked to give their consent to the study on the day of surgery. Past medical history&#xD;
      will be reviewed and patient demographics will be documented. Relevant questions and scoring&#xD;
      will be taken for baseline reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      + 24 hours (following baseline assessments) The patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
      questionnaires will be repeated by all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 Patient attends hospital for surgical treatment. Confirmation of study consent must be&#xD;
      confirmed. A study diary will be dispensed to patient. Study coordinator will give full&#xD;
      explanation regarding completion of the diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient must attend physiotherapy clinic at day 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77. A scheduled&#xD;
      visit window to allow flexibility is +/- 2 days. Patient is to continue with their&#xD;
      post-operative physiotherapy regime depending on the treatment group they have been&#xD;
      randomised. Range of Movement will be assessed and documented by the research&#xD;
      physiotherapist. Each patient diary will be reviewed and assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 84/85 Patient diary will be reviewed and returned. On completion of the 12 week programme&#xD;
      all patients (N=90) will complete all outcome questionnaires, Patients randomised to&#xD;
      Exergames arm will complete a Systems Usability score for the MIRA software. Range of&#xD;
      movement will be recorded by MIRA and documented by the research physio-therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 365 One year post surgery all patients (N=90) will complete the scoring questionnaires.&#xD;
