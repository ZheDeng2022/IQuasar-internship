    <textblock>
      Stress is an important determinant of pregnancy health behaviors, maternal physiology and&#xD;
      maternal-infant health outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explain the relationship&#xD;
      between dimensions of lifetime stress and the stress hormone cortisol in pregnant women.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will examine how coping styles help pregnant women to better manage&#xD;
      stress and improve their health behaviors to achieve the goal of having a healthy baby.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health behaviors are important modifiable factors for promoting maternal-infant health during&#xD;
      pregnancy, and include behaviors such as diet, exercise, and avoidance of harmful substances.&#xD;
      During pregnancy, women are often motivated to improve their lifestyle to achieve positive&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes; however, they may struggle to do so because certain behaviors such as&#xD;
      excessive eating, smoking and drinking have become a means for coping with stress. Stress&#xD;
      prior to and during pregnancy negatively impacts birth outcomes via complex behavioral and&#xD;
      physiologic pathways. From a behavioral perspective, stress diminishes women's engagement in&#xD;
      positive health behaviors during pregnancy. From a physiologic perspective, stress affects&#xD;
      the regulation of cortisol, a hormone involved in fetal development and timing of delivery.&#xD;
      Women use various coping styles to manage stress. It is unknown, however, whether certain&#xD;
      coping styles attenuate the negative behavioral and physiologic effects of stress on birth&#xD;
      outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this descriptive, cross-sectional study is to examine the&#xD;
      influence of coping styles on stress, physiologic cortisol regulation and health behaviors in&#xD;
      a diverse sample of pregnant women (N=55) during 24-28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quantitative design with a qualitative arm will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. explain the relationship between cortisol regulation and lifetime stress,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine whether coping styles (active vs. disengaged) moderate the effect of stress on&#xD;
           cortisol, health behaviors, and birth outcomes, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. describe women's qualitative experience of stress and coping and determine the extent to&#xD;
           which the qualitative findings converge with the quantitative findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected over three prenatal visits during the second half of pregnancy, and&#xD;
      will include self-report questionnaires, multiple salivary cortisol sampling, medical record&#xD;
      data, a structured stress interview and a semi-structured qualitative interview in a subset&#xD;
      of participants (n=12). This study will use an interview-based stress assessment in tandem&#xD;
      with physiologic (i.e. cortisol) stress measures in pregnancy. Additionally, the qualitative&#xD;
      data will provide a contextual understanding of pregnant women's stress and coping&#xD;
      experiences. The research findings will inform the future development and testing of a&#xD;
      psychosocial, coping-based intervention to promote positive health behaviors in pregnancy and&#xD;
      birth outcomes. Furthermore, this training will provide a solid scientific foundation for the&#xD;
      applicant to develop a career as an independent nurse-scientist in maternal-infant health&#xD;
      promotion research, under the guidance of an experienced interdisciplinary team of mentors&#xD;
      with complementary expertise in stress, coping health behavior, and pregnancy related&#xD;
      research. The proposal is consistent with the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR)&#xD;
      mission to support research that promotes health and prevents disease across the lifespan,&#xD;
      builds the scientific foundation for clinical practice, and invests in the training of the&#xD;
      next generation of nurse-scientists.&#xD;
