    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate Prunus&#xD;
      domestica bark contains three groups of active constituents: phytosterols (including&#xD;
      beta-sitosterol), pentacyclic triterpenoids (including ursolic and oleaic acids) and ferulic&#xD;
      esters of long-chain fatty alcohols (including ferulic esters of docosanol and tetracosanol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phytosterols, particularly beta-sitosterol, are found in numerous plants and are&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. Beta-sitosterol has been shown&#xD;
      to be useful in cases of BPH by helping to reduce the normally elevated levels of&#xD;
      prostaglandins in these patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate. Symptoms&#xD;
      related to BPH are one of the most common problems in older men. Histological evidence of BPH&#xD;
      is found in more than is approximately 10% for men in their 30s, 20% for men in their 40s,&#xD;
      reaches 50% to 60% for men in their 60s, and is 80% to 90% for men in their 70s and 80s. The&#xD;
      majority of men over the age of 60 are considered to have urinary symptoms attributable to&#xD;
      BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proliferative disorder resulting in BPH affects both the stromal and the epithelial&#xD;
      portions of the prostate. The enlarging prostate results in the progressive occlusion of the&#xD;
      proximal urethra and can result in both obstructive and irritative urinary tract symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preferred medical treatment for many men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia is&#xD;
      either an alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonist (alpha-blocker), which reduces smooth-muscle&#xD;
      tone in the prostate, and bladder neck, or a 5α-reductase inhibitor, which reduces prostate&#xD;
      volume by inducing epithelial atrophy. These drugs have side effects including:-dizziness,&#xD;
      fatigue, hypotension, headache, insomnia, gynecomastia, and retrograde ejaculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of plants and herbs for medicinal purposes (phytotherapy) including treatment of BPH&#xD;
      symptoms has been growing steadily in most countries. Usage of plant extracts is common in&#xD;
      many countries of the world and is increasing in the United States. Phytotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      represent nearly half of the medications dispensed for BPH in Italy, compared with 5% for&#xD;
      alpha blockers and 5% for 5-alpha reductase inhibitors. In Germany and Austria, phytotherapy&#xD;
      is the first-line treatment for mild to moderate urinary obstructive symptoms and represents&#xD;
      &gt; 90% of all drugs prescribed for the treatment of BPH. In the United States their use has&#xD;
      also markedly increased, they are readily available as nonprescription dietary supplements&#xD;
      and are often recommended in &quot;natural health food stores or books&quot; for self treatment of BPH&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prunus domestica, or European plum, is a small deciduous tree in the Rosaceae (rose) family&#xD;
      that is an ancient domesticated species, known only in cultivation. It is now cultivated in&#xD;
      temperate areas worldwide for its fruit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanism of action The bark contains three groups of active constituents: phytosterols&#xD;
      (including beta-sitosterol), pentacyclic triterpenoids (including ursolic and oleaic acids)&#xD;
      and ferulic esters of long-chain fatty alcohols (including ferulic esters of docosanol and&#xD;
      tetracosanol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phytosterols, particularly beta-sitosterol, are found in numerous plants and are&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. Beta-sitosterol has been shown&#xD;
      to be useful in cases of BPH by helping to reduce the normally elevated levels of&#xD;
      prostaglandins in these patients. The elimination of the excess blood and vasal congestion&#xD;
      helps reduce the size of prostate adenomas. The pentacyclic triterpenoids also help inhibit&#xD;
      inflammation by blocking enzymatic activity. They are effective anti-edema agents and also&#xD;
      help increase the integrity of small veins and capillaries. The third active group, the&#xD;
      ferulic esters of long-chain fatty acids, act by inhibiting the absorption and metabolism of&#xD;
      cholesterol. BPH and other cases of enlarged prostates are characterized by containing&#xD;
      abnormally high levels of cholesterol. Plant efficacy was determined by measuring the effects&#xD;
      of the herb on numerous parameters, including dysuria, nycturia, frequent urination,&#xD;
      abdominal heaviness, residual urine, voiding volume, prostate volume, and peak flow.&#xD;
      Consumption of P.Domestica resulted in significant amelioration of symptoms, reduction in&#xD;
      prostate size, and clearance of bladder neck urethral obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different studies suggest that these phytochemicals appear to work synergistically to improve&#xD;
      the symptoms of BPH. However, the most bioactive phytochemicals in pygeum are the&#xD;
      phytosterols. Therefore, these components of pygeum extract are believed to exert the most&#xD;
      important therapeutic effect in the treatment of BPH.&#xD;
