    <textblock>
      The rise in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) consumption over the past 40 years since its&#xD;
      introduction as a popular sweetener in the United States has led to much concern regarding&#xD;
      its contribution to the rise in obesity (1), diabetes (2) and related cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disorders (3).Unlike sucrose which contains equal proportions of fructose and glucose bound&#xD;
      by an Î±-glycosidic bond, HFCS contains 42-55% of fructose to glucose in a free (unbound) form&#xD;
      (4). Despite these differences in composition, both sugars possess identical energy&#xD;
      contribution on a gram to gram basis (4). However, the higher ratio of fructose to glucose in&#xD;
      HFCS has led to the hypothesis that HFCS may uniquely contribute to cardiometabolic risk,&#xD;
      more so than sucrose, through proposed differences in fructose metabolism, endocrine and&#xD;
      hedonic properties (5). We will conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to&#xD;
      assess the role of HFCS versus sucrose under energy matched (isocaloric) conditions on&#xD;
      cardiometabolic risk.&#xD;

      Need for proposed research: High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled&#xD;
      trials represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary guidelines and public&#xD;
      health policy development. As HFCS has gained increasing popularity as a popular sweetener&#xD;
      over the past ~50 years, replacing sucrose in the diet, there is an urgent need for&#xD;
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing sucrose versus HFCS in the development of&#xD;
      cardiometaboilc diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators will conduct a series systematic reviews and meta-analyses to&#xD;
      distinguish the effect of isocaloric exchange of sucrose versus HFCS on cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      in controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Each systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      hand searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The investigators will include randomized and non-randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials &gt;= 7-days in duration to assess the effect of sucrose versus HFCS under isocaloric&#xD;
      conditions on measures of cardiometabolic risk. Direct comparisons of sucrose versus HFCS and&#xD;
      indirect comparisons of sucrose or HFCS versus other carbohydrates under energy-matched&#xD;
      conditions will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Seven sets of outcomes will be assessed: (1) body weight and markers of adipsoity&#xD;
      (2) glycemic control, (3) blood pressure, (4) blood lipids, (5) uric acid, (6) non-alcoholic&#xD;
      fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and ectopic fat, (7) inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Mean differences will be pooled using the generic inverse variance method&#xD;
      when data are available from more than 2 trials. Random-effects models will be used even in&#xD;
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more&#xD;
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.&#xD;
      Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses&#xD;
      will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q&#xD;
      statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically&#xD;
      removed. If there are &gt;=10 studies per endpoint, then the investigators will also explore&#xD;
      sources of heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by age (children [=&lt;18 years of age],&#xD;
      adults), health status (metabolic syndrome criteria, diabetes, overweight/ obese, healthy),&#xD;
      comparator type, fructose- containing sugar form (sucrose, HFCS, honey, fructose), dose&#xD;
      (=&lt;10% energy, &gt;10% energy), baseline measurements, randomization, study design (parallel,&#xD;
      crossover), energy balance (positive, neutral, negative), follow-up (=&lt;8-weeks, &gt;8-weeks),&#xD;
      and risk of bias. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of categorical and&#xD;
      continuous subgroups analyses. When &gt;=10 studies are available, publication bias will be&#xD;
      investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal testing using the Egger's and Begg's&#xD;
      tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the investigators will attempt to adjust for&#xD;
      funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and&#xD;
      fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the&#xD;
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific&#xD;
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for&#xD;
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among&#xD;
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      sucrose versus HFCS in the development of cardiometabolic diseases, strengthening the&#xD;
      evidence-base for guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers&#xD;
      and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
