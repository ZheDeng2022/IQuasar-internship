    <textblock>
      Recovery Roadmap: A Collaborative Multimedia Tool for Person-Centered Recovery Planning is a&#xD;
      highly interactive web-based tool that provides guidance for providers and people in&#xD;
      recovery, and promotes widespread implementation of Person-Centered Recovery Planning (PCRP).&#xD;
      The Recovery Roadmap prototype was developed and tested by the Center for Social Innovation&#xD;
      (C4), in partnership with Yale University's Program for Recovery and Community Health (PRCH),&#xD;
      under a Phase I Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant funded by the National&#xD;
      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) (1R43MH100712). Phase II refined the prototype Roadmap to&#xD;
      streamline content, provide additional handouts and exercises for providers and clients to&#xD;
      complete together, expand the audio/video vignettes and case studies, and add interactive&#xD;
      online coaching and support for providers. Phase II also involved a robust evaluation of the&#xD;
      Roadmap, using a quasi-experimental design in a fully powered trial. Approximately 30&#xD;
      practitioners and 90 clients (two to three clients per practitioner) were recruited from a&#xD;
      total of five Community Support Programs in Connecticut. The programs were randomly selected&#xD;
      into one of two intervention waves (Wave 1 and Wave 2). Survey data for Wave 1 included a&#xD;
      total of four surveys: a pre-observation period, post-observation/pre-intervention, a&#xD;
      midpoint survey (after completion of online curriculum), and a post survey (after completion&#xD;
      of the entire intervention, including coaching calls). Surveys for the Wave 2 study&#xD;
      participants included a pre-intervention, midpoint, and post survey. Qualitative interviews&#xD;
      were also completed with interviews with practitioners and and administrators/clinical&#xD;
      supervisors in each agency. State level client administrative client data were also collected&#xD;
      and analyzed. Data examined changes in knowledge related to PCRP, person centered planning&#xD;
      practices, practitioner/client relationship, and overall feedback on the intervention. our&#xD;
      team also conducted a social network analysis to examine any changes in the size and strength&#xD;
      of their networks related to person centered planning before and after the intervention. This&#xD;
      phase will culminate with the dissemination of findings and preparation for Phase III&#xD;
      commercialization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Person-Centered Recovery Planning (PCRP; also referred to as Patient-Centered Care Planning)&#xD;
      is a field-tested intervention designed to maximize consumer choice and ownership of the&#xD;
      treatment and recovery process. In Phase I of Recovery Roadmap: A Collaborative Multimedia&#xD;
      Tool for Person-Centered Recovery Planning, the research team developed a prototype online&#xD;
      tool to train providers and persons in recovery to understand and implement PCRP. The tool&#xD;
      provided in-depth information and included interactive components (e.g., videos, fillable&#xD;
      forms, case studies) to prepare users to partner effectively. The tool was pilot tested in&#xD;
      two sites (one received the Recovery Roadmap only; the other received the tool plus a two-day&#xD;
      in-person training) to obtain feedback about the Roadmap and determine its impact. The&#xD;
      purpose of this Phase II SBIR study is to expand the Recovery Roadmap and conduct a fully&#xD;
      powered study to determine the tool's effectiveness in training providers and supporting&#xD;
      people in recovery in the PCRP process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed Phase II study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized stepped wedge design in which we will recruit a total of 30&#xD;
      practitioners and 90 persons in recovery (PIRs), 3-4 from each participating practitioner.&#xD;
      Per the power analysis, 90 PIRs will have enough power to show statistical significance. We&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomize the sample into two intervention waves, Wave 1 and Wave 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do a T1 assessment with all practitioners and PIRs and then immediately begin the first&#xD;
           2-month component of Wave 1 Recovery Roadmap Intervention, i.e., the 5-unit, online PCRP&#xD;
           curriculum, with both PIRs and practitioners (for Wave 1, T1 will be a Baseline&#xD;
           assessment; for Wave 2, T1 will be a Pre-Baseline assessment). Total of 3 months,&#xD;
           including assessment and completion of the curriculum, while Wave 2 completes an&#xD;
           observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do a T2 assessment (practitioners and PIRs) with both waves and launch the first&#xD;
           component of intervention with Wave 2 (RR on-line training units only) while Wave 1&#xD;
           launches the second component of the RR intervention, i.e., practitioners (only)&#xD;
           receiving 3 months of twice monthly coaching calls and an on-line Community of Practice.&#xD;
           The series of web-based technical assistance (coaching) sessions are designed to&#xD;
           reinforce PCRP key principles and practices as taught in the Recovery Roadmap and to&#xD;
           optimize practitioners' use of/benefit from the web-based Community of Practice (COP).&#xD;
           Wave 2 will have a total of 3 months, including its Baseline assessment and completion&#xD;
           of the online curriculum. Wave 1 will have a total of 4 months, including the mid-point&#xD;
           assessment for PIRs and practitioners and completion of coaching calls and COP for&#xD;
           practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do a T3 Assessment (practitioners and PIRs). This will be, for Wave 1, a&#xD;
           post-intervention assessment for PIRs and practitioners. For Wave 2, it will include a&#xD;
           mid-point intervention assessment for PIRs and practitioners, with Wave 2 immediately&#xD;
           beginning a second component of the intervention (3 months of twice monthly coaching&#xD;
           calls and an online COP for practitioners). The series of web-based technical assistance&#xD;
           sessions are designed to reinforce PCRP key principles and practices as taught in the&#xD;
           Recovery Roadmap and to optimize practitioners' use of/benefit from the web-based&#xD;
           Community of Practice. Wave 1 will have a total of 3 months, including assessments and a&#xD;
           2-month observation period. Wave 2 will have a total of 4 months, including the&#xD;
           mid-point assessment for PIRs and practitioners and completion of coaching calls and COP&#xD;
           for practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Do a T4 Assessment (practitioners and PIRs) after Wave 2 has completed the COP. This is&#xD;
           post intervention for Wave 2 and follow-up for Wave 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses (for Aims 1 and 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Providers in the RR condition will show statistically significant improvements in PCRP&#xD;
      knowledge, skills, and provider-client relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Clients served by providers in the RR condition will show statistically significant&#xD;
      improvements in treatment engagement and progress toward goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Providers with higher levels of connectivity with their peers online will report&#xD;
      sustained PCRP practices, compared with those with lower connectivity.&#xD;
