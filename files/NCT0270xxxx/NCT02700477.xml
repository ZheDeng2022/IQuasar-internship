      Trigonella Foenum-Graecum, commonly known as Fenugreek, is a plant that has been extensively&#xD;
      used as a source of anti-diabetic compounds Fenugreek is traditionally used in India,&#xD;
      especially in the Ayurvedic and Unani systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary animal and human trials suggest possible hypoglycemic and anti-hyper lipidemic&#xD;
      properties of Fenugreek seed powder, when taken orally. Fenugreek seeds contain 50% fiber&#xD;
      (30% soluble fiber and 20% insoluble fiber) that can slow the rate of post-prandial glucose&#xD;
      absorption. This may be a secondary mechanism for the hypoglycemic effect.&#xD;

      Diabetes mellitus is a complex heterogeneous group of metabolic conditions characterized by&#xD;
      increased levels of blood glucose due to impairment in insulin action and/or insulin&#xD;
      secretion. Diabetes is a condition primarily defined by the level of hyperglycemia giving&#xD;
      rise to risk of microvascular damage (retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy). It is&#xD;
      associated with reduced life expectancy, significant morbidity due to specific diabetes&#xD;
      related Microvascular complications, increased risk of macrovascular complications (ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease), and diminished quality of life.Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes in humans and results from a&#xD;
      combination of genetic and acquired factors that impair -cell function and tissue insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO has put the number of persons with diabetes worldwide at approximately 170 million.&#xD;
      The prevalence of diabetes mellitus has risen dramatically over the past 20 years, and the&#xD;
      number of people with diabetes is expected to reach 366 million by 2025. The prevalence of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus is expected to grow even more rapidly in the future. There is also&#xD;
      considerable geographic variation in the incidence of T2DM, and countries like India are fast&#xD;
      emerging as ''diabetes hot spots&quot;. About 5-10% of the total health care budget has been used&#xD;
      for T2DM in many countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced pancreatic Î²-cell functional mass in diabetes, and other categories of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance, has been described by several authors, and decreased islet and/or -cell volume&#xD;
      in the pancreas of type 2 diabetic patients has been consistently reported. In addition,&#xD;
      studies conducted in patients, and isolated islets, have shown both quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative defects of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal antidiabetic agent should normalize plasma glucose, minimize side effects, and&#xD;
      prevent development of micro- and macrovascular complications. Obviously no such agent is&#xD;
      available, nor is it likely to be available in the near or medium-term future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments and treatment regimens include combinations of oral antidiabetic drugs&#xD;
      (OADs), antihypertensive medications, and antidyslipidemic agents, but these have been less&#xD;
      than successful in managing their respective disease targets with clinical goals. Measures&#xD;
      such as screening and intensive life-style modification can help to delay the onset of&#xD;
      diabetes in at-risk individuals, and stringent glycemic control with pharmacotherapy may&#xD;
      improve outcomes. To manage the type 2 diabetes epidemic effectively, however, agents that&#xD;
      can effectively and durably controls glycemia while providing pleiotropic benefits (e.g.&#xD;
      blood pressure reduction) are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the United Kingdom Prospective&#xD;
      Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have convincingly demonstrated that normalizing glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels in individuals with diabetes can reduce diabetes-related&#xD;
      cardio-vascular (CV) morbidity and mortality as well as the incidence and progression of&#xD;
      micro vascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1C concentration is an accurate predictor of risk for such complications, with a desirable&#xD;
      goal of 7.0% or less. In the clinical setting, measurement of HbA1C assesses longer-term&#xD;
      glycemic control among individuals with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of therapeutic agents exist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin, a&#xD;
      biguanide, is a commonly prescribed oral anti diabetic drug; American Diabetes Association&#xD;
      (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines recommend metformin as&#xD;
      initial pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes, with an expected reduction in HbA1C of between&#xD;
      1.0% and 2.0%. In their recommendations, both the ADA and the International Diabetes&#xD;
      Foundation support metformin as initial pharmacotherapy for type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, Metformin is associated with increased CV risk and lactic acidosis, and it is&#xD;
      contraindicated in patients with heart failure or impaired renal function. Metformin&#xD;
      monotherapy has also been associated with diarrhea in approximately 50% of patients and&#xD;
      nausea or vomiting in 25% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sulfonylurea's (SUs) e.g., glimepiride have long been an effective and low-cost mainstay of&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes therapy; as with metformin, SU monotherapy can be expected to reduce HbA1C by&#xD;
      1.0% to 2.0%. SUs are a common alternative or add-on to metformin and act by stimulating&#xD;
      pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion in a glucose-independent manner. Weight gain is a&#xD;
      common adverse effect of SU therapy, as is an increased risk of hypoglycemia, particularly in&#xD;
      the elderly and in patients with worsening renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazolidinedione (TZD) monotherapy has been associated with HbA1C reductions of between 0.5%&#xD;
      and 1.4%. TZDs have beneficial effects on CV markers, including lipid levels (particularly&#xD;
      triglycerides and HDL-Cholesterol), blood pressure, inflammatory mediators, endothelial&#xD;
      function, and fibrinolytic status. However, weight gain and increased risk of edema and heart&#xD;
      failure are frequent adverse effects, particularly when TZDs are used in combination with&#xD;
      insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, act as competitive inhibitors of the alpha&#xD;
      glucosidases, thereby delaying glucose absorption. This effect on glucose uptake decreases&#xD;
      glucose peak and insulin response postprandially and moderately lowers fasting plasma glucose&#xD;
      levels and HbA1C, but gastrointestinal adverse effects and the requirement for three times&#xD;
      daily dosing may inhibit adherence to therapy. Monotherapy with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors&#xD;
      have been associated with HbA1C reductions of between 0.5% and 0.8%, with no weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glinide (i.e., repaglinide, nateglinide) monotherapy has been reported to reduce HbA1C by&#xD;
      between 0.5% and 1.5%. The rapid onset of action of glinides necessitates three times daily&#xD;
      dosing, and they have been associated with hypoglycemia. Weight gain has been reported with&#xD;
      glinide therapy (between 0.7 and 1.8 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin, either alone or in combination with other agents, most commonly metformin, is an&#xD;
      effective option for restoring normoglycemia, especially when administered early in the&#xD;
      disease course. The disadvantages of insulin therapy are weight gain and an increased risk of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia. Insulin has not been observed to have clinically relevant effects on either&#xD;
      blood pressure or lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to devising the most appropriate pharmacotherapeutic regimen for the patient with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, patient management is also of critical importance and is best handled by a&#xD;
      medical care team including the physician, the pharmacist, the dietitian, and a diabetes&#xD;
      education specialist. Ideally, a diabetes care plan should be developed with input from all&#xD;
      medical care team practitioners and the patient. Incretin-based therapies, which include the&#xD;
      glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonist's exenatide and exenatide Long acting release&#xD;
      (LAR), and liraglutide and the Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors sitagliptin,&#xD;
      vildagliptin, and saxagliptin represent a new class of antidiabetic drugs. Data suggest an&#xD;
      equal or potentially greater efficacy of incretin-based therapies to lower HbA1C compared&#xD;
      with other antidiabetic therapies, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Other benefits include&#xD;
      weight reduction (GLP-1 receptor agonists) or weight neutrality (DPP-4 inhibitors).GLP-1&#xD;
      receptor agonists have recently been added to the ADA/EASD treatment algorithm as a tier 2&#xD;
      alternative to the addition of SUs or basal insulin in patients not adequately controlled on&#xD;
      metformin plus lifestyle modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OADs are able, for a time, to reduce A1C but do not correct all the metabolic and&#xD;
      glucoregulatory dysfunctions involved in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology. As a result, HbA1C&#xD;
      goals become more difficult to maintain and a significant glycemic burden accumulates,&#xD;
      increasing the risk of CV diseases. The treatment of co morbid conditions, particularly&#xD;
      hypertension, may also impede achieving and maintaining glycemic goals. Difficulties in&#xD;
      maintaining long-term glycemic control with currently available antidiabetic therapies have&#xD;
      led to the need for additional treatments that can be used as monotherapy or combined safely&#xD;
      with existing agents and that may target more of the underlying pathologies of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although traditional treatments and treatment combinations are initially successful at&#xD;
      lowering HbA1C, they are unable to restore normoglycemia over the long term. Recent data that&#xD;
      suggest the mean time to secondary failure on OADs (a therapeutic event necessitating the&#xD;
      addition of another agent or insulin) may be as short as 1.3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes is the maintenance of&#xD;
      beta-cell function, the decline of which is the major reason for impairment in glucose&#xD;
      tolerance over time. Consequently, therapies that arrest progressive beta-cell deterioration&#xD;
      while restoring and maintaining normoglycemia will be required. New therapies are needed that&#xD;
      will also minimize weight gain and correct dyslipidemia without compromising improvements in&#xD;
      glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigational Agent Trigonella Foenum Graecum, commonly known as Fenugreek, is a plant&#xD;
      that has been extensively used as a source of antidiabetic compounds, from its seeds, leaves&#xD;
      and extracts in different model systems. Fenugreek is traditionally used in India, especially&#xD;
      in the Ayurvedic and Unani systems.Preliminary animal and human trials suggest possible&#xD;
      hypoglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic properties of fenugreek seed powder taken orally.&#xD;
      Fenugreek seeds contain 50% fiber (30% soluble fiber and 20% insoluble fiber) that can slow&#xD;
      the rate of post-prandial glucose absorption. This may be a secondary mechanism for the&#xD;
      hypoglycemic effect.&#xD;
