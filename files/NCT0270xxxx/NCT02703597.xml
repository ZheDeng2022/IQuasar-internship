  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this study is that the addition of social influence strategies to a&#xD;
      web-based program called ASPIRE will boost its success in lowering intention to use tobacco&#xD;
      among adolescents and experiencing stronger positive social influence. The study will involve&#xD;
      a nested group randomized controlled trial with 376 adolescents from after-school programs in&#xD;
      Florida.&#xD;

    <description>ASPIRE Group contains participants with and without intent to use tobacco. Participants engage in five 70-minute sessions of ASPIRE spread over a period of 4 weeks (2 sessions in the last week). During ASPIRE use, participants face a screen and individually watch videos and engage in computer-based activities related to the negative effects of tobacco. During each session, participants will alternate between 10 minutes of ASPIRE use and 5-minute breaks.&#xD;
At baseline, after 2 sessions, following the last session of the intervention, and one month after the intervention has ended, participants complete psychosocial surveys and social network surveys. Also, baseline survey again completed.</description>

    <description>GSA-ASPIRE-Network Group contains participants with and without intent to use tobacco. In groups, participants engage in five 70-minute sessions of ASPIRE conducted over a period of 4 weeks (2 sessions in the last week). However, during each session, ASPIRE use is coupled with game-based social activities (GSAs). During ASPIRE use, participants watch videos and engage in computer-based activities on the same computer screen. During each session, participants will alternate between 10 minutes of ASPIRE use and 5-minute GSAs. Also, in groups, participants engage in the paper-based GSAs as a team and collaborate as they complete the activities. The GSAs contain games about the effects of tobacco. Groups are allocated based on adolescents' network of friendships.&#xD;
