  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic surgical procedures are becoming more common in all surgical specialties including&#xD;
      gynecology that was one of the pioneers in this field specialties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintaining a quality field of view is important not only to patient safety but also for the&#xD;
      quality of surgery and reduced surgery time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lenses of vision which are located at the distal end of the optical vision are during&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery in direct contact with the anatomical structures. These lenses are found&#xD;
      soiled by several phenomena whose appearance of a mist which constitutes a major obstacle to&#xD;
      a clear field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alteration of the vision requires the surgeon extraction optics in order to achieve a&#xD;
      cleaning of the lens. This cleaning is carried out as many times as necessary. Many&#xD;
      strategies have been developed to improve the quality of vision. These methods relate to both&#xD;
      the development of new optical vision but also the development of the lens cleaning material.&#xD;
      In practice, the cleaning is carried out using a sterile swab sterile saline associated with&#xD;
      the betadine iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a new material called &quot;FloShield Air System Vision System&quot; has been proposed and has&#xD;
      the particularity to combine both anti-fog product and a temperature control system in&#xD;
      contact with the lens in order to fight against condensation and smoke. The purpose of this&#xD;
      is to improve the quality of vision by reducing the fogging phenomenon and no change of the&#xD;
      temperature in contact with the lens (moisture reduction). Accordingly, it is assumed a&#xD;
      reduction in the number of stay and a reduction in the specific operative time associated&#xD;
      with this cleaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we wish to evaluate the effectiveness of FloShield Air System vision system&#xD;
      on the basis of a comparative, prospective, randomized against the reference method (sterile&#xD;
      water solution + Betadine) during endoscopic surgery gynecology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The reduction in vision during endoscopic surgery is a common problem for all surgical&#xD;
      specialties and recurring. Studies of the pathophysiological mechanisms explaining the visual&#xD;
      impairment by fogging emphasize the role of intraperitoneal temperature and moisture in&#xD;
      contact with the optical lens. To this can be added two other causes of impaired vision are&#xD;
      fluid projections and passively encountered tissues during exploration (eg, blood, fat, and&#xD;
      ascites) and products of reactions of tissue during surgery for example, the outcome of smoke&#xD;
      using coagulation material or section. In these situations the vision may be impaired in&#xD;
      critical times during which an optimal view is needed to improve the quality of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report by the World Health Organization was intended to identify the consequences of&#xD;
      impaired vision during laparoscopic surgery. It is emphasized that impaired vision can&#xD;
      contribute to surgical errors such as the use of a device incorrectly or displacement of the&#xD;
      instruments on structures other than those intended. Moreover, it is reported an increase in&#xD;
      the operative time associated with suboptimal view. Finally, the psychological dimension on&#xD;
      the disruption of the surgeon is raised with a risk of difficulty of the procedure. To&#xD;
      minimize these problems anti mist vision solutions combined with condensed water vapor spray&#xD;
      system are among others marketed in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The action mechanism of these systems is to distribute steam droplets condensed on the&#xD;
      surface of the cold lens to improve the quality of vision. Most, however, require cleaning of&#xD;
      optics, but with less theoretical frequency. Although their use is reported in the literature&#xD;
      their use has never been evaluated on the basis of a robust methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative methods readily available such as povidone iodine act similarly and are&#xD;
      significantly less expensive (at least 10 times) than the above mentioned materials. No&#xD;
      comparative study is currently available to support the effectiveness of these materials to&#xD;
      the reference method inexpensive but partially effective. Their use is based solely on&#xD;
      experience and expert opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vision device &quot;FloShield Air System&quot; was developed. We offer a comparative evaluation of the&#xD;
      effectiveness of FloShield Air System vision system on the basis of a comparative,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized against the reference method (sterile water + Betadine) during a&#xD;
      gynecologic endoscopic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to carry out a single-center, randomized, prospective trial comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      in terms of reducing the number of cleaning FloShield Air System vision system, from a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized during endoscopic surgery in gynecology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After evaluation of the International Register of Clinical Trials Registry&#xD;
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/about-site) of the National Institutes of Health American no&#xD;
      ongoing trial or released is interested or not interested at effectiveness of FloShield Air&#xD;
      System vision device during endoscopic surgery in gynecology specifically on the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only Recruiting trial which concerns the system is entitled &quot;Comparison&#xD;
      FloShield Air System Versus clearify Visualization System (D-HELP)) (NCT02419911).&quot; This is a&#xD;
      non-academic comparative prospective trial efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The originality of our protocol resides in five points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  His academic nature: the promoter is the University Hospital Tenon Hospital (AP-HP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It attempts to answer a clinical question frequently in clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feasibility: experience and surgical volume recruiting center in the endoscopic&#xD;
           management should help support the computing power.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Its safety for the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The methodological basis helps support a level I evidence for this new material&#xD;
