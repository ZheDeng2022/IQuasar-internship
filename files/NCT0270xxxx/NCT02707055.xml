      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormones are naturally occurring chemicals in the body. Ghrelin is a hormone that stimulates&#xD;
      appetite. It may also stimulate alcohol cravings and use. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about alcohol cravings and test if a drug that blocks ghrelin lowers alcohol cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if the drug PF-05190457 decreases alcohol craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18-70 who have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol use disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      No other serious medical problems&#xD;
&#xD;
      Woman must be postmenopausal or have had surgery to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay on the inpatient unit here at the Clinical Center for two 2-week&#xD;
      stages, which will be separated by at least 2 days. The inpatient phase include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking the study drug or placebo by mouth twice daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tasting several sweet solutions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smokers will smoke cigarettes through a device that gives information about how they smoke a&#xD;
&#xD;
      cigarette.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to alcohol, water, and food cues in a bar-like room. Participants answer questions&#xD;
      on a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure and heart rate are monitored through an arm cuff and sensors on the chest.&#xD;
      Saliva is collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      through cotton rolls in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRIs: Participants lie on a table that slides in and out of the cylinder, and a coil is&#xD;
      placed over the head.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They complete tasks on a computer screen while in the cylinder. This lasts up to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wearing a virtual reality headset, walking around a virtual room, and selecting virtual food&#xD;
      and drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 hour long follow-up visits in our Outpatient Clinic These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling to abstain from alcohol use. Sessions may be videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
      ...&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide that stimulates appetite and food intake. It is an&#xD;
      endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR1a). Preclinical studies&#xD;
      suggest that ghrelin modulates alcohol reward processing. Previous work from our research&#xD;
      team, indicated that intravenous (IV) ghrelin administration, compared to placebo, results in&#xD;
      an acute increase in alcohol craving during a cue-reactivity experiment in alcoholic&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore, an oral bioavailable, ghrelin receptor antagonist that is able to&#xD;
      pass through the blood brain barrier holds particular promise as a treatment for alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD). This protocol is part of a grant project funded by National Center for&#xD;
      Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) aimed to generate preliminary evidence in AUD on the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of a ghrelin receptor (GHSR1a) antagonist, PF-05190457, an existing&#xD;
      molecule available under the NIH-Industry Pilot Program at NCATS. Completed preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical (Protocol #14-AA-0042) work has demonstrated the safety of PF-05190457/alcohol&#xD;
      interaction. The goal of this protocol is to conduct a proof-of-concept human laboratory&#xD;
      study to assess an early-signal of efficacy of PF-05190457 in AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be AUD individuals (n = 55).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A within-subject, counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim will be to determine whether PF-05190457, compared to placebo, reduces&#xD;
      alcohol cue-elicited craving. The main secondary aim will be to determine whether&#xD;
      PF-05190457, compared to placebo, reduces brain blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response&#xD;
      during exposure to alcohol cues, during a task-based fMRI scan. We will also investigate the&#xD;
      effects of PF-05190457 on food craving as well as on food choices using a virtual buffet&#xD;
      experimental procedure. All these outcomes will be assessed in the inpatient Unit at the NIH&#xD;
      CC. After the inpatient portion of the protocol, patients will be followed-up as outpatients.&#xD;
      During the outpatient phase, patients will be offered motivational interviewing and video&#xD;
      feedback to explore the effects of this intervention, compared to supportive counseling, on&#xD;
      maintaining motivation for alcohol abstinence and inform future studies where medications&#xD;
      like PF-05190457 and behavioral treatments may be combined. The outpatient phase is optional&#xD;
      for treatment seeking and nontreatment seeking participants.&#xD;
