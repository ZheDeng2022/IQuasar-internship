      HeadSense (HS)-1000 device, a proprietary non-invasive brain monitor, is expected to safely&#xD;
      and accurately monitor physiological signs of the brain with minimal discomfort to patients,&#xD;
      providing information about normal or abnormal brain-related conditions and providing&#xD;
      decision-making support for physicians. The investigators hypothesize that the HS-1000 is&#xD;
      capable of detecting vasospasm using the raw acoustic data derived from the noninvasive&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an open-label, non-randomized, prospective study in patients with elevated&#xD;
      risk of vasospasm after stabilizing the patient and treating the subarachnoid hemorrhage&#xD;
      (SAH) to prevent further re-bleeds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each enrolled patient will be monitored with the HS-1000 device for a period of 10 minutes,&#xD;
      occurring daily, after completion of surgery for SAH. Following admittance to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit (ICU), patients will undergo routine monitoring as per standard of care.&#xD;
      Non-invasive recordings of 10 minutes in duration with HS-1000 device will be completed daily&#xD;
      for up to 14 days contingent on staff availability and the patient's clinical status. In the&#xD;
      event a monitoring session is interrupted or postponed, another attempt to re-monitor will be&#xD;
      made when the patient is able. Flexibility will granted in lieu of patient or study team&#xD;
      unavailability thereby allowing recording to be neglected for any given day if absolutely&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case the principle investigator (PI) or a member of the study team positively confirms&#xD;
      vasospasm based on clinical assessment or follow-up care of the patient during the monitoring&#xD;
      period, the patient will be recorded twice daily for up to a consecutive 14 days or for their&#xD;
      duration in the ICU. The PI will determine the severity of vasospasm as per the vasospasm&#xD;
      severity scale. Increased recording frequency will be implemented only for patients with&#xD;
      vasospasm graded as asymptomatic moderate-to-severe or symptomatic mild-to-severe (i.e. those&#xD;
      scoring 2a, 3a, 1s, 2s, or 3s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the HS-1000 recording session, the front-end will be placed in the patient's ears&#xD;
      and connected to the monitor. The acoustic signal propagates through the cranium, and&#xD;
      attenuates during its propagation. The receiving sensor in the other headset picks up the&#xD;
      acoustic signal. The receiving sensor converts the acoustical signal into a digital signal&#xD;
      and transmits it back to the monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each recording session with the HS-1000 will last 10 consecutive minutes, if the patient's&#xD;
      condition and clinical workflow permits. If required by the attending medical staff, the&#xD;
      recording can be stopped and restarted at a later time during the day. The HS-1000 will be&#xD;
      used as a seamless adjunctive, state-of-the-art, brain monitoring utility operating in&#xD;
      parallel with standard care intensive neurological monitoring modalities. The non-invasive&#xD;
      monitor will not replace or alter the standard care received by patients. Once all recordings&#xD;
      are completed, the brain monitoring signals will be saved in the study's database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily neurological checks and collection of all routine clinical and radiographic data as per&#xD;
      standard of care will be gathered as the gold standard data for statistical comparison.&#xD;
      Neurocognitive tests will be performed routinely every 8 hours by attending physicians to&#xD;
      assess for neuro-deterioration and radiological (Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and&#xD;
      Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) components. Data collected from patients will be&#xD;
      stripped of all personal health identifiers. Each subject will receive a unique identifying&#xD;
      patient number linking the individual to their deidentified clinical data set. Only the&#xD;
      medical staff attending to the patient's standard care will be knowledgeable to the identity&#xD;
      of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once data is collected, results of the HS-1000 recording sessions will be analyzed and&#xD;
      correlated with deidentified supporting clinical/radiological data to assist in the&#xD;
      identification of vasospasm-specific acoustic waveform patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deidentified supporting clinical data will consist of standard care intensive neurological&#xD;
      monitoring procedures currently used to confirm clinical diagnosis of vasospasm, principally&#xD;
      based on evidence of neuro deterioration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computed tomographic angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Digital subtraction angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neurocognitive clinical assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Routine clinical data as per standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study workflow and HS-1000 recording sessions will be fully compatible with and will not&#xD;
      alter the standard of care received by the patients in any way.&#xD;
