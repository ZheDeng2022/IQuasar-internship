      The LUCY Study is a prospective, consecutively enrolling, non-randomized multi center&#xD;
      post-market study to evaluate the Ovation Abdominal Platform when used in the endovascular&#xD;
      treatment of female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is freedom from access-related vascular complications and freedom from&#xD;
      AAA-related mortality through 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints of the study will be achieved by demonstrating the benefits in female&#xD;
      patients despite the fact that historically fewer female patients have been eligible for&#xD;
      EVAR, and they have experienced a higher rate of access-related complications and higher&#xD;
      mortality rates. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated through 1 year (365 ± 60 days)&#xD;
      post-procedure.&#xD;

             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of&#xD;
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification). ASA category IV patients may be enrolled&#xD;
             provided their life expectancy is greater than 1 year.&#xD;

             trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Patient has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of&#xD;
