      The aim of this study is to assess the pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor that could represent&#xD;
      possible mechanisms for its beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality. We will test&#xD;
      three different hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ticagrelor may increase ischemic preconditioning as compared to clopidogrel in patients&#xD;
           with stable coronary disease, showing multivessel coronary artery disease and undergoing&#xD;
           staged PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ticagrelor may improve microvascular perfusion in the myocardium of patients with&#xD;
           multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing staged PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ticagrelor may exert positive effects enhancing the paracrine modulation, migration,&#xD;
           homing and survival of hBMDSC, with a potential impact on the microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
           and on the protective response to ischemia (cellular preconditioning).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a reversibly binding, direct-acting, oral P2Y12 antagonist used for prevention&#xD;
      of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. It does not belong to&#xD;
      thienopyridines; it is a carbocyclic nucleoside, representing a &quot;first-in-class&quot;&#xD;
      cyclopentyl-triazolo-pyrimidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2 phase II studies, dyspnea was noted to occur as a side effect to ticagrelor in a&#xD;
      dose-dependent fashion; and in the PLATO study, there was a 6% absolute excess of dyspnea in&#xD;
      ticagrelor-treated patients compared with patients treated with clopidogrel. In the&#xD;
      ONSET/OFFSET study dyspnea was more commonly associated with ticagrelor therapy in comparison&#xD;
      with clopidogrel and placebo in patients with stable coronary artery disease (38.6%, 9.3%,&#xD;
      and 8.3%, respectively), but was not associated in this study with any adverse change in&#xD;
      cardiac or pulmonary function. This result was confirmed in patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms for this side effect are largely unknown, although early data indicate that&#xD;
      ticagrelor blocks adenosine reuptake through inhibition of ENT-1 by red blood cells, and it&#xD;
      is known that intravenous adenosine infusion can cause transient dyspnea in the absence of&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction. Another mechanism potentially increasing adenosine levels by ticagrelor&#xD;
      consists in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from red blood cells. Moreover, comparison&#xD;
      between ticagrelor and adenosine molecules suggests their similarity; Adenosine is a&#xD;
      well-known key endogenous molecule that regulates tissue functions by activating 4&#xD;
      G-protein-coupled adenosine receptors: A1, A2A, A2B, and A3. Adenosine accumulates in the&#xD;
      extracellular space in response to metabolic stress and cell damage; and elevations of&#xD;
      adenosine are found in ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, and trauma. Adenosine acts as&#xD;
      cytoprotector by its anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, cerebroprotective, antisclerotic,&#xD;
      and antifibrotic properties, as well as by platelet inhibition and vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was hypothesized that chronic adenosine overload induced by ticagrelor may contribute to&#xD;
      the vascular outcome benefit observed in PLATO, in addition to its inhibitory effect on&#xD;
      platelet activity via P2Y12 receptor blockade. Very recently, ticagrelor has been shown to&#xD;
      increase adenosine-induced physiological responses in human healthy subjects by shifting the&#xD;
      dose-response curve for adenosine-induced coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV) to the left&#xD;
      and, in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients treated with percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention and receiving a maintenance dose of ticagrelor, coronary blood flow&#xD;
      velocity augments to a greater degree compared with patients on a prasugrel maintenance dose&#xD;
      in response to increasing adenosine concentrations. These effects are also compatible with&#xD;
      adenosine reuptake blockage, another of the purported pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor. The&#xD;
      enhanced ticagrelor-related adenosine bioavailabilty may have beneficial effects through&#xD;
      three interrelated mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of preconditioning: Ischemic preconditioning, consisting in episodes of ischemia&#xD;
      as short as 5 minutes, followed by reperfusion, has been showed to protect the heart from a&#xD;
      subsequent longer coronary artery occlusion by markedly reducing the amount of necrosis.&#xD;
      Adenosine plays a key role in triggering ischemic preconditioning. Indeed, stimulation of A1&#xD;
      adenosine receptors triggers a complex pathway including the epsilon isoform of protein&#xD;
      kinase C, the ATP-dependent potassium channels, the mitochondrial permeability transition&#xD;
      pores as well as others, like a paradoxical protective release of oxygen radicals eventually&#xD;
      making cells more resistant to ischemia. In humans, examples of preconditioning are the&#xD;
      preinfarction angina and the angina &quot;warm-up phenomenon&quot;. Preconditioning can be reproduced&#xD;
      experimentally by repetitive balloon inflations in the coronary artery that have as principal&#xD;
      consequences less chest pain and ST-segment elevation. Pharmacological preconditioning can be&#xD;
      induced by intravenous or intracoronary administration of adenosine or A1 agonists of&#xD;
      adenosine. In a recent study in rabbits authors observed an anti-infarct effect of&#xD;
      clopidogrel and cangrelor (the intravenous analog of ticagrelor) and that it was not the&#xD;
      result from blockade of platelet aggregation, but rather from activation of the signal&#xD;
      transduction pathway of pre- and postconditioning, involving the reperfusion injury salvage&#xD;
      kinases (RISK) including Akt and ERK as well as adenosine A2B receptors, mitochondrial KATP&#xD;
      channels, and redox signalingi. This cardioprotective effect of cangrelor was confirmed in a&#xD;
      primate model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvement of coronary microvascular dysfunction. Coronary microvascular dysfunction has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to affect the prognosis of patients with acute coronary syndromes: Furber&#xD;
      et al described that Doppler flow velocity parameters in the infarct-related artery are of&#xD;
      prognostic value for long-term cardiac events. Additionally, Takahashi et al. found an&#xD;
      impaired coronary flow reserve velocity (CFVR) in the infarct-related artery to be&#xD;
      significantly associated with increased cardiac event rates at long-term follow-up.&#xD;
      Furthermore, microvascular function has been demonstrated to be altered even in non-ischemic&#xD;
      regions at distance from the infarcted myocardial tissue and van de Hoef et al. have recently&#xD;
      shown that microvascular dysfunction determined in the reference vessel after percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention is associated with a significantly increased long-term cardiac&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvascular dysfunction is likely to occur also in the setting of non ST-elevation acute&#xD;
      coronary syndromes (NSTEMI): Marzilli et al. found that in patients with unstable angina,&#xD;
      episodes of transient myocardial ischemia at rest are associated with a brisk increase in&#xD;
      coronary microvascular resistance and that this increase is prevented by the administration&#xD;
      of antiplatelet drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, microvascular dysfunction may also occur following successful coronary angioplasty:&#xD;
      coronary flow reserve has been shown to be impaired in the vascular bed subtended by the&#xD;
      treated artery and requires up to three months for this microvascular dysfunction to resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activation of cellular preconditioning. Human bone marrow derived stem (hBMDSC) have been&#xD;
      shown to have remarkable therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of the&#xD;
      therapeutic benefits must be multifaceted, involves enhanced expression, and release of&#xD;
      trophic/growth factors that provide autocrine and paracrine modulation and protection on the&#xD;
      adult human myocardium and stimulation of the endogenous regenerative responses. However,&#xD;
      when this class of cells are exposed into an ischemic environment, revealed reduced survival&#xD;
      rates and impaired angiogenic capacity. Exposure to sub-lethal hypoxia might impair the&#xD;
      intracellular signaling pathways involved in regenerative processes and may not provide a&#xD;
      resource of several trophic agents and growth factors that might play important role in cell&#xD;
      survival, angiogenesis, and differentiation of hBMDSC. Recently, in animal model of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, P2Y12 blocker cangrelor was shown to be a potent cardioprotective&#xD;
      modulator through mobilization of progenitor cells and protective signaling on myocytes and&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells rather than any effect on platelet aggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the pleiotropic effects of ticagrelor that could represent&#xD;
      possible mechanisms for its beneficial effects on cardiovascular mortality. We will test&#xD;
      three different hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ticagrelor may increase ischemic preconditioning as compared to clopidogrel in patients&#xD;
           with stable coronary disease, showing multivessel coronary artery disease and undergoing&#xD;
           staged PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ticagrelor may improve microvascular perfusion in the myocardium of patients with&#xD;
           multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing staged PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ticagrelor may exert positive effects enhancing the paracrine modulation, migration,&#xD;
           homing and survival of hBMDSC, with a potential impact on the microvascular dysfunction&#xD;
           and on the protective response to ischemia (cellular preconditioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial&#xD;
      that will enroll patients with multivessel, stable coronary artery disease undergoing&#xD;
      ischemia-related PCI (evaluated by stress test and/or FFR during coronary catheterization),&#xD;
      and requiring staged PCI. Patients that experience an acute coronary syndrome in multivessel&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, and that need to complete the revascularization in the non-culprit&#xD;
      vessel, may be considered stabilized after one month from the culprit vessel PCI, and&#xD;
      therefore may be enrolled. After the procedure the patients should be treated according to&#xD;
      local routines. Randomization will be blocked within each study site, in order to get an even&#xD;
      balance of patients randomized to either drug within each recruiting center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment to the present study will be proposed to 66 consecutive patients and will be&#xD;
      submitted for the approval of the local ethics committee and national regulatory authority&#xD;
      (AIFA) and will be carried out according to the Italian regulatory rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to the protocol and in strict compliance with ICH GCP,&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable regulatory requirements. Before the start of&#xD;
      the study, the study protocol, the investigator brochure and other applicable documents will&#xD;
      be submitted to independent Ethics Committees (EC) and responsible national and local&#xD;
      authorities, as required by each participating country's regulations. The study can start&#xD;
      only after the favourable opinion of the EC of the Coordinating Centre. The Coordinating&#xD;
      Centre will inform the investigators in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have&#xD;
      been met before the first patient is enrolled in the study. After the protocol has been&#xD;
      accepted, substantial amendments to this protocol require the approval by the Coordinating&#xD;
      Centre. After the end of the study, a final study report will be prepared and distributed to&#xD;
      regulatory authorities and ECs as required by applicable regulations. Before a patient can&#xD;
      participate in the study, patient's informed consent needs to be obtained according to GCP&#xD;
      and the legal requirements of the country concerned. Patient information sheet and consent&#xD;
      form must have been reviewed and approved by the responsible EC. The investigator or an&#xD;
      authorized designate will explain the nature, purpose, scope and course of the study,&#xD;
      including information on the investigational therapy, potential benefits and risks to the&#xD;
      patient. In addition to oral information, the patient will receive a written patient&#xD;
      information sheet containing all relevant information. Sufficient time will be allowed to&#xD;
      discuss any questions raised. Only after this process is completed, consent for participation&#xD;
      may be given. Consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedure and with&#xD;
      sufficient time before a study related intervention as per local requirements. The consent&#xD;
      form must be personally signed and dated by the individual giving consent and by the&#xD;
      investigator or designee who lead the informed consent process with the patient. The consent&#xD;
      form must be retained by the investigator as part of the study records. In addition, the&#xD;
      patient will receive a copy of the patient information sheet and a copy of his/her signed and&#xD;
      dated consent form. Confirmation that consent was obtained will also be documented in the&#xD;
      medical records and on the eCRF. Should a protocol amendment be made, the patient information&#xD;
      sheet may need to be revised to reflect the change(s) of the protocol. After the EC has&#xD;
      approved the revised information sheet and consent form, it is the responsibility of the&#xD;
      investigator to inform all active patients affected by the change, and to receive their&#xD;
      written consent for continuation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must be identifiable throughout the study at the study site. The investigator&#xD;
      will maintain a personal list of patient numbers and patient names for data reconciliation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: 1) comparison of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on delta (difference)&#xD;
      ST-segment elevation by intracoronary ECG during two-step sequential coronary balloon&#xD;
      inflation in the culprit vessel;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: 1) comparison of ticagrelor and clopidogrel on CFR, IMR and FFR measured&#xD;
      in the culprit vessel and reference vessel at the end of PCI. 2) angina score during coronary&#xD;
      balloon inflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and power calculation: Sample size: assuming an absolute difference&#xD;
      (delta) of 4 mm in the change of ST-segment shift from the first to the second balloon&#xD;
      inflation between the 2 groups, we calculated that 30 patients per group will be required to&#xD;
      have an 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between groups at p &lt;&#xD;
      0.05. Standard deviation (SD) of the primary endpoint is expected to be ~ 5,4 mm in each&#xD;
      treatment group. A total of 66 patients will be enrolled considering a total drop-out rate of&#xD;
      10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analysis to be made is a comparison of the primary and secondary endpoint&#xD;
      (continuous variables) between the two groups of 30 patients each, that will be evaluated&#xD;
      with Analysis of variance (ANOVA). The co-primary safety endpoint, being a frequency value,&#xD;
      will be analysed using Fisher test.&#xD;
