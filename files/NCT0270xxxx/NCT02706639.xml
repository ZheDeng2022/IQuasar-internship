      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA tells the body how to grow and function. Williams-Beuren syndrome (WS) and Supravalvular&#xD;
      Aortic Stenosis (SVAS) are rare diseases caused by changes in a part of a person s DNA.&#xD;
      Symptoms of both conditions include vascular problems including narrow blood vessels and&#xD;
      supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) or supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. Individuals with WS&#xD;
      may also have developmental challenges and personality differences. Researchers at the NIH&#xD;
      want to find out why only some people with WS and SVAS have severe symptoms. They want to&#xD;
      collect samples and data to see what DNA or environmental changes affect the severity of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the DNA differences or environmental changes that change the severity of WS and&#xD;
      SVAS from person to person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 0 85 with either WS, SVAS, and/or an SVAS-like condition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and people with WS must have a parent or legal guardian to consent or help answer&#xD;
      questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with questions and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a 60-minute visit. They will provide blood or saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They or their parent/guardian will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer questions about how WS and SVAS affect them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sign a form releasing their medical records for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant s regular doctor recommends surgery, researchers will ask the surgeon for skin&#xD;
      or tissue samples that they might otherwise discard. These will be used to create stem cells&#xD;
      to study in a lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For up to 20 years, participants will have annual questionnaires by phone, email, or mail&#xD;
      about their WS or SVAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be contacted if:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They need to provide a new blood or saliva sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers need any other data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a follow-up study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our goal with the Williams syndrome (WS) and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis (SVAS),&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and Tissue Bank is to collect enough samples from individuals&#xD;
      with this rare condition to ask questions about the genes that cause the many WS and SVAS&#xD;
      related phenotypes, and to determine the genetic and environmental changes that modify the&#xD;
      severity of disease from person to person. In addition, we would like to learn more about the&#xD;
      natural history of these conditions and if there are environmental or genetic signatures that&#xD;
      are associated with symptom presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol detailed here will provide for the collection of historical information,&#xD;
      laboratory and imaging data, DNA and tissue to perform these studies now and in the future.&#xD;
      Because technology changes rapidly and because this is a rare condition, our goal is to&#xD;
      generate a collection that will be available for analysis for many years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to DNA and tissue collection proposed, we would like to begin to use the&#xD;
      specimens collected here to continue to ask questions about modifiers of vascular disease&#xD;
      severity as well as effects on other organ systems in WS and SVAS.&#xD;
