  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ibalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that works by blocking HIV entry into the immune system&#xD;
      cells (CD4+ or T-cells) the virus typically infects. Ibalizumab is intended for use in&#xD;
      combination with other anti-HIV drugs in people with multi-drug resistant HIV and limited&#xD;
      treatment options. This study will collect further information on the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of intravenously administered (IV) ibalizumab combined with an optimized background regimen&#xD;
      for treating multi-drug resistant HIV-1 infection, and will provide continuing access to&#xD;
      ibalizumab for patients completing a prior ibalizumab clinical trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Participants will enroll into one of two study cohorts. Cohort 1 will provide continued&#xD;
      administration of IV ibalizumab for patients completing a prior ibalizumab clinical trial&#xD;
      (TaiMed-sponsored or Investigator-Sponsored). Patients will continue to receive IV infusions&#xD;
      of ibalizumab at the dosage assigned in the previous study - either 800 mg once every two&#xD;
      weeks, or 2000 mg once every four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will provide IV ibalizumab, 800 mg once every two weeks, for qualifying patients&#xD;
      with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 and limited treatment options who have never previously&#xD;
      received ibalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue in this study for 48 weeks, or until ibalizumab becomes&#xD;
      commercially available, whichever occurs first.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>This trial included multiple populations- Cohort 1 included subjects who were treated with ibalizumab and OBR on previous trials including TMB-301, TMB-202, and 2 subjects on expanded access. The Cohort 2 subjects were subjects with MDR resistant virus who were treated with OBR plus ibalizumab. No subjects completed the planned duration of study as the vast majority were switched to commercial supply of drug when the drug was approved by USFDA.</limitations_and_caveats>
