      Problems sleeping are common after exposure to highly threatening experiences and can occur&#xD;
      with and without a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Established treatments&#xD;
      for PTSD are limited for addressing insomnia and many insomnia treatments appear to be&#xD;
      limited in the context of PTSD. Suvorexant is FDA approved for insomnia and among approved&#xD;
      drugs has a unique mechanism of action that may be well suited for targetting arousal at&#xD;
      night dysregulated by trauma. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of suvorexant for&#xD;
      insomnia that developed in relation to trauma exposure, utilizing a placebo control, and&#xD;
      polysomnography to identify biomarkers of response, in a six week trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disturbed sleep is one of the most common and distressing responses to exposure to severe&#xD;
      trauma and can persist in many of those affected with and without accompanying posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD). Insomnia is a risk factor for many of the conditions that are&#xD;
      prevalent in trauma-exposed populations including PTSD, depression, and physical health&#xD;
      conditions such as obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Trauma-related insomnia (TRI) is not&#xD;
      typically differentiated in studies characterizing insomnia and its treatment, and insomnia&#xD;
      accompanying PTSD has been shown to be relatively refractory to the treatments that are&#xD;
      established for PTSD. Thus treatment of TRI presents an unmet need that has implications for&#xD;
      the large and growing groups of people exposed to trauma in terms of relieving distress and&#xD;
      preventing further psychiatric and medical morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the data on TRI comes from research on populations with PTSD. Difficulty initiating&#xD;
      and maintaining sleep is designated as one of the heightened arousal symptoms of PTSD in the&#xD;
      DSM. Sleep studies have suggested increased wake after sleep onset (WASO), reduced slow wave&#xD;
      sleep (SWS) in some PTSD populations and fragmented rapid eye movement (REM) sleep when PTSD&#xD;
      is developing, and during its more acute stages. Suvorexant is a first in class orexin&#xD;
      antagonist and is approved by the FDA for the indication of insomnia. Orexin antagonists&#xD;
      dampen the activity of a specific arousal enhancing system in the brain during sleep. In&#xD;
      rodent models suvorexant has been shown to enhance, and in healthy humans, to not affect slow&#xD;
      wave and REM activity (in contrast with traditional hypnotics which can diminish both).&#xD;
      Reducing arousal during sleep while reducing WASO and maintaining REM and slow wave sleep is&#xD;
      a promising profile for the treatment of TRI. We are therefore proposing a placebo controlled&#xD;
      evaluation to assess the efficacy of suvorexant for treating TRI with and without PTSD and&#xD;
      its tolerability in these populations. We will include polysomnography (PSG) in order to have&#xD;
      objective sleep outcomes and probe potential mechanisms and biomarkers predicting response.&#xD;
      The proposed study will meet the objective below and test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To evaluate the efficacy of suvorexant for participants that meet criteria for&#xD;
      insomnia and who identify a severely threatening event (DSM criterion A trauma) as a&#xD;
      precipitant or a factor that significantly exacerbated their sleep disturbance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that suvorexant will improve subjective and objective indices&#xD;
      of sleep disturbance; specifically, our primary outcome the polysomnographic (PSG) measure of&#xD;
      sleep efficiency will be increased in the group receiving suvorexant compared with the group&#xD;
      receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of suvorexant versus placebo on the secondary outcome measures of the Insomnia&#xD;
      Severity Index (ISI) scores and co-occurring symptoms of PTSD will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will include comparison of response patterns among those with versus&#xD;
      without significant symptoms of PTSD and relationships between increased in slow wave and&#xD;
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and improvement in ISI scores and PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse experiences and the tolerability of suvorexant in the recruited population with TRI&#xD;
      will also be evaluated.&#xD;
