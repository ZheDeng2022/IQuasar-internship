      Study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the double decidual sac sign to predict an&#xD;
      intrauterine pregnancy prior to ultrasonographic visualisation of embryonic contents using&#xD;
      modern ultrasound technology.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This diagnostic accuracy study will be conducted following the standards for reporting of&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy study (STARD) guidelines. Participants will be recruited from Nurture&#xD;
      Fertility, Nottingham, United Kingdom at the time of embryo transfer. If the subsequent&#xD;
      pregnancy test is positive, participants will be invited to attend for an additional&#xD;
      transvaginal ultrasound scan at 33-34 days gestation. This scan will be considered to be the&#xD;
      'index test'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index test will be performed by a single investigator with experience in early pregnancy&#xD;
      ultrasound following standard operating procedures using a Voluson E8 machine with a high&#xD;
      frequency (5-9MHz and 9-12MHz) transvaginal probe. During the early scan the presence or&#xD;
      absence of the following structures will be recorded: an intrauterine fluid collection&#xD;
      (defined as a uniformly round, hypoechoic structure with an echogenic rim); the double&#xD;
      decidual sac sign (DDSS) (defined as two concentric echogenic rings of tissue that surround&#xD;
      the intraendometrial fluid collection that impress upon the endometrial stripe); yolk sac&#xD;
      (defined as a spherical, hyperechoic ring situated eccentrically within the gestation sac);&#xD;
      and fetal pole (defined as a small linear echogenic structure adjacent to the yolk sac, on&#xD;
      the side closest to the gestational sac). If more than one intrauterine fluid collection is&#xD;
      visualized then each will be considered as a separate entity. The findings from the early&#xD;
      scan will be interpreted immediately and recorded separate to the main clinical notes.&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded further from the study if at this point no intrauterine fluid&#xD;
      collection is detected or if an intrauterine fluid collection containing a yolk sac or fetal&#xD;
      pole is identified. Referral pathways to local Early Pregnancy Assessment Units (EPAU) will&#xD;
      be in place for any woman in whom this early scan is strongly suggestive of an ectopic&#xD;
      pregnancy, for example if there was an empty endometrial cavity and either an inhomogenous&#xD;
      adnexal mass or an empty extra-uterine sac or a yolk sac or fetal pole with or without&#xD;
      cardiac activity in an extra-uterine sac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will then have a routine viability ultrasound scan at between 6 and 7 weeks&#xD;
      gestation as per the fertility unit's standard practice. This viability scan was performed by&#xD;
      an appropriately trained doctor or nurse following standard operating procedures and using&#xD;
      the same ultrasound equipment as the index test. This viability scan plus any subsequent&#xD;
      clinical follow-up required i.e. if the diagnosis was not certain following the viability&#xD;
      scan alone, will constituted the reference standard. Clinical follow-up will consist of a&#xD;
      repeat transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) 7-10 days after the initial viability scan in cases of&#xD;
      pregnancies of uncertain viability (defined as the presence of an intrauterine gestation sac&#xD;
      of less than 25mm mean diameter with no obvious yolk sac or fetal pole or an intrauterine&#xD;
      gestation sac containing a fetal pole of less than 7mm with no obvious fetal heart&#xD;
      pulsations) and in cases of pregnancies of uncertain location (defined as no evidence of an&#xD;
      intra- or extra-uterine pregnancy or retained products of conception on transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound scan in the presence of a positive urinary pregnancy test), referral to a local&#xD;
      EPAU for monitoring of serial serum human chorionic gonadotropin (Î²-hCG) levels and&#xD;
      subsequent ultrasonography and possibly surgery where indicated according to departmental&#xD;
      protocols until a definitive diagnosis can be made. Interpretation of the reference standard&#xD;
      will be performed by an experienced gynaecologist without knowledge of the findings from the&#xD;
      index test. Any uncertainty regarding the final diagnosis will be dealt with by seeking the&#xD;
      opinion of two other senior gynaecologists and gaining a consensus opinion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of interest are an intrauterine pregnancy (which may be viable or non-viable) or&#xD;
      an ectopic pregnancy. A viable intrauterine pregnancy is defined as ultrasonographic&#xD;
      identification of an intrauterine gestation sac with a fetal pole of any length with&#xD;
      demonstrable fetal heart pulsations. A non-viable intrauterine pregnancy is defined as either&#xD;
      an empty intrauterine gestation sac with mean sac diameter greater than 25mm or an&#xD;
      intrauterine gestation sac containing a fetal pole with crown rump length greater than 7mm&#xD;
      with no demonstrable fetal heart pulsations or in the absence of a viable embryo, no&#xD;
      significant increase in the growth of the gestation sac or length of the fetal pole on two&#xD;
      ultrasound scans performed more than 7 days apart. Where women undergo surgical or medical&#xD;
      management of miscarriage, histological confirmation of the products of conception will be&#xD;
      obtained when possible. Ectopic pregnancies will be confirmed either by direct visualisation&#xD;
      during surgery with histological confirmation, or, in those managed medically with&#xD;
      methotrexate or conservatively, unequivocal identification of an ectopic pregnancy on&#xD;
      ultrasound scan. Ultrasonographic appearances indicative of an ectopic pregnancy will&#xD;
      include: an empty endometrial cavity with either an inhomogenous adnexal mass or an empty&#xD;
      extra-uterine sac or a yolk sac or fetal pole with or without cardiac activity in an&#xD;
      extra-uterine sac. Following the reference standard, any pregnancy which does not fall into&#xD;
      one of these categories will be excluded from the study. These included resolving or&#xD;
      persisting pregnancies of unknown location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity and specificity of the DDSS for predicting an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP)&#xD;
      will be estimated following cross tabulation of the index test results against those of the&#xD;
      reference standard. The overall diagnostic accuracy, as well as positive and negative&#xD;
      likelihood ratios and predictive values, will also be calculated. Results will be expressed&#xD;
      as percentages for ease of interpretation and 95% confidence intervals will also be given.&#xD;
