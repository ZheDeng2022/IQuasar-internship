  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing spine surgery often have considerable pain post-operatively and&#xD;
      frequently require opioid medication (Percocet, Norco, oxycodone, morphine, etc.) to control&#xD;
      their pain postoperatively. The widespread use of opioids, however, is associated with a&#xD;
      number of side effects. These include: sedation, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation,&#xD;
      dizziness and itching amongst others. Some investigators have suggested that&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications (the same class of medicines as advil, ibuprofen, etc.) and&#xD;
      acetaminophen (Tylenol) can reduce the total dose of opioid required postoperatively and, as&#xD;
      a result, lower opioid-related side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test this hypothesis and determine if postoperative&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications and postoperative acetaminophen can reduce the amount of opioid&#xD;
      required to control pain following surgery. A secondary goal of this study is to examine if&#xD;
      the change in pain medication will lead to decreased overall pain levels, decreased&#xD;
      opioid-related side effects and improved function [quicker ambulation with physical therapy&#xD;
      (PT), earlier return to work, etc.].&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Given the potential for non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen to&#xD;
      decrease opioid requirements following spine surgery, the investigators propose a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial comparing the efficacy of intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) acetaminophen (Group A) or IV ketorolac (Group K) versus placebo (Group P). The impact&#xD;
      of treatment on perioperative opioid use, opioid-related complications, functional outcomes&#xD;
      and rates of pseudarthrosis following 1 or 2 level lumbar fusion surgery will be measured in&#xD;
      each group. The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on&#xD;
           immediate postoperative opioid requirements, postoperative pain levels and opiate&#xD;
           related symptoms using the Opiate-Related Symptom Distress Scale (ORSDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of IV ketorolac or IV acetaminophen use on&#xD;
           functional outcomes defined by return to work, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the&#xD;
           Veterans Rand-12 (VR-12) Health Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to determine the total postoperative opioid dose (in oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents) in each group. The investigators hypothesize that patients in Group A and Group&#xD;
      K will have lower total opioid use, suffer from fewer opiate related symptoms and have&#xD;
      similar rates of pseudarthrosis to patients in Group P. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      patients in Group A and Group K will have a quicker return to work and improved early&#xD;
      functional outcomes although they acknowledge that long term functional outcomes may be the&#xD;
      same for all groups.&#xD;
