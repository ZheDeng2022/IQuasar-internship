  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The preclinical and clinical evidence of safety and efficacy with the BACE device (concept&#xD;
      and feasibility) paved the way for the evaluation of the BACE device in this prospective,&#xD;
      multi-center, single-arm, self-controlled study for safety and efficacy in the treatment of&#xD;
      functional MR in a maximum of 60 adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint will be reduction of MR grade to 1+ or less from the baseline&#xD;
      MR grade through the 6 month study period. Primary safety endpoint will be freedom from major&#xD;
      device and surgery-related adverse events for the duration of the 6 month follow up period.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up to two years.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the BACE device&#xD;
      for the treatment of FMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to assess the ease of deployment of the BACE device Study Population:&#xD;
      Since this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new device, with no control arm or&#xD;
      comparator, the number of subjects enrolled will be a maximum of 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 8-10 sites are expected to be included in the study. The subject population is&#xD;
      adults of 18 to 80 years of age, either gender, with FMR as specified in the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
