  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to confirm that the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib in pediatric&#xD;
      participants is consistent with that in adults (part 1) and to assess efficacy (event-free&#xD;
      survival [EFS]) of ibrutinib in combination with rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      etoposide (RICE) or rituximab, vincristine, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and idarubicin (RVICI)&#xD;
      background therapy compared to RICE or RVICI background therapy alone (part 2).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),&#xD;
      open-label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and study staff), controlled&#xD;
      study which consists of two parts: Part 1 and Part 2. The Part 1 is a pharmacokinetic run-in&#xD;
      part, which will be conducted before starting the randomized part (Part 2) of the study and&#xD;
      Part 2 is a randomized and open-label study. Part 1 and Part 2 of the study will be conducted&#xD;
      in 3 phases: a Pretreatment (Screening) Phase (Up to 14 days before administration of study&#xD;
      drug), a Treatment Phase, and a Posttreatment Phase. The Treatment Phase will extend from&#xD;
      enrollment (in Part 1) or randomization (in Part 2) until 1 of the following: 1) completion&#xD;
      of 3 cycles of therapy, 2) transplantation, if clinically indicated, or 3) progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD), whichever comes first. The Posttreatment Phase will continue until death, loss&#xD;
      to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first. The end of study is&#xD;
      defined as when approximately 60 event-free survival (EFS) events have occurred in Part 2&#xD;
      (death, disease progression, or lack of complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] after&#xD;
      3 cycles of treatment based on blinded independent event review), or the sponsor terminates&#xD;
      the study, whichever comes first. Participants in Part 1 will be 1 to less than (&lt;) 18 years&#xD;
      old. Participants in Part 2 will be 1 to 30 years old. Participants will be primarily&#xD;
      evaluated for pharmacokinetics in part 1 and efficacy (EFS) of ibrutinib in combination with&#xD;
      RICE or RVICI background therapy compared to RICE or RVICI background therapy alone in part&#xD;
      2. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
