  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how much DHA to give to mothers in order to provide&#xD;
      enough to the baby. Researchers will also learn if there are differences in development of&#xD;
      the baby up to 12 months after birth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an essential nutrient. Our bodies make DHA from the foods we&#xD;
      eat. If we eat foods with a lot of DHA, like fatty ocean fish, we have more DHA in our&#xD;
      bodies. DHA is found in all cells of the body but is especially high in nerve cells of the&#xD;
      brain and eye. Babies get DHA from the mother when they're in the womb. After birth, they can&#xD;
      get DHA from breast milk or infant formulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll pregnant women and follow them and their baby until the baby is 12&#xD;
      months old. Changes in the development of the baby will be tracked. Half of the participants&#xD;
      in this study will receive 200mg of DHA to take daily. The other half of participants will&#xD;
      receive 800mg of DHA to take daily. Participants, along with the researchers, will not know&#xD;
      which dose of DHA they are receiving.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Delivery (birth)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal blood samples and infant cord blood will be collected at delivery and Red Blood Cell (RBC) DHA concentrations between maternal-infant pairs will be compared. Maternal-Infant DHA Equilibrium occurs if newborn cord blood DHA is less than or equal to the mother's DHA at delivery.</description>
