  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 250 million courses of antibiotics are prescribed annually in the ambulatory care&#xD;
      setting in the United States alone, including more than 40 million in children under 18 years&#xD;
      of age. The perception that antibiotic use has minimal attendant adverse side effects&#xD;
      contributes to the over-utilization of antibiotics in clinical circumstances when they are&#xD;
      not strictly indicated. We have learned much about the human microbiome. The emerging view is&#xD;
      of profound life-long bi-directional interactions between our microbiota and our cells.&#xD;
      Perturbations in the microbiota affect metabolic, immune, and cognitive physiology in&#xD;
      experimental animal models. When a person takes an antibiotic, the antibiotic diffuses via&#xD;
      the blood into all body compartments, selecting for resistance. We propose to examine the&#xD;
      effects of two commonly used antibiotics (the beta-lactam, amoxicillin and the macrolide&#xD;
      azithromycin) on human microbial populations and on metabolic and immune physiology, studying&#xD;
      healthy human volunteers in a randomized controlled clinical trial at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center. Our hypothesis is that in addition to acutely perturbing the human microbiome, these&#xD;
      agents will have measurable metabolic and immunologic effects, with residual effects in the&#xD;
      weeks that follow. To test this hypothesis, we will assess the effects of a brief therapeutic&#xD;
      course of antibiotics on microbiome and metagenome composition. After an initial evaluation&#xD;
      period, antibiotics will be given for 7 days or 5 days (depending on the antibiotic), and&#xD;
      there will be a post-treatment evaluation. A control group will receive no drug intervention.&#xD;
      Specimens will be obtained from multiple sites at each of 10 time points occurring before,&#xD;
      during, and after antibiotic administration, and used for estimating bacterial and fungal&#xD;
      composition and gene content. We will also assess the effects of the antibiotic course on&#xD;
      markers of innate and adaptive immunity as well as markers of metabolic and hormonal&#xD;
      physiology. A subgroup of subjects will be studied in the clinical center metabolic chamber&#xD;
      to assess 24-hour energy expenditure and its components (sleeping, diet-induced, and activity&#xD;
      energy expenditure), as well as macronutrient oxidation rates (carbohydrate, fat, and&#xD;
      protein), during 3 of the 10 study visits. In addition to the primary data analyses, we will&#xD;
      build a model that integrates the temporal data to begin to understand the complex&#xD;
      intertwined physiology between microbiome and host.&#xD;
