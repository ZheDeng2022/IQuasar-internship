      In this multi-centre prospective randomized controlled trial the efficacy of segmental&#xD;
      acupuncture in the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections will be assessed. The&#xD;
      study (acupuncture) group will receive 12 acupuncture treatments according to a standardized&#xD;
      protocol, plus recommendation for use of cranberry products. The control group will receive&#xD;
      recommendation for use of cranberry products only.&#xD;

      1. Background 1.1. Urinary tract infection&#xD;
&#xD;
           Urinary tract infections (UTI) are considered to be the most common bacterial&#xD;
           infections, with approximately 80% of all UTIs occurring in women (1). Nearly one in&#xD;
           three women is expected to have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24 years and&#xD;
           almost half of all women will experience one UTI during their lifetime (2). Recurrence&#xD;
           affect approximately 20-30% of women with initial UTI, although recurrence rates vary&#xD;
           widely (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recurrent UTIs are a common problem seen in clinical practice with important medical,&#xD;
           social and financial implications. Prophylaxis of recurrent UTI is an ongoing challenge&#xD;
           with several different management strategies being used (4). Low dose antibiotic&#xD;
           prophylaxis for several months is effective, but fosters the development of antibiotic&#xD;
           resistance of the causative microorganisms, but also the commensal flora.(4-8). In&#xD;
           postmenopausal women vaginal estrogen therapy reduces symptomatic UTI episodes (1, 7).&#xD;
           Further prevention strategies include the oral immunostimulant OM-89, the vaginal&#xD;
           vaccine Urovac, lactobacilli prophylaxis, cranberry products and acupuncture (5, 7, 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2.Cranberry products Cranberries have been used in the prevention of UTIs for many&#xD;
           years. Cranberries contain two compounds with antiadherence properties that prevent&#xD;
           fimbriated Escherichia coli from adhering to uroepithelial cells in the urinary tract&#xD;
           (10). A recent review of 24 studies showed that the use of various cranberry products&#xD;
           may have a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, although differences were not&#xD;
           statistically significant (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Acupuncture treatment The effectiveness of acupuncture has been established for a&#xD;
           series of different conditions (12, 13). Up to date there are only two clinical trials&#xD;
           studying the effect of acupuncture on the prevention of recurrent UTI, both conducted&#xD;
           from the same research group. In one controlled trial of 67 adult women acupuncture was&#xD;
           significantly more effective in preventing recurrent UTI compared to sham acupuncture&#xD;
           than no treatment over an observation period of 6 months (14). In the second trial of&#xD;
           100 women acupuncture, administered twice weekly for 4 weeks, was significantly more&#xD;
           effective in reducing the number of UTIs, but also in reducing the volume of residual&#xD;
           urine. Acupuncture points were chosen according to patientsÂ´ individual diagnoses&#xD;
           following traditional Chinese medical patterns. (15)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study aims The present study aims to compare acupuncture treatment with standard&#xD;
           treatment (recommendation for cranberry intake) in the treatment of uncomplicated&#xD;
           recurrent UTIs in women and is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial. We&#xD;
           will assess the number of acute lower UTIs and subsequent treatment, the type and amount&#xD;
           of self medication (cranberry products and others), health related quality of life and&#xD;
           treatment satisfaction within a defined period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The results from this study will help to guide clinical practice with level I evidence&#xD;
           and allow for effective treatment with regard to patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods/ Workplan This patient oriented non-profit clinical study is designed as a&#xD;
           randomised controlled trial (6 months) with a follow-up period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active recruitment: 12 months Randomised controlled trial: 6 months Short-term Follow-up: 12&#xD;
      months 3.1. Active recruitment After Ethics Committee approval patient recruitment will be&#xD;
      started. Information material about the study, including contact details, will be provided at&#xD;
      the outpatient clinics of the Dep. of Gynecology, the Dep. of Urology, and other local health&#xD;
      care providers. During an initial visit patients will be informed about the study and&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criterias will be evaluated. A structured medical history, including&#xD;
      assessment of previous UTIs and other urogenital tract symptoms, will be obtained. After&#xD;
      written informed consent is obtained participants will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Randomized Controlled Trial (6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of randomization patients must not have signs or symptoms of an acute UTI, and&#xD;
      must not currently receive antibiotic treatment. Randomizing will be done electronically&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.at). Patients will be randomized in one of two treatment groups without&#xD;
      stratification with a planned ratio of 1:1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acupuncture treatment group 12 acupuncture treatments according to a standardized&#xD;
           protocol plus recommendation for use of cranberry products&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard treatment group Recommendation for use of cranberry products only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted bimonthly by telephone and asked about occurrence of UTIs,&#xD;
      adverse events, study adherence and completion of study diary. At 6 months a control visit&#xD;
      will be scheduled, the RCT will be completed and the main outcome parameter (number of women&#xD;
      with no acute UTIs) and secondary outcome parameters (9.2.) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by a 12 months short-term Follow-up. 3.3. Short-term Follow-up (12&#xD;
      months) Patients of both treatment groups may use any prophylactic treatment. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted bimonthly by telephone and asked about occurrence of UTIs, adverse events,&#xD;
      and use of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for UTIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed according to the 2010 CONSORT guidelines(16) and the STRICTA (Standards&#xD;
      for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture) guidelines (17).&#xD;
