      The investigators are doing this research to see if they can use small tissue samples or&#xD;
      fluid to develop a test that will determine if the tissue samples are related or not related&#xD;
      to each other. The test will use the patient's DNA, which is part of their unique genetic&#xD;
      material that carries the instructions for the body's development and function. Cancer can&#xD;
      result from changes in a person's genetic material that causes cells to divide in an&#xD;
      uncontrolled way and, sometimes, to travel to other organs. Currently, researchers and&#xD;
      doctors know some of the genetic changes that can cause cancer, but they do not know all of&#xD;
      the genetic changes that can cause cancer.&#xD;

      A frequent clinical dilemma in lung cancer care is the management of multifocal lung cancers.&#xD;
      The management decision is based on determining if multiple cancers represent true&#xD;
      independent primary cancers or related metastasis. This determination is critical to the&#xD;
      appropriate staging of the cancers and treatment. Indeed, this distinction represents the&#xD;
      difference between aggressive local therapy with either surgery or radiation therapy for&#xD;
      primary early stage lesions, or palliative chemotherapy or best supportive care with&#xD;
      appropriate symptom management for advanced stage metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No existing pathologic or molecular test is currently capable of making the distinction&#xD;
      between multiple independent lung primaries from metastatic disease with accuracy. The recent&#xD;
      release of preliminary data from the NLST screening trial, suggesting survival benefit for&#xD;
      screening high risk patients with CT scanning, will only increase the number of patients&#xD;
      facing these treatment dilemmas. The research team has recently developed a test that allows&#xD;
      this distinction with great accuracy. This test allows determination of lineage between two&#xD;
      tumors using the identification of large genomic rearrangements using mate pair next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (MP). The test has been developed using fresh frozen tissue from&#xD;
      resected lung tumors and is currently being validated for a clinical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' goal is to develop the test using cytology and small biopsy specimens.&#xD;

      The patient will have some or all of the samples taken listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample of 10 ml (2 teaspoons).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to two lung bronchoscopic or transbronchoscopic needle aspiration biopsies will be&#xD;
           given to the research study during an already scheduled bronchoscopy. In addition at the&#xD;
           time of the bronchoscopy a brushing or washing specimen could be collected for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A piece of lung or lymph node tissue taken at the time of the CT guided lung or lymph&#xD;
           node biopsy will be given to the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A piece of lung tumor tissue removed during surgery will be given to the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If pleural fluid is removed as part of the procedure(s) and there is any fluid left&#xD;
           after what is needed for your clinical care, it will be given to the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DNA genome sequencing will be performed on the collected tissues, blood and fluid.&#xD;
