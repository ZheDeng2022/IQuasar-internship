    <textblock>
      This study conducted in order to validate the functionality and accuracy of the smARTrack™&#xD;
      System in a real-life ICU setting. The smARTrack™ Feeding Tube System is a novel system with&#xD;
      nasogastric tube developed by ART Healthcare Ltd, based on sensor-lined tubes that transmit&#xD;
      real-time information to an external console. The smARTrack™ feeding tube is equipped with&#xD;
      reflux sensors which alert when gastric contents regurgitating into the esophagus. In&#xD;
      addition, the smARTrack™ feeding tube is equipped with sensors designed to provide&#xD;
      information about the location of the tube thus assisting in reducing the incident of&#xD;
      misplacement during first positioning. The smARTrack™ feeding tube is also automatically and&#xD;
      in real-time stops feeding if the feeding tube moves out of position during ongoing use or&#xD;
      detect gastric content in esophagus. Furthermore, smARTrack™ Feeding Tube System can guide&#xD;
      operator to correctly re-position the tube.&#xD;
