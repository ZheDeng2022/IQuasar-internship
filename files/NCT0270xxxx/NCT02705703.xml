  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of Tumor Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPA) pulsed&#xD;
      dendritic cell injections as a potential consolidation therapy for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      solid malignancies (SM). The investigators hypothesize that treatment of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic SM who demonstrate a tumor response, or whose disease remains stable, after&#xD;
      conventional first-line systemic therapy AND who lack an available, potentially curative&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention and whose tumor cells and/or blood express at least one (1) TAPA of&#xD;
      a defined panel of TAPAs will result in TAPA-specific T-cell responses without significant&#xD;
      toxicities. The investigators also hypothesize CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses generated&#xD;
      against specific TAPAs may translate into clinical antitumor activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with metastatic solid malignancies (SM), who have responded or whose&#xD;
      disease remains stable following first line systemic therapy, and without available,&#xD;
      potential curative therapeutic options, will be candidates for this Phase I/II study.&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients who agree to participate and sign a consent form will have&#xD;
      their neoplastic cells and/or blood analyzed for the expression of a specific panel of Tumor&#xD;
      Associated Peptide Antigens (TAPAs), including Sp17, ropporin, AKAP-4, PTTG1, Span-xb,&#xD;
      Her-2/neu, HM1.24, NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-1. Patients whose tumors express one (1) or more of&#xD;
      these TAPAs will receive three (3) days of subcutaneous Granulocyte Macrophage Colony&#xD;
      Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) to increase bone marrow production of monocytes and dendritic&#xD;
      cell (DC) precursors, and whole blood will be obtained by phlebotomy and/or leukapheresis for&#xD;
      generation of autologous DCs. Patient's DCs will be generated in Kiromic's Cell Processing&#xD;
      Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) facility, according to established Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures, and activated by pulsing/loading them with the TAPA(s) relevant for each&#xD;
      particular patient. Patients will receive five (5) days of low-dose cyclophosphamide prior to&#xD;
      each vaccination with TAPA-pulsed DCs to decrease Treg activity. TAPA-pulsed DCs will be&#xD;
      administered at a fixed dose of up to 1 X 107 DCs at least two (2) days following&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide administration. DC vaccination schedule will be once every fourteen (14)&#xD;
      days via subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) injections for a total of 6 vaccinations. Low&#xD;
      dose GM-CSF will also be administered SC for five (5) consecutive days, starting three (3) to&#xD;
      six (6) hours after each TAPA-pulsed DC treatment, to optimize immune responses. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed on a weekly basis (or more frequently if required) to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity. Immune responses and anti-tumor responses will be evaluated per&#xD;
      protocol specifications. Continuation and stopping rules for the study will be defined based&#xD;
      on toxicity/tolerability (Phase I) and/or immune responses (Phase II).&#xD;

    <description>A cycle of low-dose cyclophosphamide (100mg/day) by mouth for 5 days starting seven 7 days prior to the DC vaccine cycle to reduce Treg activity. Low-dose cyclophosphamide will be taken every 14 days for six 6 cycles. A total of 6 vaccines containing 1 x 10^7 TAPA-pulsed DC will be administered SQ every 14 days. The DC vaccine is given on Day 1 of the DCV cycle plus low-dose GM-CSF 50mcg/day SQ x 5 days (Day 1 to Day 4). GM-CSF is administered for 5 days to increase monocyte production and dendritic cell precursors to optimize immune responses.</description>
