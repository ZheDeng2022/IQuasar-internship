  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is evaluating NEOX®CORD 1K, a cryopreserved human umbilical cord allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, incidence and rate of wound closure&#xD;
      following application of the product compared to standard of care in the treatment of&#xD;
      difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 114 patients presenting with a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) that is&#xD;
      located below the malleoli (plantar only) of at least 4 weeks in duration and a size of at&#xD;
      least 0.5 cm2 up to 5.0 cm2 for plantar wounds meeting all inclusion criteria but none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria will be recruited from different trial sites. All patients will receive&#xD;
      sharp debridement to remove non-viable tissue followed by standard of care including a&#xD;
      sponsor approved standard dressing with a non-adherent wound contact layer, a foam pad or&#xD;
      gauze for moderately draining wounds, a secondary bandage, and off-loading device specific to&#xD;
      plantar wounds. Eligible patients return at two consecutive visits approximately two weeks&#xD;
      apart to assess wound closure. Patients that exhibit a change of less than 30% reduction of&#xD;
      the original surface area of their target wound two weeks after the screening visit following&#xD;
      debridement will be randomized into the control group or the treatment group at this baseline&#xD;
      visit, Week 1. The control group will continue to receive the standard of care and the&#xD;
      treatment group will receive standard of care and NEOX® CORD 1KTM. At each weekly visit, all&#xD;
      wounds will be adequately debrided of devitalized and necrotic tissue, and the wound dressing&#xD;
      will be replaced. For the treatment group, application of NEOX® CORD&#xD;
&#xD;
      1KTM will be considered at each weekly treatment visit following the Investigator's&#xD;
      assessment of wound progression. If the Investigator determines it is medically necessary,&#xD;
      additional NEOX® CORD 1KTM will be applied, up to and including Week 12 for a maximum of no&#xD;
      more than 10 applications. All wounds that close before Week 13 will be followed for an&#xD;
      additional two consecutive weekly visits approximately to confirm closure before exiting the&#xD;
      trial. Patients who experience closure at the Week 13 visit will be followed for an&#xD;
      additional two consecutive visits up to Week 15 to confirm closure. Patients who do not&#xD;
      experience wound closure prior to Week 13 will be considered a failure and complete the end&#xD;
      of study/Withdrawal Visit 15 exiting the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each weekly visit, efficacy will be assessed by the extent of wound closure as determined&#xD;
      by the wound surface area and volume measured by an electronic measurement device&#xD;
      (Silhouette®, ARANZ Medical), after debridement if performed, using a standardized protocol.&#xD;
      After confirmation of closure, or at Visit 15, all patients will complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by clinical laboratory tests at screening and at End of&#xD;
      Study/Withdrawal Visit 15, adverse event (AE) collection, and focused physical exams.&#xD;
