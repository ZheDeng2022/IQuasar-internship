  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-site, Phase 1/2a clinical trial is an open-label study to identify the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of a repeated dose regimen of NEO100 (perillyl alcohol) for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with radiographically-confirmed progression of Grade IV glioma or&#xD;
      recurrent primary or secondary Grade IV glioma. The study will have two phases, Phase 1 and&#xD;
      Phase 2a. Phase 1 is a standard cohort dose escalation 3+3 design used to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose for Phase 2a. There will be up to 24 patients enrolled in Phase 1.&#xD;
      There will be 25 patients enrolled in Phase 2a. For both phases of the study, NEO100 will be&#xD;
      self-administered four times daily for a 28-day treatment cycle up to six cycles until&#xD;
      disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. At the completion of cycle six,&#xD;
      patients will be given the option to continue receiving compassionate use treatment&#xD;
      cycles.This is the first nasal administration in the US, after prior oral studies with&#xD;
      perillyl alcohol proved ineffective. Nasal administration of perillyl alcohol is on-going in&#xD;
      Brazil&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perillyl alcohol has previously been tested in 15 clinical studies in &gt; 600 subjects This&#xD;
      includes 13 studies in 255 subjects using oral administration sponsored by the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute and two studies in &gt; 350 subjects using intranasal administration in Brazil.&#xD;
      NEO100 is a highly purified (&gt;99%) form of perillyl alcohol. Studies in Brazil suggest&#xD;
      improved survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Doses of 96 mg qid, 144mg qid,&#xD;
      192mg qid, and 288 mg qid administered intranasally to patients with recurrent GBM for up to&#xD;
      6 months, disease progression or death. From 3 to 6 patients will be evaluated after first&#xD;
      cycle (28 days) until MTD is reached. MRI with gadolinium will be at base line, and at the&#xD;
      beginning of even cycles. A total of 25 patients will be treated at the MTD. PK studies will&#xD;
      be conducted during Phase 1 at first dosing, and after first dose of 3rd cycle.&#xD;
