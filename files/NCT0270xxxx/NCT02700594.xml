    <textblock>
      Patients with painful knee conditions often present with hip muscle weakness. This weakness&#xD;
      can lead to, and perpetuate, knee problems. Diminished strength causes movement impairments&#xD;
      that can lead to pathology, functional limitations and disablement. In some cases, this hip&#xD;
      muscle weakness is not caused by simple disuse and muscle shrinkage (atrophy). Hip weakness&#xD;
      may be caused by an inhibitory mechanism that limits the force output of a muscle. The&#xD;
      inhibition is reflexive and is in response to pain or joint dysfunction. Joint&#xD;
      mobilization/manipulation can quickly reduce pain and improve joint function, possibly&#xD;
      decreasing inhibition and increasing strength. Joint mobilization/manipulation may facilitate&#xD;
      strength recovery. By restoring strength sooner, the patient may avoid the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of prolonged muscle weakness and achieve quicker or better outcomes.&#xD;

      Patients with knee pain often present with hip muscle weakness. Hip muscle weakness can cause&#xD;
      faulty hip mechanics that contribute to adverse knee joint kinematics. The gluteus maximus is&#xD;
      the largest hip muscle and its primary actions are extension and external rotation of the hip&#xD;
      joint. Gluteus muscle weakness was associated with varied knee injuries, including&#xD;
      patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      sprains. In 2 systematic reviews that have assessed subjects with anterior knee pain, the&#xD;
      authors found strong evidence for impaired hip extensor muscle strength and activation. In a&#xD;
      prospective cohort study, weak hip external rotation strength was associated with the&#xD;
      development of anterior knee pain and the hip strength further diminished after pain started.&#xD;
      There is evidence supporting gluteal muscle strengthening for the management of anterior knee&#xD;
      pain. Some authors argue that gluteal muscle weakness may be caused by muscle inhibition and&#xD;
      not simple disuse atrophy. This reflexive muscle inhibition is neural-mediated and driven by&#xD;
      pain or joint dysfunction. Joint mobilization/manipulation reduces pain and improves joint&#xD;
      function and may help maximize strength by reducing inhibition. Yerys et. al. (2002)&#xD;
      demonstrated that hip joint mobilization caused an immediate 14% increase gluteus maximus&#xD;
      strength and Makofsky (2007) found an immediate 17% increase in gluteus medius strength after&#xD;
      hip joint mobilization. Both of these studies, however, used asymptomatic subjects and their&#xD;
      results may not translate to symptomatic patients. Chilibeck (2011) found an immediate 14%&#xD;
      increase in hip extension strength, and 12% in hip abduction, after lumbar spine thrust joint&#xD;
      manipulation. This study also used an asymptomatic sample. In addition, thrust joint&#xD;
      manipulation is used less frequently in physical therapy practice compared to nonthrust joint&#xD;
      mobilization. The scientific objective for this research is to assess the effect of spine and&#xD;
      hip joint mobilization on hip muscle strength in patients with knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to answers the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does hip joint mobilization immediately improve hip muscle strength in patients with&#xD;
           knee pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does spinal joint mobilization immediately improve hip muscle strength in patients with&#xD;
           knee pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does hip or spinal joint mobilization create a greater improvement on hip muscle&#xD;
           strength in patients with knee pain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot, prospective clinical trial will use a randomized clinical trial design. The&#xD;
      primary dependent variable is isometric muscle strength, measured in pounds, an interval&#xD;
      level of measurement. Muscle strength will be determined by the maximum voluntary contraction&#xD;
      (MVC) and measured by an electronic hand-held dynamometer. Hand-held dynamometric muscle&#xD;
      testing has demonstrated good intrarater reliability and validity when compared to Biodex&#xD;
      dynamometry. Although there is no established minimal clinically important change (MCID)&#xD;
      score for strength testing, some authors have suggested a 10% change in strength to be&#xD;
      clinically significant. Pain will be measured at the ordinal level with the numeric pain&#xD;
      rating scale (NRPS). Investigators will recruit subjects from routine clinical practice&#xD;
      within the NYULMC-CMC. The outcomes variables (isometric muscle strength and strength) will&#xD;
      be measured before and after the intervention at the initial evaluation visit. After these&#xD;
      measures are obtained, the participation in the study is complete. There is no follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>Prone posterior-to-anterior Grade IV hip joint mobilization: The subject will be placed in prone on a treatment table. The intervening physical therapist will place the heel of his hand on the greater trochanter of the femur on the involved side provide rhythmic anterior-directed force. The subject will receive 3 bouts of 30 seconds of continuous mobilizations with 10 seconds rest in between bouts. For the prone posterior-to-anterior Grade IV hip joint mobilization, the intervening therapist will perform all 3 bouts in the same position.</description>

    <description>Mobilization and manipulation are manual therapy techniques&quot; comprising a continuum of skilled passive movements to the joints and/or related soft tissues that are applied at varying speeds and amplitudes, including a small-amplitude/high- velocity therapeutic movement.&quot;16 The term joint mobilization, or nonthrust mobilization, often refers to slow, &quot;rhythmic, repetitive passive movements to the patients' tolerance, in voluntary and/or accessory range and graded according to examination findings.&quot;</description>
