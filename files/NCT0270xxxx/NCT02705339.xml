  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though patients whose tumors harbor EGFR T790M mutation appear to benefit from rociletinib,&#xD;
      there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to primary and acquired&#xD;
      resistance to rociletinib. The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial of&#xD;
      rociletinib of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations (including exon&#xD;
      19 deletion or L858R mutation), with or without EGFR T790M mutation. In these patients,&#xD;
      pre-treatment and post-progression biopsy specimens will be subjected to genomic analysis to&#xD;
      fully understand the clonal evolution and the molecular mechanisms underpinning treatment&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
