      Single arm one stage Phase II study: post 4-6 cycles platinum doublet chemotherapy for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) offering Pembrolizumab as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy to non-progressors with primary endpoint: Immune Related Progression Free&#xD;
      Survival (irPFS) at 1 year. Aim to show that this is at least 25% (compared to an expected&#xD;
      12% 1 year PFS based on the Pemetrexed and Erlotinib maintenance trials).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no data on maintenance therapy with PD1/PDL1 inhibitors in NSCLC. After&#xD;
      an initial response / stable disease to first line chemotherapy, non progressors / candidates&#xD;
      for maintenance treatment, represent an ideal setting / patient group to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab given that chemotherapy results in antigen release, hence it has the potential&#xD;
      to augment immune checkpoint blockade, and following disease cytoreduction, this represents a&#xD;
      lower disease burden setting, that may suit checkpoint inhibition better given the recent&#xD;
      studies in Prostate cancer with Ipilimumab and Melanoma with Pembrolizumab(suggesting better&#xD;
      outcomes for patients with less extensive disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: percentage of patients that have not progressed at 1 year using immune&#xD;
      related radiological criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients to be treated with fixed dose 200mg iv Pembrolizumab until unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, disease progression or completion of 2 years therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan Summary The study employs a one stage phase II Fleming's design&#xD;
      using irPFS at 1 year as primary endpoint. Using response hypotheses of H0 &lt; 12 % and Ha&gt; 25%&#xD;
      i.e. that the irPFS at 1 year for the maintenance Pembrolizumab arm is 25%, compared to 12%&#xD;
      in the normal chemotherapy maintenance arm, with a significance level (i.e., the probability&#xD;
      of rejecting H0 when it is true) α=0.05 and the power (i.e. the probability of deciding the&#xD;
      regimen is active) is 0.8 when true response rate is 25%, 48 patients are required to be&#xD;
      entered into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entry Criteria Diagnosis/Condition for Entry into the Trial In order to be eligible for trial&#xD;
      entry, patients must have a diagnosis of metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, and should&#xD;
      not have progressed after first line palliative chemotherapy with a platinum doublet. They&#xD;
      should have received no more than six (6) cycles of a platinum doublet chemotherapy, and&#xD;
      should be able to receive treatment within three (3) to six (6) weeks from the last&#xD;
      chemotherapy administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;

             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
