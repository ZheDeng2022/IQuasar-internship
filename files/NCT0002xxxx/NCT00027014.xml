  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a series of studies in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for adverse&#xD;
      interactions between St. John's wort (SJW) extract and two narcotic (opioid) pain&#xD;
      medications: oxycodone and fentanyl. In the case of oxycodone, we are interested in whether&#xD;
      SJW treatment promotes the metabolism of oxycodone, such that it lowers the effectiveness of&#xD;
      standard doses of oxycodone in treating pain problems. For the fentanyl study, we will&#xD;
      investigate whether SJW treatment will interfere with the delivery of fentanyl to the brain&#xD;
      and diminish it's effectiveness to relieve pain. There is evidence to suggest that SJW&#xD;
      treatment may increase the activity of a transporter protein, named P-glycoprotein (Pgp), in&#xD;
      the blood-brain barrier (BBB) that protects the brain from exposure to drugs and other&#xD;
      dietary and environmental toxins.&#xD;

      Extract of St. John's wort (SJW: Hypericum perforatum) has gained widespread popularity as an&#xD;
      over-the-counter, natural antidepressant. Until recently, SJW was thought to be well&#xD;
      tolerated and relatively safe. Within the past year, adverse metabolic interactions have been&#xD;
      reported between SJW and several narrow therapeutic index drugs, notably cyclosporine,&#xD;
      indinavir and digoxin. The interactions are now recognized to involve induction of two drug&#xD;
      disposition mechanisms: cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme and the active efflux pump,&#xD;
      P-glycoprotein, both leading to profound reductions in blood or plasma drug concentration&#xD;
      that compromises the therapeutic efficacy of the affected drug. Natural and synthetic opioids&#xD;
      are the first-line agents for the palliative treatment of severe pain that results from&#xD;
      cancer and cancer treatment. It is well recognized that depression is a co-morbid condition&#xD;
      of severe and poorly controlled cancer-related pain. Given the widespread recognition of St.&#xD;
      Johns wort as a mood enhancer and natural antidepressant, cancer pain patients receiving&#xD;
      opioid analgesics may well turn to this herbal preparation for relief of depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this research proposal is to investigate if significant interactions&#xD;
      occur between two widely used opioid analgesics -- oxycodone and fentanyl and St. John wort&#xD;
      extract through laboratory-based studies in healthy volunteers. The studies will assess the&#xD;
      potential clinical significance of the interactions with respect to opioid analgesia efficacy&#xD;
      and side effects, and provide scientific insights into the pharmacokinetic mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying any observed interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxycodone arm of the study is designed to 1) investigate the induction of CYP3A4-mediated&#xD;
      N-demethylation which is the major detoxification pathway for oxycodone, and 2) resolve the&#xD;
      inductive effects of SJW on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 through intravenous and oral&#xD;
      administrations of a CYP3A-specific, in vivo catalytic probe -midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fentanyl arm of the study is designed to 1) assess the effects of SJW on the brain uptake&#xD;
      and efflux kinetics of fentanyl through pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modeling of&#xD;
      miotic response over time during and following intravenous infusion of the opioid, and 2) To&#xD;
      evaluate the changes in analgesia and side effects of fentanyl upon pretreatment with SJW&#xD;
      that may have resulted from induction of Pgp at the BBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the proposed research will provide a definitive assessment of the potential and&#xD;
      clinical significance of adverse interactions between SJW and opioids in the context of&#xD;
      cancer pain therapy.&#xD;
