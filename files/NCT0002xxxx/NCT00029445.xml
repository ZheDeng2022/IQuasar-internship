  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect white blood cells and plasma for research on how the immune system&#xD;
      controls HIV infection. The immune system of a very small group of HIV-infected patients,&#xD;
      called non-progressors, has been able to control HIV for long periods without antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy. Some immune system-related genes important for this control have been identified in&#xD;
      these patients. This study will examine the contribution of HLA genes B*57+, B*27+ and A*01+&#xD;
      to HIV disease in progressors and long-term non-progressors. (HLA type is a genetic marker of&#xD;
      the immune system.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients 18 years of age and older with HLA types B*57+, B*27+ and/or A*01+ may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo apheresis-a method for collecting larger quantities of certain&#xD;
      blood components than can safely be collected through a simple blood draw-by one of the&#xD;
      following two methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Automated pheresis - Blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm vein and spun in a&#xD;
           machine, separating the blood components. The white cells are extracted and the red&#xD;
           cells, with or without plasma (liquid part of the blood), are re-infused into the donor&#xD;
           through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. An anticoagulant (medication to&#xD;
           prevent blood from clotting) is usually added to the blood while in the machine to&#xD;
           prevent it from clotting during processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual pheresis - One unit (1 pint) of blood is drawn through a needle placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein, similar to donating a pint of whole blood. The red blood cells, with or without&#xD;
           plasma, are separated from the rest of the blood and re-infused to the donor through the&#xD;
           same needle. Manual pheresis will be done only when a person s estimated total blood&#xD;
           volume or red cell count is too low to safely permit removal of blood through a pheresis&#xD;
           machine. An adult small in size or markedly anemic, for example, may fall into this&#xD;
           category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the blood collected through apheresis may be stored for future studies of HIV disease&#xD;
      and immune function and for HLA testing, a genetic test of markers of the immune system. Some&#xD;
      of the blood may be used to screen for different types of viral liver infections, such as&#xD;
      hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F, or G.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of immune-mediated restriction of HIV viral&#xD;
      replication, we aim to study three groups of individuals: 1) HIV-infected long-term&#xD;
      nonprogressors (LTNP), who appear to control HIV primarily through virus-specific cellular&#xD;
      immunity; 2) HIV-infected patients who have broadly cross-neutralizing antibody activity&#xD;
      against HIV; and 3) the family members of patients exhibiting immunologic control of HIV&#xD;
      infection. Although most of our previous efforts have focused on investigating the&#xD;
      virus-specific immune responses in a unique group of patients termed LTNP who control HIV by&#xD;
      cellular immune-mediated mechanisms, more recently, another group of rare individuals who&#xD;
      naturally develop broadly cross-neutralizing antibody activity against HIV isolates have also&#xD;
      been identified in our laboratory. Passive transfer studies in nonhuman primates have&#xD;
      demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies detectable in a subject at the time of challenge&#xD;
      can protect from infection. We aim to recruit more of these patients in an effort to further&#xD;
      characterize and compare their virus-specific cellular and humoral immune responses with&#xD;
      those in individuals experiencing progressive infection. As we attain greater insight into&#xD;
      differences between these patient groups, we hope to perform genetic studies that would&#xD;
      enable us to more precisely identify susceptibility or protective genes, which could be&#xD;
      potentially used to construct a familial pedigree. We anticipate that all of these findings&#xD;
      will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the nature of effective HIV-specific humoral&#xD;
      and cellular immunity, which will help focus future vaccine design efforts. For our studies,&#xD;
      it will be necessary to obtain larger quantities of plasma or mononuclear cells than can be&#xD;
      safely obtained by simple phlebotomy. These components can be easily and safely obtained&#xD;
      using apheresis procedures in the Clinical Center Apheresis Unit. This protocol is designed&#xD;
      to conform to the requirements of the Apheresis Unit for donors to have leukapheresis or&#xD;
      plasmapheresis procedures. In select subjects, lymphocytes obtained from lymph node&#xD;
&#xD;
      biopsy will also be studied.&#xD;
