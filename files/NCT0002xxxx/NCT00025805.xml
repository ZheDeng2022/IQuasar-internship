      This study will examine the effectiveness of G-CSF in treating patients with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease-a long-term recurring inflammation of the small and large intestine. Patients may&#xD;
      have swelling and bleeding of the intestinal lining, which can lead to infection and&#xD;
      abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, diarrhea, bloody stools, fistula (connections between the&#xD;
      skin and intestine), intestinal blockages, and abscesses. Although there are various&#xD;
      treatments for Crohn's disease, many patients continue to have inflammation that is difficult&#xD;
      to control or severe side effects from the medications. G-CSF is an approved drug that is&#xD;
      used to increase white blood cell counts. Other cells, immune cells, exposed to G-CSF can&#xD;
      develop a specific immune action-a Th-2 response-that decreases the inflammatory response in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease-a Th-1 response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older who have had mild to moderately severe Crohn's disease for&#xD;
      at least 4 months may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and possible review of medical records, physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), urine and stool analyses and, for women, a pregnancy test. They will&#xD;
      fill out a Crohn's Disease Activity Index questionnaire daily for 7 days and an Inflammatory&#xD;
      Bowel Disease questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have G-CSF therapy. Before starting therapy, they will have a series of&#xD;
      pre-treatment tests, including a colonoscopy and leukapheresis. Colonoscopy is an examination&#xD;
      of the colon. For the procedure, patients are given a medication to lessen anxiety and any&#xD;
      discomfort. An endoscope-a lighted flexible tube-is inserted into the rectum, allowing&#xD;
      examination of the extent of inflammation. The endoscope can also be used to take pictures of&#xD;
      the colon and extract tissue samples for testing (biopsy). Leukapheresis is a procedure for&#xD;
      collecting quantities of white blood cells. Whole blood is collected through a needle placed&#xD;
      in an arm vein and circulated through a machine that separates it into its components. The&#xD;
      white cells are removed, and the rest of the blood is returned to the body, either through&#xD;
      the same needle used to draw the blood or through another needle placed in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the colonoscopy and leukapheresis, patients receive G-CSF injections every day for 29&#xD;
      days. The patient or a caregiver, such as a family member, will be taught to give the&#xD;
      injections. Blood samples will be collected on treatment days 4, 8, 11 and 15, and a physical&#xD;
      examination and interview, blood tests and a stool exam will be done once a week. Patients&#xD;
      will have a repeat colonoscopy and leukapheresis 24 hours after the last treatment dose (day&#xD;
      29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 29-day treatment, patients will be followed in the clinic as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 4 after treatment - physical exam and interview, routine blood work and stool exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 8 - interview and blood work&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 16 - interview, blood work and stool exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 24 - physical exam and interview, blood work, stool exam and colonoscopy&#xD;

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the immunologic and the clinical response to&#xD;
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, Filgrastim, Neupogen) administered to patients&#xD;
      with Crohn's Disease. Crohn's disease, an incurable, chronic, relapsing inflammation of the&#xD;
      small and large intestine, affects approximately 500,000 people in the United States. The&#xD;
      disease is characterized by full-thickness involvement of the gut wall leading to episodes of&#xD;
      abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, weight loss and complications such as bowel&#xD;
      obstruction, fistula formation and extraintestinal manifestations. The rationale for this&#xD;
      study is based on several observations. First, it has been shown that effector T cells and&#xD;
      dendritic cells harvested following G-CSF administration display a Th2 phenotype. Second,&#xD;
      Crohn's disease in animal models has been characterized as a Th1 inflammatory disease that is&#xD;
      susceptible to Th2 counter-regulation. Lastly, G-CSF has been an effective treatment in&#xD;
      Crohn's disease as well as other colitides with resemblance to Crohn's disease according to&#xD;
      published case reports. Despite the standard therapeutic use of steroids, aminosalicylates,&#xD;
      antibiotics, antimetabolite immunosuppressants (6-MP, methotrexate), and early agents of the&#xD;
      emerging biologics class of drugs (anti-TNFalpha antibodies, e.g.), the treatment of Crohn's&#xD;
      disease is still troubled by loss of effectiveness of standard therapy over time, outright&#xD;
      nonresponsiveness, and serious medication side effects. For these reasons newer agents and&#xD;
      strategies for the treatment of Crohn's disease need to be developed and tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study proposes to measure the immunologic and clinical effect of two dose levels&#xD;
      of G-CSF administered subcutaneously to patients with active Crohn's disease. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes include documenting changes in immune parameters by measuring peripheral and lamina&#xD;
      propria CD4 T cell cytokine release, dendritic cell phenotype and cytokine release, and&#xD;
      changes in clinical parameters such as the Crohn's Disease Activity Index and endoscopic and&#xD;
      histologic scores. Secondary endpoints include the rate and severity of adverse events. Our&#xD;
      short-term goal is to document production of effector cells that have a Th2-cytokine profile&#xD;
      and associate clinical improvement with these changes. The long-term goal of this study is to&#xD;
      establish G-CSF as an effective alternative or adjunctive therapy with a low risk profile for&#xD;
      the treatment of Crohn's disease.&#xD;
