  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of leptin therapy in two children&#xD;
      with severe insulin resistance syndrome. Patients with this condition often have high blood&#xD;
      sugar levels and may have hormone imbalances, a constant feeling of warmth, fertility&#xD;
      problems, large appetite, and enlarged liver due to fat accumulation. Leptin is a hormone&#xD;
      produced by fat cells. It influences appetite, affects levels of reproductive hormones, and&#xD;
      possibly manages how the body reacts to insufficient food. Certain people with severe insulin&#xD;
      resistance syndromes have decreased amounts of fat tissue and make little or no leptin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 13-year-old male and an 11-year-old female with severe insulin resistance will participate&#xD;
      in this study. They will have the following tests and procedures before beginning 4 months of&#xD;
      leptin therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin tolerance test - measures blood sugar levels after intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           administration of insulin. Blood samples are collected through the IV tube at various&#xD;
           intervals during the 1-hour test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound of the liver and, if abnormalities are found, possibly liver biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting blood tests - to measure blood count, blood lipids, and various hormones and&#xD;
           assess liver function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting metabolic rate - to measure the amount of oxygen breathed at rest in order to&#xD;
           calculate how many calories are required to maintain resting body functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and other organs, and of muscle and fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic ultrasound in female patient - to detect ovarian cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimation of body fat - measurements of height, weight, waist, hip size, and skin folds&#xD;
           over the arms and abdomen to estimate body fat content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test - measures blood sugar and insulin levels. The patient&#xD;
           drinks a very sweet drink containing glucose (sugar), after which blood samples are&#xD;
           collected through an IV tube in an arm vein at various intervals during the 3-hour test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous glucose tolerance test - measures tissue response to insulin and glucose&#xD;
           after glucose injection and insulin infusion. Blood is collected over 3 hours to measure&#xD;
           insulin and glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appetite level and food intake - to measure hunger level and caloric intake. Patients&#xD;
           are questioned about their hunger level, given a variety of foods they may choose to eat&#xD;
           and questioned again at various intervals about hunger level. On another day, patients&#xD;
           are given breakfast (usually a milkshake) and when they want to eat again, the appetite&#xD;
           level and caloric intake study is repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hormone function tests - the function of three hormones influenced by leptin&#xD;
           (corticotropin-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone and luteinizing&#xD;
           hormone-releasing hormone) are assessed. The hormones are injected intravenously and&#xD;
           then blood samples are drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire - patients complete a questionnaire about their activities and how they&#xD;
           feel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24-hour urine collections - to measure specific hormones, proteins and sugars excreted&#xD;
           in the urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the above tests are completed, leptin therapy will start. The drug is injected under the&#xD;
      skin twice a day for 4 months. Patients will record their symptoms weekly throughout the&#xD;
      study. Those with diabetes will measure their blood glucose levels daily before each meal and&#xD;
      at bedtime. Follow-up visits at 1, 2 and 4 months after therapy will include a physical&#xD;
      examination, blood tests and a meeting with a dietitian. At the 4-month visit, the tests done&#xD;
      at the beginning of the study will be repeated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the course of the year, we have observed that recombinant leptin has the potential to&#xD;
      act as an insulin-sensitizer in subjects with lipoatrophy and leptin deficiency. The exact&#xD;
      mechanisms of this effect are not known. We would like to test whether leptin will work as an&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizer in a situation where the mechanism of insulin resistance is known, namely&#xD;
      in a situation where there is a known defect on the insulin receptor. This will allow us to&#xD;
      learn if leptin can overcome a receptor defect by activating some of the down-stream&#xD;
      molecules in insulin signaling cascade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to begin exploring this question in two patients with mutations on their&#xD;
      insulin receptor, who are in need of improved treatment. In fact, in these two patients, the&#xD;
      conventional therapeutic options have not provided adequate control of blood sugar levels.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the circulating leptin concentrations in these two patients are lower than the&#xD;
      15th percentile of normal population. Therefore, a strategy to achieve physiological&#xD;
      concentrations of leptin hormone using recombinant leptin (A100, recombinant methionyl-human&#xD;
      leptin) will be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also plan to keep the initial observation period short. Since we have observed&#xD;
      insulin-sensitizing effects of leptin in lipoatrophy within 4 months, we will limit the&#xD;
      initial treatment period to 4 months. The regime will be similar to the regimen used in&#xD;
      lipoatrophic patients. The starting dose will be 50% of replacement dose and this will be&#xD;
      incrementally increased to 200% replacement dose within the course of two months. The&#xD;
      medication will be administered subcutaneously in two divided doses. Plasma glucose&#xD;
      concentrations and HbA1c are designated as primary outcome measures. Data on the effects of&#xD;
      leptin hormone on appetite, insulin secretion and sensitivity and other pituitary hormones&#xD;
      will also be collected as pilot data. At the end of 4 months, we will make a decision to&#xD;
      continue therapy and to broaden the study by opening recruitment to other similar patients.&#xD;
