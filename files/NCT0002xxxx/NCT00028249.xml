  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the most effective approach for managing pain and providing&#xD;
      palliative care (lessening of pain or symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced cancer who are enrolled in a National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol&#xD;
      and will undergo major surgery as part of their treatment may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to pain management provided by either 1) their&#xD;
      attending physician or 2) the Clinical Center's Pain and Palliative Care Service. Patients in&#xD;
      the first group may be reassigned to the Pain and Palliative Care Service at any time during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed every 3 months for as long as 1 year about their pain, its&#xD;
      effect on several areas of their lives, changes in their needs, and how well they think their&#xD;
      pain is being managed.. As the patients progress through the NCI study, they will meet&#xD;
      regularly and as often as needed with either their attending physician or the Pain and&#xD;
      Palliative Care team. Each interview will last about 20 to 30 minutes. With the patient's&#xD;
      permission, the interviews will be tape recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is multidimensional. It is more than simply a physiologic or sensory response. Pain&#xD;
      management programs are best developed by selecting interventions based on the individual's&#xD;
      pain experience. Strategies with several mechanisms of action that complement each other&#xD;
      might be selected to work together, thereby maximizing pain relief. The goal of palliative&#xD;
      care is to achieve the highest possible quality of life for patients and their families&#xD;
      through symptom control and attention to the whole patient, where physical, psychosocial,&#xD;
      emotional, and spiritual dimensions are addressed. Provision of relief from pain and&#xD;
      distressing symptoms is best served by a specialized interdisciplinary team with a&#xD;
      comprehensive approach. The continuity of care for the patient and family is supported by&#xD;
      communication and a strong partnership with the primary biomedical research team and the&#xD;
      palliative care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a number of descriptive studies exploring the effectiveness of specialized pain and&#xD;
      palliative care teams, the paucity of good evaluations, with any comparative design, urgently&#xD;
      needs to be addressed. This is a randomized, repeated measures, evaluation study to explore&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the inpatient Pain and Palliative Care Service intervention. The data&#xD;
      collected during this study will not only include outcomes of the intervention, but also&#xD;
      patient and family perceptions of the care delivery process including issues surrounding&#xD;
      communication with health care providers. Patients with advanced malignancies who are&#xD;
      currently participating in NCI Surgery Branch protocols will be asked to participate in a&#xD;
      pain and symptoms management evaluation study. Each patient and a designated family member&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires over time exploring physical,&#xD;
      psychosocial and emotional correlates of pain and symptom management. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using multivariate statistics.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with advanced malignancies who are currently undergoing major surgical procedures&#xD;
        in NCI Surgery Branch will be recruited to participate in a pain and symptoms management&#xD;
        evaluation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria are stated in the parent protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Although each patient will be asked to identify a family member/significant other to&#xD;
        participate in the study, patients will be eligible for inclusion regardless of whether&#xD;
        they identify a family member for participation in the family questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All exclusions are stated in the NCI Surgery Branch parent protocols.&#xD;
