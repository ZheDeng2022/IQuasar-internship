      Patients who are being considered for participation in a NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch&#xD;
      research study will be screened for eligibility under this protocol. For every NCI research&#xD;
      study, patients must meet defined medical criteria in order to ensure the integrity of the&#xD;
      research study and to maximize patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and procedures required for determining eligibility depend on the specific study for&#xD;
      which the patient is being considered. Some of the more common tests and procedures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples for routine laboratory tests and possibly research studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life assessment questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce&#xD;
           pictures of body structures, including tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computerized tomography (CT) scan uses radiation to produce multiple detailed pictures&#xD;
           of body structures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays uses radiation to provide a single picture of a body part&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nuclear medicine scans uses a chemical tagged with a radioactive substance to detect&#xD;
           tumors, measure kidney or heart function, or monitor the flow of cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
           (fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) uses electrodes placed on the skin to evaluates heart rate and&#xD;
           rhythm by measuring electrical impulses from the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram uses high-frequency sound waves to evaluate heart structure and function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture tests for cancer cells and other substances in cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
           Involves placing a needle into the lower back between the bones of the spine and&#xD;
           withdrawing a fluid sample from the fluid-containing space below the spinal cord&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ommaya reservoir surgically implanted catheter inserted into the fluid-filled ventricles&#xD;
           of the brain, used to withdraw spinal fluid samples and to give medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination vision test and eye examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies removal of a small piece of tissue, by needle or by surgery, for examination&#xD;
           under the microscope. An area of skin over the biopsy site is numbed with an anesthetic.&#xD;
           For a needle biopsy, a needle is inserted into the tumor, tissue or bone marrow to pull&#xD;
           out a small sample. A surgical biopsy may be done in the operating room, clinic, or&#xD;
           hospital room, depending on the biopsy location. The tissue or tumor is removed by&#xD;
           cutting a small piece of it with a sharp knife or scalpel and the area will be closed&#xD;
           with sutures or staples.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients, who are screened for POB research protocols, undergo a series of tests and&#xD;
           procedures to determine protocol eligibility prior to entry onto the primary research&#xD;
           protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may&#xD;
           becollected during the screening process to prevent subjecting the patient to a painful&#xD;
           procedure on multiple occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performing invasive procedures for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or&#xD;
           body fluids for research purposes is often not ethically justifiable in children, yet&#xD;
           these specimens are needed to advance our knowledge of childhood cancers. Therefore, it&#xD;
           is critical to obtain tissue and fluid samples for future research when procedures are&#xD;
           performed for clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate patient eligibility for participation in POB research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect clinical data, such as a medical history and clinical laboratory results that&#xD;
           can serve as baseline values for subsequent research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procure residual tissues or fluids that are remaining from tests or procedures that are&#xD;
           performed for clinical indications (e.g., diagnosis or treatment of the cancer) during&#xD;
           the screening process or during treatment and follow-up on a primary POB research&#xD;
           protocol. These specimens will be transferred to subsequent research protocols for&#xD;
           IRB-approved research studies or stored for future research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children and young adults who are being evaluated for and treated on protocols within&#xD;
           the Pediatric Oncology Branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients or their parents/guardians can refuse to participate in the tissue procurement&#xD;
           portion of this protocol and still participate in the screening for eligibility on POB&#xD;
           research trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are being evaluated for POB primary research protocols will be entered onto&#xD;
           this screening and tissue procurement protocol for eligibility screening and collection&#xD;
           of tissue specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures to be done may include, but are not limited to, laboratory tests on blood,&#xD;
           CSF, urine, or other specimens; pulmonary function tests; TB skin tests (with a&#xD;
           control); subspecialty consultations; molecular diagnostics on tumor tissues such as PCR&#xD;
           for Ewing s or rhabdomyosarcoma, HLA, IHC, or FISH; radiographic and nuclear medicine&#xD;
           studies, which may require the administration of contrast or a radioisotopic tracer; and&#xD;
           needle or open biopsies for diagnostic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissues and body fluids that are obtained during or after the screening process or at&#xD;
           any time during treatment and follow-up on a primary POB research protocol will be&#xD;
           discarded or stored for future research purposes with the consent of the patient or&#xD;
           his/her parent or guardian, if the patient is not eligible for or elects not to enroll&#xD;
           on the primary research protocol. These specimens will be stored with patient&#xD;
           identifiers, IRB approval will be requested prior to performing any research with these&#xD;
           tissues or fluids or the samples will have identifiers removed (unlinked) and an&#xD;
           exemption will be requested from OHSRP.&#xD;
