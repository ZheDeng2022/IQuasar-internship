  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the effect of fluoxetine in the treatment of adult autism and on&#xD;
      functional ability and behavior associated with autism. Evidence suggests abnormal serotonin&#xD;
      function in autism. Fluoxetine is a selective inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.&#xD;

      Eligible patients will undergo comprehensive evaluation. Informants familiar with the patient&#xD;
      will also provide information. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment or placebo.&#xD;
      During the 12-week treatment there will be weekly monitoring for the first 4 weeks and&#xD;
      biweekly monitoring for the next 8 weeks. The drug dosage will be increased each week as&#xD;
      tolerated by the patient. Serum levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine will be documented at&#xD;
      Week 12.&#xD;
