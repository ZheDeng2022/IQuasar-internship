      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with diabetic nephropathy experience markedly increased rates of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality due to arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease [CVD]. Established arteriosclerotic&#xD;
      risk factors such as age, sex, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia do not&#xD;
      account adequately for this excess CVD risk. Prospective data from general populations, and&#xD;
      much more limited findings from both diabetic cohorts. and cohorts with chronic renal&#xD;
      disease, have linked elevated levels of total homocysteine (tHcy) and C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP) to arteriosclerotic CVD morbidity and mortality. Determination of baseline serum total&#xD;
      homocysteine and C-reactive protein concentrations in the Irbesartan Type 2 Diabetic&#xD;
      Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) cohort affords a truly unique opportunity to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      independent relationship between these putative CVD risk factors and subsequent CVD morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, in this patient population. The IDNT is a multicenter, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1,715 hypertensive, Type 2 diabetic patients aged&#xD;
      30 to 70 who have overt nephropathy (24 hour urinary protein excretion greater than 900 mg&#xD;
      and a serum creatinine of 90 to 265 micromols/L). The IDNT compares the effect of the&#xD;
      angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan with placebo and amlodipine on the progression&#xD;
      of renal disease and mortality. The IDNT is supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in&#xD;
      Princeton, New Jersey and Sanofi-Synthelabo in Paris, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to an initiative &quot;Ancillary Studies in Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Disease Trials&quot; released by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in June 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first specific aim is to conduct longitudinal analyses of the potential &quot;Independent&quot;&#xD;
      relationship between baseline concentrations of serum total homocysteine and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein in the full IDNT cohort, and subsequent:pooled cardiovascular disease morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality (primary analysis). total mortality, (after multivariable -adjustment for the&#xD;
      established predictors of cardiovascular disease morbidity/ mortality, and total mortality).&#xD;
      The second specific aim is to conduct cross-sectional analyses to assess baseline serum total&#xD;
      homocysteine and C-reactive protein concentrations in the full IDNT cohort, in relation to&#xD;
      potential baseline determinants of these analytes, including: B-vitamin status; age and&#xD;
      gender; renal function indices, i.e. both creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
      estimates, and proteinuria; indices of glycemia, prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD),&#xD;
      traditional CVD risk factors (i.e., in particular, smoking, blood pressure, and total&#xD;
      cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio).&#xD;
