  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LErafAON is a liposome encapsulated c-raf antisense oligonucleotide. Raf-1 is a protein&#xD;
      produced by human cells, both normal and cancerous, which may help protect tumor cells from&#xD;
      radiation. Antisense oligonucleotides are very specific drugs, which can decrease the amount&#xD;
      of a certain target protein by blocking the gene that makes it. Antisense oligonucleotide to&#xD;
      raf gene can reduce the amount of Raf-1 protein in tumor cells. Liposomes are tiny globules&#xD;
      of fat, which can carry drugs in the body. The experimental agent LErafAON is composed of&#xD;
      liposomes carrying antisense oligonucleotide against the Raf-1 protein. It is hoped that&#xD;
      decreased Raf-1 in the cancer cells will make them more sensitive to the radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced malignancies will receive daily IV infusions of LErafAON for 2 weeks&#xD;
      (total of 10 doses) during clinically indicated palliative radiotherapy. Cohorts of at least&#xD;
      three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort will be observed for&#xD;
      toxicity for at least two weeks after completion of treatment with study medication before&#xD;
      the next cohort is enrolled. The study will be stopped when a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed. Safety and supportive care&#xD;
      requirements will be assessed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and MTD of LErafAON administered in daily I.V.&#xD;
      infusions, in combination with radiotherapy, to patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of LErafAON after IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess in vivo inhibition of Raf-1 protein by LErafAON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine efficacy in radiated and non-radiated tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is a traditional Phase I MTD study. Cohorts of at least three&#xD;
      patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Patients will receive daily IV infusions&#xD;
      of LErafAON for 2 weeks (total of 10 doses). Each cohort will be observed for at least two&#xD;
      weeks post treatment with study medication to allow for observation of toxicity before the&#xD;
      next cohort is enrolled. Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD is identified. Dose&#xD;
      escalation within a patient will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 27 patients; at least 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs.&#xD;

        -Disease Characteristics-&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologically-confirmed malignancy which has recurred or progressed after initial&#xD;
        definitive treatment and/or for which no curative therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Palliative radiation therapy indicated for disease and site. (More than one lesion may be&#xD;
        treated with radiation therapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        At least 30 days must have elapsed since receiving an investigational agent, at least 21&#xD;
        days since receiving any prior chemotherapy or radiation, and at least six weeks since&#xD;
        receiving nitrosourea-containing therapy; patient must have recovered from any related side&#xD;
        effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The site for radiotherapy, the index lesion, must have a measurable or evaluable tumor&#xD;
        documented no more than 4 weeks prior to having study-related procedures. More than one&#xD;
        lesion may be present and treated with radiotherapy. Additional lesions, not treated with&#xD;
        radiotherapy, may also be present. Previously irradiated sites will NOT be irradiated in&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patient Characteristics-&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance Status (ECOG/ZUBROD) of 0-2.&#xD;

        Must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must have adequate organ function: Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3; Platelets&#xD;
        at least 100,000/mm3; Creatinine, Calcium, and total Bilirubin not higher than the upper&#xD;
        limit of normal; Liver enzymes AST and ALT not more than 2.5 x the upper limit of normal;&#xD;
        PT and aPTT not more than the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy more than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must sign Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Planned treatment site(s) has not had previous radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must not have concurrent antitumor therapy other than that planned in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No history of Grade 4 toxicity from prior radiation therapy. (Grade 3 toxicity from prior&#xD;
        radiation therapy, at investigator discretion.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        No infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; no HIV infection; no chronic hepatic&#xD;
        disease; and no seropositivity for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. (Use of prophylactic&#xD;
        antibiotics is permitted.)&#xD;
