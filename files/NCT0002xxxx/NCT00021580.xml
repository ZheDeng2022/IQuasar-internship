  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of the Edmonton Group with islet transplantation and use of the &quot;Edmonton&#xD;
      Protocol&quot; provides much promise for T1DM patients. However, the need to use 2 or more donor&#xD;
      pancreases to achieve freedom from insulin shots limits the widespread use of this protocol.&#xD;
      Two classes of oral antidiabetic drugs improve insulin action and reduce the amount of&#xD;
      insulin needed to have normal blood sugars. The first part of the proposed project (Group 1)&#xD;
      will use these drugs in conjunction with the Edmonton Protocol to allow for successful islet&#xD;
      transplantation from islets isolated from a single pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edmonton Protocol is a treatment, not a cure. It requires the long-term use of powerful&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs that are expensive and increase the risk of infection and cancer.&#xD;
      T1DM patients who have a functioning kidney transplant already have to use immunosuppressive&#xD;
      drugs, and they are still at risk of recurrent diabetic kidney disease and other&#xD;
      complications of diabetes. Islet transplantation in these patients has only rarely been&#xD;
      successful in the past in part because the usual immunosuppressive drugs used in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation cause diabetes and actually harm the transplant kidney in other ways. The&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs used in the Edmonton Protocol are less likely to cause diabetes and&#xD;
      are also less harmful to the kidney. In the second part of this project (Group 2), we will&#xD;
      transplant islets into kidney transplant patients after they have switched to the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications used in the Edmonton Protocol. Even if some of the patients do&#xD;
      not get islet transplants or still need insulin shots after islet transplantation, we expect&#xD;
      to see improvement in kidney function and blood glucose control.&#xD;

      We anticipate that successful islet transplantation will establish a group of islet cell&#xD;
      transplant patients who have normal blood sugars and do not need insulin injections. Some of&#xD;
      this group will have received a kidney transplant as well. All these patients will be studied&#xD;
      in great detail along with other investigators in our islet cell program to understand better&#xD;
      the mechanisms of efficacy and side effects of islet transplant and these new&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs.&#xD;
