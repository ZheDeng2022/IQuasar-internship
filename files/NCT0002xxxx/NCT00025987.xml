  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a specially designed head-neck cooling system&#xD;
      for way lowering the body's central, or core, temperature and cooling the brain. Brain&#xD;
      cooling has an effect on stopping seizure discharges in the brain as well as the seizures&#xD;
      themselves. If this system works to cool the brain, a similar study may be tried in patients&#xD;
      with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers 21 years of age and older who have no medical or neurological condition and&#xD;
      do not use any medications may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      an interview. Women will have a pregnancy test. Those enrolled will be hospitalized twice for&#xD;
      overnight stays, with the admissions 2 to 3 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations,&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG). Then, electrodes will be attached to&#xD;
      their scalp, forearm and calf to measure temperatures in those locations. Intestinal (core)&#xD;
      temperature will be measured with a temperature-sensing pill, which will be swallowed&#xD;
      earlier), and a hand-held infrared thermometer will be used to measure temperatures from the&#xD;
      ear canal, face, head, arms legs, and abdomen. Electrodes on the scalp will also measure&#xD;
      changes in blood volume in the brain for a study of brain blood flow. Subjects will be seated&#xD;
      in a comfortable chair and fitted with the cooling system, a portable unit with a circulating&#xD;
      coolant. Cooling will last 30 minutes for the first session and 60 minutes for the second.&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each session to track&#xD;
      temperature changes and have a post-cooling EEG recording.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to study thermal responses in normal volunteers using a special&#xD;
      cooling system designed to cool the head and neck. Temperature will be monitored at various&#xD;
      locations including the scalp, face, mouth, ears (tympanic), arms, legs, and rectum. Previous&#xD;
      studies indicate that cooling of the brain can be achieved with the head-neck cooling method.&#xD;
      We hope to derive cooling parameters that will be used in a future study involving patients&#xD;
      with epilepsy.&#xD;
