  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL13-PE38QQR is an oncology drug product consisting of IL13 (interleukin-13) and PE38QQR (a&#xD;
      bacteria toxin). IL3-PE38QQR is a protein that exhibits cell killing activity against a&#xD;
      variety of IL13 receptor-positive tumor cell lines indicating that it may show a therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit. In reciprocal competition experiments, the interaction between IL13-PE38QQR and the&#xD;
      IL13 receptors was shown to be highly specific for human glioma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR will be infused in two courses of 96 hours each, eight weeks apart, directly&#xD;
      into the malignant brain tumors of patients to determine the dose of drug these patients can&#xD;
      tolerate. After that, the selected dose will be studied to give an estimate of the response&#xD;
      rate, response duration, time to response, and survival after infusing that dose of&#xD;
      IL13-PE38QQR into the recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by&#xD;
      continuous infusion into malignant glioma over 96 hours, in two courses eight weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the response rate, response duration, time to response, and survival after&#xD;
      interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR into recurrent malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the toxicities of interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR at the selected dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are expected to receive two IL13-PE38QQR infusions at 8-week&#xD;
      intervals. For each course, drug will be infused through each of two catheters; infusion rate&#xD;
      will be held constant during a 96-hour infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase I, the dose of IL13-PE38QQR will be increased by increasing the IL13-PE38QQR&#xD;
      concentration in stepwise fashion, while holding infusion volume and duration constant. Three&#xD;
      patients will be treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      reached, and an additional three patients are treated at that level. In Phase II, patients&#xD;
      will be treated at the selected MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: In Phase I, up to 30 patients will be treated. In Phase II, up to 35&#xD;
      patients will be treated.&#xD;

        Disease Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have had surgery (or biopsy) of a supratentorial brain tumor with pathologic&#xD;
             diagnosis of malignant (grade 3 or 4) glioma, including anaplastic astrocytoma,&#xD;
             glioblastoma multiforme and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma. (Note: If diagnosis is&#xD;
             dependent upon the Day 0 biopsy, pathology must be confirmed prior to start of&#xD;
             IL13PE-38QQR infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have received cranial radiotherapy, with tumor dose of at least 48 Gy, completed&#xD;
             at least 12 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have radiographic evidence of recurrent or progressive supratentorial tumor&#xD;
             compared with a previous study. The baseline tumor measurements must be determined&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to study entry. The tumor must have a solid portion at least 1.0&#xD;
             cm but not more than 5.0 cm in maximum diameter. A maximum of one satellite lesion is&#xD;
             permitted, if separated by less than 3 cm from the primary mass.&#xD;
