  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL13-PE38QQR is an oncology drug product consisting of IL13 (interleukin-13) and PE38QQR (a&#xD;
      bacteria toxin). IL3-PE38QQR is a protein that exhibits cell killing activity against a&#xD;
      variety of IL13 receptor-positive tumor cell lines indicating that it may show a therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit. In reciprocal competition experiments, the interaction between IL13-PE38QQR and the&#xD;
      IL13 receptors was shown to be highly specific for human glioma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive IL13-PE38QQR via a catheter placed directly into the brain tumor. Tumor&#xD;
      recurrence will be confirmed by biopsy. The next day, patients will start a continuous&#xD;
      48-hour infusion of IL13-PE38QQR into the tumor. The dose (concentration) will be increased&#xD;
      in the pre-resection infusion until the endpoint is reached (histologic evidence of tumor&#xD;
      cytotoxicity or a maximum tolerated dose). Tumor resection will be planned for one week after&#xD;
      biopsy, plus or minus 1 day. A histologically-effective concentration (HEC) will be&#xD;
      determined using pathologic observations. At the end of resection, three catheters will be&#xD;
      placed in brain tissue next to the resection site and assessed within 24 hours using MRI. On&#xD;
      the second day after surgery, IL13-PE38QQR infusion will begin and will continue for 4 days.&#xD;
      The lowest pre-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration will be used as the starting dose for&#xD;
      post-resection infusions. After an HEC or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined, the&#xD;
      pre-resection infusion will no longer be administered. Subsequent patients will have tumor&#xD;
      resection and placement of three peri-tumoral catheters at study entry. IL13-PE38QQR will be&#xD;
      infused starting on the second day after surgery and continuing for 4 days. Escalation of the&#xD;
      post-resection IL13-PE38QQR concentration will be continued until the previously-defined HEC&#xD;
      or MTD is reached, after which duration of the post-resection infusion will be increased in&#xD;
      one day increments for up to 6 days. If a post-resection MTD is obtained, there will be no&#xD;
      increase in duration of infusion. In the final stage of the study, catheters will be placed 2&#xD;
      days after tumor resection, and a 4-day IL13-PE38QQR infusion will begin the day after&#xD;
      catheter placement. Patients will be observed clinically and radiographically for toxicity&#xD;
      and duration of tumor control.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the concentration of IL13-PE38QQR that produces histologic evidence of toxicity&#xD;
      to tumor, and the corresponding drug toxicity, following a 2-day continuous infusion into&#xD;
      recurrent malignant glioma prior to surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicity of IL13-PE38QQR administered as a 4-day continuous infusion via&#xD;
      catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at&#xD;
      concentrations up to the selected concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity of increasing duration of continuous infusion of IL13- PE38QQR&#xD;
      via catheters into brain adjacent to tumor resection site, after surgical resection, at the&#xD;
      selected concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the feasibility and safety of IL13-PE38QQR administration following&#xD;
      post-operative placement of stereotaxic catheters 2 days after tumor resection, utilizing a&#xD;
      post-operative imaging study for planning of catheter placement. A 4-day continuous infusion&#xD;
      at the MTD is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Describe the time to progression and survival of patients treated with IL13-PE38QQR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is designed to determine two dose levels. The first is defined&#xD;
      as the histologically effective concentration (HEC) when the agent is administered prior to&#xD;
      tumor resection. The second is defined using safety and tolerability of study drug&#xD;
      administered after tumor resection at doses up to the HEC. Safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      increasing duration of infusion after tumor resection will then be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient cohorts will be treated at escalating pre-resection dose-levels until a stopping&#xD;
      criterion for the pre-surgery dose is met, holding the post-resection dose constant at the&#xD;
      starting level. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of the pre-surgery infusion are&#xD;
      determination of the HEC or the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent cohorts will be treated only post-operatively at escalating dose levels until a&#xD;
      stopping criterion for the post-surgery dose is met. Stopping criteria for dose escalation of&#xD;
      the post-surgery infusion are reaching the HEC determined for the pre-operative infusion or&#xD;
      determination of the MTD. After the HEC is reached, subsequent cohorts will be treated with&#xD;
      post-operative infusions of increasing duration at the HEC until the maximum duration defined&#xD;
      in the study is reached or an MTD is defined. (If an MTD has already detected, duration will&#xD;
      not be escalated.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the stage of the study evaluating escalation of infusion duration has completed, the&#xD;
      study will expand to evaluate post-operative placement of catheters after tumor resection.&#xD;
      This stage of the study will assess the feasibility and safety of stereotaxic placement of&#xD;
      catheters 2 days after tumor resection using a post-operative imaging study for planning.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a 96 hour post-resection infusion at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at each dose level. Each cohort will be&#xD;
      observed for at least thirty days after completion of administration of study drug to allow&#xD;
      for observation of toxicity before the next cohort is enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Depends on number of dose-levels, estimated at 25-50 patients.&#xD;
