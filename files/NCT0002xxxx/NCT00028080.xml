    <textblock>
      This study is designed to establish a population of patients with Lyme disease for&#xD;
      evaluation, treatment and follow-up to learn more about the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active Lyme disease may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical examination and diagnostic evaluations&#xD;
      as appropriate to their individual condition. Laboratory tests may include routing blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, X-rays, or other imaging studies, body fluid or tissue cultures, skin biopsy and&#xD;
      tests for allergic or immune responses. Treatment will include only medications approved by&#xD;
      the Food and Drug Administration, given according to accepted dose schedules and ways of&#xD;
      taking the medicines. All diagnostic tests and treatments will be according to standard&#xD;
      medical practice for the disease. No experimental procedures will be offered under this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed as needed for evaluation and treatment of their condition. In&#xD;
      general, they will be asked to return at the end of therapy, then 3, 6 and 12 months later,&#xD;
      and then every 6 to 12 months. More frequent visits may be required or less frequent visits&#xD;
      may be allowed, depending on the individual s condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to undergo the following additional procedures for research&#xD;
      purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra blood draws to study Lyme disease and other inflammatory conditions. Blood will be&#xD;
           drawn from arm veins. The total amount drawn during any 6-week period will not exceed&#xD;
           450 cc (30 tablespoons) for adults and 7 cc (1/2 tablespoon) per kilogram (2.2 pounds)&#xD;
           of body weight for children under 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis to collect large numbers of white blood cells. Whole blood is collected&#xD;
           through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood circulates through&#xD;
           a machine that separates it into its components, and the white cells are removed. The&#xD;
           rest of the blood is returned to the body through the same needle. Only adults 18 years&#xD;
           of age and older will be asked to undergo leukapheresis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and it is&#xD;
      the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. This protocol is designed to offer&#xD;
      evaluation, therapy and follow up to patients with Lyme disease. This is a natural history&#xD;
      study, which has the objective of developing a rigorously defined population of patients with&#xD;
      Lyme disease to serve as the basis of research in multiple aspects of the infection. These&#xD;
      research sub-projects have emphasis in exploring the biological markers of Borrelia&#xD;
      infections, assessment of clinical course and outcomes of patients with Lyme infection, and&#xD;
      the immunological response to B. burgdorferi infection.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of active Lyme disease at the time of the initial NIH evaluation&#xD;
             based on the CDC case definition. Study physician will review history to confirm&#xD;
             probable cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must maintain a private physician for non-protocol related medical complaints&#xD;
             and for emergency medical treatment required for these or other of their disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post treatment Lyme disease syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unacceptably poor compliance, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             interfere with one's ability to study or provide quality medical care for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
