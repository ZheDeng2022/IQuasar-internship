      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as gemtuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill&#xD;
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemtuzumab in treating&#xD;
      patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the total survival of patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome treated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin. II. Assess the quality of life&#xD;
      of patients treated with this drug. III. Compare two different dose schedules of this drug in&#xD;
      these patients. IV. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. V. Determine the&#xD;
      number of patients treated with this drug that achieve complete remission, partial remission,&#xD;
      stable disease, major and minor hematologic improvements, or major and minor cytogenetic&#xD;
      responses. VI. Determine the progression-free survival, relapse-free survival, and time to&#xD;
      progression to acute myeloid leukemia in patients treated with this drug. VII. Determine the&#xD;
      number of transfusions, number of days on IV antibiotics, and the number of days hospitalized&#xD;
      in patients treated with this drug. VIII. Determine the possible predictors of response in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug, including age, karyotype, and multi-drug resistance efflux.&#xD;
      IX. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. X. Correlate the results&#xD;
      of pharmacogenomic studies to gene activation and response to therapy in patients treated&#xD;
      with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to age (60 and under vs over 60) and IPSS score (1.5-2.0 vs 2.5 and greater).&#xD;
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive gemtuzumab&#xD;
      ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Arm II: Patients receive gemtuzumab ozogamicin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on days 1 and 15. After completion of induction therapy, patients in both arms with&#xD;
      stable or responding disease may receive post-remission therapy comprising up to 3 additional&#xD;
      doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin approximately 28-42 days apart. Quality of life is assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, on day 29 for arm I, on day 43 for arm II, on day 127 for patients that receive&#xD;
      additional doses of study drug, and at 8 months for all patients. Patients who do not respond&#xD;
      to induction therapy are followed monthly for 8 months and then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
      Patients who receive post-remission therapy are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 128 patients (64 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 12 months.&#xD;
