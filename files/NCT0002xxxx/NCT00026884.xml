  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selected patients suspected of having or with prior biopsy proof of malignant disease will be&#xD;
      seen in the Urologic Oncology Branch, NCI. Blood samples may be collected at the time of the&#xD;
      initial visit and at periodic intervals during the course of the disease. These samples will&#xD;
      be stored in the tissue bank of the Urologic Oncology Branch. Aliquots of malignant and&#xD;
      normal tissue will be collected at the time of surgery and stored in the tissue bank,&#xD;
      Urologic Oncology Branch, NCI. These materials will be used in the research efforts of the&#xD;
      Urologic Oncology Branch, NCI.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kidney, prostate, bladder, testis and penile cancer account for 22% of cancers diagnosed in&#xD;
      the United States and are responsible for 10% of cancer deaths each year in the U.S.&#xD;
      Understanding the genes and gene pathways that cause genitourinary malignancies will provide&#xD;
      the foundation for the development of targeted therapeutic agents for patients affected with&#xD;
      these cancers. Since 1982 investigators in the Urologic Oncology Branch have been studying&#xD;
      the genetic basis of urologic cancers. The identification of the genes for cancer of the&#xD;
      kidney has led to the approval by the FDA of a number of new agents for patients with&#xD;
      advanced disease. It is our goal to study the cancer gene pathways of genitourinary&#xD;
      malignancies in order to further understand the cancer gene pathways that cause these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of benign and malignant tissue from patients with known or suspected cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of benign and malignant tissue from patients with rare inherited conditions&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk for kidney cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the molecular genetic differences between normal and tumorigenic tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate the categories of genes/ biochemical pathways such as those that influence the&#xD;
      cell cycle, angiogenesis, metabolic changes, and metastatic potential&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine protein expression and bioimmunoassays investigating potential genetic markers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate cellular/biochemical response to existing and novel therapeutic agents&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate quality of life in men who have prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigate molecular genetic basis of urologic malignancies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examine cell free DNA and circulating tumor DNA for cancer gene mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with biopsy-proven malignant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients suspected of having malignant disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with known or suspected inherited urologic malignant disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members (related by blood) of patients who have or are suspected of having an&#xD;
      inherited genitourinary disorder or malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family members of patients with a DNA variant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility in the Urologic Oncology Branch Clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples may be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal and malignant tissue may be collected from patients undergoing clinically indicated&#xD;
      surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic scientific research will be performed on collected specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have the option to be contacted if a result is detected that would affect their&#xD;
      health and they will be given the opportunity to be evaluated and re-tested on an IRB&#xD;
      approved protocol if available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Germline and somatic whole genome exome sequencing may be performed&#xD;
