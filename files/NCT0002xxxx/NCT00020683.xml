      COL-3 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Randomized phase II&#xD;
      trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens of COL-3 in treating patients&#xD;
      who have HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the tumor response rate and response duration of treatment with Col-3 at two&#xD;
      different dose levels- 50 mg/day and 100 mg/day in subjects with HIV related KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the biologic activity of Col-3 by measuring percent apoptotic cells on tumor&#xD;
      biopsies pre- and post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effect of Col-3 on serum levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of Col-3 at two different dose levels in HIV related&#xD;
      KS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of Col-3 on overall quality of life. III. To evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between clinical response and quantitative measures of KSHV/HHV-8 and HIV viral&#xD;
      load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of&#xD;
      2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I: Patients receive low-dose oral COL-3 once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II: Patients receive high-dose oral COL-3 once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment on both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients (35 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 1.75 years.&#xD;

    <measure>Relationship between clinical response and quantitative measures of KSHV/HHV8 and HIV viral load</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>These measures will be tested to determine if they are normally distributed. If the data are non-normal, the data will be transformed for analysis purposes. The logistic regression model will be used to assess the relationship between qualification of baseline levels of KSHV/HHV-8, HIV viral load and response. The proportional hazards model will be used to evaluate the relationship between the qualification of baseline KSHV/HHV8 and HIV viral load and time to progression, and response duration.</description>

             evidenced by positive ELISA, positive Western Blot, or other federally approved&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin should be normal; if, however, the elevated bilirubin is felt to be&#xD;
             secondary to indinavir therapy, then subjects will be allowed on protocol if bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt; 3.5 mg/dl, provided that the direct bilirubin is normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 times the ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT and PTT &lt; 120% of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of 3 months or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability and willingness to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum beta HCG within 72&#xD;
             hours prior to study entry and must practice adequate birth control to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy while receiving study treatment and for 3 months after treatment is&#xD;
             discontinued; all males of child fathering potential must also practice adequate birth&#xD;
             control; pregnant or breast feeding females are excluded from participation in this&#xD;
             study since the effects of Col-3 on an unborn or young child are unknown and may&#xD;
             potentially be toxic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must, in the opinion of the investigator, be capable of complying with this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent active opportunistic infection (OI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent neoplasia requiring cytotoxic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute treatment for an infection or other serious medical illness within 14 days prior&#xD;
             to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior anti-neoplastic treatment for KS within 3 weeks of study entry; patients must&#xD;
             also have completely recovered from any associated toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous local therapy of any KS indicator lesion within 60 days, unless the lesion&#xD;
             has progressed since treatment; because of the possibility of tattooing and the&#xD;
             difficulty in ascertaining clinically what is active KS versus residual pigment post&#xD;
             treatment, any prior local treatment to the indicator lesions regardless of the&#xD;
             elapsed time should not be allowed unless there is evidence of clear-cut progression&#xD;
             of said lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-retroviral therapy is permitted but not required; if patients are taking&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy, their regimen must not have changed within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             starting the study medication; patient should be receiving an optimal and stable&#xD;
             regimen of HAART for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to entry&#xD;
