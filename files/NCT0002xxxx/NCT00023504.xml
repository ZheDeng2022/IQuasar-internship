    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate immune function in people with a known or suspected immune disorder.&#xD;
      It will determine participants immune response to vaccines by measuring blood antibody levels&#xD;
      after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in a NIH protocol involving immune reconstitution (bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation or gene therapy) for a known or suspected primary immune disorder may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to have more than one vaccine, based on their age, use of IVIG,&#xD;
      past immunization history and underlying immune problem. The possible vaccinations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rabies vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diphtheria and tetanus booster&#xD;
&#xD;
      23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diphtheria, tetanus, pneumococcus and rabies vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) and used routinely to protect against disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will have a blood sample drawn before vaccination. The number of&#xD;
      additional samples collected will vary according to the vaccines administered; 1 for rabies;&#xD;
      1 for tetanus; and 1 to 2 for the pneumococcal vaccines. Each sample will be up to 5&#xD;
      teaspoonfuls. Participation in the study may last up to a year, depending on the blood&#xD;
      sampling scheduling&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immune responses to vaccines in subjects (both&#xD;
      children and adults) with known or suspected primary immune disorders. We intend to&#xD;
      characterize immune responsiveness to standard, well characterized antigens (vaccines) in&#xD;
      subjects with primary immune disorders, and/or in subjects who have received treatments to&#xD;
      correct their primary immune disorders. This will be an open label, prospective study&#xD;
      investigating the functional status of the adaptive immune system. Up to 50 subjects may be&#xD;
      enrolled. It is anticipated that subjects will be referred by any investigators at NIH&#xD;
      studying inherited disorders of the immune system under their own protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving standard vaccines, we will test specific antibody. The vaccines include licensed&#xD;
      and universally mandated diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, two licensed pneumococcal vaccine&#xD;
      formulations recommended for protection of children from pneumonia, and rabies vaccine&#xD;
      licensed in 1997 (not the formerly available reaction-prone formulation). We will obtain&#xD;
      peripheral blood samples from subjects before vaccination and at a specific time intervals&#xD;
      after vaccination. Measurement of specific antibody titers will be conducted by the&#xD;
      immunology laboratory at the Department of Laboratory Medicin at the NIH. Subjects may be&#xD;
      offered one or more of the vaccines based on available information about their exposure&#xD;
      history and their immune status, and the vaccines may be offered sequentially or in&#xD;
      combination to shorten study time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the vaccines used here are often medically indicated and given outside of research&#xD;
      protocols both to provide protection and to assess immune responses, the investigators have&#xD;
      elected to use a protocol for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enhancement of subject understanding of the use of vaccines for in vivo assessment of&#xD;
           immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emphasis on the importance of obtaining pre- and post-immunization blood samples to&#xD;
           monitor how well the body's immune system is working.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of rabies vaccine to subjects who would not ordinarily need it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recognition that vaccine side effects have been widely publicized and may be of concern&#xD;
           to potential enrollees.&#xD;
