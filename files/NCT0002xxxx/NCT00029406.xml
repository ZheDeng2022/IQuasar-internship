      To conduct a prospective study of pediatric transfusion recipients to determine the risk of&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite a marked reduction in the risk of transfusion-transmitted disease, lessons learned&#xD;
      from the delayed recognition of HIV transmission by transfusion, underscore the necessity for&#xD;
      continued vigilance for blood safety. The study will correct a significant lack of&#xD;
      prospective studies of transfusion transmitted disease in infants and children in this&#xD;
      country. A critical material outcome of the study will be the establishment of a large serum&#xD;
      and cell repository of linked patient recipient samples. Such a repository, representing&#xD;
      prospective studies in a pediatric population, will be unique. It will provide a means for&#xD;
      ongoing surveillance to identify more rapidly emerging infectious agents and to aid in&#xD;
      determining whether they present a significant risk to the blood supply. Because of a close&#xD;
      collaboration and parallel structure with two related adult transfusion studies, age related&#xD;
      comparisons of viral clearance and clinical outcomes should likewise be derived from this&#xD;
      work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study of pediatric transfusion recipients will determine the residual risk of&#xD;
      transmitting known infectious agents such as hepatitis viruses, human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      (HIV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), for which there are current donor screening&#xD;
      assays, and the potential risk of known agents that are not routinely screened during blood&#xD;
      donation, but might, nonetheless, infect blood recipients with diseases such as&#xD;
      cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B-19, human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) and newly proposed hepatitis&#xD;
      viruses, TTV and the SEN virus (SEN-V). An additional primary goal of the study is to&#xD;
      establish a repository of linked donor and recipient samples so that if a new infectious&#xD;
      agent emerges in the future, testing of the repository will rapidly establish whether or not&#xD;
      that agent presents a threat to the blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To insure larger numbers of samples and greater statistical power, samples from this study&#xD;
      will be merged into a large repository to be generated in the NHLBI-sponsored RADAR (REDS&#xD;
      Allogeneic Donor and Recipient) study. The current study will be the only pediatric arm of&#xD;
      the RADAR multi-center study. Further, the current pediatric study will be undertaken&#xD;
      collaboratively with a similarly designed study in adults being conducted at the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center. In both studies recipients will be enrolled prior to transfusion and then followed&#xD;
      for at least 6 months post-transfusion. Blood samples will be obtained before and at 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 16 and 24 weeks after transfusion. Molecular and serologic testing will be routinely&#xD;
      performed for the agents cited above with particular emphasis on molecular assays for human&#xD;
      retroviruses (HRV), hepatitis C virus (HCV). HIV, SEN-V, cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus&#xD;
      B-i 9 and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Aliquots will be retained in frozen storage. In&#xD;
      addition, pre and post-transfusion and donor whole blood samples will be frozen to allow for&#xD;
      recovery of recipient DNA and identification of microchimerism. Such microchimerism may&#xD;
      result in transfusion-associated graft versus host disease and immunosuppression and have&#xD;
      long term consequences for the development of immune mediated diseases in the recipient. In&#xD;
      summary, the primary pediatric study and the proposed collaborations will allow for&#xD;
      determinations of the transfusion risk of a variety of blood-screened and unscreened&#xD;
      infectious agents, and will allow for comparisons of transfusion risk between pediatric and&#xD;
      adult patients, as well as comparisons of viral persistence and clinical outcome according to&#xD;
      age. In addition, by contributing pre and post-transfusion samples from blood recipients and&#xD;
      their linked donor samples, this study will help establish a large serum and cell repository&#xD;
      that will allow for the future determination of whether virtually any infectious agent is&#xD;
      transfusion-transmitted and a potential risk to blood recipients.&#xD;
