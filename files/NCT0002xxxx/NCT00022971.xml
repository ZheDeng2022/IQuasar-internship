    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two antibodies,&#xD;
      apolizumab and rituximab (Rituxan ), in treating B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
      leukemia. Rituximab attaches to a molecule called CD20 on B-cell lymphomas and can cause&#xD;
      significant shrinkage of these tumors in up to half of patients. However, it does not cure&#xD;
      the lymphoma, which usually returns. Also, it is not as effective against leukemia.&#xD;
      Apolizumab attaches to a protein called 1D10 on B-cell cancers and has also been able to&#xD;
      shrink tumors in some patients. There is little experience apolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      leukemia. This study will test whether the two antibodies together are more effective against&#xD;
      these tumors than either one alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years and older with B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Patients' leukemia or lymphoma cells must have both the CD20 and&#xD;
      1D10 antigen receptors and must have had at least one systemic treatment for their disease.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests, electrocardiogram, x-rays and other imaging studies, and possibly a bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate (withdrawal of a small marrow sample through a needle inserted into the hip bone)&#xD;
      and lumbar puncture (withdrawal of a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid-fluid that bathes&#xD;
      the brain and spinal cord-through a needle placed between the bones in the lower back).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive infusions of rituximab and apolizumab once a week for 4 weeks. The first&#xD;
      patients in the study receive lower doses of apolizumab with standard doses of rituximab. If&#xD;
      the apolizumab is well tolerated, subsequent patients are given higher doses. Patients are&#xD;
      also given dexamethasone or another similar steroid, diphenhydramine (Benadryl ), and&#xD;
      acetominophen (Tylenol ) to reduce reactions to the antibodies. After 4 weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      patients are followed frequently to examine the response to treatment and evaluate drug side&#xD;
      effects. Patients whose tumors do not grow during the 4 weeks of therapy may be offered&#xD;
      another course of treatment at a later time. Participants are followed periodically after&#xD;
      treatment ends until their disease worsens or the study ends.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are often&#xD;
      responsive to therapy, they are rarely curable and disease control is the primary therapeutic&#xD;
      goal. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown single agent activity in&#xD;
      these diseases and is currently approved for the therapy of recurrent indolent lymphoma.&#xD;
      However, rituximab induces objective remission in at most 60% of cases with inevitable&#xD;
      relapse. The 1D10 antigen, a subclass of the HLA-DR molecule, is expressed in a majority of&#xD;
      cases of B-cell malignancy. Apolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets this&#xD;
      antigen. In a phase I dose escalation trial this antibody has shown clinical activity against&#xD;
      B-cell NHL that express the 1D10 antigen. Acute infusional toxicity has been tolerable, and a&#xD;
      maximum of 5 mg/kg has been given in each of 4 weekly doses. Preclinical in vitro data from&#xD;
      Dr. George Weiner's laboratory suggests at least additive anti-tumor efficacy when cells are&#xD;
      exposed to both antibodies simultaneously. This trial will pilot the use of combination&#xD;
      therapy with rituximab and apolizumab in patients with tumors that express both antigens.&#xD;
      Feasibility and tolerability of the regimen will be determined. Experimental endpoints will&#xD;
      include pharmacokinetics of apolizumab, assessment of apoptosis in circulating CLL cells by&#xD;
      FACS analysis with Annexin 5, assessment of T-and B-cell dynamics, and effects of rituximab&#xD;
      and apolizumab on CLL mRNA as measured by cDNA microarray. Following the first 21 patients on&#xD;
      trial, the administration sequence of rituximab and apolizumab was changed from rituximab&#xD;
      first to apolizumab first to potentially reduce sensitization of apolizumab toxicity by&#xD;
      rituximab.&#xD;
