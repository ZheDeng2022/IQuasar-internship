      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BBR 3464 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that cannot be treated with surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the overall survival of patients with inoperable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with BBR 3464. II. Determine the response&#xD;
      rate, duration of response, time to disease progression, and duration of stable disease in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the incidence and severity of the toxic&#xD;
      effects of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the disease-related symptoms in&#xD;
      patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BBR 3464 IV over 1 hour on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for a minimum of 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
