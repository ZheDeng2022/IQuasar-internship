      This study will test the safety of a new treatment method called tissue ultrafiltration. We&#xD;
      will test this method in the treatment of compartment syndrome, a condition that occurs when&#xD;
      pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels. In the legs and other parts of the&#xD;
      body, a tough, stiff membrane covers groups of muscles and the nerves and blood vessels that&#xD;
      run next to and through them. The entire unit is called a compartment. The causes of&#xD;
      compartment syndrome include traumatic leg injuries and loss of blood supply. In tissue&#xD;
      ultrafiltration, a doctor places hollow probes, or catheters, directly into the muscle&#xD;
      compartment in the injured area of the lower leg. The probes remove fluid from the&#xD;
      compartment (extra fluid can cause increased pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will do an initial safety study in a group of patients who have had surgery for a broken&#xD;
      tibia (the inner, larger bone of the lower leg) and are at high risk for developing&#xD;
      compartment syndrome. The goals of this initial study are to show that inserting tissue&#xD;
      ultrafiltration catheters in the muscle compartment is safe and can be done repeatedly&#xD;
      without problems; to show that tissue ultrafiltration can be used to monitor the biochemical&#xD;
      environment inside tissues; and to show that the catheter apparatus provides an accurate&#xD;
      measurement of pressure in the compartment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The human clinical trials are organized as a series of consecutive studies designed to&#xD;
      demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ultrafiltration in the management of compartment&#xD;
      syndrome (CS). The first study is a cohort study of patients with tibial shaft fractures that&#xD;
      will test the safety of the catheters as well as demonstrate that ultrafiltration fibers&#xD;
      provide an improved method for monitoring myofascial compartment physiology. The goals of&#xD;
      this study are to (1) demonstrate that inserting ultrafiltration (UF) catheters is safe and&#xD;
      reproducible; (2) show that CSUF allows for biochemical assessment of cellular function; and&#xD;
      (3) show that the CSUF apparatus provides an accurate measurement of intracompartmental&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of 10 patients with closed or open Gustilo grade I, grade&#xD;
      II, or grade IIIa tibial shaft fractures that require surgical stabilization. We will recruit&#xD;
      patients for the study at the study centers. Data collected during this study will be&#xD;
      numerical values for the biochemical measurements and for the intramuscular pressure (IMP)&#xD;
      measurements. We will compare the CSUF system values for intramuscular pressure with IMP&#xD;
      measured with a Stryker device. Finally, we will correlate serial changes in the biochemical&#xD;
      measures to any changes in IMP. The metabolic assay will show increased UF levels compared to&#xD;
      serum levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will consider fasciotomy when the IMP is within 30 mmHg of the patient's diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, or when the clinical examination of the patient demands. We will make repeat IMP&#xD;
      measurements at the time of fasciotomy and record the interval to and reasons for fasciotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the operative stabilization of the tibial fracture and before the final closure of&#xD;
      any traumatic wounds, we will insert multiple UF catheters into the anterior, lateral, and&#xD;
      posterior (superficial and deep) compartments of the leg. Techniques used for catheter&#xD;
      insertion will be similar to existing methods for the insertion of drainage catheters and we&#xD;
      do not anticipate any specific difficulties with this step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure intramuscular pressure, we will connect one of the catheters designed for this&#xD;
      purpose to a standard pressure transducer and will use it to monitor intracompartmental&#xD;
      pressure (IMP) in real-time. In addition, we will use a standard wick catheter, inserted&#xD;
      separately, for control measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For biochemical measurements, we will analyze samples of the interstitial fluid removed by&#xD;
      CSUF for levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),&#xD;
      osmolarity, pH, and pO2. We will obtain fluid every 4 hours for up to 48 hours. The assays&#xD;
      will be performed by standard clinical laboratory techniques.&#xD;
