      Although Neopharm has terminated its sponsorship of this study, it is continuing under the&#xD;
      sponsorship of the NCI. Please see &quot;Experimental Drug SS1(dsFv)-PE38 to Treat Cancer&quot; (Study&#xD;
      ID number 010011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 is an oncology drug product containing a bacteria toxin, fused to a high&#xD;
      affinity, disulfide stabilized antibody. The fused protein retains cell killing activity, but&#xD;
      binds only to cells expressing mesothelin. Tumors characterized by very high surface&#xD;
      mesothelin expression include mesothelioma; epithelial carcinomas of ovary and peritoneum;&#xD;
      and squamous cancers of cervix and upper aerodigestive tract, including esophagus, head, and&#xD;
      neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous&#xD;
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered continuously for 10 days every four weeks for a maximum of four&#xD;
      courses of treatment. Dose escalation will proceed in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) is observed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Investigate the safety and efficacy of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered as a 10-day&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 given by&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion for ten days in patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate response of selected advanced malignancies to continuous intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 for ten days at doses near the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Characterize the plasma kinetics of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered by continuous intravenous&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the appearance of serum antibody to SS1(dsFv)-PE38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: To exclude immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction, each patient will&#xD;
      receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38, and be observed for 30 minutes prior to receiving the&#xD;
      continuous infusion on Day 1 of each treatment course. Each treatment will be given by&#xD;
      continuous intravenous infusion for ten days. After the first 24 hours of infusion, at the&#xD;
      Investigator's discretion, patients will be allowed to leave the hospital on day pass per NCI&#xD;
      policies. After the end of infusion patients will be observed overnight. The first patient at&#xD;
      each dose level must be observed for development of toxicity for at least 14 days after the&#xD;
      beginning of treatment before additional patients are enrolled. At least three patients will&#xD;
      be accrued at each dose level. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients&#xD;
