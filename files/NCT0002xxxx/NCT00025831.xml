  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect biological samples-buccal cells, blood sample, skin sample-to be used&#xD;
      in developing and testing laboratory methods for measuring and analyzing genes. Such methods&#xD;
      can be used for research on identifying genetic factors that may affect a person's cancer&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals age 21 and older may participate in this study. Participants will provide one&#xD;
      or more of the following samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal (mouth) cells - obtained by swishing a small amount of mouthwash in the mouth or&#xD;
           by swabbing or bushing the inside of the cheek with a swab or brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood - obtained by pricking the finger and collecting the drops or by blood drawing&#xD;
           through a needle placed in an arm vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin - obtained by a punch biopsy on the inner upper arm. For this procedure, the skin&#xD;
           is anesthetized and a small piece of skin is removed with a sharp instrument similar to&#xD;
           a cookie cutter. The wound is then covered and held together with a sterile bandage. A&#xD;
           small scar, approximately 1/8-inch long, will be left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most participants will be asked to provide only a buccal sample; blood and/or skin samples&#xD;
      will be requested from a few participants. The blood and skin samples may be used to grow&#xD;
      cell lines; that is, to make them grow indefinitely for research uses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose two related activities that involve the collection of biological samples. The&#xD;
      first involves the collection of mouthwash samples from 200 volunteers, to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of pooling samples for quantitative genotype determinations. For a small number&#xD;
      of volunteers, we will also collect a peripheral blood sample and a skin punch biopsy for&#xD;
      establishment of lymphoblastoid and fibroblast cell lines. The blood and skin samples will be&#xD;
      used to compare the amount and subcellular localization of DNA repair proteins between&#xD;
      lymphocytes (cells most commonly collected in epidemiologic studies) and fibroblasts (the&#xD;
      cell types commonly used in assay development). In addition, we will conduct hands-on&#xD;
      education and training sessions in molecular genetics for members of DCEG and others. The&#xD;
      hands-on education sessions will be aimed at non-laboratory scientists and involve 6-9 hours&#xD;
      of demonstration and participation in basic molecular genetics techniques. Participants will&#xD;
      have the option of collecting their own mouthwash sample, extracting the DNA, and performing&#xD;
      a genotyping assay on their sample in the Laboratory of Population Genetics in Building 41.&#xD;
      After the education session, the biological samples will be reassigned arbitrary numbers not&#xD;
      linked to personally identifying information and will be used for laboratory methods&#xD;
      development only.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals age 21 and older will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants who have volunteered for previous DCEG studies within the past three years in&#xD;
        which buccal or blood samples were collected will be excluded because the samples collected&#xD;
        in the current study may be combined with some previously collected samples and duplication&#xD;
        of subjects is to be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals with known active oral disease will be excluded from the buccal cell collection&#xD;
        component, and those known to form keloids will be excluded from the skin biopsy component.&#xD;
