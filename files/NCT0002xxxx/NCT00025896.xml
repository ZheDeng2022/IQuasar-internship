  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha&#xD;
      glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored&#xD;
      form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In infants with severe cases&#xD;
      of Pompe disease (called Classical Infantile Pompe disease), an excessive amount of glycogen&#xD;
      accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart, skeletal muscle, and liver,&#xD;
      which prevents their normal function. This study being conducted to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as a potential enzyme&#xD;
      replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Patients diagnosed with Classical Infantile Pompe&#xD;
      disease who have a small, but inactive, amount of natural GAA enzyme present in their bodies&#xD;
      (called Cross-Reacting Immunologic Material-Positive or &quot;CRIM (+)&quot; patients), will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
