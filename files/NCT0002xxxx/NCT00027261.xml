  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the experimental vaccine, ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) is safe&#xD;
      and to study how the immune system responds to the vaccine. This trial is designed to&#xD;
      determine whether a higher vaccine dose (6 times the usual dose) will elicit a higher immune&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of May 2001, over 200 people received the ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) vaccine at the lower dose.&#xD;
      The higher dose of the vaccine to be used in this study has not been given to humans&#xD;
      previously. High doses of a similar vaccine have been given to a few people without serious&#xD;
      side effects. In a recent study done in mice, higher doses of ALVAC-HIV produced stronger&#xD;
      immune responses. It is possible that the doses of ALVAC-HIV given to humans are below the&#xD;
      amount needed for the maximum immune response. Because the exact relationship between an&#xD;
      increased immune response and its effectiveness in preventing HIV infection is uncertain, the&#xD;
      HVTN will use the highest dose that can be manufactured.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, adverse reactions to immunization with the various ALVAC-HIV candidate vaccines,&#xD;
      including ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452), have been similar to those observed in healthy adults who have&#xD;
      received other licensed vaccines of similar types. In a previous trial, even high doses of&#xD;
      recombinant ALVAC vaccine were well tolerated in a group of participants that were&#xD;
      significantly immunocompromised. In a recent study done in mice concerning dose escalation&#xD;
      using the ALVAC-HIV vectors, the data demonstrated more robust immune responses with higher&#xD;
      doses of ALVAC-HIV (vCP1452) in mice. It is certainly possible that the doses of ALVAC-HIV&#xD;
      given to humans are well below the amount needed for a maximal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)&#xD;
      response. As the predictive value of a CTL response is at present unknown with respect to its&#xD;
      efficacy in preventing or ameliorating HIV acquisition or infection, the HVTN will utilize&#xD;
      the highest dose that can be currently manufactured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study products are to be administered intramuscularly. Participants will receive 1 of 3&#xD;
      injections. Group A will receive a high dose of vaccine, group B will receive a low dose of&#xD;
      vaccine, and group C will receive a placebo. Participants are inoculated at 4 time points.&#xD;
      Assessment of product safety includes clinical observation, monitoring of hematological,&#xD;
      chemical, and immunologic parameters, and a social harms questionnaire. Safety will be&#xD;
      evaluated by monitoring of participants for local and systemic adverse reactions during the&#xD;
      course of the trial. Participants will be monitored longitudinally for HIV-specific serologic&#xD;
      and cellular immune responses.&#xD;
