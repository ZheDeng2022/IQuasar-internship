  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 131MIBG in treating malignant pheochromocytoma&#xD;
      and whether sensitization medications improve the response to treatment. Pheochromocytoma is&#xD;
      a rare type of tumor that usually occurs in the adrenal glands. The tumor cells release&#xD;
      chemicals like adrenaline that can cause large increases in blood pressure and pulse rate,&#xD;
      with serious health consequences. Tumor in the adrenal glands usually can be removed&#xD;
      surgically, but if the pheochromocytoma is malignant-i.e., has spread to many sites in the&#xD;
      body-or is located in places where surgery is difficult or impossible, no satisfactory&#xD;
      treatment is available. 131MIBG is a combination of an adrenaline-like chemical and a&#xD;
      radioactive form of iodine. The 131MIBG attaches to the tumor cells and the high&#xD;
      concentration of radioactive iodine kills them. Previous studies using 131MIBG to treat&#xD;
      pheochromocytoma had a 36% response rate in terms of complete or partial improvement. This&#xD;
      study will examine whether adding other sensitization medications to the 131MIBG treatment&#xD;
      regimen will enhance its effectiveness in reducing the size and number of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with malignant or inoperable pheochromocytoma may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 18-month study. Candidates will be screened with various tests and&#xD;
      procedures, which may include a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      lung function studies, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, computed tomography (CT), magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and bone scans and other scans&#xD;
      using radioactive MIBG and octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) 131MIBG plus&#xD;
      sensitization medications, or 2) 131MIBG alone. All patients will be hospitalized 3 to 5 days&#xD;
      for each 131MIBG treatment. The drug will be infused through a vein (intravenously, or I.V.)&#xD;
      over 10 to 30 minutes. Patients will receive up to 3 treatments, separated by at least 3&#xD;
      months. All patients will also take potassium to protect the thyroid gland from radioactive&#xD;
      iodine generated by the 131MIBG. The potassium is taken twice a day for 30 days, beginning&#xD;
      the day before the 131MIBG treatment. Patients in the sensitization group will receive the&#xD;
      following additional drugs for sensitization: methylprednisolone, intravenously a few minutes&#xD;
      before 131MIBG treatment; Roaccutan, by mouth (capsules) twice a day for 6 weeks before&#xD;
      treatment; Demser, by mouth 3 times a week for 1 week before treatment, and Carbidopa, by&#xD;
      mouth every 6 hours for 4 days before treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each treatment, patients will have a clinical evaluation and periodic blood tests to&#xD;
      check for adverse side effects of radiotherapy. Follow-up visits at NIH will be scheduled at&#xD;
      12 and 18 months after the first 131MIBG treatment for clinical, laboratory and imaging&#xD;
      tests. Patients who had tumors in the lungs before treatment will have lung function tests 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6 months after each treatment. CT, MRI 131MIBG, and PET scanning will be done 1 week&#xD;
      before each treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have tumors that have grown by more than 25% and none that have shrunk by more&#xD;
      than 50% or who have developed one or more new tumors while on 131MIBG treatment will be&#xD;
      taken off the study.&#xD;

      Pheochromocytomas are tumors of chromaffin cells that synthesize catecholamines. This project&#xD;
      tests the efficacy of radiotoxic treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma using&#xD;
      (131)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine [(131)I-MIBG], and in particular, tests whether pre-treatment&#xD;
      with enhancer pharmaceuticals increases the efficacy of experimental (131)I-MIBG treatment in&#xD;
      reducing the size and number of tumors and the tumor burden.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Patients will have malignant pheochromocytoma defined as a locally-invasive adrenal tumor&#xD;
        and/or a metastatic extra-adrenal tumor located in tissues where chromaffin cells are not&#xD;
        normally present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Histologic proof of pheochromocytoma is not required but the nature of the tumor will be&#xD;
        confirmed either by surgical pathological diagnosis or by biochemical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have single or multiple tumors. There must be at least one discrete metastatic&#xD;
        tumor that can be detected and measured by CT or MRI. Metastatic tumor sites may or may not&#xD;
        be resectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The tumor(s) must concentrate [131]I-MIBG.&#xD;

        than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Renal dysfunction (serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl);&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Weight over 136 kg, This is the limit for the scanning tables;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Combined blood withdrawal greater than 450 ml during the six weeks preceding the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Impaired mental capacity that precludes written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior experimental treatment with [131I]-MIBG, [90Y]-octreotide (an alternative agent being&#xD;
        investigated to treat pheochromocytoma), or chemotherapy will exclude the patient, if this&#xD;
        treatment was received in the previous 3 months provided the patient meets all other entry&#xD;
        criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Labetalol, reserpine, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic anti-depressants, phenylephrine,&#xD;
        phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and some atypical&#xD;
        anti-depressants/anti-psychotics interfere with uptake of [131I]-MIBG by pheochromocytomas.&#xD;
        If a patient cannot change to a non-interfering pharmaceutical, they will be ineligible for&#xD;
        the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Due to the potiential immunosuppressive effect of radiation therapy, patients with positive&#xD;
        HIV are excluded from this study. Patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C are excluded due&#xD;
        to the potential of liver toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received high dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant therapy or&#xD;
        stem cell infusion are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have received radiation therapy to the pelvis and/or spine are excluded. Local&#xD;
        radiation therapy to one site (excluding pelvis/spine) will be permitted provided that at&#xD;
        least 1 year has lapsed and the patient meets all other entry criteria.&#xD;
