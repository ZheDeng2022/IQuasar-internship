      To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of corticosteroid and leukotriene receptor&#xD;
      antagonists, focusing on their effects on T lymphocytes during both chronic (18 months) and&#xD;
      acute therapy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. T lymphocytes are essential for initiating and&#xD;
      maintaining the asthmatic inflammatory immune response. Corticosteroid treatment targets&#xD;
      several inflammatory responses, including T lymphocytemediated responses. In addition,&#xD;
      leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) may influence T cell activation. To investigate the&#xD;
      effects of these two controller agents in the treatment of asthma on airway function is the&#xD;
      goal of the IMPACT clinical trial in mild chronic adult asthmatics. The Improving Asthma&#xD;
      Control Trial (IMPACT) is one of the trials within the NHLBI-supported Asthma Clinical&#xD;
      Research Network (ACRN). IMPACT is a double-blind, randomized, parallel group design clinical&#xD;
      trial to determine the best long-term strategy for treating adults with mild asthma who&#xD;
      experience symptoms more than occasionally. The trial will test whether these patients should&#xD;
      be taking anti-inflammatory medications on a daily basis and whether a newer class of&#xD;
      medications provides the same benefit as older drugs. In the IMPACT study, 234 adults with&#xD;
      mild asthma who have more than occasional symptoms will be enrolled in six clinical research&#xD;
      centers. Following an initial evaluation, patients will be randomized to receive either a&#xD;
      twice daily inhaled corticosteroid, a twice daily anti-leukotriene, or a placebo. All&#xD;
      patients will receive treatment for symptoms if and when they occur. The results should&#xD;
      demonstrate whether medication is required on a daily basis by these patients, and if so,&#xD;
      whether inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers are equally effective. Recruitment&#xD;
      began in May, 2000. The trial is expected to be completed in 2003.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is in response to an initiative &quot;Ancillary Studies in Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Disease Trials&quot; released by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in June 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 39 patients, 13 in each arm, will be randomized to inhaled steroid, leukotriene&#xD;
      receptor antagonist or placebo and followed for 18 months for changes in T-cell costimulatory&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;
