      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of taurolidine in treating patients who&#xD;
      have recurrent or progressive glioma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of taurolidine in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      or progressive high-grade glioma. II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine&#xD;
      the response in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine IV over 1-4 hours on&#xD;
      days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      taurolidine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the&#xD;
      dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
