  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has several parts. One part will examine the influence of factors such as&#xD;
      personality and past experience on reactions to unpleasant stimuli. Others will examine the&#xD;
      effect of personality and emotional and attentional states on learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When confronted with fearful or unpleasant events, people can develop fear of specific cues&#xD;
      that were associated with these events as well as to the environmental context in which the&#xD;
      events occurred via a process called classical conditioning. Classical conditioning has been&#xD;
      used to model anxiety disorders, but the relationship between stress and anxiety and&#xD;
      conditioned responses remains unclear. This study will examine the relationship between cued&#xD;
      conditioning and context conditioning . This study will also explore the acquisition and&#xD;
      retention of different types of motor, emotional, and cognitive associative processes during&#xD;
      various tasks that range from mildly arousing to stressful.&#xD;

      Objective: Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses to different types of threats. Fear is a&#xD;
      short-duration response evoked by explicit threat cues and anxiety a more sustained state of&#xD;
      apprehension evoked by unpredictable threat. This protocol studied fear using Pavlovian fear&#xD;
      conditioning in two studies. Studies 1 and 3. Study 2 focused on anxiety. Studies 1 and 3&#xD;
      will be discontinued to focus uniquely on the study of anxiety. Specifically, we will examine&#xD;
      the interactions between anxiety induced experimentally using verbal threat and cognitive&#xD;
      processes. We will seek to 1) characterize the effect of anxiety on key cognitive processes&#xD;
      including working memory and attention control and 2) examine the extent to which performance&#xD;
      of cognitive tasks distract from anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: This more-than-minimal-risk protocol will test medically and&#xD;
      psychiatrically healthy volunteers aged 18-50. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Fear and anxiety will be measured using the startle reflex to brief and loud sounds.&#xD;
      Fear conditioning will be assessed using shock as unconditioned stimulus. Cognitive&#xD;
      performance will be examined during periods of unpredictable shock anticipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The study will include cognitive performance and measure of aversive&#xD;
      states, primarily the startle reflex.&#xD;
