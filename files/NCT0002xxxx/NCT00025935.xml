    <textblock>
      This study seeks to learn more about the symptoms of severe mood dysregulation in children&#xD;
      and adolescents ages 7-17. Children and adolescents with severe mood dysregulation (SMD)&#xD;
      display chronic anger, sadness, or irritability, as well as hyperarousal (such as insomnia,&#xD;
      distractibility, hyperactivity) and extreme responses to frustration (such as frequent,&#xD;
      severe temper tantrums). Researchers will describe the moods and behaviors of children with&#xD;
      these symptoms and use specialized testing and brain imaging to learn about the brain changes&#xD;
      associated with this disorder....&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irritability is a common and impairing clinical presentation in youth. Despite its&#xD;
      significant public health impact, the clinical course and pathophysiology of irritability&#xD;
      remains poorly understood. Chronic and severe irritability is the primary symptom of the new&#xD;
      DSM-5 diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), is an associated symptom of&#xD;
      other pediatric disorders including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and can&#xD;
      be a clinical precursor to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. In&#xD;
      addition, irritability is a trait distributed continuously in youth, thereby fitting well&#xD;
      within the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)&#xD;
      initiative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically impairing irritability in children and adolescents began to gain more attention as&#xD;
      interest grew in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder. Beginning in the 1990s, child&#xD;
      psychiatry researchers suggested that while pediatric bipolar disorder can present with&#xD;
      distinct episodes of mania or hypomania as in adults, the more typical pediatric presentation&#xD;
      was chronic, severe irritability and hyperarousal symptoms. However, data collected under&#xD;
      this protocol comprise a series of longitudinal, family, behavioral, and pathophysiological&#xD;
      studies that differentiated classically defined episodic pediatric bipolar disorder from&#xD;
      chronic irritability without distinct manic or hypomanic episodes. These findings are&#xD;
      consistent with reports from other groups and meta-analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the several strands of research designed to differentiate pediatric bipolar disorder&#xD;
      from chronic irritability, longitudinal studies provide the strongest evidence that these two&#xD;
      phenotypes are distinct. Children with chronic irritability are at elevated risk for later&#xD;
      depression, but not manic episodes. Thus, youth with MDD (with and without prior DMDD) are an&#xD;
      important comparison group to explore, and we are examining the developmental trajectory,&#xD;
      phenomenology, behavioral correlates, and underlying neural mechanisms of chronic&#xD;
      irritability and MDD in youth. Further, because irritability and ADHD symptoms are highly&#xD;
      comorbid in youth, participants with ADHD are an important comparison group in our work on&#xD;
      irritability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current translational model of irritability emphasizes the role of abnormal threat and&#xD;
      reward processing, but also underlines the relevance of environmental factors in the&#xD;
      emergence and maintenance of irritability. More precisely, it is assumed that irritable&#xD;
      children experience environments, where rewards and punishments are inconsistently delivered&#xD;
      leading to unintentional reinforcement of disruptive behavior through the parents. Reasons&#xD;
      for this inconsistent parent behavior could be manifold spanning instrumental learning&#xD;
      deficits and exaggerated responses to threat and frustrative non-reward in the parents&#xD;
      themselves as well as lack of knowledge regarding learning principles and increased levels of&#xD;
      stress . These factors might contribute to instrumental-learning deficits in the children&#xD;
      increasing frequency and intensity of temper outbursts. Heightened levels of chronic&#xD;
      irritability, another symptom of DMDD, might be more associated with features of the&#xD;
      parent-child interaction. There is a rich literature within the framework of attachment&#xD;
      theory showing that behavior of children with anxious-resistant insecure attachment is&#xD;
      characterized by a general angry tone and is also associated with increased amygdala&#xD;
      responses to negative social scenes. In addition, it was also shown that highly irritable&#xD;
      infants are less sociable in terms of being less responsive and more fearful towards others&#xD;
      and displaying an angry emotional tone in general as toddlers when they had been insecurely&#xD;
      attached and more sociable when they had been securely attached. Adding another layer of&#xD;
      complexity, it is also conceivable that inconsistent parent behavior diminishes parent s&#xD;
      perceived trust-worthiness. This could be of relevance as recent studies showed that persons&#xD;
      are less willing to delay rewards an action bound to increase levels of frustration if their&#xD;
      interaction partner is perceived as little reliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to gain a clearer understanding of the environmental factors contributing&#xD;
      to irritability in order to inform treatment and improve the outcome for children. As part of&#xD;
      this overall goal, we plan to collect information on numerous environmental factors. First,&#xD;
      we plan to investigate parents of youth with DMDD enrolled in this study and subthreshold&#xD;
      DMDD enrolled in this study in order to determine clinical, behavioral, neuropsychological,&#xD;
      neurophysiological and neuroanatomical features of the parents that contribute to the&#xD;
      symptomatology in the children and adolescents. Further, we plan to examine parent-child&#xD;
      interaction and its influence on irritability observed in the youth. Second, we plan to&#xD;
      investigate the role of environmental stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on youth s&#xD;
      irritability symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 6 separate populations being studied in this protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old who meet criteria for DMDD&#xD;
           or subthreshold DMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents of children and adolescents, who meet criteria for DMDD or subthreshold DMDD and&#xD;
           are enrolled in 02-M-0021, and are 25 - 59 years old will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy volunteer children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Healthy volunteer adults between the ages of 18-25 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Children and adolescents between the ages of 12-17 years old who meet criteria for major&#xD;
           depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Children and adolescents between ages of 8-17 years who meet criteria for&#xD;
           attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who do not have a mood disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children and adolescents with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, this study is an&#xD;
      outpatient characterization and longitudinal follow-along design. Once determined to be&#xD;
      eligible, individuals come for an initial assessment, and then return at varying intervals&#xD;
      until age 25 for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For healthy volunteer children, adults and parents of healthy volunteer children, this study&#xD;
      is an outpatient cross-sectional study that includes clinical interviews, behavioral tasks,&#xD;
      and structural and functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all individuals, genetic material from saliva or blood is obtained under protocol&#xD;
      01-M-0254.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two primary outcome measures. First, this study will examine associations between&#xD;
      irritability and clinical, behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological&#xD;
      variables in individuals with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, ADHD, anxiety, and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Second, this study will examine between-group differences in clinical,&#xD;
      behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological variables in individuals with&#xD;
      full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, ADHD, anxiety, and healthy volunteers.&#xD;

                  component of the study until age 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1.1.2 Abnormal mood (specifically, anger, sadness, and/or irritability), present&#xD;
                  at least half of the day most days (or at least half the day at least one day per&#xD;
                  week for subthreshold), and of sufficient severity to be noticeable by people in&#xD;
                  the child s environment (e.g. parents, teachers, peers).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1.1.3 Compared to his/her peers, the child exhibits markedly increased reactivity&#xD;
                  to negative emotional stimuli that is manifest verbally or behaviorally. For&#xD;
                  example, the child responds to frustration with extended temper tantrums&#xD;
                  (inappropriate for age and/or precipitating event), verbal rages, and/or&#xD;
                  aggression toward people or property. Such events occur, on average, at least&#xD;
                  three times a week. For subthreshold DMDD such tantrums occur on average at least&#xD;
                  once per month.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1.1.4 The symptoms in # 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 above are currently present and have&#xD;

                  (distractibility, intrusiveness) in a second setting. For subthreshold DMDD,&#xD;
                  there must be evidence of impairment causing distress to the child or to those&#xD;
                  around him/her in at least one setting.&#xD;
