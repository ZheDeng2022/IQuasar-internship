      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the function of certain brain chemicals and&#xD;
      receptors in patients with mood disorders. This study will also examine how the stress&#xD;
      hormone cortisol affects brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data suggest that serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor function is abnormal in patients with mood&#xD;
      disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). However, these&#xD;
      data are limited because they are based on small sample sizes. In this study, PET scans will&#xD;
      be used to compare 5-HT1A receptor binding potential between mood disorder patients and&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have an initial medical and psychiatric evaluation. Depression&#xD;
      severity, anxiety, negative thinking, level of functioning, intelligence, and cognitive&#xD;
      functions will be measured. Urine, saliva, and blood will be collected. Women will have a&#xD;
      pregnancy test and tests to determine menstrual phase and time of ovulation. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scans of the brain. Some participants&#xD;
      will have other procedures such as a lumbar puncture. Participants with Cushing's disease&#xD;
      will undergo imaging as a comparison group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multiple lines of evidence suggest that serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor and serotonin&#xD;
      transporter (5-HTT) function is abnormal in major depressive disorder (MDD) and that somatic&#xD;
      antidepressant treatments effect changes in the function of these systems that are relevant&#xD;
      to their therapeutic mechanisms. The data supporting these hypotheses have been obtained by&#xD;
      assessing neuroendocrine and temperature responses to 5-HT1A agonists in MDD subjects,&#xD;
      measuring 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HTT binding in brain tissue acquired post mortem from small&#xD;
      samples of MDD subjects, and examining effects on 5-HT1A receptor function in rats following&#xD;
      antidepressant drug (AD) administration. The recent development of highly selective 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor and 5-HTT radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging made direct,&#xD;
      noninvasive exploration of the central serotonin sites binding possible. Two studies&#xD;
      conducted using one of these, [carbonyl-11C]-WAY-100635, found reduced 5-HT1A receptor&#xD;
      binding potential (BP) in the mesiotemporal cortex, the raphe, and the prefrontal cortex&#xD;
      (PFC). Pilot data from these studies suggested that the abnormal reduction in 5-HT1A receptor&#xD;
      BP is more prominent in bipolar disorder (BD) than MDD subjects (i.e., unipolar depressives)&#xD;
      who did not have bipolar relatives, and that it exists independently of mood state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these data have the limitations that the subject samples studied in these&#xD;
      preliminary post mortem and PET series have been small, and that [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635&#xD;
      uptake is difficult to quantitate in PET images. Therefore, these observations require&#xD;
      replication in subject samples large enough to establish main effects of diagnostic subtype&#xD;
      using a 5-HT1A receptor radioligand that can be validly quantitated. A selective 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor radioligand suitable for this purpose, [18F]FC-WAY100635 ([18F]FCWAY), has recently&#xD;
      been developed at the NIH. In addition, a recently developed selective 5-HTT ligand, [11C]&#xD;
      DASB provides a unique opportunity to image the 5-HTT in the same depressed sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will advance knowledge regarding the neurobiology of mood disorders by&#xD;
      employing PET and [18F]FCWAY and [11C] DASB to compare 5-HT1A receptor BP between mood&#xD;
      disordered and healthy control subjects in the mesiotemporal cortex, raphe, anterior&#xD;
      cingulate gyrus, and left orbital cortex. The following hypotheses, based upon pilot data&#xD;
      acquired using [carbonyl-11C]-WAY-100636, will be tested: 1) Depressives have reduced 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor binding relative to healthy controls. 2) Bipolar depressives will have significantly&#xD;
      greater reductions in 5-HT1A receptor binding than unipolar depressives with only unipolar&#xD;
      relatives. A pilot study in which bipolar depressives are treated with lithium or divalproex&#xD;
      and then re-imaged will test the third hypothesis, that 5-HT1A receptor binding will increase&#xD;
      in bipolar subjects during mood stabilizer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, because central 5-HT1A receptor density is down-regulated in rodents by&#xD;
      corticosterone administration and by stress-mediated corticosterone secretion, assessments of&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity (which is commonly elevated in MDD and&#xD;
      BD), will be assessed to determine whether down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptors correlates&#xD;
      with cortisol hypersecretion in mood disorders. Because this down-regulation may play a&#xD;
      compensatory role to reduce cortisol secretion, neuroendocrine assessments of long-standing&#xD;
      rather than acute hypercortisolism and of the pathophysiological diathesis to hypersecrete&#xD;
      cortisol will be emphasized as providing the most sensitive correlates of reduced 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor binding. A medical control group with Cushing's Disease will also be imaged to&#xD;
      determine whether pathological elevation of glucocorticoid levels down-regulates 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor expression in humans, as it does in rats.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        MDD SAMPLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Seventy subjects (ages 18 to 60) with MDD will be selected who additionally meet criteria&#xD;
        for one of 3 subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) MDD, Currently depressed with FPDD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MDD,&#xD;
        currently in a major depressive episode, who have a first degree relative with MDD but no&#xD;
        first degree relatives with mania, alcoholism, or antisocial personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) MDD, Currently in remission with a history of FPDD, defined as a period of at least six&#xD;
        months with no more than one clinically significant symptom, and during which time subjects&#xD;
        were not taking an AD agent. Subjects will thus meet the historical criteria for recurrent&#xD;
        MDD (DSM-IV). We will also require that subjects previously had a least one antidepressant&#xD;
        drug trial, to ensure that the severity of previous episodes warranted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C) MDD, Currently depressed, non-FPDD. To assess the specificity of the findings in MDD to&#xD;
        FPDD, a sample meeting criteria for MDD, currently in a depressive episode, but not FPDD&#xD;
        will also be imaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        BIPOLAR DEPRESSED SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Forty five subjects (ages 18 to 60) who meet DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and are&#xD;
        currently in a major depressive episode. Subjects may be inpatients or outpatients. Because&#xD;
        effective treatment will not be discontinued for the purposes of this protocol, subjects&#xD;
        will be identified who have never been treated or who have discontinued medication due to&#xD;
        lack of efficacy, noncompliance, physician order or other reasons prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY, LOW RISK, CONTROL SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        One hundred and four subjects (ages 18 to 60) who have not met criteria for any major&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder. The control subjects will have no known first or second degree&#xD;
        relatives with mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CUSHINGS DISEASE CONTROL SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ten subjects (ages 18 to 60) with probable Cushing's Disease will be recruited who have&#xD;
        both clinical and biochemical evidence of hypercortisolism (including urinary free cortisol&#xD;
        excretion higher than the upper limit of normal (greater than 248) nmole/day, and marked&#xD;
        central adiposity, cutaneous atrophy, proximal myopathy, and large purple striae). The&#xD;
        diagnosis of probable Cushing's Disease will also have been established prior to referral&#xD;
        via CRH and ACTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        MENSTRUALLY-RELATED DYSPHORIC DISORDER SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (n equals 12; ages 18-50). These females are recruited, screened and diagnosed by&#xD;
        collaboration under protocol number 81-M-0126, previously approved by IRB, entitled 'The&#xD;
        Phenomenology and Biophysiology of Menstrually Regulated Mood and Behavioral Disorders',&#xD;
        principal investigator, David Rubinow, M.D. As described in that protocol these subjects&#xD;
        must have a regular menstrual cycle lasting 21 - 33 days and meet the following criteria:&#xD;
        1) history within the last two years of at least six months with menstrually-related mood&#xD;
        or behavioral disturbances of at least moderate severity - that is, disturbances that are&#xD;
        distinct in appearance and associated with a notable degree of subjective distress; 2) a 30&#xD;
        percent increase in mean negative mood ratings (relative to the range of the scale&#xD;
        employed) in the premenstrual week compared with the week following the end of menses in at&#xD;
        least two of the three cycles; 3) age 18 to 50; 4) not pregnant and in good medical health;&#xD;
        5) regular menses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        REMITTED MDD WITH AND WITHOUT A HISTORY OF PPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (n=40; ages 18-40). These subjects are recruited, screened and diagnosed by collaboration&#xD;
        under 95-M-0097, previously approved by IRB entitled An Endocrine Modal for Postpartum Mood&#xD;
        Disorders. These subjects will have a history of DSM-IV MDD. Twenty will also have had a&#xD;
        hypomanic/manic episode that occurred within three months of childbirth and twenty will&#xD;
        have not had the latter within three months of childbirth. Women will have been well for a&#xD;
        minimum of one year, have a regular menstrual cycle for at least three months, medication&#xD;
        free (including birth control pill), have no history of puerperal suicide attempts or&#xD;
        psychotic episodes requiring hospitalization. Any women with a current axis I psychiatric&#xD;
        diagnosis will be excluded from participating in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY FEMALE CONTROLS UNDER 95-M-0097:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (n=20, age 18-40). These healthy control women are under an identical drug administration&#xD;
        regimen as the 40 remitted MDD women above and will similarly be recruited and screened&#xD;
        under 95-M-0097. They will meet the same criteria specified for the remitted MDD group&#xD;
        above but will not have any past or present Axis I diagnosis or evidence of menstrually&#xD;
        related mood disorders. This healthy sample of females will have given birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must not have taken antidepressant or other medications likely to alter monoamine&#xD;
        neurochemistry or cerebrovascular function for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine)&#xD;
        prior to scanning. Subjects being scanned at two points or the same point twice in their&#xD;
        menstrual cycle must not have taken birth control pills for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
        scanning. However, effective medications will not be discontinued for the purposes of this&#xD;
        study. Instead, subjects will be recruited who are not currently receiving psychotropic&#xD;
        drugs. Subjects will also be excluded if they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. serious suicidal ideation or behavior;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. psychosis to the extent that the ability to provide informed consent is in doubt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or&#xD;
             drug dependence (DSM IV criteria);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. current pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. current breast feeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. general MRI exclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. previous exposure to ecstasy (i.e. MDMA) which has neurotoxic effects on 5-HTT&#xD;
             expressing neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects beyond age 50 are excluded from the MRMD sample due to peri-menopausal status and&#xD;
        subjects beyond age 60 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by&#xD;
        the MDD criteria, since depressives whose age-at MDD-onset is later than 60 have a far&#xD;
        greater likelihood of having MRI correlates of cerebrovascular disease than age-matched,&#xD;
        healthy controls or age-matched, early-onset depressives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects whose first major depressive episodes arose temporally after other major medical&#xD;
        or psychiatric conditions will also be excluded, since their functional imaging results&#xD;
        generally differ from those reported in primary MDD.&#xD;
