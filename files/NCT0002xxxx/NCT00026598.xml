  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how changes in the brain associated with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease influence the control of motor and thinking speed. There is disagreement&#xD;
      over whether patients with Parkinson's disease are slow in thinking as well as movement. This&#xD;
      study may provide a new framework to explain the relationship between motor and cognitive&#xD;
      aspects of human behavior and help to clarify the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to the study: behavioral tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI). All participants will be asked about their medical history, have a physical&#xD;
      examination, and complete a questionnaire. They must not take regular medications, including&#xD;
      levodopa and dopamine agonists, for 8 hours prior to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The behavioral study involves computer-generated neuropsychological tasks, including hand&#xD;
      movements, imagination of movements, and mental calculations. Response will be recorded and&#xD;
      evaluated. Electrodes may be placed on the participant's skin to measure surface&#xD;
      electromyogram (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fMRI study involves MRI scanning in which motor and thinking tasks are performed.&#xD;
      Electrodes may be placed on the skin to monitor muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty patients, ages 40 and up, with early-stage Parkinson's disease will be recruited.&#xD;
      Sixty normal volunteers ages 21-75 will be included as well for comparison.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high-level of motor control often requires complex processing of sensory information. Such&#xD;
      a cognitive aspect of motor control is supposed to share underlying neural components with&#xD;
      non-motor, cognitive operations. The present study is aimed to clarify the similarity and&#xD;
      difference between cognitive processing for motor control and non-motor, cognitive&#xD;
      processing, especially in terms of the speed of processing. From this standpoint, patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease who manifest motor slowing as well as possible cognitive slowing&#xD;
      will provide an interesting model to explore similar control mechanisms of speed for motor&#xD;
      and non-motor behavioral control. Using psychophysical observations, we will try to clarify&#xD;
      normal and diseased control of motor and cognitive speed. Furthermore, using functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will explore the neural correlates underlying control&#xD;
      of motor and cognitive speed in normal brains as well as pathologic brains.&#xD;
      Blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes measured by fMRI, as an index of the activity of&#xD;
      a neural population, are expected to reveal underactivity or compensatory overactivity in the&#xD;
      functionally impaired brain areas responsible for slowing of movement, thinking, or both.&#xD;
      This study may provide a new framework to explain the relationship between motor and&#xD;
      cognitive aspects of human behavior and help to clarify the pathophysiology of Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Imaging methods (e.g., structural MRI) may be included as a part of the pre-study&#xD;
        evaluation. PD patients should be at a relatively early stage of the disease and must be&#xD;
        devoid of any other neuropsychiatric symptoms, especially dementia. To assure this, they&#xD;
        are to be rated by UPDRS (motor sub-scale) and standard neuropsychological batteries (e.g.,&#xD;
        mini-mental test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thirty PD patients with age 40 and higher will be recruited. Patients may be male or&#xD;
        female. Patients will be asked to withhold any medication that can influence central&#xD;
        nervous system (e.g. levodopa) at least 8 hours prior to the examination. They will also&#xD;
        asked to abstain from alcohol for 24 hours before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sixty normal volunteers ranging from 21-75 will be included. Normal volunteers will be&#xD;
        recruited from people who are registered as HMCS Normal Volunteers. Patients would be&#xD;
        referred from the HMCS Clinic. All subjects participating in MR studies should have a valid&#xD;
        Clinical Center Medical Record Number. Procedures for the fMRI experiment will follow the&#xD;
        Standard Operating Procedures of the HMCS Neuroimaging group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PD patients younger than 40 years will be excluded from the study since they are considered&#xD;
        to be young-onset PD and have slightly different characteristics from typical idiopathic&#xD;
        PD. Normal subjects younger than 21 years old will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain tumors,&#xD;
        stroke, trauma or AVM's will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with progressive neurological disorders other than PD will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with a history of significant medical disorders such as cancers, or requiring&#xD;
        continuous treatment with drugs other than antiparkinsonian medication, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have any contraindications to MRI will be excluded from the fMRI part of the&#xD;
        study. We will not scan pregnant women because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is&#xD;
        not established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female&#xD;
        subjects of childbearing potential prior to functional MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients not capable of giving informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
