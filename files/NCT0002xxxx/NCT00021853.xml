      This study will evaluate the effect of motor training on focal hand dystonia in people with&#xD;
      writer's cramp and will examine whether this training affects excitability of the motor&#xD;
      cortex of the brain. In dystonia, muscle spasms cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive&#xD;
      movement or abnormal postures. Focal dystonia involves just one part of the body, such as the&#xD;
      hand, neck or face. Patients with focal hand dystonia have difficulty with individualized&#xD;
      finger movements, which may be due to increased excitability of the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hand dystonia 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 2-month study.&#xD;
      Those taking botulinum toxin injections must stop medication 3 months before entering the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a complete neurologic examination. They will undergo motor training&#xD;
      with &quot;constraint-induced movement therapy.&quot; This therapy involves constraining some fingers&#xD;
      while allowing others to move. Participants will have the following tests and procedures at&#xD;
      baseline (before motor training), after 4 weeks of motor training, and again after 8 weeks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handwriting analysis - A computerized program evaluates the degree of &quot;automatic&#xD;
           movements&quot; the patient uses in writing, as well as writing pressure and speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms evaluation - Patients fill out a written questionnaire about symptoms and rate&#xD;
           their improvement, if any, after training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation - The patient is seated in a comfortable chair, and an&#xD;
           insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. Brief electrical currents pass through the&#xD;
           coil, creating magnetic pulses that travel to the brain. These pulses generate very&#xD;
           small electrical currents in the brain cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the&#xD;
           brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching or&#xD;
           tingling in the scalp, face, arm or hand. During the stimulation, the patient is asked&#xD;
           to slightly tense certain muscles in the hand or arm or perform simple actions.&#xD;
           Electrodes are taped to the skin over the muscles activated by the stimulation, and the&#xD;
           electrical activity in the muscles will be recorded with a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalogram (EEG) - Wire electrodes are taped to the scalp or placed on a Lycra&#xD;
           cap the patient wears to record the brain's electrical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 50-minute motor training sessions 3 times during the first week of the&#xD;
      study, twice the second week and once each in weeks 3 and 4. In addition, they will be&#xD;
      required to practice the training at home for 25 minutes each day during week 1 and 50&#xD;
      minutes each day for the remaining 3 weeks. Fingers not being trained will be splinted.&#xD;

      Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions generating&#xD;
      twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Abnormalities of the motor cortex&#xD;
      have been shown in patients with focal hand dystonia. In addition it is well known that&#xD;
      dystonic patients have co-contraction of their antagonist muscles, and that individualized&#xD;
      finger movements are imprecise and difficult. Motor training such as &quot;constraint-induced&#xD;
      movement therapy&quot; has been described to be successful in patients with musician's cramp. We&#xD;
      therefore hypothesize that motor training with training of individualized finger movements&#xD;
      could improve focal hand dystonia in patients with writer's cramp. We propose to study one&#xD;
      group of twelve patients with either pure or dystonic writer's cramp. Patients will receive&#xD;
      individualized finger training with immobilization of fingers that are not in training.&#xD;
      Evaluation for improvement will be done with a handwriting analysis program developed by Mai&#xD;
      and Marquardt, and clinical evaluation with the Fahn-Dystonia Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies have shown that patients with dystonia have&#xD;
      less intracortical inhibition compared with normal subjects, leading to excessive cortical&#xD;
      activity and possibly to co-contraction of agonist-antagonist groups of muscles of the&#xD;
      forearm resulting in dystonic posturing. Furthermore, studies in other basal ganglia&#xD;
      disorders as well as dystonia have suggested that the movement related cortical potentials&#xD;
      might show plastic changes that reflect the degree of &quot;successful&quot; performance of a motor&#xD;
      task. We therefore would like to evaluate the excitability of the motor cortex before and&#xD;
      after the training with TMS and movement related cortical potentials.&#xD;
