  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide patients with adequate informed consent to&#xD;
      understand that screening tests with minimal health risk will be performed to evaluate their&#xD;
      eligibility for a research study. The protocol makes it clear that patients initial visit to&#xD;
      the intramural clinical program may include screening studies that are not medically&#xD;
      necessary for disease management, but are done purely for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a known or suspected diagnosis of cancer, HIV infection, skin disorder or&#xD;
      immunodeficiency who are being considered for enrollment in a National Cancer Institute&#xD;
      intramural clinical research protocol will participate in this consent protocol. It informs&#xD;
      patients of screening tests and procedures involving minimal risk that are done for research&#xD;
      purposes only, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, standard X-rays (e.g., chest X-ray),&#xD;
      bone films, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine&#xD;
      studies. It explains that other eligibility screens that are more invasive and involve&#xD;
      greater risk, such as a biopsy, will require separate consent.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for NIH Intramural Research Program&#xD;
      (IRP) protocols must be screened to determine whether they meet the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate patient or healthy volunteer eligibility for participation in NIH IRP research&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect results of screening test for use on subsequent research protocols as baseline (e.g.,&#xD;
      pretreatment) values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect specific research samples required for the primary research protocol as part of a&#xD;
      screening test or procedure in order to avoid from having to subject the patient to a painful&#xD;
      procedure on multiple occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for and treated on protocols within&#xD;
      the NIH IRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is not a research study of an investigational drug or device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols are&#xD;
      conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some cases, specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may be&#xD;
      collected during the screening process in order to avoid from having to subject the patient&#xD;
      to a painful procedure on multiple occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissues and biological fluids that are obtained during the screening process will be stored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient or healthy volunteer completes the screening process and is either enrolled&#xD;
      onto another NIH study or is returned to the care of their local physician they will be taken&#xD;
      off study.&#xD;

             for research protocols. NOTE: It is expected that healthy adult volunteers have the&#xD;
             capacity to consent (i.e., a LAR may not be used).&#xD;
