  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation delivered over the skin&#xD;
      increases the muscle strength as measured by a dynamometer in chronic stroke patients. We&#xD;
      recently also found out that such stimulation enhances the ability of healthy brains to learn&#xD;
      faster, enhancing the beneficial effects of the motor training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if this stimulation can enhance the ability of&#xD;
      stroke patients to experience plastic changes in the brain. It may aid in the development of&#xD;
      new strategies for rehabilitation after brain injury in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical and neurological exam will be administered. Each patient will participate in three&#xD;
      different sessions separated by at least 48 hours: a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to&#xD;
      the weak hand, a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the leg, and no stimulation. The&#xD;
      sessions will be randomly ordered. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be&#xD;
      done as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nerve stimulation will be done by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS, the head&#xD;
      is immobilized within a frame. An insulated coil wire is placed on the scalp and brief&#xD;
      electrical current passed through it. Participants may be asked to perform movements, do&#xD;
      simple tasks, or simply tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded&#xD;
      with a computer. Some experiments may be recorded on videotape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must be stroke patients who have recovered to the point of being able to make&#xD;
      thumb movements, and the stroke must have occurred more than 6 months ago.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are very few therapeutic options for the treatment of motor disabilities resulting from&#xD;
      chronic stroke. Motor training results in use-dependent plasticity, thought to underlie&#xD;
      recovery of motor function after cortical lesions. We recently demonstrated that stimulation&#xD;
      of peripheral nerves (SPN) administered in association with motor training enhances&#xD;
      use-dependent plasticity in healthy volunteers. The purpose of this protocol is to&#xD;
      investigate if SPN administered in association with motor training enhances use-dependent&#xD;
      plasticity in patients with chronic stroke. If so, it may become an important tool to enhance&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of rehabilitative treatment in this patient group.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemiparetic patients (right or left who had thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic infarction&#xD;
        (documented by CT or MRI) more than 6 months before. Patients should have recovered motor&#xD;
        function to the point of being able to perform thumb movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be recruited from referrals from the community, particularly Baltimore and&#xD;
        Washington VA hospitals, and Suburban Hospital as well as stroke clubs. An anatomical MRI&#xD;
        scan will be acquired at the NIH if a recent one (within 6 months) is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Large hemorrhagic or brain stem stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple cerebral lesions with residual deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of head injury with loss of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe alcohol or drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychiatric illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable cardiac dysrhythmia or unresponsive arterial hypertension (greater than&#xD;
             160/100 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  H/o hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving alpha-adrenergic antagonists or agonists, major/minor tranquilizers,&#xD;
             clonidine,prazosin, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, haloperidol, other&#xD;
             neuroleptics, barbiturates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Degree of aphasia or cognitive deficit that makes patient unable to give informed&#xD;
             consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, glaucoma, h/o hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to sympatomimetic drugs.&#xD;
