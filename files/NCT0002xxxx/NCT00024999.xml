      This study will examine how the brain operates during execution and control of voluntary&#xD;
      movement and what goes wrong with these processes in disease. It will use&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to compare brain function in normal&#xD;
      subjects and in patients with-a disorder affecting patients with stroke and other brain&#xD;
      lesions. These patients have problems with timing, sequence and spatial organization of&#xD;
      certain types of movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is recorded using wire&#xD;
      electrodes attached to the scalp or mounted on a Lycra cap placed on the head. EMG measures&#xD;
      electrical activity from muscles. It uses wire electrodes placed on the skin over the&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult healthy normal volunteers and patients with ideomotor apraxia with a single left brain&#xD;
      lesion may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be asked to make certain movements with their arms or hands, such as&#xD;
      waving and using scissors. Brain and muscle activity will be measured during these tasks with&#xD;
      EEG and EMG recordings. Patients may be asked to repeat these tests over time as their&#xD;
      condition changes (such as during recovery from a stroke) to gain information about the&#xD;
      recovery process.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ideomotor apraxia is a disorder affecting patients with stroke and a variety of other brain&#xD;
      lesions. The disorder involves problematic timing, sequence, and spatial organization of&#xD;
      gestured movements. As a result, patients suffer from incorrect temporal and spatial&#xD;
      components to movements as evidenced during pantomime of transitive and intransitive&#xD;
      movements. The errors can be seen in left and right hemisphere damaged patients during&#xD;
      intransitive movements, but lesions predominate in the left hemisphere for inability to&#xD;
      pantomime transitive movements. Thus far, damage to parietofrontal circuits has been&#xD;
      implicated in significantly contributing to this disorder. These circuits, which pave the way&#xD;
      for sensorimotor processing, are of clear interest in the nature of praxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we plan to evaluate further the parietofrontal circuits in these&#xD;
      patients. Using EEG, we will analyze the movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) in these&#xD;
      patients compared to controls to evaluate any cortical planning differences. We will analyze&#xD;
      how the circuits play a role in transitive and intransitive movements in normal subjects and&#xD;
      patients with Ideomotor apraxia. Each patient will make a series of movement during 64&#xD;
      channel EEG and EMG recordings. Following recordings, analysis will be made of the event&#xD;
      related desynchronization (ERD) and the MRCP. Further analysis will look at the activation of&#xD;
      the parietofrontal circuitry in patients using correlation and coherence methods. For the&#xD;
      same purposes, MEG studies will be performed to assess similar measures.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        We will study normal volunteers and patient groups between the ages of 18-80 years of age&#xD;
        within the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients diagnosed with Ideomotor apraxia with a single left hemisphere lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Ideomotor apraxia with corticobasal ganglionic degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal subjects: abnormal neurologic examination or history of neurologic disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ideomotor apraxic patients: a second neurologic disorder including more than one brain&#xD;
        lesion or the inability to cooperate fully.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal and Ideomotor apraxic patients: cognitively impaired subjects will not be accrued&#xD;
        (for the purposes of this study, patients that can provide full informed consent for the&#xD;
        study are not considered cognitively impaired).&#xD;
&#xD;
        For MRI studies, patients with metallic implants to remove potential risks from this&#xD;
        procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For MRI purposes, women who are pregnant are excluded from this part of the protocol.&#xD;
        Therefore, all women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed, which&#xD;
        must be negative, before proceeding.&#xD;
