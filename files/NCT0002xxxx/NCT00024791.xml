  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the brain controls eye-hand coordination (visuomotor skills) in&#xD;
      children with spastic diplegia and will determine whether impairment of this skill is related&#xD;
      to the learning difficulties in school that some of these children experience. Spastic&#xD;
      diplegia is a form of cerebral palsy that affects the legs more than the hands. The brain&#xD;
      injury causing the leg problem in this disease may also cause difficulty with eye-hand&#xD;
      coordination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and children with spastic diplegia between 6 and 12 years of age&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a review of medical and&#xD;
      school records, psychological testing, neurological and physical examinations, and assessment&#xD;
      of muscle function in the arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may undergo one or more of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing (1 to 2 hours) - involves sitting at a computer and answering&#xD;
      questions, such as whether the letters on the screen make up a real word.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (45 minutes) - uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
      to provide images of the brain. The child lies on a table in a narrow cylindrical machine&#xD;
      while the scans are obtained. Both the child and parent wear earplugs to muffle the loud&#xD;
      noise the radio waves make while the images are formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) (1 to 2 hours) - EEG uses electrodes&#xD;
      to record the electrical activity of the brain. The electrodes are in a special cap that is&#xD;
      worn on the head during the procedure. EMG records electrical activity from muscles.&#xD;
      Electrodes are placed on the skin over certain muscles. During the test, the child makes&#xD;
      simple repetitive movements, such as finger tapping. The cap and the electrodes on the skin&#xD;
      are removed at the end of the test.&#xD;

      The goal of this Career Transition Award is to acquire research training in clinical and&#xD;
      neurophysiologic dimensions of motor disorders in cerebral palsy. Dr. Mark Hallett of the&#xD;
      Human Motor Control Section, NINDS, will act as the principal mentor for this training award.&#xD;
      Cerebral palsy is a group of syndromes with non-progressive motor impairment resulting from a&#xD;
      static injury to the developing brain. The processes of growth and development further&#xD;
      complicate the motor syndromes of cerebral palsy leading to a changing clinical picture.&#xD;
      Mirror movements in children with spastic hemiplegia are prominent in the affected hand under&#xD;
      10 years of age, but are more symmetric and less noticeable after this age. Investigators&#xD;
      speculate that callosal maturation is responsible for these changes. Understanding the affect&#xD;
      of development on motor manifestations of cerebral palsy is critical to develop effective&#xD;
      rehabilitative strategies at each stage of life. Many children with cerebral palsy make&#xD;
      significant contributions to society as adults, but these achievements are possible only by&#xD;
      overcoming physical and educational impediments with effective therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
      Research into therapeutic strategies can decrease the possibility of performing inappropriate&#xD;
      or irreversible interventions. A major obstacle to research in this group of patients is&#xD;
      difficulty in distinguishing between motor syndromes. Neurophysiology can help to distinguish&#xD;
      between the specific hypertonic patterns and their contribution to the child's functional&#xD;
      disability. The focus of the research proposed in this award is to use neurophysiologic&#xD;
      methods to enhance our understanding of the motor disabilities of spastic diplegia and to&#xD;
      explore the affect of development on these disorders. One set of studies, coinciding with&#xD;
      training in the physiology of motor control, explores the more basic physiologic aspects of&#xD;
      motor syndromes in spastic diplegia. These studies will assess diplegic children with the&#xD;
      goal of clarifying the physiologic nature of these motor disorders and their relationship to&#xD;
      functional status of the patients. A second set of studies examines motor skills in spastic&#xD;
      diplegia children at different ages with the goal of defining the affect of callosal&#xD;
      development on the motor syndromes of cerebral palsy.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SPECIFIC AIM #1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children 12 to 14 years of age will be eligible for the study as neuromotor function in&#xD;
        healthy children is close to adult levels at this age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diplegic children must have been born before 36 weeks gestation with a birth weight&#xD;
        appropriate for their gestational age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clinical examination for these children must show bilateral spasticity with more severe&#xD;
        involvement of the legs than of the arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects must be free from all neurologic and psychiatric disorders with normal&#xD;
        scores on the Connor's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) checklist and the&#xD;
        Child Behavior Check List (CBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neurological history and examination must be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SPECIFIC AIM #1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with sapstic diplegia who were born at term will be excluded from the study as&#xD;
        these form a separate diagnostic cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with a history of a severe (grade III or IV) intraventricular hemorrhage, or&#xD;
        periventricular hemorrhagic infarction will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diplegic children who have a genetic or congenital disorder (such as congenital&#xD;
        cytomegalovirus or rubella infection) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with obviously asymmetric findings (hemiplegia) or quadriplegia (arms and legs&#xD;
        affected equally) will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy children will be excluded from the study if they have ADHD, obsessive compulsive&#xD;
        symptoms, tics or any other neurologic or psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have siblings with an undiagnosed cause of developmental delay or&#xD;
        abnormalities of the corpus callosum will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with albinism or a personal or family history of sensorineural hearing loss have&#xD;
        an increased incidence of incidental callosal abnormalities and for this reason will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diplegic subjects with a personal history of seizures and any subject with a family history&#xD;
        of first degree relatives with seizures will be excluded from the transcranial magnetic&#xD;
        stimulation portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SPECIFIC AIM #2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Spastic diplegia patients and age matched healthy controls aged 7-14 years of age will be&#xD;
        recruited using the same methods outlined in Specific Aim #1. Data from eligible&#xD;
        13-year-old patients and healthy controls studied in Specific Aim #1 will be included in&#xD;
        the data analysis of this specific aim.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Spastic diplegia patients will be matched on the extent and severity of periventricular&#xD;
        leucomalacia (PVL) on their clinical MRIs. We will study the group of patients with&#xD;
        pathology extending from occipital to frontal regions, as this appears to be most common in&#xD;
        diplegic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects must be free from all neurologic and psychiatric disorders with normal&#xD;
        scores on the Connor's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) checklist and the&#xD;
        Child Behavior Check List (CBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Neurological history and examination must be normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SPECIFIC AIM #2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        These will be the same as those outlined in Specific Aim #1 for both spastic diplegia&#xD;
        patients and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, diplegic children with MRI lesions other than PVL (porencephaly,&#xD;
        schizencephaly) will be excluded.&#xD;
