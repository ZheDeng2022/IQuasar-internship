      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of ecteinascidin 743 in treating patients&#xD;
      who have malignant mesothelioma that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine partial and complete response rates in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      malignant mesothelioma treated with ecteinascidin 743. II. Determine the toxicity profile of&#xD;
      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships&#xD;
      of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of response, time to disease&#xD;
      progression, 6-month progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall&#xD;
      survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Assess the quality of life of these patients&#xD;
      treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 3 hours on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2&#xD;
      additional courses after achieving CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the&#xD;
      beginning of each course of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
