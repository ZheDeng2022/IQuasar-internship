      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) to examine the role of the chemical&#xD;
      messenger dopamine in stuttering. It will measure and compare the number of dopamine&#xD;
      receptors and the amount of dopamine released in the brains of stutterers with that of normal&#xD;
      volunteers. The results may provide information about how drugs that block dopamine's effect&#xD;
      might work to enable fluent speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with developmental stuttering between the ages of 18 and&#xD;
      55 may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and&#xD;
      possibly a physical examination and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a hearing test and cognitive function tests to measure speech,&#xD;
      language, memory and visual skills. In addition, they will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scanning to measure brain blood flow and dopamine distribution in the brain. PET&#xD;
           uses radioactive materials to show cellular activity in specific tissues of the body.&#xD;
           Before starting the procedure, a thin plastic tube (intravenous, or IV line) is placed&#xD;
           in a vein in each arm of the subject and a special plastic mask is molded to the face.&#xD;
           (The mask is used to insure that the position of the head does not change during the&#xD;
           scan.) For the scan, the subject lies on a bed that is positioned into the scanner. A&#xD;
           preliminary &quot;transmission&quot; scan is done to make necessary measurements and adjustments.&#xD;
           Following this scan, 10 injections of radioactive water are given through an IV line.&#xD;
           During these injections, the subject performs a series of speech tasks-such as singing,&#xD;
           telling a story, or reciting nursery rhymes-that will elicit either fluent speech or&#xD;
           stuttering. A special camera detects the radiation emitted and produces images of brain&#xD;
           blood flow during stuttering and normal speech. Next, raclopride (a radioactive material&#xD;
           that attaches to dopamine receptors on the cell surface) is given through an IV line and&#xD;
           more pictures of the brain are taken. Fifty minutes after the raclopride injection,&#xD;
           amphetamine-a drug that increases brain dopamine levels-is injected through the other IV&#xD;
           line and more pictures are taken to show dopamine distribution in the brain. Fifty&#xD;
           minutes after the amphetamine infusion, the IV lines are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to complement and interpret information&#xD;
           from the PET scans. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to show structural&#xD;
           changes in tissues. The subject lies on a table surrounded by a metal cylinder (the&#xD;
           scanner). During the procedure, which may take from 20 minutes to 2 hours, subjects may&#xD;
           be asked to perform simple tasks, such as speaking or moving their arms. They can speak&#xD;
           with a staff member via an intercom at all times during the procedure and can be moved&#xD;
           out of the machine any time they request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to return for up to two scanning sessions within a year. For these&#xD;
      scans, only 1 injection of radioactive water will be given.&#xD;

      Clinical responses to dopamine (DA) antagonists from patients with developmental stuttering&#xD;
      suggest that the pathophysiology of this disorder may involve an abnormality of central DA&#xD;
      systems. This hypothesis has never been tested using methods that measure both pre- and&#xD;
      postsynaptic dopaminergic mechanisms within the CNS. A new PET technique permits evaluation&#xD;
      of these mechanisms in human subjects. 11C raclopride, a relatively selective D2 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, is used to estimate postsynaptic DA receptor binding potential following&#xD;
      establishment of equilibrium conditions. A low dose bolus of amphetamine is then used to&#xD;
      release DA from the presynaptic neuron and displace the ligand from postsynaptic binding&#xD;
      sites, in order to estimate the size of the releasable presynaptic DA pool. We propose to use&#xD;
      this technique in individuals with developmental stuttering and control subjects to test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that stuttering is due to dopaminergic hyperactivity within the CNS. The cause of&#xD;
      this hyperactivity is hypothesized to be due to an increase in either the postsynaptic&#xD;
      binding potential or the size of the releasable presynaptic dopamine vesicular pool (in which&#xD;
      case postsynaptic receptors may be down regulated). Our studies should help conjoin and&#xD;
      modify this pathophysiological model. If low dose amphetamine can be used to demonstrate a&#xD;
      difference between people who stutter and controls, a second study will be conducted to see&#xD;
      if stuttering behavior per se has a measurable effect on DA release that differs from the&#xD;
      effect of similar speech tasks in control subjects. Lastly, in a third study, DA&#xD;
      releasability will be measured in those recovered from stuttering and those not affected by&#xD;
      stuttering but are part of families who have many members that stutter. The culmination of&#xD;
      these studies is to attempt isolation of a DA marker that can be used as a phenotyping tool&#xD;
      in genetic studies of stuttering.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA - STUTTERING AND CONTROL SUBJECTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be between the ages of 18 and 55.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be in good general health except for the primary neurological diagnosis of&#xD;
        stuttering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects may not have evidence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular&#xD;
        disease or hyperthyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EKG and thyroid function tests must be within normal limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have no history of traumatic head injury including any head trauma that&#xD;
        resulted in loss of consciousness or history of substance abuse, including alcohol&#xD;
        (excluding caffeine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be screened for history of psychiatric illness, such as depression, anxiety&#xD;
        or obsessive-compulsive disorders according to DSM-IV; subjects with such diagnoses will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be screened for a past medical history or family history of speech-language&#xD;
        disorders; subjects with a personal or significant family history of speech-language&#xD;
        disorders unrelated to the diagnoses of stuttering or aphasia will be excluded. Also those&#xD;
        subjects with immediate family members having a significant history of heart attack or&#xD;
        stroke will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women who are pregnant or currently breast-feeding will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with pacemakers, aneurysm clips, cochlear implants, shrapnel fragments or have a&#xD;
        significant history of exposure to small metallic objects, which might have become lodged&#xD;
        in the tissues of the head, or neck will be excluded due to the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria must be met to identify an individual who stutters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Affected individual regards him or herself as having a stuttering disorder, reporting&#xD;
        instances during speech where they know exactly what they wish to say, but can not be due&#xD;
        to production impairment; these instances may be accompanied by a feeling of tension&#xD;
        somewhere within the vocal tract. Individuals may have sought treatment for their&#xD;
        stuttering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Speech-language pathologist confirms diagnosis of stuttering disorder in affected&#xD;
        individuals, documenting presence of silent or sound prolongations, syllable repetitions,&#xD;
        word/phrase repetitions, interjections and pauses at non-linguistic loci in their speech.&#xD;
        Affected individuals will be at least 5% dysfluent in at least 2 of the speaking tasks used&#xD;
        to assess fluency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recovered stutterers must have a history of stuttering documented by the speech pathologist&#xD;
        responsible for evaluation or treatment of this individual during childhood. A history of&#xD;
        stuttering may alternatively be documented by a parent and at least one other family member&#xD;
        or friend. Recovered individuals must report that they no longer monitor their speech on a&#xD;
        routine basis or use speech therapy techniques while speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Speech-language pathologist must judge that recovered individuals are currently free of&#xD;
        overt stuttering (less than 1 stuttering behavior/100 words).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Onset of stuttering in both affected individuals and recovered stutterers must have&#xD;
        occurred in childhood (between 3 and 10 years-of-age), unrelated to psychological or&#xD;
        neurological trauma.&#xD;
