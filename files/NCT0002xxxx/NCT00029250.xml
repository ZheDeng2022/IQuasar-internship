    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability of garlic pills in&#xD;
      lowering cholesterol and triglycerides in hyperlipidemic HIV-infected individuals who are&#xD;
      being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evaluation of garlic in HIV disease is warranted for several reasons. First, garlic&#xD;
      is used as a botanical medicine and as an alternative therapy by many HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals. Baseline data from the Bastyr's Alternative Medicine Care Outcomes in AIDS&#xD;
      (AMCOA) study [1] indicate that garlic is the most frequently used botanical medicine among&#xD;
      HIV-infected men and women (52.9%) who utilize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).&#xD;
      In the same cohort, 50% of the subjects who use antiretroviral therapy are also taking garlic&#xD;
      supplements. Second, there is a growing body of studies that indicate that garlic exhibits&#xD;
      lipid and glucose lowering as well as hepato-protective activities. Third, several of the&#xD;
      pharmacological activities of garlic and their reported clinical benefits in other&#xD;
      conditions, especially in hyperlipidemia, may be relevant in the management of highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication: We will utilize GarlicinTM, an allicin-standardized dried garlic supplement&#xD;
      in two escalating doses in HIV-infected subjects who are receiving HAART.&#xD;
