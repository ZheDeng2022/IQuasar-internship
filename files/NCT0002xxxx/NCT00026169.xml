    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to determine the dose of imatinib mesylate that is most effective with the&#xD;
      least amount of toxic side effects in treating patients who have advanced cancer and kidney&#xD;
      failure. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping the enzyme&#xD;
      necessary for cancer cell growth. Kidney failure may delay the elimination of imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate from the body, which may lead to longer drug exposure and increase toxic side&#xD;
      effects&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI571 for cohorts of patients with&#xD;
      varying degrees of renal dysfunction (normal, mild, moderate, and severe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of renal dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of STI571.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the safety of STI571 in patients with various degrees of renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to creatinine&#xD;
      clearance (at least 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min vs 20-39 mL/min vs less than 20 mL/min vs any&#xD;
      creatinine clearance and undergoing dialysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1 and 4-28. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that&#xD;
      at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60-69 patients (about 12 per stratum) will be accrued for&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy, which is&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do&#xD;
             not exist or are no longer effective; the following tumor types are eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (Note: All patients with normal renal function should be referred first to higher&#xD;
                  priority national trials under cooperative group or Novartis sponsorship; these&#xD;
                  studies include the Intergroup S0033 trial in GIST tumors and NABTC-9908 trial&#xD;
                  for gliomas; Novartis is also sponsoring ongoing clinical trials in pediatric&#xD;
                  patients with Philadelphia chromosome - positive acute lymphocytic leukemia and&#xD;
                  chronic myelogenous leukemia; for complete listing of other trials and sites&#xD;
                  collaborating investigators are encouraged to verify status of current national&#xD;
                  trials on the NCI - Physician Data Query [PDQ] system)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with all hematological malignancies are eligible (such as myeloma,&#xD;
                  leukemia and lymphoma patients) provided the patient(s) have exhausted curative&#xD;
                  intent or life prolonging therapy and meet other eligibility in terms of blood&#xD;
                  counts; patients with Philadelphia chromosome - positive leukemia should be&#xD;
                  enrolled on other NCI or Novartis sponsored trials, if possible&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any solid tumor patient with abnormal renal dysfunction and including 12 patients&#xD;
                  with normal renal function (controls for pharmacokinetics) with an emphasis on&#xD;
                  patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and including patients with&#xD;
                  glioma; patients with glioma who require corticosteroids or anticonvulsants must&#xD;
                  be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for one month prior to&#xD;
                  enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (Note: Slots will be retained for patients with CML or other Philadelphia&#xD;
                  chromosome-positive leukemia or GIST tumors beyond the initial dose level&#xD;
                  cohorts, since these tumor types have greater potential to respond to therapy);&#xD;
                  every effort should be made to enroll patients with glioma or GIST on available&#xD;
                  cooperative group trials first&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy are allowed,&#xD;
             including prior therapy with STI571; there is no ceiling on number of prior regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2, (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) and a life expectancy of at least 3&#xD;
             months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) =&lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with abnormal kidney function will be allowed and will be grouped accordingly&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with gliomas and brain metastases, who require corticosteroids or&#xD;
             anticonvulsants must be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for one&#xD;
             month prior to enrollment; patients with brain metastasis should have had brain&#xD;
             irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of STI571 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because STI571 is known to be teratogenic, women&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal&#xD;
             or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation; since interaction with STI571 and oral contraceptives is possible, a&#xD;
             barrier method should be used and oral contraceptives should not be the only method; a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test is required prior to starting therapy for women of child&#xD;
             bearing age; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: STI571 may be harmful to the developing fetus; therefore, for patients&#xD;
             enrolled on the study, contraceptive methods are recommended, and since interactions&#xD;
             with the metabolism of some oral contraceptives cannot be excluded at present, an&#xD;
             additional or alternative effective method of contraception, (e.g., barrier method)&#xD;
             should be used&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast feeding: STI571 may be harmful to nursing infants secondary to STI571 treatment&#xD;
             of the mother' breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             STI571&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be capable of following instructions regarding study medication,&#xD;
             completion of medication diaries, or have a caregiver who will be responsible for&#xD;
             administering study medication and completing medication diaries&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to study enrollment (excluding hydroxyurea if&#xD;
             hydroxyurea was administered to patients with leukemia to maintain a lower WBC count);&#xD;
             in the case of leukemic patients on maintenance hydroxyurea, patients may not receive&#xD;
             hydroxyurea within 24 hours prior to initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents; patients on therapeutic&#xD;
             doses of warfarin are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had liver, kidney, lung transplants or taking FK-506, cyclosporine&#xD;
             as an immunosuppressive agent; these agents may cause increased toxicity with STI571&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because STI571 is an agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with STI571, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with STI571&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections,&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with STI571&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving renal dialysis treatments while on the study will be enrolled in&#xD;
             two cohorts per the schema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had a major surgery (e.g., thoracotomy, intra-abdominal&#xD;
             surgery) within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unstable or untreated (irradiated) brain metastases should be excluded&#xD;
