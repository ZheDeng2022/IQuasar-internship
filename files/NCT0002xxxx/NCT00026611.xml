  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how many people respond to a smallpox vaccine when a sore&#xD;
      forms where the shot was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The world was declared free of smallpox in 1980. General routine vaccinations for smallpox&#xD;
      were stopped in the U.S. in 1971. In 1976, the recommendation for routine vaccination of&#xD;
      healthcare workers was also discontinued. The only people who presently receive this vaccine&#xD;
      are people who work with vaccinia virus or monkeypox virus. Because the world was considered&#xD;
      free of smallpox infections, this vaccine was no longer produced; there is a limited supply&#xD;
      available in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the limited amount of Dryvax vaccine (vaccinia virus) against smallpox, this study&#xD;
      will look at the ability to dilute the vaccine making more doses available in the event of a&#xD;
      smallpox outbreak. The study seeks to characterize a strategy of vaccination against smallpox&#xD;
      with various doses of Dryvax, followed by revaccination with the same dose, if required, in&#xD;
      volunteers 18-32 years of age with a negative history of smallpox vaccination.&#xD;
