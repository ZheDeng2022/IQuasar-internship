  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is to see if combination chemotherapy works better with or&#xD;
      without bevacizumab in treating patients who have malignant mesothelioma. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways.&#xD;
      Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help&#xD;
      kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known if combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy works better with or without bevacizumab in treating malignant mesothelioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the time to progression of patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin with or without bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the objective response rate in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the toxicity of these regimens when administered to these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare the median and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and serum vascular cell adhesion&#xD;
      molecule-1 levels before, during, and after study therapy as predictors of outcome in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients&#xD;
      are stratified according to histology (epithelial vs other) and ECOG performance status (0 vs&#xD;
      1). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin IV over&#xD;
      30-60 minutes (beginning after gemcitabine infusion) and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes&#xD;
      (beginning after cisplatin infusion) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable&#xD;
      disease (SD), complete response (CR), or partial response (PR) after the sixth course may&#xD;
      receive bevacizumab as a single agent once every 3 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive gemcitabine and cisplatin as in arm I and placebo IV over 30-90&#xD;
      minutes (beginning after cisplatin infusion) on day 1. Treatment repeats as in arm I.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve SD, CR, or PR after the sixth course may receive placebo as a single&#xD;
      agent once every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression.&#xD;
