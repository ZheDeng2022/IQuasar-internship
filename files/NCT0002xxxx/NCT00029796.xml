      This is a randomized, double-blinded dietary intervention in hemodialysis patients to&#xD;
      determine the clinical and metabolic effects of soy isoflavones on disease activity,&#xD;
      including improvement of blood markers of acute-phase response, and decreased blood levels of&#xD;
      markers of metabolic bone disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up to 40 percent of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients suffer from a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory process which is not currently amenable to specific treatment and is associated&#xD;
      with high morbidity and mortality. High circulating levels and production of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines are an essential part of this ongoing acute-phase response and they are believed to&#xD;
      exacerbate many of the clinical manifestations of ESRD, including renal osteodystrophy. Like&#xD;
      in all other inflammatory processes that have undergone more extensive investigation, the&#xD;
      nuclear factor, Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NFKB) promises to be a critical cellular intermediate&#xD;
      of this acute-phase response and to be both mediator and target of inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      effects. In the current search for agents that may be able to negate the ongoing acute-phase&#xD;
      response of ESRD, the soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein have emerged as potentially&#xD;
      useful. These isoflavones are present in many soyfoods, are available as over-the-counter&#xD;
      nutritional supplements and have received growing attention due to their biological&#xD;
      properties and potential as therapeutic agents. Inhibitory effects of the isoflavones on&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase and NFKB activity, on inflammatory cytokine production and on oxidative&#xD;
      stress have been demonstrated by this group and by many other investigators and they may be&#xD;
      highly relevant to the renal failure population. Additionally, we have found recently that&#xD;
      intake of soy food by ESRD patients results in very high blood levels of isoflavones and it&#xD;
      is well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our working hypothesis that in chronic renal failure a variety of endogenous and&#xD;
      exogenous factors trigger acute-phase response with activation of NFKB and production of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that intervention with soy isoflavones inhibits NFKB&#xD;
      activation and cytokines production, thus blocking the ongoing acute-phase response and&#xD;
      affecting positively clinically relevant parameters of disease activity in ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objective of this proposal is to conduct a randomized, double-blinded dietary&#xD;
      intervention trial in hemodialysis patients to determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dietary intake of the soy isoflavones by ESRD patients with clinical signs of ongoing&#xD;
           acute-phase response decreases the production of the proinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
           TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6 in peripheral blood, thus changing the balance between these&#xD;
           cytokines and their antagonists sTNF RI, sTNF RII, and IL-1ra.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suppression of inflammatory cytokine production by soy isoflavones is associated with&#xD;
           improvement of clinically relevant parameters of disease activity, including improvement&#xD;
           of blood markers of acute-phase response, and decreased blood levels of markers of&#xD;
           metabolic bone disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intake of soy isoflavones suppresses NF-KB activity in peripheral blood monocytic cells&#xD;
           of ESRD patients, in a manner consistent with change of cytokine levels and of clinical&#xD;
           parameters of disease.&#xD;
