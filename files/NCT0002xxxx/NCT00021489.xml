  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how safe and well-tolerated mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)&#xD;
      is when given with abacavir (ABC). Another purpose is to see if adding MMF to ABC decreases&#xD;
      viral load (amount of HIV in the blood) more than ABC alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many HIV-infected patients who have had heavy exposure to anti-HIV drugs and have experienced&#xD;
      treatment failure need new treatment combinations. One promising combination is ABC and MMF&#xD;
      as part of a drug combination. Laboratory studies show that MMF helps ABC destroy HIV in the&#xD;
      cells and further clinical testing is needed. MMF is not FDA-approved as a treatment for HIV&#xD;
      infection but has been approved by FDA to prevent rejection of organ transplants. Doses of&#xD;
      MMF tested in this study will be lower than those used to treat people with organ&#xD;
      transplants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large group of heavily drug-exposed HIV-infected individuals with detectable HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      exists as a result of the sequential use and failure of existing antiretroviral agents from&#xD;
      each of the 3 antiretroviral drug classes (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      [NRTIs], protease inhibitors [PIs], and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors&#xD;
      [NNRTIs]). Systematic approaches are needed to define &quot;salvage therapy&quot; regimens for this&#xD;
      patient group. This trial uses a short-term study to determine the initial safety,&#xD;
      pharmacology, and antiviral potency of MMF in augmenting the antiretroviral effect of ABC,&#xD;
      which then can be appraised for use as a salvage regimen. After rapid oral absorption, MMF is&#xD;
      hydrolyzed to form MPA (mycophenolic acid), the active metabolite. Recent in vitro studies&#xD;
      show that MPA concentrations as low as 62.5 nM synergistically increase the antiviral effect&#xD;
      of ABC or ddI, or of ABC in combination with ddI, against multinucleoside-resistant HIV&#xD;
      strains. These observations suggest that MMF in combination with ABC might play a role in&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy in patients with drug resistance, and continued clinical evaluation of&#xD;
      MMF is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, patients stop current NRTIs but continue taking PIs and NNRTIs with study&#xD;
      treatment. The first 50 patients are stratified by plasma HIV-1 RNA (below 40,000 copies/ml&#xD;
      or 40,000 and higher copies/ml) and randomized to either Arm A or Arm B. Arm A receives ABC&#xD;
      with MMF placebo; Arm B receives ABC and MMF. Only ABC and MMF are provided by the study.&#xD;
      Treatment is received for 4 weeks and patients are evaluated for safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      virologic response. At Week 4, entry genotype results are provided to patients and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy may then be altered as indicated. Patients are unblinded to study&#xD;
      treatment as soon as possible after Week 4 but no later than Week 7. Future opening of Arm C&#xD;
      to 125 additional patients is delayed until the first 50 patients have reached Week 4 and an&#xD;
      interim review of safety and virologic response is completed. Responders may continue study&#xD;
      treatment through Week 24. At 10 clinic visits patients have blood drawn for HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      determinations, CD4 and CD8 cell counts, and genotyping. Patients may participate in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic substudy A5121s.&#xD;
