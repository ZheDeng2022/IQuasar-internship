  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has four objectives: 1) to provide investigators the opportunity to study bone&#xD;
      specimens from patients with various skeletal diseases; 2) to treat patients with skeletal&#xD;
      diseases at the NIH; 3) to expose NIH trainees to certain skeletal diseases; and 4) to gain&#xD;
      more knowledge about skeletal diseases and stimulate further study of bone biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone with a disease that affects the skeleton may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations, tests, procedures and treatments given study participants are used in the&#xD;
      standard care of skeletal diseases. No experimental evaluations or treatments are offered.&#xD;
      Patient evaluations include a medical history, review of medical records and routine physical&#xD;
      examination. Based on the findings, other procedures may be recommended, including blood&#xD;
      tests, urine tests, and imaging tests, such as X-rays, bone densitometry, bone scan, computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone specimens from participants will be collected for research use. Specimens will be&#xD;
      obtained from bone removed during a patient s planned surgical procedure performed for&#xD;
      medical care, or patients may be requested to have a bone biopsy removal of a small piece of&#xD;
      bone tissue as part of the patient evaluation procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human diseases are commonly manifested in the skeletal system. The skeleton may be the&#xD;
      primary or secondary target of the disease and the disease may be congenital or acquired.&#xD;
      While understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of bone and mineral disorders has&#xD;
      increased in the last several years, much remains to be understood about the underlying&#xD;
      biology of the skeleton. The gaps in the understanding of skeletal biology are evident in the&#xD;
      paucity of tissue-specific therapies for skeletal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this study, we plan to obtain tissue and clinical specimens from outside institutions&#xD;
      as well as to evaluate subjects with bone and mineral disorders at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo clinically indicated testing and possibly receive treatment, which will&#xD;
      be limited to therapies based on the best professional judgment of the investigators and&#xD;
      treatment with medications commercially available under FDA law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this protocol are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. allow for the receipt of tissues and clinical specimens from investigators outside and&#xD;
           inside the NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. provide a protocol within which subjects with common and rare disorders of bone and&#xD;
           mineral metabolism can be studied, evaluated and treated at NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. provide a protocol under which trainees can evaluate subjects with bone and mineral&#xD;
           disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. provide a pool of subjects with bone and mineral disorders, from which research&#xD;
           questions will arise and from which future research studies will be generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  with a known or suspected bone disease and/or with a known or suspected disorder of&#xD;
           mineral metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be accepted regardless of gender, race, or&#xD;
           ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is a training, evaluation and treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To successfully enroll, evaluate, and manage subjects with common and rare bone and&#xD;
           mineral metabolism disorders. The purposes for doing this are: a) educating trainees and&#xD;
           investigators and b) providing a mechanism by which subjects with diseases of uncertain&#xD;
           or unknown diagnoses can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To collect or receive research and clinical specimens of common and rare bone and&#xD;
           mineral metabolism disorders from subjects seen at outside medical facilities as well as&#xD;
           those seen at the NIH. Specimens will be collected for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of research and subject outcome data collected from the subjects enrolled in&#xD;
           this study will generate future research studies related to common and rare bone and&#xD;
           mineral metabolism disorders.&#xD;
