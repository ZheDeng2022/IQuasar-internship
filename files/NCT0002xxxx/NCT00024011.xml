    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have metastatic&#xD;
      malignant melanoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from&#xD;
      dividing so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the progression-free survival at 18 weeks and overall survival of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic malignant melanoma treated with PS-341.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Correlate&#xD;
      p27 levels in tumor tissue with objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2 years after registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be&#xD;
             accurately measured as &gt;= 2.0 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PLT &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper normal limit (UNL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST =&lt; 2.5 x UNL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x UNL or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for&#xD;
             patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x UNL using the Cockcroft-Gault formula&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of&#xD;
             the study and willing to sign the written informed consent document&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any prior chemotherapy&#xD;
