  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of brain receptors called&#xD;
      alpha2-adrenoreceptors in regulating the sympathetic nervous system, which maintains the&#xD;
      supply of blood and fuel to the body's organs in times of stress, fear, anger, or exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)-AR) play a role in a variety of physiological&#xD;
      functions. There are three subtypes of alpha(2)-ARs, and their differences are unknown. This&#xD;
      study will examine the functional roles of these three subtypes by comparing the behavioral,&#xD;
      biochemical, psychophysiological, and autonomic function effects of the alpha(2)-AR drugs&#xD;
      clonidine and yohimbine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will undergo a physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and&#xD;
      blood, urine, and saliva tests. Women will have hormone tests to determine the time of their&#xD;
      last period and the time of their next ovulation. Participants will undergo&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing and other procedures.&#xD;

      Alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(2)-AR) are cell surface receptors for catecholamines&#xD;
      that bind to the G(i)/G(0) family of G proteins. Alpha(2)-ARs are widely distributed in the&#xD;
      central and peripheral nervous system, and are known to play an important role in the&#xD;
      regulation of catecholamine release. This mechanism and the broad distribution of these&#xD;
      receptors explain their role in a wide variety of physiological functions. Alpha(2)-AR&#xD;
      mediate central hypotensive, sedative, anesthetic, and analgesic responses to alpha(2)-AR&#xD;
      agonists. However, cardiovascular and other responses to the alpha(2)-AR agonists are subject&#xD;
      to interindividual variation in the human population. Such variability may be explained by&#xD;
      genetic variation in the structure of the receptors themselves, the cognate G proteins, the&#xD;
      transductional effectors, or the downstream intracellular targets. Molecular and&#xD;
      pharmacological research has defined three alpha(2)-ARs subtypes designated alpha(2)(A),&#xD;
      alpha(2)(B), and alpha(2)(C). All three alpha(2)-AR subtypes are involved in the regulation&#xD;
      of blood pressure, and these receptors also modulate sedation, analgesia, regulation of&#xD;
      insulin release, renal function, cognition and behavior. Biochemical research has identified&#xD;
      three human genes that uniquely encode these alpha(2)-ARs. Recently, in preclinical studies&#xD;
      polymorphisms of all three alpha(2)-AR subtypes have been described. The three polymorphisms&#xD;
      are each relatively abundant, and two appear to be functional in vitro. However, in humans&#xD;
      the in vivo physiological effect of these polymorphisms is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will elucidate the potential functional role of the three alpha(2)-AR subtypes in&#xD;
      humans by comparing the behavioral, biochemical, psychophysiological, and autonomic function&#xD;
      effects of the well-established alpha(2)-AR agonists and antagonists, clonidine and&#xD;
      yohimbine, respectively, in individuals selected for particular alpha(2)-AR genotypes. Based&#xD;
      on preclinical studies the following hypotheses will be tested: 1) subjects homozygous or&#xD;
      heterozygous for the alpha(2)(A)-AR Asn251Lys substitution will show a potentiation of&#xD;
      clonidine-induced effects, relative to subjects who have the Asn251/Asn251 genotype, and a&#xD;
      reduction of yohimbine-induced effects, 2) subjects homozygous or heterozygous for a&#xD;
      alpha(2)(B)-AR three glutamic acid deletion (residues 301-303) will show reduced effects of&#xD;
      the alpha(2)-AR agonist clonidine and possibly a potentiation of effects of yohimbine, and 3)&#xD;
      we will evaluate whether altered responses in either direction occur in subjects homozygous&#xD;
      and heterozygous for an in-frame deletion of a alpha(2)(C)-AR homologous repeat occurring at&#xD;
      codons 322-325 relative to subjects without this deletion allele.&#xD;
