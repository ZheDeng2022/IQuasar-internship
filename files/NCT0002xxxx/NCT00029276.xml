  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a magnetic coil is placed on the front part&#xD;
      of the head. Electric current passes through the coil in brief pulses. Magnetism from the&#xD;
      current produces a separate, small electric current inside the brain, which activates brain&#xD;
      cells below the coil. This treatment may result in decreased depression and improved&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease symptoms.&#xD;

      The major aim of this study is to carry out a sequential Phase I trial of prefrontal&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic brain stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease (PD) and severe depression. Depression complicates PD in up to 50%&#xD;
      of cases, leading to further deterioration of motor performance and quality of life; but&#xD;
      antidepressant medication fails or produces intolerable side effects in 25-30% of patients.&#xD;
      Case reports and uncontrolled trials suggest that ECT is effective in ameliorating&#xD;
      simultaneously the mood and motor symptoms of PD. Only a few small studies of ECT in PD have&#xD;
      been prospective or randomized, the assessment protocols have been limited, and the results&#xD;
      have been variable. TMS is a new, promising, alternative treatment for refractory depression,&#xD;
      which appears to be easier and safer than ECT. Requiring no hospitalization, anesthesia, or&#xD;
      recovery time, TMS is now being investigated as an alternative therapy for mood disorders.&#xD;
      TMS has not been studied in depressed patients with PD or in other serious central nervous&#xD;
      system diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study extends our past and present research in PD, depression, ECT, and TMS. We will&#xD;
      comprehensively evaluate the effects of left prefrontal TMS on mood, motor, and&#xD;
      neuropsychological function, together with quality of life indices in depressed PD patients.&#xD;
      All patients will initially receive treatment with TMS. Those who fail to benefit will&#xD;
      proceed to ECT. Comprehensive evaluation will be continued for another eight weeks in both&#xD;
      the TMS-only and ECT groups. The key issues addressed by these studies include: (1) the&#xD;
      potential benefit of TMS on mood and movement in depressed PD patients, and (2) the tightness&#xD;
      of the association between mood and motor function after TMS and ECT. Overall, these studies&#xD;
      will provide important preliminary data on the relationships among mood, cognitive and motor&#xD;
      function in PD, and their influence on quality of life. The results will help in directing&#xD;
      future applications of TMS as an alternative therapy for brain disorders, and will further&#xD;
      elucidate the relative benefits of both TMS and ECT in depressed PD patients. A positive&#xD;
      effect from TMS should be an impetus towards randomized, placebo-controlled trials.&#xD;
