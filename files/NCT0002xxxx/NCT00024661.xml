  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LErafAON is a liposome encapsulated c-raf antisense oligonucleotide. Raf-1 is a protein&#xD;
      produced by human cells, both normal and cancerous, which may help protect tumor cells from&#xD;
      radiation. Antisense oligonucleotides are very specific drugs, which can decrease the amount&#xD;
      of a certain target protein by blocking the gene that makes it. Antisense oligonucleotide to&#xD;
      raf gene can reduce the amount of Raf-1 protein in tumor cells. Liposomes are tiny globules&#xD;
      of fat, which can carry drugs in the body. The experimental agent LErafAON is composed of&#xD;
      liposomes carrying antisense oligonucleotide against the Raf-1 protein. It is hoped that&#xD;
      decreased Raf-1 in the cancer cells will make them more sensitive to the radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced solid tumors will receive IV infusions of LErafAON over at least 60&#xD;
      minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression, patients may continue on&#xD;
      weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each dose of study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort&#xD;
      will be observed for at least ten days after receiving the first dose of treatment before&#xD;
      additional patients are treated at a higher dose level. Patients will be followed for one&#xD;
      month after receiving the last dose of study medication. The study will stop when a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and MTD of LErafAON when given by weekly IV infusion&#xD;
      for 8 weeks in patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of LErafAON after IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Document in vivo inhibition of Raf-1 protein by LErafAON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Detect anti-tumor effects of intravenous LErafAON.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a Phase I Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) study for patients with&#xD;
      recurrent solid tumor malignancies. Study medication will be administered by intravenous&#xD;
      infusion over at least 60 minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression,&#xD;
      patients may continue on weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each&#xD;
      dose of study medication. Patients will be followed for one month after receiving the last&#xD;
      dose of study medication. Patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or&#xD;
      Stable Disease (SD) at the Week 8 disease assessment may continue to receive study medication&#xD;
      until disease progression (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort&#xD;
      will be observed for at least ten days after receiving the first dose of treatment before&#xD;
      additional patients are treated at a higher dose level. Patients will be followed for one&#xD;
      month after receiving the last dose of study medication. The study will stop when a maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Estimated enrollment is 15-35 patients; 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if&#xD;
      DLT occurs.&#xD;
