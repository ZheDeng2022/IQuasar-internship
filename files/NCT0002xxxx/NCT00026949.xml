  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the body handles etoposide, a drug used to treat breast cancer.&#xD;
      The knowledge gained may lead to more effective use of the drug with fewer side effects in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer patients who are receiving etoposide as part of their treatment may participate&#xD;
      in this study. Patients will have 18 blood samples (about a teaspoon or less each) drawn over&#xD;
      a 72-hour period during and after their infusion of etoposide. The initial blood samples&#xD;
      cannot be taken from the same intravenous line (small tube placed in a vein) used to deliver&#xD;
      the etoposide, so a second line may have to be placed temporarily to obtain these samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that has a broad range of anticancer activity at&#xD;
      conventional doses (100 mg/m(2) daily x 5 days) and is administered in high doses (greater&#xD;
      than 1200 mg/m(2)) as a component of pre-transplant myeloablative chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
      Etoposide pharmacokinetics are linear over a 30-fold dose range, but disposition is highly&#xD;
      variable. Etoposide is highly protein bound (95%) to albumin, but protein binding (and&#xD;
      therefore free drug concentrations) vary widely in cancer patients. Etoposide is eliminated&#xD;
      by metabolism and renal excretion, which may also contribute to the variability. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of etoposide will be studied in patients receiving high-dose etoposide as&#xD;
      part of their pre-transplant preparative regimen, and pharmacokinetic parameters generated&#xD;
      from pharmacokinetic modeling will be correlated with clinical and laboratory characteristics&#xD;
      and toxicity in order to develop more rational dosing methods.&#xD;
