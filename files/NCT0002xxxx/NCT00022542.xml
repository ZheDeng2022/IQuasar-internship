    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have&#xD;
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor&#xD;
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the confirmed response rate of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma&#xD;
      treated with BMS-247550.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with&#xD;
      this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response&#xD;
      receive 2 additional courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, treated localized prostate cancer,&#xD;
