  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe it is to give patients a shot that has a&#xD;
      mixture of a vaccine and dendritic cells (DCs), a special kind of immune cell, and how safe&#xD;
      it is to give a shot of the vaccine alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current HIV vaccines have not been strong enough to give good immune responses. Research has&#xD;
      shown that the immune response to a vaccine delivered by DCs is greater than the response&#xD;
      without DC delivery. A5130 is a study that seeks to give good delivery of the vaccine to&#xD;
      important immune cells of the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL) responses are important in viral destruction and thereby in&#xD;
      the protective immune response to viral infection. Current HIV vaccines do not consistently&#xD;
      elicit strong CTL responses. The limited immune response of current HIV vaccines could be&#xD;
      attributed, in addition to other causes, to failure of the vaccine to reach the appropriate&#xD;
      cells to initiate a robust immune response. DCs particularly are effective in stimulating&#xD;
      primary T-cell-dependent immunity. Antigen-bearing DCs are used as adjuvants for active&#xD;
      immunotherapy in humans, particularly to increase host resistance to tumors and certain viral&#xD;
      infections. A5130 is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study that seeks to ensure adequate&#xD;
      delivery of the vaccine to important antigen-presenting cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 vaccination groups at entry. Group A: Patients receive an&#xD;
      SC vaccination with DCs infected with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452. DC exposure to KLH occurs at Weeks 3&#xD;
      and 7. Leukopheresis occurs at entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Patients receive an SC vaccination with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 without DCs. KLH&#xD;
      injections are administered at Weeks 3 and 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups receive their vaccinations at Weeks 3, 7, and 15. This study consists&#xD;
      of 4 steps but not all patients necessarily qualify to enter Step II, Step III, or Step IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step I: vaccination phase. Step II: withdrawal of potent ART. Step III: optional&#xD;
      discontinuation of ART. Step IV: reinitiation of ART. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/10/02: Step V:&#xD;
      follow-up period off potent ART.]&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are HIV-infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Took 3 or more anti-HIV drugs for 3 or more months before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load of 400 copies/ml or less for a period of 3 months before study start&#xD;
             and within 30 days before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 count of 400 cells/mm3 or more for a period of 3 months before study start&#xD;
             and within 30 days before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a CD4 count of 400 cells/mm3 or more at study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a viral load of 50 copies/ml or less at study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree not to become pregnant or to impregnate during the study and for 12 weeks after&#xD;
             the study, if able to have children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may not be eligible for this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a short-term but intense infection or serious illness within 14 days before study&#xD;
             start and have not completed therapy or are not clinically stable on therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have viral load values greater than 400 copies/ml within 3 months before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have CD4 counts less than 400 cells/mm3 within 3 months before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have close contact with canaries through work (e.g., breeding farms, bird shops). Does&#xD;
             not apply to pet canaries.&#xD;
&#xD;

             follow the study requirements.&#xD;

          -  Have become HIV-positive within 1 year before study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had lymph node irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
