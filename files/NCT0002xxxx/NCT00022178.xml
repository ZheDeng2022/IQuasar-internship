      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more&#xD;
      effective for metastatic cancer of an unknown site of origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic cancer of an unknown site of&#xD;
      origin.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of the regimens, in terms of tumor response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and overall survival of vincristine, doxorubicin, and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide vs epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      carcinoma of unknown primary. II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
      III. Compare quality of life and symptom control in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to presence of liver metastases (yes vs no) and type of tumor (adenocarcinoma vs&#xD;
      non-adenocarcinoma). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients&#xD;
      receive vincristine IV, doxorubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Arm II: Patients&#xD;
      receive epirubicin IV and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously&#xD;
      on days 1-21. Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for 3-6 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the&#xD;
      end of courses 2, 4, and 6, and 1 month after completion of therapy. Patients are followed at&#xD;
      1 month and then until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 398 patients (199 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
