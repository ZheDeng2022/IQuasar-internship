      This study will determine whether a stepwise increase of the drug infliximab (RemicadeÂ®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)) controls juvenile rheumatoid arthritis more effectively than a fixed&#xD;
      dose. It will look at the safety and effectiveness of increasing the dose to a maximum of&#xD;
      15mg/kg body weight per dose, examining the drug's effect on bone and cartilage, and whether&#xD;
      it can improve abnormal growth, metabolism and hormones. Infliximab is approved for treating&#xD;
      adults with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 4 and 17 years of age with active juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who do not&#xD;
      respond adequately to standard therapy may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive nine infusions of infliximab during this 62-week study. The drug is&#xD;
      given intravenously (IV, into a vein) over 2 hours. The first three infusions will be at a&#xD;
      dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Children who improve on this regimen will receive another 6&#xD;
      infusions at the same dose. Children who do not significantly improve on 5 mg/kg at the end&#xD;
      of 6 weeks (the third infusion) may continue with phase 2 of the study, in which they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either: 1) 6 additional doses of the drug at 5 mg/kg per dose,&#xD;
      or 2) a gradually increased dose to a maximum of 15 mg/kg. In addition, all children will&#xD;
      continue to take methotrexate at the same dose as when they entered the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center 12 times (about every 8 weeks) during the&#xD;
      study for the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History and physical examination, including a complete joint exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Puberty assessment - breast development in girls, testicle size in boys, and pubic hair&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and weight measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will have imaging studies (x-rays, MRI and Dexa scan) at the beginning and end of&#xD;
      the study and will collect a 24-hour urine sample before each infliximab infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may elect to have an endocrine evaluation. This involves Clinical Center&#xD;
      hospitalizations for 1-1/2 days on visits 1, 4 and 12. Small amounts of blood will be drawn&#xD;
      every 20 minutes (through an indwelling catheter to avoid multiple needle sticks) for 8 hours&#xD;
      while the child sleeps. The blood will be examined for the normal rhythm of growth hormone&#xD;
      and other substances in the body and how they are affected by arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a questionnaire once a year for 2 years to provide information on&#xD;
      their health status and any problems that might be related to the study drug.&#xD;

      Infliximab, a murine chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against TNF-alpha has recently&#xD;
      been licensed for the treatment of adult patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;
      A double blind placebo controlled trial in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)&#xD;
      using a single dose fixed infusion regimen is currently ongoing. This dose finding study is&#xD;
      designed to determine whether a clinically guided intravenous (iv) infusion regimen allowing&#xD;
      for intra-patient dose escalation is superior in achieving a 70% clinical response to fixed&#xD;
      dose administration of infliximab in children with a polyarticular course of JRA. We will&#xD;
      model the pharmacokinetic profile in both phases of the study. We plan to enroll a maximum of&#xD;
      48 patients to allow for 36 patients to be randomized into the two treatment arms. In the&#xD;
      first phase of the study all patients will receive a fixed dose of 5mg/kg/dose for a total of&#xD;
      3 infusions over 6 weeks (weeks 0, 2, 6). In the second phase at week 14, patients who have&#xD;
      not achieved a 70% improvement will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either receive&#xD;
      intra-patient dose escalation capped at 15mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks or continue to receive&#xD;
      5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks in a blinded fashion. After 6 additional IV doses, patients will&#xD;
      again be evaluated clinically, radiographically and serologically for clinical response.&#xD;
      Patients who achieved a 70% response by week 14 will be kept on 5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      the trial duration of 62 weeks, but will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. We&#xD;
      also plan to evaluate patients endocrinologically and metabolically to determine the effect&#xD;
      of TNF blockade on these systems.&#xD;
