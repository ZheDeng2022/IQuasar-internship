  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how certain brain chemicals work in patients with&#xD;
      Panic Disorder (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with and without major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain chemicals that regulate emotion, anxiety, sleep, stress hormones, and other body&#xD;
      functions bind to serotonin (5-HT1A) and benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that 5-HT1A and BZD receptor function is abnormal in patients with PD, PTSD, and depression.&#xD;
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scans to examine BZD and 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor binding potential in patients with PD and patients with PTSD with and without&#xD;
      co-morbid MDD, as well as in healthy volunteers. This study will also determine the effects&#xD;
      of the stress hormone cortisol on 5-HT1A and BZD receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current emotional state and psychiatric, medical, and family history of potential&#xD;
      participants will be evaluated during an initial telephone interview. After entering the&#xD;
      study, participants will be asked questions about general mood, degree of nervousness, and&#xD;
      behavior. A physical examination, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and tests of intelligence and&#xD;
      cognition will be given. Urine, blood, and saliva samples will be taken. Women will be given&#xD;
      pregnancy tests and tests to determine menstrual phase and time of ovulation. All volunteers&#xD;
      will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scans of the brain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Evidence suggests that serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor, serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and&#xD;
      benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor function is abnormal in panic disorder (PD), postraumatic&#xD;
      stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (MDD). The hypotheses for the role of 5-HT1A receptors&#xD;
      have been obtained by assessing behavioral, neuroendocrine and temperature responses to the&#xD;
      selective partial 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone in anxiety disorders subjects and healthy&#xD;
      controls, and examining effects on 5-HT1A receptor function in rats following antidepressant&#xD;
      drug (AD) administration. 5-HT1A receptors knockout mice show behaviors that have been used&#xD;
      as a model for anxiety disorders in humans. Moreover, 5-HT1A receptor agonists have been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. The serotonin&#xD;
      transporter is implicated in these disorders by virtue of the efficacy of selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors in relieving symptoms in these subjects. Evidence arguing for a role of&#xD;
      BZD/GABA receptor dysfunction in anxiety disorders comes from studies showing anxiolytic and&#xD;
      anxiogenic properties of BZD agonists and antagonists, respectively. BZD receptor sensitivity&#xD;
      has been shown to be reduced in patients with anxiety disorders. Brain imaging studies using&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)&#xD;
      suggest decreased BZD receptor binding in PD and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies link together serotonin and GABA suggesting a pathological pathway originating&#xD;
      from 5-HT1A receptor deficit leading towards dysfunctions within GABAergic systems, resulting&#xD;
      in increased levels of anxiety. Yet, association between disturbed interactions between&#xD;
      5-HT1A receptor binding and alterations in BZD receptor binding has not been explored in&#xD;
      humans. The proposed study will advance knowledge regarding the neurobiology of PD and PTSD&#xD;
      by employing PET and [11C]flumazenil, [18F]FC-WAY100635([18F]FCWAY) and [11C]DASB to compare&#xD;
      BZD receptor, 5-HT1A receptors and the serotonin transporter binding potential, respectively,&#xD;
      between PD, PTSD and MDD patients and healthy controls. Because central 5-HT1A receptor&#xD;
      density is down-regulated in rodents by corticosterone administration and by stress-mediated&#xD;
      corticosterone secretion, assessments of HPA-axis activity will be assessed to determine&#xD;
      whether down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptors correlates with cortisol hypersecretion in PD,&#xD;
      PTSD and MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) PD/PTSD/MDD patients have reduced GABA(A)-BZD&#xD;
      receptor binding relative to healthy controls. 2) PD/PTSD/MDD patients have reduced 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor binding potential relative to healthy controls. 3) 5-HT1A receptor binding will be&#xD;
      more prominently reduced in PD and PTSD patients with comorbid MDD relative to anxiety&#xD;
      disorders patients without comorbid MDD and healthy controls. 4) There will be a positive&#xD;
      correlation between the reduction in 5-HT1A receptor binding and BZD binding in PD/PTSD/MDD&#xD;
      patients. 5) There will be an inverse correlation between reduction in 5-HT1A receptor&#xD;
      binding and BZD binding in PD/PTSD/MDD patients and cortisol secretion. 6) Serotonin&#xD;
      transporter binding, measured using [11C]DASB, will be reduced in PD subjects relative to&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ANXIETY DISORDERS SAMPLES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eighty four subjects (ages 18-50) with anxiety disorders (PD and PTSD) will be selected who&#xD;
        additionally meet criteria for one of 4 subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A) PD, Currently Depressed (n=27):&#xD;
&#xD;
        As defined by DSM-IV criteria for PD, and still symptomatic as defined by at least 1 panic&#xD;
        attack/week or a CGI score of at least 4, and current HDRS score in the&#xD;
        mild-moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are requested to meet the DSM-IV criteria for a single or recurrent episode of&#xD;
        major depressive disorder.&#xD;

        In case of comorbid depression it will be ensured that PD had an earlier onset than the&#xD;
        depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B) PD, Currently Not Depressed (n=27):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Defined as having symptomatic PD with at least 1 panic attack/week or a CGI score of at&#xD;
        least 4 and never having had experienced a depressive episode meeting DSM-IV criteria for&#xD;
        major depressive disorder or dysthymia, OR a period of at least six months with no more&#xD;
        than one clinically significant symptom, and during which time subjects were not taking an&#xD;
        AD agent, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 25 item) scores in the non-depressed&#xD;
        range (less than or equal to 7) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C) PTSD, Currently Depressed (n=15):&#xD;
&#xD;
        As defined by DSM-IV with a duration of illness at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must score greater than or equal to 50 on Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale&#xD;
        (CAPS-2) as a measure of PTSD symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients are requested to meet the DSM-IV criteria for a single or recurrent episode of&#xD;
        major depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current HDRS score is in the mild-moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than or&#xD;
        equal to 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case of comorbid depression it will be ensured that PTSD had an earlier onset than the&#xD;
        depressive disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D) PTSD, Currently Not Depressed (n=15):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Defined as having PTSD and never having had experienced a depressive episode meeting DSM-IV&#xD;
        criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia OR a period of at least six months with&#xD;
        no more than one clinically significant symptom, and during which time subjects were not&#xD;
        taking an AD agent, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 25 item) scores in the&#xD;
        non-depressed range (less than or equal to 7) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY CONTROL SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        One hundred sixteen subjects (ages 18-50) who have not met criteria for any major&#xD;
        psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The control subjects will have no known first-degree relatives with PD or PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PSYCHIATRIC CONTROL SAMPLE (n=30):&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), currently remitted, as defined by a period&#xD;
        of at least three months during which the subject has not taken an antidepressant agent,&#xD;
        with Hamilton Depression Rating Scales (HDRS; 21-item) scores in the non-depressed range&#xD;
        (less than 8), and with no more than one clinically significant depressive symptom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        These subjects must not have a history of PTSD and/or serious trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be recruited who are drug-naive or who are not currently receiving&#xD;
        psychotropic drugs for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine). In case a patient is on&#xD;
        psychotropic medications and this treatment is not successful (as defined by meeting the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria as noted above), the medication will be tapered off to ensure that the&#xD;
        subject is drug-free for at least 3 weeks prior to PET scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be also be excluded if they have: a) serious suicidal ideation or behavior,&#xD;
        b) psychosis to the extent that the ability to provide informed consent is in doubt, c)&#xD;
        medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, d) a history of&#xD;
        drug (including BZDs) or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or&#xD;
        drug dependence (DSM IV criteria), e) current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing&#xD;
        prior to scanning), f) current breast feeding, g) general MRI exclusion criteria, h)&#xD;
        patients who are currently taking fluoxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients and controls must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with current or previous regular (greater than 4 weeks) of BZDs and excessive use&#xD;
        of alcohol (greater than 8 ounce/day for men and greater than six ounces /day for women) in&#xD;
        the past or present are ineligible to participate, as they may produce a down-regulation of&#xD;
        the BZD receptor that may confound the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Postmenopausal female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects beyond age 50 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by&#xD;
        the MDD and anxiety disorders criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects whose first anxiety disorder episode arose temporally after other major medical or&#xD;
        psychiatric conditions will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to the above criteria, subjects undergoing the serotonin transporter scan will&#xD;
        also be excluded if they have taken the recreational drug ecstasy within 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
        scan or for regular use in the past.&#xD;
