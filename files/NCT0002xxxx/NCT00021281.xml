      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. SU5416 may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to&#xD;
      the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy will be more effective with&#xD;
      or without SU5416 in treating metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      with or without SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the survival of patients with previously untreated metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan with or&#xD;
      without SU5416. II. Compare the antitumor efficacy of these regimens in these patients. III.&#xD;
      Evaluate the additional measures of clinical benefit in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
      IV. Determine the relative safety profile of these regimens in these patients. V. Assess&#xD;
      quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (normal vs&#xD;
      elevated), and treatment regimen. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms by 2&#xD;
      different regimens (Saltz vs de Gramont). Regimen I (Saltz): Arm IA: Patients receive SU5416&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, and 39. Patients also receive&#xD;
      irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 5-10 minutes, and fluorouracil&#xD;
      IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Arm IIA: Patients receive irinotecan,&#xD;
      leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats every 6&#xD;
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen II (de&#xD;
      Gramont): Arm IB: Patients receive SU5416 as in arm IA. Patients also receive irinotecan IV&#xD;
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and&#xD;
      fluorouracil IV over 2 hours on days 1, 2, 15, 16, 29, and 30. Arm IIB: Patients receive&#xD;
      irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm IB. Treatment in both arms repeats&#xD;
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life&#xD;
      is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, and then at the end of treatment.&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months for 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,270 patients (635 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this&#xD;
      study within 2 years.&#xD;
