  <brief_summary>

      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate how the brain controls&#xD;
      bimanual movements (movements of both hands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 65 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations, and will&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire before and after testing. The study consists of two parts: 1) finger&#xD;
      movement training and 2) magnetic resonance imaging, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 - Finger movement training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will train to do three different finger movements using the index finger of both&#xD;
      hands. The fingers will be taped to a device that measures their movement. The movements are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony&#xD;
           (starting and stopping at the same time). The amplitude of finger movements is the same&#xD;
           for both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifting and dropping the index fingers of each hand repetitively and in synchrony, but&#xD;
           with a different amplitude for each hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lifting and dropping of the index finger of each hand repetitively, but each with a&#xD;
           different amplitude and not in synchrony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - Magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform the trained movements during MRI scanning. This diagnostic&#xD;
      procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of brain structure and&#xD;
      activity. For MRI, the subject lies on a stretcher that is moved into the scanner-a cylinder&#xD;
      containing a strong magnet. Earplugs are worn to protect the ears from loud thumping noises&#xD;
      that occur with electrical switching of radio frequency circuits. Scanning time varies from&#xD;
      20 minutes to 2 hours, with most examinations lasting 1 to 1 1/2 hours. The subject can&#xD;
      communicate with the staff person conducting the test at all times during the scan.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: The present study is aimed to clarify which structure or network of structures are&#xD;
      responsible for the temporal linkage in bimanual co-ordination in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Healthy normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI: Anatomical MRI and fMRI sequences are performed to obtain blood-oxygenation&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) imaging of brain activation during which movement performance will be&#xD;
      measured with respect to movement synchrony, movement speed and amplitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-channel EEG recording performed while motor performance is monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI: BOLD will be obtained using baseline correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG: band-power and inter-regional coherence will be calculated using baseline correction.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Forty normal volunteers ranging from 21 to 75 will be included. Normal volunteers&#xD;
                  would be recruited from people who are registered as HMCS Normal Volunteers. All&#xD;
                  subjects should have a valid Clinical Center Medical Record Number.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Alcohol abstention is required for all subjects for both fMRI and EEG for 24&#xD;
                  hours before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Normal subjects younger than 21 years and older than 75 will also be excluded from the&#xD;
             study since development and decline in movement performance and the associated brain&#xD;
             activation is out of the scope of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Normal subjects with MRI findings consistent with organic brain lesions such as brain&#xD;
             tumors, stroke, trauma or AVMs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Normal subjects with a history of significant medical disorders such as cancers, or&#xD;
             requiring continuous treatment with drugs will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with mental disorders will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. We will not scan pregnant women because safety of high magnetic field to fetus is not&#xD;
             established. Therefore, we will administer a urine pregnancy test for any female&#xD;
             subjects of childbearing potential 24 hours prior to functional MRI scan. Pregnant&#xD;
             women will not be excluded from the EEG arm of this protocol.&#xD;
