      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DHA-paclitaxel in treating patients who&#xD;
      have locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable kidney cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response rate, duration of response, and time to disease&#xD;
      progression in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable renal cell cancer&#xD;
      treated with DHA-paclitaxel. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this&#xD;
      drug. III. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day&#xD;
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and at completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
