  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the brain operates during execution and control of voluntary&#xD;
      movement and what goes wrong with these processes in disease. It will use&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to compare brain function in normal&#xD;
      subjects and in patients with focal hand dystonia. In dystonia, involuntary muscle movements,&#xD;
      or spasms, cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Focal&#xD;
      dystonia involves just one region of the body, such as the hand, neck or face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is recorded using wire&#xD;
      electrodes attached to the scalp or mounted on a Lycra cap placed on the head. EMG measures&#xD;
      electrical activity from muscles. It uses wire electrodes placed on the skin over the&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult healthy normal volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Patients will be selected from NINDS's dystonia patient database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sit in a semi-reclining chair in a darkened room and be asked to move&#xD;
      either their right index finger, right foot, or the angle of their mouth on the right side at&#xD;
      a rate of one movement every 10 seconds. Brain and muscle activity will be measured during&#xD;
      this task with EEG and EMG recordings.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find and quantify EEG/MEG correlates of cortical center-surround organization and&#xD;
           intracortical inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare these between healthy volunteers and focal hand dystonia (FHD) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy volunteers and FHD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The study has two separate arms aiming to examine the same question. In the first one&#xD;
      subjects perform a 4-choice contingence negative variation (CNT) type motor task while&#xD;
      multi-channel EEG and EMG are recorded. In the second arm somatosensory evoked potentials&#xD;
      (SEPs) or fields (SEFs) are recorded to median nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      - First arm: EEG band-power difference between &quot;center&quot; and &quot;surround&quot;. Second arm: number,&#xD;
      amplitude, and power of high frequency oscillations (HFOs) component of SEPs/SEFs.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study population will consist of (a) healthy volunteers; and (b) patients with focal&#xD;
        hand dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects: Healthy volunteers who consented to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients diagnosed with focal hand dystonia: unilateral focal hand dystonia from our&#xD;
        dystonia patient database who consented to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy subjects: abnormal neurological exam or history of past neurological disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dystonia patients: the presence of a second neurological disease or condition; abnormal&#xD;
        neurological findings on exam that are not related to their focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For MRI studies, patients with metallic implants will be excluded to remove potential risks&#xD;
        from this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For MRI purposes, women who are pregnant are excluded from this part of the protocol.&#xD;
        Therefore, all women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed prior&#xD;
        to prospective MRI studies, which must be negative, before proceeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For TMS studies, healthy volunteers or focal hand dystonia patients who have a pacemaker,&#xD;
        an implanted medical pump, a metal plate or metal object in the skull or eye (for example,&#xD;
        after brain surgery), or who have a history of seizure disorder will be excluded from the&#xD;
        trial.&#xD;
