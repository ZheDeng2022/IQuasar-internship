    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of intermittent short cycles of HAART (highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy) for treating HIV infection. HAART is a multi-drug regimen that is&#xD;
      very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or halting progression to AIDS.&#xD;
      However, the treatment has significant drawbacks: it cannot completely rid the body of virus;&#xD;
      long-term therapy carries a risk of toxicity (harmful side effects); and the regimen is&#xD;
      difficult to comply with because many pills and capsules must be taken daily. When patients&#xD;
      stop taking HAART, their HIV levels climb again. This study will see if giving HAART in short&#xD;
      cycles of 7 days on, 7 days off, can keep viral levels low while maintaining CD4+ T cell&#xD;
      counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected people age 18 or older who are receiving HAART and have a viral load of less&#xD;
      than 50 copies/ml and a CD4+ T cell count of at least 175 cells/mm3 may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. Women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential will have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue their current medication regimen or&#xD;
      to take HAART in intermittent cycles of 7 days off, 7 days on. Patients will continue&#xD;
      treatment for 72 weeks or until viral levels increase or CD4+ T cell counts decline to a&#xD;
      level of concern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, patients will have blood tests to monitor the amount of virus in the&#xD;
      blood, CD4+ T cell count, viral resistance to HAART medications, side effects of the drug,&#xD;
      and immune response to HIV in the test tube. They will have clinic visits for a history,&#xD;
      physical examination and blood draws every month for 12 months. At that time, depending on T&#xD;
      cell counts and viral load, the number of visits may be reduced, but never less frequently&#xD;
      than every other month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure for collecting quantities of white blood&#xD;
      cells-every 3 to 4 months while on the study. For this procedure, whole blood is collected&#xD;
      through a needle in an arm vein (similar to donating blood). The blood is circulated through&#xD;
      a cell separator where the white cells are removed, and the rest of the blood (plasma, red&#xD;
      cells and platelets) is returned through the same needle or through a second one in the other&#xD;
      arm. The collected white cells are used for special studies on the level and function of T&#xD;
      cells and to detect hidden virus.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing&#xD;
      plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It&#xD;
      is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in&#xD;
      individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing HAART, even after prolonged periods&#xD;
      of virus suppression, leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is&#xD;
      also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and&#xD;
      side effects. In addition, the monetary cost of HAART is prohibitive for many individuals and&#xD;
      countries. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the&#xD;
      goals of : 1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, 2)&#xD;
      minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style, and 3) a&#xD;
      reduction in cost. Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of&#xD;
      short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible&#xD;
      means to achieve these goals. In a pilot study of patients successfully treated with HAART,&#xD;
      we have demonstrated that cycles of 7 days on HAART followed by 7 days off HAART can maintain&#xD;
      suppression of plasma, lymph node, and resting CD4+ T cell HIV while maintaining CD4+ T cell&#xD;
      counts for up to 1 year. It is the purpose of this study to further evaluate these&#xD;
      observations with a randomized, controlled, intent-to-treat trial.&#xD;
