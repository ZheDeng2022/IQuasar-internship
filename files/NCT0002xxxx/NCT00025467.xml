  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have&#xD;
      recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by&#xD;
      stopping blood flow to the tumor&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of thalidomide, in terms of 6-month&#xD;
      progression-free survival, in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.&#xD;
      Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients treated with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the duration of progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with&#xD;
      this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the effect of this drug on initial performance status and histological grade in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
