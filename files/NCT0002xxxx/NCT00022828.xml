  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research project is to develop a new system that uses lasers to provide&#xD;
      3-dimensional (3-D) images of the cervical spine (the seven spinal bones in the neck) in a&#xD;
      moving person. Doctors and researchers could use this system to examine people with spinal&#xD;
      disorders and to learn more about how the spine works. The laser technique would be better&#xD;
      than existing imaging methods because it would provide 3-D views of the cervical spine and&#xD;
      would not expose patients to radiation. These two features would make a laser system a safer&#xD;
      and more effective tool than other imaging systems. This technique should be suitable for a&#xD;
      wide variety of uses because the sensitivity of the measurement can be adjusted depending on&#xD;
      what is being studied. The benefits of this research will include helping doctors and other&#xD;
      health practitioners to detect and diagnose painful spinal disorders more effectively. This&#xD;
      should lead to improved treatment and management of spinal disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An improved method of spinal visualization is important because the examination and treatment&#xD;
      of people with diagnoses such as scoliosis, spinal instability, and painful cervical spine&#xD;
      and lumbar disorders depend on good spinal imaging. A system that would allow&#xD;
      three-dimensional analysis of the spine in a moving person without the risk and limitations&#xD;
      of radiation would greatly enhance the research and interventions needed to improve our&#xD;
      understanding of spine position and movement. Moreover, it is extremely important for&#xD;
      physicians, physical therapists, athletic trainers, coaches, and movement scientists to rely&#xD;
      on accurate yet reliable devices for measuring the spine during activity and research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop a novel automated, nondestructive 3-D laser imaging&#xD;
      system for cervical spine motion analysis. The imaging system is based on shadow Moir√Ω&#xD;
      interferometry and finger pattern analysis. The proposed technique would be superior to&#xD;
      existing methods such as radiography because of its potential to allow 3-D visualization and&#xD;
      its elimination of patient exposure to radiation. These two attributes would make a laser&#xD;
      system a safer and more effective tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the laser-based system will surpass conventional motion analysis systems&#xD;
      such as video motion analysis systems, inclinometers, flexible rulers, goniometers, and&#xD;
      posture grids in accuracy, reliability, and validity of measurements of spinal motion and&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique possesses several advantages with respect to simplicity, versatility and&#xD;
      suitability for operation in different environments. The sensitivity of the measurement can&#xD;
      be adjusted based on the nature of the object under investigation. This makes the technique&#xD;
      suitable for a wide variety of applications. The benefits of these basic studies will include&#xD;
      assisting physician and other allied health practitioners to more effectively detect and&#xD;
      diagnose painful spinal disorders. This ultimately should enhance the treatment and&#xD;
      management of spinal disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to test the device on 134 people whom we will recruit from Northern Illinois&#xD;
      University and the surrounding community. Thirty-four study participants (25%) will be&#xD;
      patients seeking medical, chiropractic, or physical therapy intervention for complaints of&#xD;
      neck pain from the Northern Illinois University Health Service and Northern Illinois area&#xD;
      medical, chiropractic, and physical therapy facilities. The rest of the participants will&#xD;
      have no complaints of neck pain.&#xD;
