  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to identify and understand the genetic factors that lead to an inner ear&#xD;
      malformation called &quot;enlarged vestibular aqueducts&quot;, that can be associated with hearing&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sensorineural hearing loss with or without inner ear malformations and their&#xD;
      parents and siblings may be eligible for this study. Participants and their immediate family&#xD;
      members, may undergo some or all of the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and family history, including questions about hearing, balance and other&#xD;
           ear-related issues, and review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Routine physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw or buccal swab (brushing inside the cheek to collect cells) - Tissue is&#xD;
           collected for DNA analysis to look for changes in genes that may be related to hearing&#xD;
           loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hearing tests - The subject listens for tones emitted through a small earphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balance test (VEMP) to see if balance functions of the inner ear are associated with the&#xD;
           hearing loss Electrodes will be placed behind your ear and at the base of your neck.&#xD;
           From a reclining position, you will be asked to raise your head while clicking sounds&#xD;
           are played into your ears. - Ultrasound tests - An inner ear malformation called EVA&#xD;
           (enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct) indicates that a genetic disorder called&#xD;
           Pendred syndrome may be the cause. Because thyroid abnormalities are also associated&#xD;
           with Pendred syndrome, an ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland may be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans - These tests show&#xD;
           the structure of the inner ear. For CT, the subject lies still for a short time while&#xD;
           X-ray images are obtained. For MRI, the patient lies on a stretcher that is moved into a&#xD;
           cylindrical machine with a strong magnetic field. The magnetic field and radio waves&#xD;
           produce images of the inner ear. The radio waves cause loud thumping noises that can be&#xD;
           muffled by the use of earplugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that can&#xD;
      be caused by mutations in any one of at least 60 different genes. Enlargement of the&#xD;
      vestibular aqueduct (EVA) is a radiologic finding known to be associated with mutations in&#xD;
      one of these genes, the Pendred syndrome gene (SLC26A4, formerly known as PDS). EVA may thus&#xD;
      serve as a clinically useful marker to facilitate the diagnosis of hearing impairment. Recent&#xD;
      data from our laboratory and others indicates that only a subset of individuals with EVA have&#xD;
      SLC26A4 mutations, and therefore some EVA cases are likely to be caused by other genes,&#xD;
      nongenetic factors, or a combination of these etiologies. Families with two or more&#xD;
      individuals with hearing impairment and EVA will be enrolled in this study in order to&#xD;
      identify other genetic factors that cause EVA. Siblings and parents may also be enrolled in&#xD;
      order to define inheritance and to perform molecular genetic analyses.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must have or be a family member of a participant with known or non-syndromic SNHL&#xD;
        associated with EVA or have evidence of other findings that suggest that EVA might be part&#xD;
        of a novel phenotype&#xD;
&#xD;
        There must be at least two participating affected family members with one exception: if&#xD;
        there is only one participating affected family member, there must be genetic test results&#xD;
        identifying only one pathogenic mutant allele of SLC26A4&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults must be able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minors must have a parent or guardian able to provide consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age between 0-99.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with known exposure to physical or chemical teratogens in utero that could account&#xD;
        for their inner ear malformations such as thalidomide or radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any hearing loss that is associated with symptoms which meet the criteria of already known&#xD;
        syndromes, such as, branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome, which comprises system malformations&#xD;
        and branchial cleft abnormalities and is caused by heterozygous mutations in the EYA1 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous genetic testing identifying two pathogenic mutant alleles of SLC26A4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prospective study subjects who are cognitively impaired and lack consent capacity, will not&#xD;
        be enrolled.&#xD;
