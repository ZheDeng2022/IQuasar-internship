    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have stage&#xD;
      IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may&#xD;
      interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the one-years survival rate in both previously-untreated and previously-treated&#xD;
      patients with advanced bronchioalveolar carcinoma receiving chronic oral ZD1839.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival in these groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the response rate using both the standard RECIST criteria and by&#xD;
      computer-assisted image analysis in patients with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To measure EGFR and EGFR variant III overexpression in tumor tissue samples and explore&#xD;
      their relationship with aforementioned clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To measure EGFR expression and activation status in slides of buccal brushings submitted&#xD;
      on S9925 before and after initiation of treatment with ZD1839 and explore their association&#xD;
      with response and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior systemic&#xD;
      treatment for bronchioalveolar carcinoma (yes vs no). (The previously untreated stratum&#xD;
      closed to accrual as of 2/15/2003.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.&#xD;

             brushings or washings are not permitted for diagnosis; patients must have either&#xD;
             selected stage IIIB due to cytology-confirmed malignant pleural effusion, or stage IV&#xD;
             disease; tumors may be multi-focal or diffuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence of disease by CT scan of the chest; the pre-study CT scan&#xD;
             of the chest must include the liver and adrenal glands or be accompanied by an&#xD;
             abdominal CT scan in which they are visualized; all x-rays/scans to assess measurable&#xD;
             disease must have performed within 28 days prior to registration; all other required&#xD;
             tests to assess non-measurable disease must have been performed within 42 days prior&#xD;
             to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The institution must plan to submit all pathology materials (i.e., H&amp;E stained slide&#xD;

                  disease must be present outside of areas of previous radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Prior surgery is allowed, provided that the patient has had sufficient recovery&#xD;

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 x IULN (if bone metastases are present, alkaline&#xD;
             phosphatase =&lt; 5 x IULN is allowed); abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase levels&#xD;
             should be appropriately followed to document the possibility of bone or hepatic&#xD;
             metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Institution must have receive IRB approval for S9925; patients must be offered&#xD;
             participating in S9925 (the Lung Cancer Specimen Repository); optional submissions of&#xD;
             buccal brushings for EGFR determination will be done via the Lung Cancer Specimen&#xD;
             Repository; patients must be registered separately to S9925 to receive credit for&#xD;
             buccal brushing submission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with known brain metastases are ineligible for this clinical trial; if there&#xD;
             are any abnormal findings on neurological examination suspicious for brain metastases,&#xD;
             a CT or MRI should be performed within 42 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: a baseline slit lamp examination is NOT required; however, patients with eye&#xD;
             symptoms (eye pain, tearing, redness, vision problems) should be evaluated by an&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient must not have corneal inflammation or infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring agents that induce CYP3A4 are excluded from the study, due to the&#xD;

             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except to the following: adequately treated basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I&#xD;
             or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the&#xD;
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study&#xD;
