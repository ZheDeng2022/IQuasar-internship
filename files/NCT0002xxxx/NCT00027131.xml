      Description: The trial is designed to determine the response of the immune system of patients&#xD;
      with breast cancer to a vaccine made from their own tumor. Researchers believe that this&#xD;
      particular vaccine, which is made from purified heat shock proteins taken from each patient's&#xD;
      tumor, might alert the body's immune system to recognize and attack invading cancer. To be&#xD;
      considered potentially eligible for this study you must be a high risk breast cancer patient&#xD;
      and have a tumor that can be removed surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length/Duration: Vaccinations are administered weekly for six weeks. Follow up visits to the&#xD;
      clinic are every three months for two years, then every six months thereafter.&#xD;

      Heat-shock proteins (HSP) are present within normal and cancerous cells. They are among the&#xD;
      most ancient molecules in evolution, and are known as protein chaperones because of their&#xD;
      abilities to bind polypeptide chains to assist in protein folding, transport or turnover.&#xD;
      Works pioneered by Srivastava's group (Srivastava et al. 1998) have shown that HSPs can&#xD;
      associate non-covalently with antigenic peptides. Injection of HSP-peptide complexes isolated&#xD;
      from tumor cells can induce tumor protection against both pre-established tumors and&#xD;
      subsequent tumor challenge by eliciting specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response&#xD;
      against a variety of tumors in animals such as sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma, hepatoma,&#xD;
      prostate cancer and lung cancer (Tamura et al).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous trial on the role of HSP70 in breast cancer treatment was targeted specifically&#xD;
      against patients who had widespread metastasis and who had failed all conventional therapy&#xD;
      including intensive multi-agent chemotherapy with DTEC (decadron, taxol, etoposide and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study has shown that, (1) HSP70 can be purified successfully from breast cancer&#xD;
      cells. (2) The yield of HSP70 is extremely variable and cannot be predicted accurately based&#xD;
      on the size of the tumor because of significant heterogeneity of histology and patient's&#xD;
      prior history of chemotherapy. (3) HSP70 vaccination is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and current protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest challenge of cancer management is to control metastasis. It is perhaps more&#xD;
      obvious in breast cancer than in any other tumor. Breast cancer patients rarely die of&#xD;
      primary cancer. The tendency of a deadly relapse in distal sites, after years of &quot;remission&quot;&#xD;
      is the common cause of mortality. Even with newly diagnosed patients who present with stage&#xD;
      IV breast cancer, complete response can be achieved in more than 40% of patients with the&#xD;
      current multi-modality approach. However, patients with stage IV breast cancer are &quot;never&quot;&#xD;
      cured because of the risk of late relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several reasons for the unsatisfactory results of immunotherapy in advanced and&#xD;
      widespread cancers. First, the tumor burden is too overwhelming. Host defenses are simply&#xD;
      over powered. Second, patients at this stage usually have significant co-morbidities, which&#xD;
      prevent optimal immune responses. Third, advanced cancer patients often have a compromised&#xD;
      functional state of the immune system either quantitatively or qualitatively due to prior&#xD;
      cytotoxic therapy, radiation therapy, or as a result of active secretion of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents by the tumor cells such as TGF-beta. Finally, there is simply not enough time to mount&#xD;
      an effective adaptive immune response in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we hypothesize that immunotherapy with HSP70 is more effective as &quot;consolidation&quot;&#xD;
      therapy for high-risk patients who are rendered to have only minimal residue disease. To test&#xD;
      this hypothesis, tumors from patients with high-risk breast cancer will be resected for HSP70&#xD;
      purification. This will be followed by conventional therapy such as hormonal therapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or combined modality treatment. A total of 15 patients who&#xD;
      are either in complete remission or in stable partial remission after standard therapy, will&#xD;
      be enrolled to test the hypothesis that HSP70 vaccine will lead to improved tumor-specific T&#xD;
      cell response in over 40% of patients. As a secondary endpoint, it will be determined whether&#xD;
      the immunological responses can be correlated with disease-free survival or progression-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
