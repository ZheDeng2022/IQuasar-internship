  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether and how nitrites and nitrates in the diet affect the level&#xD;
      of nitric oxide gas that is breathed out in air. Nitric oxide is involved in many bodily&#xD;
      processes, such as immune function, nerve signal transmission, inflammation, and dilation of&#xD;
      blood vessels and bronchial tubes (tubes that branch out from the trachea into the lungs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male volunteers age 18 years or older who have not smoked for at least 5 years may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will undergo blood and urine tests, breathing tests, and&#xD;
      an electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will follow two special diets for 3 days each. One is a low-nitrate and nitrite&#xD;
      diet, and the other is a high-nitrate and nitrite diet. Both diets must be completed within a&#xD;
      month's time. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two 3-night&#xD;
      hospital stays during the two diet periods, but may go out on passes at any time. While on&#xD;
      the diets, they may consume only food prepared by the NIH Nutrition Department; eating other&#xD;
      foods will seriously affect the study results. Meals may be eaten at the NIH Clinical Center,&#xD;
      or packaged meals prepared by the Nutrition Department can be taken out. Participants may not&#xD;
      engage in any heavy exercise during the diet periods, as exercise affects nitric oxide&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples of about 4 milliliters, or 1 teaspoon, each will be collected before starting&#xD;
      each diet and at the end of each diet to measure blood levels of nitrate and nitrite.&#xD;
      Additional blood samples, totaling about 2 tablespoons, will be collected for research. Each&#xD;
      day, participants will have a test to measure exhaled nitric oxide levels. This involves&#xD;
      blowing air into a mouthpiece attached to a machine that measures levels of the gas in each&#xD;
      breath.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) has been recognized for its multifaceted roles in many physiological&#xD;
      processes (e.g., vasodilatation, host defense, neurotransmission, bronchodilatation, and&#xD;
      inflammation.) NO is produced by a family of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms in a&#xD;
      reaction that converts L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO metabolites in vivo include nitrite&#xD;
      (NO2) and nitrate (NO3). Plasma NO2/NO3 concentrations have been used extensively as a marker&#xD;
      for NOS activity and NO radical production. Studies have shown that dietary intake of&#xD;
      nitrate, estrogen, atmospheric pollution, and heavy exercise can influence NO2/NO3 levels in&#xD;
      blood. NO can also be detected in exhaled air. NO levels vary with disease, and in some cases&#xD;
      (e.g., asthma) respond to treatment (e.g., steroid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is designed to determine whether or not dietary intake influences exhaled NO&#xD;
      levels. To use plasma metabolite measurements to monitor NOS activity, subjects must adhere&#xD;
      to a strict low NO2/NO3 diet before and during the study where measurements of exhaled NO can&#xD;
      be performed quickly and easily in an inpatient setting. Subjects will be studied as&#xD;
      inpatients consuming standardized high and low nitrite/nitrate (NO2/NO3) diets each for a&#xD;
      period of three days. Since L-arginine is a NOS substrate and can affect the generation of&#xD;
      NO, diets will also be monitored by protein intake. Blood samples will be collected four&#xD;
      times during the study, pre- and post-diet for each diet, for the quantification of NO2/NO3&#xD;
      concentration. Exhaled NO will be measured daily. In addition, blood pressure, pulmonary&#xD;
      function testing, and blood plasma levels of L-arginine, cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#xD;
      (cGMP), and S-thiolation may be monitored. Results of this study should allow us to determine&#xD;
      the most effective method of monitoring NOS activity, and potentially identify activities&#xD;
      responsible for maintaining nitric oxide levels.&#xD;
