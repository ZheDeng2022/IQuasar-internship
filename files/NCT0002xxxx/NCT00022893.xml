      The purpose of this study is to enable retreatment with Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy&#xD;
      for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who previously responded (PR, CCR, or CR) for&#xD;
      at least 3 months to Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy.&#xD;

      The endpoints of the study are to determine the response rate, complete response rate,&#xD;
      duration of response, time to progression, time-to-treatment failure, safety, and survival&#xD;
      following Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy in patients with NHL who previously responded&#xD;
      (PR, CCR, or CR) with a duration of response of at least 3 months to Iodine-131 Anti-B1&#xD;
      Antibody therapy.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
             B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have previously responded (PR, CCR, or CR) with a duration of response&#xD;
             of at least 3 months to Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy. The patient's disease&#xD;
             must have progressed following the response to Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence that their tumor tissue expresses the CD20 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status of at least 60% on the Karnofsky Scale and an&#xD;
             anticipated survival of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an absolute granulocyte count (ANC)&gt;1,500 cells/mm3 (US) or &gt;1,500&#xD;
             x 109/l (UK) and a platelet count &gt;100,000 cells/mm3 (US) or &gt;100,000 x 109/l (UK)&#xD;
             within 14 days of study entry. These blood counts must be sustained without support of&#xD;
             hematopoietic cytokines or transfusion of blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper&#xD;
             limit of normal) and hepatic function (defined as total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit&#xD;
             of normal and hepatic transaminases [AST and ALT] &lt;5 x upper limit of normal) within&#xD;
             14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease. At least one lesion must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 2 x 2 cm (by CT scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with more than an average of 25% of the intratrabecular marrow space involved&#xD;
             by lymphoma in bone marrow biopsy specimens as assessed microscopically within 42 days&#xD;
             of study entry. Bilateral posterior iliac crest core biopsies are required if the&#xD;
             percentage of intratrabecular space involved exceeds 10% on a unilateral biopsy. The&#xD;
             mean of bilateral biopsies must be no more than 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy,&#xD;
             immunosuppressants, or cytokine treatment within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks&#xD;
             for nitrosourea compounds) or who exhibit persistent clinical evidence of toxicity.&#xD;
             The use of systemic steroids must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to study&#xD;
             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active obstructive hydronephrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of active infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of&#xD;
             study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease or other&#xD;
             serious illness that would preclude evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 years. Patients who have been disease-free of another cancer for&#xD;
             greater than 5 years must be carefully assessed at the time of study entry to rule out&#xD;
             recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing (breastfeeding). Patients of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must undergo a serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry.&#xD;
             Males and females must agree to use effective contraception for 6 months following&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous allergic reactions to iodine. This does not include reacting to&#xD;
             IV iodine-containing contrast materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with progressive disease within 1 year of irradiation arising in a field that&#xD;
             has been previously irradiated with &gt;3500 cGy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who became HAMA positive following Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody therapy or&#xD;
             patients who are HAMA positive at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are concurrently receiving either approved or non-approved (through&#xD;
             another protocol) anti-cancer drugs or biologics.&#xD;
