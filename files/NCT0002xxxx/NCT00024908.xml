      This study will examine the underlying mental processes that determine how people understand&#xD;
      social behavior, remember information, and think. Language, planning, problem solving,&#xD;
      reasoning, social behavior, and memory are the critical parts of cognition that make up daily&#xD;
      life. This study will explore the association between performance on various experimental&#xD;
      tasks and day-to-day functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with certain kinds of brain damage (primarily focal or&#xD;
      degenerative lesions of the human prefrontal cortex) or psychiatric disorders may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates with central nervous system trauma, disease or dysfunction will be&#xD;
      screened with a routine neurological examination and history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be asked to complete written tests, sit in front of a computer monitor and&#xD;
      press a key to indicate a decision about what appears on the screen (for example, whether a&#xD;
      statement is accurate) and answer questions from a test examiner. A skin conductance response&#xD;
      (SCR) test may be done along with some of the cognitive tests. SCR uses electrodes (pieces of&#xD;
      metal attached to wires) placed on the fingers to measure the subject's emotional reaction to&#xD;
      a test. Participants may also do an evoked response test, in which the subject watches words&#xD;
      or scenes on a TV screen while his or her responses are recorded from electrodes placed on&#xD;
      the scalp (similar to an electroencephalogram). The tests will be scheduled for an average of&#xD;
      one session a week, with each session lasting from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Generally, 15&#xD;
      sessions will be scheduled over a 1-year period. Special arrangements will be made to&#xD;
      accommodate participants from out-of-town.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. This test uses&#xD;
      radio waves and a strong magnetic field to picture structural and chemical changes in tissue.&#xD;
      For the procedure, the subject lies on a table in a space enclosed by a metal cylinder (the&#xD;
      scanner) for about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, some study subjects will be invited to participate in a training study designed&#xD;
      to improve their planning or social behavior. Participation requires coming to NIH daily over&#xD;
      a 1- to 2-month period for 1 to 2 hours each visit.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to test a comprehensive model of the underlying knowledge&#xD;
      representations stored in the human prefrontal cortex developed by the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Utilizing a variety of standardized and experimental neuropsychological tasks&#xD;
      and techniques, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex in planning, problem-solving, and reasoning and the ventromedial prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will ascertain the relationship&#xD;
      between so-called &quot;cold&quot; cognitive processes such as planning and &quot;hot&quot; social processes such&#xD;
      as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal cortex. Besides&#xD;
      cognitive paradigms, we will use skin conductance and event-related EEG recording techniques&#xD;
      when subjects are performing selected cognitive tasks in order to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between autonomic and central nervous system markers of emotional modulation and&#xD;
      speed/duration of processing and task performance. The data we collect in this protocol will&#xD;
      be of value in 1) Developing a model of the forms of knowledge representation stored in the&#xD;
      human prefrontal cortex; 2) Developing outcome measures for drug and behavioral treatments&#xD;
      for disorders of prefrontal cortex functions; and, 3) Developing biologically plausible&#xD;
      computer models of the cognitive sub-components stored in the human prefrontal cortex that&#xD;
      compose the complex skills referred to above.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Controls: Healthy normal controls matched to specific patient groups for age, education,&#xD;
        gender, and race to be recruited by advertisement from the community or from among friends&#xD;
        and relatives of the patient. Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history or&#xD;
        medical condition that would compromise our interpretation of the test results will not be&#xD;
        included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients: Patients will be selected from referrals to the Cognitive Neuroscience Section,&#xD;
        the NIH Clinical Center, and from referrals recruited through approved advertisement in&#xD;
        appropriate media and medical journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients must have a diagnosed CNS disorder with lesions localization (when suspected)&#xD;
        verified by CT or MRI scanning available from the referring physician or completed at the&#xD;
        NIH Clinical Center. Subjects without neurological, neuropsychological, and imaging&#xD;
        evidence compatible with one of the recruited diagnoses will be excluded from the study as&#xD;
        will subjects who cannot cooperate with neuropsychological testing (based on family report&#xD;
        and the report of the referring healthcare professional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The bulk of the patients recruited for this protocol will have focal or degenerative&#xD;
        lesions of the HPFC. We also will recruit patients with non-frontal lesions in order to&#xD;
        determine the specificity of the deficit we observe in patients with HPFC lesions. These&#xD;
        patients will undergo the same testing but are not expected to have marked cognitive&#xD;
        deficits on tests of frontal lobe function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with different basal ganglia disorders or limbic system lesions are included&#xD;
        because their lesions involve differing subsets of subcortical structures that are thought&#xD;
        to play an important role in the automatic activation of stored plans and social behavior.&#xD;
        Another prediction from the SEC model is that patients with basal ganglia disorders will&#xD;
        have deficits primarily on over-learned components of tasks that require visuomotor&#xD;
        interaction (e.g., a visuomotor serial reaction time task) but have spared performance on&#xD;
        higher level cognitive planning tasks that don't require simple visuomotor responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The bulk of the patients will be patients with focal penetrating head injuries who will be&#xD;
        seen here at the NIH as part of a newly funded study to be conducted primarily, but not&#xD;
        solely, at the National Naval Medical Center. Patients with dementing disorders (e.g.,&#xD;
        frontotemporal dementia) are suitable for assessment of the structure of knowledge, and in&#xD;
        particular, the systematic general breakdown of social and non-social SEC knowledge&#xD;
        representation. Patients with focal lesions (e.g., dorsolateral frontal) will be studied to&#xD;
        assess damage to specific sub-components of the structured event complex model.&#xD;
        Occasionally, single cases will be intensively studied due to a unique behavioral&#xD;
        presentation (see above for a lengthier description).&#xD;
&#xD;
        A durable power of attorney will be appointed if the patient is unable to make decisions&#xD;
        about any or all aspects of this protocol. In the past in our protocols, this has almost&#xD;
        always been the spouse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The age range of the brain-damaged patients will be determined on entrance into the&#xD;
        protocol. An equal number of left and right unilateral lesions will be sought for&#xD;
        determination of laterality differences. Patients with lesions limited to (rather than&#xD;
        simply including) the frontal lobe will also be especially sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minors (ages 6-17) are included in this protocol in order to examine 3 specific questions:&#xD;
        (1) What is the distinction in retrievable SEC knowledge (e.g., plans or social rules)&#xD;
        learned prior to adolescence from that subsequent to adolescence?; (2) Does learning and&#xD;
        development of all aspects of social cognition require an intact prefrontal cortex?; and&#xD;
        (3) Will some effects of early prefrontal cortex lesions only appear after the age of 14?&#xD;
        The first question will be addressed by studying healthy normal children before the age of&#xD;
        14 on experimental social cognition and planning tasks slightly modified from those used&#xD;
        with adults (see the six studies described above). The second question will be addressed by&#xD;
        studying single cases and groups of children with prefrontal cortex lesions on social&#xD;
        cognition tasks before and after the age of 14. The third question will be addressed by&#xD;
        studying children with prefrontal cortex lesions incurred before the age of 14 both before&#xD;
        and after the age of 14 on social cognition, meta-cognition, and planning tasks.&#xD;
