  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of the motor part of the brain in&#xD;
      the recovery of motor function after stroke. The motor deficits that follow a stroke are&#xD;
      compensated for over several months. It has been proposed that the ipsilateral motor cortex&#xD;
      mediates these recovery processes. The results of this study will provide fundamental&#xD;
      information on the role of ipsilateral M1 in recovery of motor function after chronic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general patient evaluation will determine the location of the lesion site and assess the&#xD;
      degree of impairment in motor and global cognitive functioning. An assessment of motor&#xD;
      function will also be performed. Patients will be divided into two groups: well and poorly&#xD;
      recovered. An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan may also be done if one has not been&#xD;
      performed in the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main procedures will be performed: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and test of&#xD;
      motor performance. In the first procedure, a metal coil surrounded by a plastic mold will be&#xD;
      placed on the head and electrical current will be pulsed through it. The electrical muscle&#xD;
      activity will be recorded through these electrodes with a computer. The second procedure&#xD;
      involves a reaction time test. The task will consist of reacting to a visual stimulus by&#xD;
      performing a voluntary movement. TMS pulses will be given before each movement. This is done&#xD;
      to determine whether this type of stimulation interferes with reaction time, which would&#xD;
      indicated that it interferes with the brain centers executing the reaction to the visual&#xD;
      Go-signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with single ischemic hemispheric lesions at least 12 months after the stroke who&#xD;
      initially had a severe paralysis of the arm will be recruited for the study. Healthy normal&#xD;
      volunteers will also be included in the study. A special effort will be made to increase the&#xD;
      participation of women and diverse racial groups.&#xD;

      It has been proposed that recovery of motor function of the paretic arm following stroke is&#xD;
      mediated by the ipsilateral (intact) motor cortex (M1). This proposal has not been&#xD;
      conclusively tested experimentally and represents an important question in stroke&#xD;
      rehabilitation. In this protocol, we will study the behavioral consequences of transient&#xD;
      inactivation of ipsilateral M1 on motor performance of the affected arm in chronic stroke&#xD;
      patients with complete and incomplete motor recovery. The results from this study will&#xD;
      provide fundamental information on the role of ipsilateral M1 in recovery of motor function&#xD;
      after chronic stroke.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with single ischemic hemispheric lesions at least 12 months after the stroke who&#xD;
        had a severe paresis (below MRC grade 2) of the affected arm initially. An anatomical MRI&#xD;
        scan will be acquired at the NIH if a recent one (within 6 months) is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normal volunteers who are willing and able to perform the tasks will be included in the&#xD;
        study. Healthy normal volunteers recruited for the study will receive neurological and&#xD;
        physical exams to ensure their healthy conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with more than one stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with bilateral motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with cerebellar or brainstem lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects unable to perform the task (wrist or elbow flexion at least MRC grade&#xD;
        2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with history of severe alcohol or drug abuse, psychiatric illness like&#xD;
        severe depression, poor motivational capacity, or severe language disturbances,&#xD;
        particularly of receptive nature or with serious cognitive deficits (defined as equivalent&#xD;
        to a mini-mental state exam score of 20 or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular&#xD;
        disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis, active joint deformity of arthritic origin, active&#xD;
        cancer or renal disease, any kind of end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or a&#xD;
        deteriorated condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy or others).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with metal in the cranium except mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with dental braces, metal fragments from occupational exposure or&#xD;
        surgical clips in or near the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with eye, blood vessel, cochlear or eye implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients or subjects with increased intracranial pressure as evaluated by clinical means.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with cardiac or neural pacemakers, intracardiac lines and/or implanted medication&#xD;
        pumps.&#xD;
