  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether PET imaging can reveal what is happening in lymph nodes of&#xD;
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, during periods of active disease.&#xD;
      Patients may have periods of active disease when they may feel sick with fever, fatigue, and&#xD;
      aching or swollen joints. Their blood tests are abnormal and their kidney, lungs or heart may&#xD;
      be affected. At other times, the disease is inactive, and patients feel well, their blood is&#xD;
      normal, and there is no evidence of organ disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In lupus, like other autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system attacks it own healthy&#xD;
      tissues. Activated lymphocytes (a type of immune cell) lead to the production of antibodies&#xD;
      and chemical signals that contribute to the disease process. In animals with lupus, these&#xD;
      cells are activated in the lymphoid organs, such as the lymph nodes or spleen. It is not&#xD;
      known exactly where these cells are activated in humans. Because some lymph nodes are located&#xD;
      deep inside the chest and abdomen; surgery is currently the only way to examining them. PET&#xD;
      imaging may provide an alternative, non-invasive, means of obtaining information on lymph&#xD;
      node activity in humans. This test uses a radioactive sugar molecule called F18-FDG to find&#xD;
      areas of increased cellular activity in the body. (Cells use sugar for fuel, so active cells,&#xD;
      such as active lymphocytes, uses more FDG than other body tissues.) This study will determine&#xD;
      whether PET can detect these areas of increased activity in lupus during active disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active or inactive lupus may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a history, physical examination, and routine blood and urine tests. Women who&#xD;
      are pregnant or breastfeeding may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo PET scanning. On the day of the scan they have a brief medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination and a blood sample is drawn to check blood count and look&#xD;
      for markers of lymphocyte activation. Then, a small plastic tube (catheter) is placed into a&#xD;
      vein in the patient's arm, the FDG is injected through the catheter, and the patient rests&#xD;
      for an hour. For the scan, the patient lies flat in a cradle that is moved into the central&#xD;
      hole of the doughnut-shaped PET camera, and pictures are taken over the next 2 hours, with&#xD;
      the patient lies quietly, without moving the head or arms. After the scan is finished, the&#xD;
      patient empties the bladder approximately every hour for 6 hours to excrete the radioactive&#xD;
      sugar.&#xD;

      This pilot study aims to evaluate the value of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in&#xD;
      assessing the distribution of activated lymphocytes in SLE patients. Systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus (SLE), often defined as the prototypical autoimmune disease, is a chronic&#xD;
      occasionally life threatening, multisystem disorder. Determining disease activity in SLE is&#xD;
      essential for the selection of appropriate and effective therapeutic regimes. Lymphocyte&#xD;
      activation is the hallmark of SLE and correlates well with disease activity. 2-deoxy-2 [F-18]&#xD;
      fluoro-2-D-Glucose positron emission scanning (FDG-PET) is a physiologically based method of&#xD;
      imaging that provides non-invasive information on uptake and metabolism of glucose in various&#xD;
      tissues. Actively metabolizing cells will preferentially take up the radioactively labeled&#xD;
      glucose analog and therefore demonstrate increased signal. Actively proliferating lymphocytes&#xD;
      take up FDG at a higher rate than resting lymphocytes and are expected to accumulate in&#xD;
      selected lymph nodes or spleen that are the anatomic sites of lymphocyte activation.&#xD;
      Lymphocyte activation will be confirmed by FACS analysis of circulating lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a single center pilot study with two groups of patients divided&#xD;
      into active vs. non-active SLE and both groups will undergo FDG-PET scanning. The primary&#xD;
      objective will be to evaluate the feasibility of FDG-PET in assessing distribution of&#xD;
      activated lymphocytes in active and inactive SLE patients. The goal is to detect activated&#xD;
      lymphocytes at their homing sites and correlate the pattern of distribution with clinical&#xD;
      disease activity.&#xD;
