  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetically inherited heart diseases (familial cardiopathies) are conditions affecting the&#xD;
      heart passed on to family members by abnormalities in genetic information. These conditions&#xD;
      are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers are interested in learning more about the specific genetic abnormalities causing&#xD;
      heart diseases. In addition, they would like to find out how these abnormal genes can&#xD;
      contribute to the development of other medical problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this, researchers plan to study patients and family members of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with genetically inherited heart disease. Those people participating in the study&#xD;
      will undergo a variety of tests including blood tests, echocardiograms, and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging studies (MRI). These tests will be used to help researchers find the&#xD;
      genetic problem causing the familial cardiopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hope that the information gathered from this study can be used to develop better&#xD;
      medical care through early diagnosis, management, and treatment plans.&#xD;

      Familial cardiomyopathies (FC) are important cardiovascular causes of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      that demonstrate both allelic and non-allelic genetic heterogeneity. We propose to perform&#xD;
      genetic studies to determine novel molecular causes of FC and to describe their clinical&#xD;
      correlates. This will permit: (1) pre-symptomatic diagnosis; (2) definition of cardiac&#xD;
      phenotype, disease penetrance; (3) natural history; (4) study of abnormal physiology that is&#xD;
      a consequence of the molecular defect; (5) elucidation of specific mechanisms of arrythmias&#xD;
      and sudden death; and (6) demonstration and characterization of skeletal muscle involvement.&#xD;

        INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        The subjects will consist of family members who may have inherited FC and spouses that may&#xD;
        help in the linkage studies. Family members or spouses who do not wish to participate in&#xD;
        the research protocol will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
