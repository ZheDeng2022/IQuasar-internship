      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is highly prevalent in American Indian children, increasing their risk for the&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes. Although increasing energy&#xD;
      expenditure, through increasing physical activity, and decreasing dietary fat intake should&#xD;
      slow the rate of body fat gain, it appears that children actually decrease their physical&#xD;
      activity as they mature from pre-to post-pubescence. Several studies have shown that the&#xD;
      decline in activity is greater in females than in males, and greater in non-whites than in&#xD;
      whites; however, other studies have not supported these findings. Further, there were no data&#xD;
      available in American Indian children, which is a population at greatest risk. Additionally,&#xD;
      inconsistencies have been reported with respect to the relationship between body weight or&#xD;
      body fat and energy intake or dietary fat intake. At the heart of the problem is the&#xD;
      difficulty in measuring self-reported physical activity and dietary intake accurately.&#xD;
      Accurate self- report measures are necessary for use in the large scale studies that are&#xD;
      required to investigate relationships between physical activity and dietary intake and&#xD;
      disease. The Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives&#xD;
      include seven objectives emphasizing increasing physical activity in children and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study had a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional design in which the investigators&#xD;
      modified the best existing methods for the self-report of physical activity and dietary&#xD;
      intake in children and adolescents, and evaluated their validity using total energy&#xD;
      expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) as the criterion. They then used&#xD;
      these methods to measure physical activity and dietary intake in two age cohorts of male and&#xD;
      female American Indian children (8-10-years and 11-13-years) at baseline and two years later,&#xD;
      with two sets of interim measurements. Change in TEE from baseline to the two-year follow-up&#xD;
      was also measured using DLW and the TriTrac accelerometer. Equations for the estimation of&#xD;
      percent body fat were cross-validated for this population. The study filled an existing gap&#xD;
      by improving existing instruments for the measurement of physical activity and dietary intake&#xD;
      in children and adolescents, and provided longitudinal data on change in these variables in&#xD;
      the same children over time, plus provided cross-sectional data for each age and gender group&#xD;
      to compare to the existing literature.&#xD;
