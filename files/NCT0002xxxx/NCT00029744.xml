  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of HVTN sites to recruit and retain&#xD;
      people at risk for HIV infection for possible future HIV vaccine research studies. This study&#xD;
      also aims to learn more about the risk behaviors of people at high risk for HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order for studies to be successful, study sites must be able to recruit, enroll, retain,&#xD;
      and inform groups at high risk for HIV infection. The plan for Phase III HIV vaccine trials&#xD;
      will depend on the number of participants enrolled, the rate at which participants become&#xD;
      HIV-infected, the length of follow-up, and the number of participants who continue and follow&#xD;
      through with the entire study. At existing sites, it is necessary to evaluate the potential&#xD;
      to recruit new groups. At possible expansion sites, work is necessary to establish effective&#xD;
      procedures to recruit and retain participants and to identify HIV incidence rates. This study&#xD;
      will accomplish those goals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct successful trials, the ability of study sites to recruit, enroll, retain, and&#xD;
      inform cohorts at risk for HIV infection is critical. Building a site's capacity for these&#xD;
      functions is an essential component of overall preparedness for HIV vaccine trials. The&#xD;
      design of Phase III HIV vaccine trials to be conducted in the HVTN will depend on the&#xD;
      interplay of 4 parameters: the number of participants enrolled, the HIV incidence rate among&#xD;
      enrollees, the duration of follow-up, and the number of participants retained in follow-up.&#xD;
      Dramatically different study designs may be required depending on these parameters, and&#xD;
      information must be obtained to characterize these parameters at HVTN sites. Based on&#xD;
      previous work, many of the HVTN research sites have established effective standard operating&#xD;
      procedures to recruit and retain high-risk populations in research studies and have&#xD;
      characterized HIV incidence rates in these populations. Work is now required to establish a&#xD;
      similar research infrastructure and knowledge base at potential expansion sites not&#xD;
      previously represented in HIV vaccine research networks and to assess the potential for&#xD;
      recruitment of new cohorts by existing HVTN sites. This HIV Vaccine Preparedness Study (VPS)&#xD;
      serves that purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study site targets 1 or more major risk groups (heterosexual men or women at high sexual&#xD;
      risk, men who have sex with men (MSM), or injection drug users (IDU)) for enrollment. Within&#xD;
      each group, 200 to 500 HIV-negative participants are enrolled. Potential study participants&#xD;
      undergo a screening interview to identify persons at high-risk for HIV infection. Those who&#xD;
      meet the study eligibility criteria (except for HIV testing), as well as any additional&#xD;
      site-specific criteria, complete a Behavioral Risk Assessment, receive HIV pre-test and risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling, and are tested for HIV antibody and syphilis. Women must provide a&#xD;
      urine sample for pregnancy testing. Participants who test HIV-negative and meet all other&#xD;
      eligibility criteria are enrolled in the study and maintained in follow-up over the next 12&#xD;
      months. Specifically, participants complete &quot;locator contacts&quot; at Months 3 and 9 and&#xD;
      follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12. The Months 3 and 9 locator contacts serve the purpose of&#xD;
      enhancing retention in the study by providing a mechanism to confirm or update participants'&#xD;
      locator information; confirm or reschedule their next follow-up visit; and reinforce&#xD;
      instructions to contact the study site to update locator information and/or, if needed,&#xD;
      request HIV counseling and/or testing between scheduled visits. The follow-up visits at&#xD;
      Months 6 and 12 will include assessments, counseling, and testing similar to those done at&#xD;
      the screening visit.&#xD;
