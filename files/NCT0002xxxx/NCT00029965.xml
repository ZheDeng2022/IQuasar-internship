      This study will evaluate children with glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage disorders to&#xD;
      investigate brain changes that cause nervous system degeneration. No experimental treatments&#xD;
      are offered in this study; participants will receive standard medical care for their disease.&#xD;
      The information from this study may help researchers develop new therapies for these&#xD;
      disorders and monitor the effects of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age with Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, or type 2&#xD;
      Gaucher disease may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 4 to 5 days every 6 months for a&#xD;
      clinical evaluation involving the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical, neurologic, and eye examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Developmental evaluations by a physical therapist, nutritionist and psychologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to check nutritional status, liver and kidney function, and, in patients&#xD;
           treated for seizures, level of anti-seizure drugs. Some blood will also be used for&#xD;
           research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis to check urine sugar levels and kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy to obtain cells to grow in culture. The biopsy area is numbed with an&#xD;
           anesthetic cream and a 1/8-inch piece of skin is removed with a circular punch and&#xD;
           scissors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic analysis of DNA to screen for mutations responsible for the patient s GSL&#xD;
           storage disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. Children with type 2 Gaucher disease,&#xD;
           Sandhoff disease and GM1 gangliosidosis will also have liver and spleen scans. Brain&#xD;
           scans will be done every 6 months the first year. After that, they may be done less&#xD;
           often, depending on the results. For the MRI, the child lies still in a narrow cylinder&#xD;
           (the scanner). A magnetic field and radio waves are used to produce pictures of the&#xD;
           organs under study. (Children will be sedated for MRI. Children who cannot be sedated&#xD;
           will not have this test.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure electrical activity of the brain and detect&#xD;
           possible seizures. For this test, electrodes (small metal discs attached to wires) are&#xD;
           attached to the child s head with a paste and the brain waves (electrical activity) are&#xD;
           recorded while the child rests quietly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) to measure hearing. Electrodes are attached to&#xD;
           the child s head (similar to the EEG procedure) and the brain waves are recorded when a&#xD;
           sound stimulation is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to study proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes&#xD;
           the brain and spinal cord. A needle is inserted in the space between the bones&#xD;
           (vertebrae) in the lower back. About 2 tablespoons of fluid is collected through the&#xD;
           needle. This test is done under anesthetic at the same time the MRI is done. If the&#xD;
           child cannot be sedated, a local anesthetic will be used.&#xD;

      The GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses are rare lysosomal storage disorders that primarily affect the&#xD;
      brain and are uniformly fatal. The glycoproteinoses sialidosis and galactosialidosis are&#xD;
      ultra-rare disorders involving predominantly the skeletal and central nervous systems that&#xD;
      are likewise fatal or severely debilitating. No effective therapy for patients with these&#xD;
      diseases has yet been demonstrated. Historically, since these disorders are fatal very little&#xD;
      natural history information or disease characterization using modern medical techniques has&#xD;
      been collected. This information is vital to establish the pattern of disease progression and&#xD;
      to identify clinical, biochemical and biophysical markers that can be used as endpoints in&#xD;
      future therapeutic trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to study the natural history of the GM1 and GM2 gangliosidoses, sialidosis&#xD;
      and galactosialidosis in affected individuals of all ages, races and genders using medical&#xD;
      technologies including MRI/MRS, hearing evaluation and auditory evoked response testing, EEG,&#xD;
      sleep study, EMG/NCV, echocardiogram and abdominal ultrasound as well as subspecialty&#xD;
      evaluations in rehabilitative medicine (including gait analysis), ophthalmology, speech&#xD;
      language pathology, neurology, and psychology. Biomarkers of disease progression may be&#xD;
      explored in CSF, blood, and urine samples for correlation with disease staging. Fibroblast&#xD;
      cultures will be established for testing potential therapeutic agents. Some fibroblast lines&#xD;
      will be used to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) for differentiation into neural&#xD;
      tissues, more relevant for the study of these disorders that primarily affect the central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS). We hypothesize that relevant biomarkers will correlate with disease&#xD;
      progression and will shed light on the pathophysiology of disease progression in these&#xD;
      devastating disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a means of acquiring additional information, subjects or their parents may also be asked&#xD;
      to complete a questionnaire regarding their medical and developmental history, initial&#xD;
      clinical presentation of the disease and steps toward diagnosis. At their request, the same&#xD;
      questionnaire may be sent to families who do not wish to undergo clinical evaluation at the&#xD;
      NIH, who are medically fragile and unable to travel, or whose affected member(s) are already&#xD;
      deceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that children with infantile GM2 gangliosidosis develop increasing macrocephaly as&#xD;
      part of their disease. No normal curves for head circumference vs. age currently exist for&#xD;
      this disorder. In an attempt to provide such curves to the clinical community parents may&#xD;
      also be asked to provide head circumference data on their children whether they are being&#xD;
      seen at NIH or whether a clinical questionnaire is being completed for children too medically&#xD;
      fragile to travel or already deceased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know that for infantile onset disease the storage of ganglioside in neurons begins during&#xD;
      the second trimester of pregnancy. In rare situations where carrier couples learned from&#xD;
      prenatal diagnosis that they were carrying a fetus with infantile disease and had decided to&#xD;
      terminate the pregnancy, we accepted samples of fetal tissue prior to June 5, 2019 for&#xD;
      analysis of biomarkers including gene expression analysis that may lend clues as to the&#xD;
      underlying pathogenesis of disease. This may lead to increased understanding of the early&#xD;
      events in disease pathogenesis and suggest possible therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that information obtained from the small population of patients with&#xD;
      glycosphingolipid and glycoprotein disorders evaluated in this study will have a broader&#xD;
      impact on patients with other neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders and perhaps more&#xD;
      common disorders of neurodegeneration.&#xD;
