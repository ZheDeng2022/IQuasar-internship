      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol acknowledges that it is in the interest of the NIH and ROB, as well as our&#xD;
           patients, to continue to follow those who have been treated with radiotherapy at ROB and&#xD;
           are not otherwise eligible for current active research protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It also provides a mechanism for the correlation and interpretation of disparate data&#xD;
           for research into the long term side effects and outcomes for a variety of disease&#xD;
           entities and treatments, such as combined modality treatment, MoAb, PDT, radiation&#xD;
           modifiers, intraoperative radiotherapy, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the late effects of treatment and the&#xD;
      natural history of disease through collection of data from any standard procedures performed&#xD;
      as part of follow up care on patients previously treated with radiotherapy in the Radiation&#xD;
      Oncology Branch (ROB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients who received radiation therapy at the NCI and are not entered on an interventional&#xD;
      research protocol at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a natural history protocol in which data will be collected from Radiation&#xD;
           Oncology Branch patients receiving standard of care long-term follow up care and&#xD;
           evaluation, including NIH consultation services as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It will be made clear to patients in the consent form, that data collected during their&#xD;
           follow-up may be used anonymously for publications concerning the natural history of&#xD;
           disease processes and long-term effects of treatment.&#xD;
