      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of obesity in children, adolescents, and adults has increased significantly&#xD;
      over the last two decades. Adolescents who are obese are at great risk for remaining obese&#xD;
      into adulthood. Given the difficulty of treating adult obesity, intervening with adolescents&#xD;
      before they reach adulthood is critical. Decreasing obesity during adolescence provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to prevent the continuance of pediatric onset obesity into adulthood. There are&#xD;
      well-established weight control interventions for children between 8 and 12 years of age.&#xD;
      However, treatment findings with overweight adolescents are not as robust and are difficult&#xD;
      to replicate. One potential limitation of existing weight control interventions for&#xD;
      adolescents is the minimal attention given to the peer group as an active component of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was in response to an initiative issued by the National Institute of Diabetes and&#xD;
      Digestive and Kidney Diseases and entitled &quot;Innovative Approaches to the Prevention of&#xD;
      Obesity&quot;. The resulting grant was later reassigned to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 119 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 years and between 20 and 80%&#xD;
      overweight were randomized to one of three treatment conditions: (1) cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      treatment (CBT); (2) cognitive-behavioral treatment with the addition of peer-based skills&#xD;
      training (CBT + PBST); or 3) standard care (SC). The cognitive-behavioral intervention&#xD;
      consisted of 16 weekly sessions followed by four monthly maintenance sessions. Adolescents&#xD;
      randomized to CBT + PBST received the cognitive-behavioral treatment as well as an intensive&#xD;
      32 session peer-based intervention. The peer-based intervention combined problem-solving&#xD;
      therapy with principles from Outward Bound to address self-reliance, social competence and&#xD;
      physical self-worth. One way analyses of variance was conducted at the end of treatment and&#xD;
      at 6-months after the end of treatment to compare the three groups on initial reduction in&#xD;
      percent overweight and maintenance of decreases in percent overweight at follow-up. Analysis&#xD;
      of variance was also used to compare the three groups on measures of social functioning,&#xD;
      self-esteem, physical activity level, and physical self-worth.&#xD;
