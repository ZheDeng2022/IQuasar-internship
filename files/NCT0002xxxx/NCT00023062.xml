      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to explore how the brain controls&#xD;
      movement by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles and what goes wrong with this&#xD;
      process in disease. Activity in the motor cortex-the outer part of the brain-will be examined&#xD;
      use TMS in patients with Parkinson's disease and in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease (stage I to III) 21 years of age and&#xD;
      older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, an&#xD;
      insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp and a brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
      through the coil. This creates a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain and generates very&#xD;
      small electrical currents in the cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells&#xD;
      in the stimulated area. This may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the face, jaw or limb.&#xD;
      During the stimulation, participants will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or&#xD;
      perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscle will be recorded on a&#xD;
      computer through electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the study will&#xD;
      last less than 3 hours. Participants will also fill out questionnaires about aspects of&#xD;
      personality and will be tested for their ability to perform certain cognitive (thinking) and&#xD;
      movement tasks. Patients with Parkinson's disease will, in addition, be administered the&#xD;
      Uniform Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale to measure disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be requested to stop all Parkinson's disease medications 12 hours before the&#xD;
      study. They may resume medications immediately after the study. Patients who so wish may be&#xD;
      admitted to the hospital the day or evening before the study while they are off medications&#xD;
      and stay there until they feel ready to leave.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) provides a measure of the balance of&#xD;
      inhibitory and facilitatory activity evokable in the motor cortex. Studies in several diverse&#xD;
      disorders of basal ganglia outflow and cortical regulation show an alteration in the&#xD;
      direction of decreased inhibition or increased facilitation. In general, these have been&#xD;
      quite small, data from different interstimulus intervals have been pooled for analysis, and,&#xD;
      therefore, disease and state-specific information may have been missed. A deeper&#xD;
      understanding of what this technique can tell us about pathological and normal cortical&#xD;
      regulation requires detailed studies within populations looking for correlations between&#xD;
      physiological and clinical/behavioral variables and large, uniform, head-to-head comparisons&#xD;
      between clinical populations. This proposal contains a project that combines the&#xD;
      correlational and comparative approaches in Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. Data&#xD;
      from this project will then be comparable to future similar studies in other disorders.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with established, dopa-responsive PD, Hoehn and Yahr stage I-III, age 21 and older&#xD;
        will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be recruited from the NINDS HMCS and ETB clinical programs and from the&#xD;
        community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy controls 21 and older will be recruited through the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer&#xD;
        Program and from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusionary criteria will be: any significant medical or psychiatric illness (other than&#xD;
        PD), pregnancy, history of epilepsy, concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants,&#xD;
        neuroleptic agents, or any other licit or illicit drugs that could lower the seizure&#xD;
        threshold or significantly affect cortical excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with surgically or traumatically implanted foreign bodies in the head (other than&#xD;
        dental appliances of fillings) that may pose a physical hazard during magnetic stimulation&#xD;
        will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with persistent &quot;resting&quot; tremor that precludes testing at rest may be excluded as&#xD;
        well as any patient to whom the screening physician makes a judgment that withdrawal of&#xD;
        medications poses a significant risk due to immobility or risk of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients on long-acting dopamine agonists will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage IV will also be excluded, since they are least likely to&#xD;
        tolerate medication withdrawal and are also unlikely to be able to maintain muscle&#xD;
        relaxation for TMS testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant medical or psychiatric illness (other than PD), pregnancy, history of&#xD;
        epilepsy, concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic agents, or any other&#xD;
        licit or illicit drugs that could lower the seizure threshold or significantly affect&#xD;
        cortical excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have surgically or traumatically implanted foreign bodies in the head (other than&#xD;
        dental appliances or fillings) that may pose a physical hazard during magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY CONTROLS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ages 21 and older will be recruited through the NIH Clinical Research Volunteer Program&#xD;
        (CRVP) and from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals will be processed through the CRVP before participating. Recruitment will&#xD;
        be focused on optimizing age, sex, educational, and racial matching with patient group.&#xD;
        Patients' spouses will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No significant medical or psychiatric illness (other than PD), pregnancy, history of&#xD;
        epilepsy, concurrent use of tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptic agents, or any other&#xD;
        licit or illicit drugs that could lower the seizure threshold or significantly affect&#xD;
        cortical excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Must not have surgically or traumatically implanted foreign bodies in the head (other than&#xD;
        dental appliances or fillings) that may pose a physical hazard during magnetic stimulation.&#xD;
