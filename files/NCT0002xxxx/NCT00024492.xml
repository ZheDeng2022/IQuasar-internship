  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposome entrapped mitoxantrone (LEM) is a mixture of commercially available mitoxantrone HCL&#xD;
      (Novantrone) and a combination of lyophilized lipids. Mitoxantrone, the active agent in the&#xD;
      investigational formulation, is a currently marketed chemotherapeutic agent. The rationale&#xD;
      for development of liposomal formulations is primarily that of improving the safety profile&#xD;
      of the drug, which may permit dose intensification and/or an increase in the cumulative dose&#xD;
      that may be administered, resulting in enhanced efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEM will be given to patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the dose of drug these&#xD;
      patients can tolerate. Patients will receive intravenous LEM every 21 days until the disease&#xD;
      progresses or toxicity occurs requiring treatment discontinuation. Anti-tumor effects of LEM&#xD;
      will be assessed and patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      LEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Measure the blood pharmacokinetics of LEM following IV administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Observe any anti-tumor effects of LEM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open-label study for patients with advanced and/or metastatic,&#xD;
      histologically-documented solid tumors considered to be unresponsive to available&#xD;
      conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEM will be administered IV over 45 minutes. At least three patients will be studied at each&#xD;
      dose level and at least three patients will complete one 21-day course before any patient is&#xD;
      enrolled at the next dose level. Study drug administration will continue on an every 3-week&#xD;
      schedule in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A subsequent course&#xD;
      of treatment may be administered at least 21 days after a prior LEM dose has been&#xD;
      administered when study criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level will be studied. This will be expanded to 6 if a DLT&#xD;
      occurs, followed by a total of 6 patients at a possible MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 21 to 30 patients will be entered into the study to&#xD;
      determine the MTD: 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if DLT occurs, followed by a total of 6&#xD;
      patients at a possible MTD. The dose level identified as the MTD may then be expanded up to&#xD;
      12 patients to permit additional safety assessment.&#xD;
