  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the production of proteins called chemokines in inflammatory skin&#xD;
      reactions. It is thought that chemokines attract or recruit white blood cells from the blood&#xD;
      stream into the skin when there is a skin injury or infection, causing inflammation. This&#xD;
      study will examine chemokine production in induced inflammatory reactions to try to gain a&#xD;
      better understanding of how white blood cells are attracted to inflamed areas of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 33 and 60 years old may be eligible for this study if they&#xD;
      1) have no history of chronic skin disease; 2) are not allergic to eggs; and 3) do not tend&#xD;
      to form large irregular scars after trauma to the skin from, for example, cuts, scratches and&#xD;
      surgical incisions. Candidates will be asked a short series of questions and have a limited&#xD;
      skin examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 10 ml (2 tablespoons) of blood drawn from an arm vein at the start and&#xD;
      end of the 5-day study and undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Day 1 - Participants receive an injection in the right upper arm of mumps antigen (a&#xD;
           protein commonly used to tests for immunization against mumps) and an injection of&#xD;
           &quot;vehicle&quot; (saline plus the preservatives thimerosal, glycine and formaldehyde) in the&#xD;
           left upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Day 3 - Participants who develop a swelling from the mumps antigen larger than 5 mm wide&#xD;
           will receive another injection of antigen in the right arm and another injection of&#xD;
           vehicle in the left arm. Those whose swelling is not greater than 5 mm will be excluded&#xD;
           from the study at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Day 5 - All four injection sites, plus another site on the left upper arm will be&#xD;
           biopsied. For this procedure the five injection areas are numbed with a local&#xD;
           anesthetic. A punch biopsy instrument that resembles a small cookie cutter (about&#xD;
           one-third the diameter of a dime) is inserted about one-fifth of an inch deep into the&#xD;
           skin and the tissue is removed. Two stitches are used to close the wound. Antibiotic and&#xD;
           bandages are applied for 5 days. Nine days after the biopsy the participant returns to&#xD;
           NIH for removal of the stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New molecular biology techniques will be used to measure changes in chemokine production in&#xD;
      the biopsied tissue.&#xD;

      In the skin, T lymphocytes are critical modulators and effectors of acquired defense&#xD;
      responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). T lymphocytes and other leukocytes are&#xD;
      recruited to the challenged site via the interaction of selectins, integrins, immunoglobulin&#xD;
      gene superfamily molecules with their ligands, and cytokines including the large and growing&#xD;
      chemokine group. Endogenous proinflammatory agents such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha&#xD;
      and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) modulate lymphocyte recruitment via up-regulation of endothelial&#xD;
      adhesion molecules and chemokines. In vitro evidence suggests that endothelial cell-derived&#xD;
      chemokines may play a crucial role in inducing firm arrest of leukocytes on endothelial cells&#xD;
      prior to transmigration. However, the investigation of the expression patterns and regulation&#xD;
      of chemokines in human skin has been limited. Our goal is to qualitatively and quantitatively&#xD;
      investigate changes in chemokine expression patterns in human skin using a DTH response to&#xD;
      mumps antigen as a model T cell mediated immunological response. We will study the effects of&#xD;
      intradermal injection of mumps antigen on cutaneous chemokine expression in healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers over a five-day period. Skin biopsies of treated and mock-treated areas will be&#xD;
      obtained and processed for state-of-the-art, real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA&#xD;
      for chemokines and related molecules of interest. Routine and immunohistological analysis of&#xD;
      chemokine receptor, chemokines, cytokines and other cell markers on fixed and frozen tissue&#xD;
      will also be performed in an attempt to correlate chemokine expression patterns with the&#xD;
      influx of leukocyte subsets into skin. Our hypothesis is that the chemokines will be&#xD;
      up-regulated, but that the kinetics and expression patterns of individual chemokines may not&#xD;
      be identical, thus possibly accounting for the differential recruitment of T lymphocytes and&#xD;
      other leukocytes during the course of the DTH response. Chemokine expression as determined by&#xD;
      quantitative RT-PCR will be compared with results obtained semi-quantitatively by&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining. This study may increase the understanding of the pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms of inflammatory diseases that are characterized by the recruitment of T&#xD;
      lymphocytes, thus possibly identifying targets for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases such as psoriasis.&#xD;
