      This study will compare the side effects of two laser treatments for diabetic macular edema,&#xD;
      a common condition in patients with diabetes. In macular edema, blood vessels in the retina-a&#xD;
      thin layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye-become leaky and the retina swells. The&#xD;
      macula-the center part of the retina that is responsible for fine vision-may also swell and&#xD;
      cause vision loss. Traditional laser treatment (argon blue or green or yellow) for macular&#xD;
      swelling, or edema, causes scarring that can expand and possibly lead to more loss of vision.&#xD;
      Studies with a different type of laser (diode) have shown no adverse effects to the retina,&#xD;
      but long-term effects of this treatment are not known. The results of this study on side&#xD;
      effects of the treatments will be used to design a larger study of effectiveness. This study&#xD;
      will also examine whether vitamin E can reduce the damage caused by laser treatment. Patients&#xD;
      with diabetic eye disease who take vitamin E have increased blood flow through the vessels of&#xD;
      the retina, as well as improved kidney function. Patients with elevated cholesterol levels&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in a cholesterol reduction part of the study to compare&#xD;
      normal-pace cholesterol reduction with accelerated reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and macular edema may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history - to review past medical conditions and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination - to measure vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature,&#xD;
           breathing rate) and examine the head and neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye examination - to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and examine pupils, lens,&#xD;
           retina, and eye movements. The pupils will be dilated with drops for this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests - to measure cholesterol and vitamin E blood levels, blood clotting time,&#xD;
           hemoglobin A1C (a measure of diabetes control), and to evaluate liver and kidney&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photography - to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur in&#xD;
           the future. Special photographs of the inside of the eye are taken using a camera that&#xD;
           flashes a bright light into the eye. From 2 to 20 pictures may be taken, depending on&#xD;
           the eye condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fluorescein angiography - to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected&#xD;
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina&#xD;
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if&#xD;
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel&#xD;
           abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two laser treatments. They will&#xD;
      also be randomly assigned to take 1600 IU of vitamin E or placebo (an inactive, look-alike&#xD;
      pill) daily. For the laser treatment, eye drops are put in the eye to numb the surface and a&#xD;
      contact lens is placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Several visits may be&#xD;
      required for additional laser treatments. The maximum number of treatments depends on how&#xD;
      well the treatment is working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On their first visit, patients will be given vitamin C. After taking the vitamin for 1 month,&#xD;
      they will return to the clinic for the first laser treatment. They will followed 1, 3, 6, 9,&#xD;
      and 12 months after the first treatment, and then every 6 months until either 1) the patient&#xD;
      returns for a 3-year visit; 2) the last enrolled patient returns for the 1-year visit, or the&#xD;
      patient requests to leave the study. During these visits, several of the exams described&#xD;
      above will be repeated to evaluate the response to treatment and check for side effects of&#xD;
      the vitamin E.&#xD;

      This randomized pilot study is an important first step in planning a large multi-center&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate medical and laser approaches that could improve the visual outcome&#xD;
      for patients with diabetic retinopathy. This study will provide preliminary safety data on&#xD;
      these therapies as well as allow for assessment of the performance of ocular outcomes and&#xD;
      study design for use in subsequent trials. If there are no safety concerns, the results of&#xD;
      this pilot will be helpful in the design of a large multicenter clinical trial by providing&#xD;
      data on estimates of expected treatment effects. A larger trial will proceed regardless of&#xD;
      whether or not this study identifies statistically significant main effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a partial factorial design, this study will compare (1) diode (micropulse) laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation to mild ETDRS style focal photocoagulation and, (2) treatment with Vitamin&#xD;
      E, a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib), or placebo prior to and following laser photocoagulation.&#xD;
      The primary safety outcome is a visual acuity drop of 15 letters or more from baseline one&#xD;
      year following initial laser treatment. The primary efficacy outcome will be reduction of the&#xD;
      retinal thickening defined as an improvement by at least two steps (on standard fundus&#xD;
      photos) combined with a 50% reduction in the area of fluorescein leakage one year after the&#xD;
      initial laser compared to baseline. A secondary outcome will be the change in macular height&#xD;
      as measured (OCT). These outcomes will be assessed for potential use in future trials.&#xD;
      Concerns regarding safety and efficacy follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the risk of visual loss in patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      potentially different across treatment groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Assessment of Potential Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there evidence that any treatment combinations could be effective in reducing retinal&#xD;
      thickening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there evidence that Vitamin E may affect the ability of either photocoagulation method to&#xD;
      reduce retinal thickening, or vice versa?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there evidence that celecoxib may inhibit retinal thickening?&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the estimated treatment effects on vision?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is the number of laser treatments required to achieve a reduction in retinal thickening&#xD;
      similar across treatment groups?&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tertiary objective of this study will be to examine the effects of dramatically reducing&#xD;
      low-density lipoproteins cholesterol in patients with diabetic macular edema and elevated&#xD;
      serum lipids. Change vision and retinal thickness will be compared across three groups; (1)&#xD;
      patients without elevated serum lipids at baseline, (2) patients with elevated lipids at&#xD;
      baseline and receive standard of care treatment, and (3) patients with elevated lipids at&#xD;
      baseline and are aggressively treated pharmacologically.&#xD;
