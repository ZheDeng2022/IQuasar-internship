    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of clozapine as a&#xD;
      treatment for the manic phase of bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant proportion of manic patients either do not respond adequately to conventional&#xD;
      treatment or cannot tolerate the adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses of these&#xD;
      agents. Clozapine may be a safe and effective treatment for mania. However, the efficacy of&#xD;
      clozapine as an alternative therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder mania has not&#xD;
      been extensively researched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 is a screening phase that will take&#xD;
      place for 2 to 7 days. Participants will undergo a baseline positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET) scan of the brain at the end of this period. In Phase 2, participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either clozapine or placebo (an inactive pill) for 3 weeks. They may also&#xD;
      receive lorazepam for the first 10 days of Phase 2. After 3 weeks, patients treated with&#xD;
      clozapine will undergo a second PET scan. During Phase 3, participants who received placebo&#xD;
      and did not improve will be offered clozapine for 3 weeks. Those who received clozapine and&#xD;
      did not improve will receive other treatment for 3 weeks. At the end of Phase 3, participants&#xD;
      who were treated with clozapine will have another PET scan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of manic patients either do not respond adequately to conventional&#xD;
      treatment (lithium, valproate or carbamazepine (with or without antipsychotic drugs), or&#xD;
      cannot tolerate the adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses of these agents. Thus,&#xD;
      a need exists for additional effective treatments. Preliminary studies by our group suggest&#xD;
      that clozapine may have antimanic actions and be effective in treatment-resistant bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. However, the efficacy of clozapine as an alternative therapy in treatment-resistant&#xD;
      mania has never been subjected to definitive study with an adequate number of subjects. Thus,&#xD;
      we propose to conduct the largest and only double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to date, of&#xD;
      clozapine, in bipolar manic patients who were unresponsive or intolerant to six weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and at least one antipsychotic drug. The&#xD;
      specific aims of this investigation are to 1) assess the acute treatment efficacy of&#xD;
      clozapine in treatment-resistant mania, 2) to investigate the functional anatomical&#xD;
      correlates of mania, and 3) to investigate the effects of clozapine treatment on cerebral&#xD;
      glucose metabolism and metabolic correlates of effective antimanic, clozapine treatment.&#xD;
      Forty-two subjects (two groups of 21 each) will be randomly assigned to treatment with&#xD;
      clozapine or placebo for three weeks. We anticipate that a maximum of 33% of patients will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the acute phase of the study due to reasons such as intolerable adverse&#xD;
      effects or withdrawal of consent. Thus, we expect the entered sample to yield 14 completed&#xD;
      subjects per cell. This sample size will allow for adequate statistical power to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses stated above. Patients, ages 18-65, with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder manic&#xD;
      or mixed (with or without psychotic features), will be randomized to double-blind treatment&#xD;
      to receive either clozapine (200-550 mg/day) or placebo, for a period of 3 weeks. Following&#xD;
      this acute period, the patients will receive either open-label clozapine or treatment as&#xD;
      clinically indicated. If clozapine is found effective in treatment-resistant mania, it would&#xD;
      be a significant step forward in the treatment of these patients and would have major health&#xD;
      implications. In addition, it would establish a gold standard against which newer treatments&#xD;
      can be compared to. Finally, glucose metabolism images will be obtained using PET and [F-18]&#xD;
      FDG at baseline and following 3 weeks of clozapine treatment to investigate the functional&#xD;
      anatomical correlates of mania and to compare drug-induced metabolic changes between&#xD;
      responders and nonresponders.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Males or females 18 to 65 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis: DSM-IV Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic or mixed with or without&#xD;
        psychotic features as determined by SCID-P. This criteria includes the following diagnoses:&#xD;
        296.4X, Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, and 296.6X, Bipolar I Disorder, Most&#xD;
        Recent Episode Mixed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        YMRS greater than or equal to 20 at Visits 1 and 2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        No decrease in total score of YMRS of greater than or equal to 20% during washout (between&#xD;
        Visits 1 and 2);&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meet criteria for treatment resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have experienced at least two manic or mixed episodes within five years prior&#xD;
        to study entry; DSM-IV rapid cyclers will be permitted to participate in this study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all the tests&#xD;
        required by the protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent&#xD;
        document. Before participating in this study, we will advise all patients to complete a NIH&#xD;
        Advance Directive Form. However, completing a NIH Advanced Directive form is not a&#xD;
        requirement for participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous lack of response (during a manic episode) to any two of the following antimanic&#xD;

        atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole,&#xD;
        quetiapine). If the subject has only taking one of these antimanic treatments, then the&#xD;
        research physician may start one of them at NIH. Subjects not responding to a 3 week trial&#xD;
        of an antimanic agent of their choice (at least a 50% decrease on the YMRS rating scale&#xD;
        form baseline) will be eligible to be randomized if they continue to meet study criteria.&#xD;
