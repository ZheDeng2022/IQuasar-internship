      The purpose of this study is to find substances in the blood and urine that indicate that a&#xD;
      person has kidney damage. It will identify proteins found only in patients with acute kidney&#xD;
      failure but not in normal healthy people or in patients with volume depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults and children who are at least 3 years old who fall into one of the following four&#xD;
      categories may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are healthy and have normal kidney function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have volume depletion (this condition differs from acute kidney failure in that it is&#xD;
           easily treated with fluids)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are at high risk of kidney failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Have acute kidney failure (kidney shutdown)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will have a history and physical examination. Up to four blood samples&#xD;
      of 3 tablespoons each will be taken for laboratory analysis. Urine will be collected for&#xD;
      analysis and to measure urine output. The participants length of stay in the study varies.&#xD;
      People with normal kidney function will be in the study for 1 day and patients with volume&#xD;
      depletion will be studied 3 days. The length of hospitalization of patients at high risk of&#xD;
      kidney failure or in acute kidney failure will depend on the patient s condition and&#xD;
      medication requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study may lead to the development of earlier and more accurate methods&#xD;
      for diagnosing acute kidney failure. With earlier detection, treatment could be started&#xD;
      earlier, possibly preventing further damage and helping recovery of injury that has already&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality of acute renal failure (ARF) remains high despite advances in supportive care.&#xD;
      There are no established effective drug therapies, and dialysis may promote renal injury via&#xD;
      hypotension or neutrophil activation. Many agents [e.g., mannitol, furosemide, dopamine,&#xD;
      Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), thyroid hormone, etc.]&#xD;
      are effective in animal models but ineffective in treating or preventing human ARF. The&#xD;
      failure of these agents in human ARF may be due to late enrollment into the trial; effective&#xD;
      therapy will likely require earlier detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this clinical study is to identify new biomarkers of renal injury,&#xD;
      progression or recovery by analyzing urinary proteins during ARF. We will enroll patients&#xD;
      with ARF, patients at high risk of ARF, patients with volume depletion, patients with urinary&#xD;
      tract infection, patients with chronic kidney disease, and normal subjects. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      pre-renal versus renal ARF will be made by routine clinical and laboratory testing. The level&#xD;
      of renal dysfunction will be determined by creatinine clearance. Those patients at high risk&#xD;
      for ARF will be followed prospectively and will undergo additional testing if ARF does&#xD;
      develop. Patients will also be studied after creatinine levels return to normal. We will&#xD;
      identify protein and/or microRNA biomarkers that are unique to patients with ARF,but not&#xD;
      found in normal subjects or patients with volume depletion. It is hoped that some of these&#xD;
      proteins may form the basis of new diagnostic tests for ARF.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Subjects &gt;= 3 years old. Both male and female subjects will be recruited without&#xD;

               2. Either:&#xD;

                    1. Normal (creatinine level &lt; 1.3 mg/dl for adults; creatinine level &lt; standard&#xD;
                       nomogram for children), OR&#xD;
