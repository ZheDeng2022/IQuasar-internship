  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the PMPA gel, which kills microbes, in HIV-infected&#xD;
      and HIV-uninfected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of new HIV infections occur through heterosexual contact. A product that stops&#xD;
      or slows the replication of HIV during sexual contact is needed. At present, there are no&#xD;
      products that are completely effective. PMPA gel, also known as tenofovir, is an anti-microbe&#xD;
      agent that may fight against sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted&#xD;
      diseases (STDs). It is applied to the vagina and gives women the ability to control their&#xD;
      disease-prevention activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of new HIV infections are transmitted through heterosexual contact. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no single product that is completely efficacious in preventing initial HIV infection&#xD;
      through vaginal transmission. Thus, the development of a topical product which could block&#xD;
      local virus replication once infection has occurred is needed. Topical microbicides are&#xD;
      designed to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV and other disease pathogens. Potentially,&#xD;
      they can be applied vaginally to prevent both male-to-female and female-to-male transmission.&#xD;
      They also offer a female-controlled option. PMPA gel has shown some activity against HIV and&#xD;
      STD pathogens in in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo eligibility screening tests which include: a general physical exam; a&#xD;
      pelvic exam; a urine pregnancy test; urinalysis; HIV and STD testing and counseling; and&#xD;
      hematology, liver, and renal function tests. For HIV-infected participants, a CD4 cell count&#xD;
      is performed and specimens are collected for quantitation of HIV viral load in plasma and&#xD;
      cervico-vaginal fluids. [AS PER AMENDMENT 05/29/02: and for HIV resistance genotyping.] PMPA&#xD;
      gel is evaluated among 4 types of women distributed into 7 cohorts. All participants apply&#xD;
      PMPA gel intravaginally for 14 consecutive intramenstrual days. The dose and frequency of&#xD;
      application is escalated across &quot;cohorts.&quot; Cohorts A1 through A4 consist of HIV-uninfected,&#xD;
      abstinent women who use different doses of PMPA gel once or twice daily. Cohort B includes&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected women who are sexually active. Cohorts C and D consist of HIV-infected women&#xD;
      who are abstinent or sexually active, respectively. Cohorts B, C, and D use the highest&#xD;
      practical dose frequency. The male partners of sexually active participants undergo HIV and&#xD;
      STD testing and counseling as well as an optional genital exam and a post-regimen interview.&#xD;
      Participants keep a daily record of when doses are taken and of any adverse effects. Pelvic&#xD;
      exams, and hematology, liver, and renal function tests (and CD4 cell counts [AS PER AMENDMENT&#xD;
      05/29/02: and resistance genotyping] in HIV-infected participants) are performed at follow-up&#xD;
      visits. After the regimen is complete, participants participate in group interviews to&#xD;
      discuss adverse effects, adherence to, and general perception of PMPA gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 6 participants in Cohorts A2, B, and C take part in a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of&#xD;
      PMPA gel. Serum collection and PK analysis are performed at different time intervals during 2&#xD;
      study visits.&#xD;
