      This study will collect data on the incidence (rate of occurrence) of fungal infections in&#xD;
      recipients of bone marrow, stem cell or organ transplants. The data will provide information&#xD;
      needed to develop strategies for prevention and early treatment of fungal infections in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient receiving bone marrow transplantation, peripheral stem cell transplantation or&#xD;
      solid organ transplantation is eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will be conducted over a 3-year period at about 20 collaborating transplant&#xD;
      centers. Through the annual accrual of more than 9,000 patients, it is estimated that at&#xD;
      least 5 to 8 percent per year will have documented or suspected invasive fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three phases as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 1 A 6-month &quot;start-up&quot; phase during which sites will initiate screening and begin&#xD;
           collecting data on incident cases of invasive fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2 A 2-year phase in which all sites will conduct surveillance and collect data and&#xD;
           specimens in a standardized fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 3 A 6-month &quot;wrap-up&quot; phase during which active surveillance for invasive fungal&#xD;
           infections will be conducted only among patients who were transplanted before the&#xD;
           beginning of this phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient care will be provided through the patient s primary protocol and standard of care.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive fungal infections have emerged as important causes of morbidity and mortality among&#xD;
      recipients of bone marrow, stem cell, and solid organ transplantation (SOT), as well as&#xD;
      patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for treatment of hematological malignancies,&#xD;
      patients with aplastic anemia, and patients with inherited immunodeficiencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has been formerly conducted through a surveillance network of BMT/SCT and SOT&#xD;
      centers through collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control for the surveillance of&#xD;
      invasive fungal infections in recipients of bone marrow, stem cell transplantation, and solid&#xD;
      organ transplantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three phases of this study will have been conducted over a six-year period at&#xD;
      approximately 23 collaborating transplant centers and completed enrollment of multi-center&#xD;
      cases of March 31, 2006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of a fourth phase allows the study of cases of invasive fungal infections to&#xD;
      continue by extending the protocol for four years at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that at least 5-8% of immunocompromised patients will be accrued annually&#xD;
      with documented or suspected invasive fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to conduct multi-institutional surveillance for invasive&#xD;
      fungal infections in recipients of bone marrow, stem cell transplantation, and solid organ&#xD;
      transplantations, as well as in immunocompromised patients within the Clinical Center patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain a multi-institute surveillance network to evaluate new approaches to the&#xD;
      prevention and diagnosis of invasive fungal infections through the analysis of immune&#xD;
      function, to include antigen detection, within the population of patients who develop&#xD;
      invasive fungal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient within the NIH Clinical Center receiving a bone marrow transplantation,&#xD;
      peripheral stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplantation, or any patient with an&#xD;
      inherited immunodeficiency, aplastic anemia or oncologic diagnosis meeting EORTC/MSG criteria&#xD;
      for an invasive infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective surveillance study of invasive fungal infections in the&#xD;
      immunocompromised host population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incident case will be defined as any transplant recipient, or an immunocompromised patient&#xD;
      (i.e., having inherited immunodeficiencies, aplastic anemia or general oncology) with proven&#xD;
      or probable invasive fungal infection meeting the criteria for IFI as described by the&#xD;
      MSG/EORTC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive microbiological evidence will prompt acquisition of discarded serum and blood from&#xD;
      the Department of Laboratory Medicine for analysis of immune function, to include antigen&#xD;
      detection, to evaluate new approaches to the prevention and diagnosis of invasive fungal&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
