      This is an in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) study of regional cerebral dopamine and&#xD;
      blood flow in normal volunteers, persons with Parkinson s disease (both familial and&#xD;
      sporadic), and those with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. The latter also sign consent for&#xD;
      NIH approved protocol 89-M-0160, &quot;Inpatient Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Patients,&quot; PI:&#xD;
      Daniel Eisenberg, M.D. Using PET with 6-[F-18] Fluoro-L-dopa (FDOPA) and (15)0-H2O in a&#xD;
      single scan session, both presynaptic dopaminergic function and regional cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      (rCBF) are assessed. The kinetic rate constant (Ki) for presynaptic dopaminergic uptake in&#xD;
      striatum and other regions is calculated. We compare Ki across subject groups and relate the&#xD;
      findings to rCBF. Findings are also related to allelic variation in genes of interest, for&#xD;
      determination of which participants sign separate consent for NIH approved protocol 95-M-0150&#xD;
      Neurobiological Investigation of Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders and Their&#xD;
      Siblings, PI: Karen F. Berman, MD. We also draw comparisons between subjects with inherited&#xD;
      vs. sporadic Parkinson s disease to determine whether the PET phenotype is the same in both&#xD;
      groups, and we compare system-level, circuit-based pathophysiology across PD and&#xD;
      schizophrenia groups. Each subject is further screened with an MRI to rule out structural&#xD;
      abnormalities and also to further delineate areas of interest in the PET scans.&#xD;
