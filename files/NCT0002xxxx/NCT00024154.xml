  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with gefitinib works in&#xD;
      treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab can&#xD;
      locate breast cancer cells that have HER2 on their surface and either kill them or deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Biological therapies such as&#xD;
      gefitinib may also interfere with the growth of tumor cells and may enhance the effects of&#xD;
      trastuzumab. Combining trastuzumab with gefitinib may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancers with high amounts of HER2&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the response rate, duration of response, and time to progression in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2-neu treated with trastuzumab&#xD;
      (Herceptin) and gefitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the phase II dose of gefitinib when given in combination with trastuzumab in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the 3- and&#xD;
      6-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Correlate response rates with plasma levels of circulating HER2 and tumor levels of&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor, activated HER2, and HER2 receptors, as measured by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), in patients treated&#xD;
      with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of gefitinib. The phase I portion of&#xD;
      this study was open in only 5 ECOG institutions. The phase I portion has been completed, and&#xD;
      the study is being opened in all ECOG-affiliated institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (completed): Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes once&#xD;
      weekly and oral gefitinib once daily beginning on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2&#xD;
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is established, additional&#xD;
      patients are accrued to the phase II portion of the study and are treated at that dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily (at the MTD established in phase I) and&#xD;
      trastuzumab IV weekly until week 24, at which time trastuzumab is given every 3 weeks (with&#xD;
      daily gefitinib) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until 2 years from&#xD;
      study entry.&#xD;
