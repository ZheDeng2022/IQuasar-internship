  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of a drug called Cystagon in treating infantile&#xD;
      neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL), a progressive neurological disease affecting children.&#xD;
      At around 11 to 13 months of age, patients develop slowed head growth, mild brain atrophy&#xD;
      (wasting), electroencephalographic (EEG) changes and retinal deterioration, with symptoms&#xD;
      worsening over time. The disease results from an enzyme deficiency that causes fatty&#xD;
      compounds called ceroid to accumulate in cells. In laboratory experiments, Cystagon has&#xD;
      helped remove ceroid from cells of patients with INCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with INCL between 6 months and 3 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants take Cystagon daily by mouth every 6 hours. They are admitted to the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center for a 4- to 5-day period every 6 months for the following tests and&#xD;
      evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medical history, including a detailed record of seizures, physical&#xD;
           examination, blood tests and clinical photographs. For the initial baseline studies,&#xD;
           examinations may also be scheduled with pediatric neurology, ophthalmology and&#xD;
           anesthesia services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain MRI uses a powerful magnet, radio waves,&#xD;
           and computers to provide detailed images of the brain without the use of X-rays. The&#xD;
           patient lies on a table that slides inside a donut-shaped machine containing a magnetic&#xD;
           field. The child requires general anesthesia for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinogram (ERG) measures the function of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue&#xD;
           in the back of the eye. To record the flash ERG, a special contact lens is placed on the&#xD;
           eye s surface and the eye is stimulated with flashes of light. Infants and very young&#xD;
           children require general anesthesia for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual evoked potential (VEP) measures the function of the visual pathway from the eye&#xD;
           to the brain. To record the VEP, five electrodes are placed on the scalp and the eye is&#xD;
           stimulated with flashes of light. Infants and very young children must be anesthetized&#xD;
           for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain electrical activity, using electrodes placed&#xD;
           on the scalp. The test is useful in defining seizures. The child may need to be sedated&#xD;
           to keep still during the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin biopsy A small piece of skin is removed (usually from the upper arm or shoulder)&#xD;
           under local anesthetic to grow cells in the laboratory. This procedure is done at the&#xD;
           start of the study and is repeated after 1 year if therapy results are promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children s condition may improve, stabilize or worsen during this study. Life may be&#xD;
      prolonged without significant improvement in quality. The information gained from the study&#xD;
      may help scientists develop more potent drugs to treat INCL.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly known as Batten disease, represent a group of&#xD;
      the most common (1 in 12,500) heritable neurodegenerative storage disorders of childhood.&#xD;
      Mutations of at least 8 different genes are responsible for various forms of NCL. The&#xD;
      infantile form of NCL or INCL is the most severe disease. It is caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) gene. PPT1 is a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves&#xD;
      thioester linkages in S-acylated proteins and its deficiency leads to abnormal lysosomal&#xD;
      accumulation of fattyacylated- proteins (ceroids) leading to INCL pathogenesis. Since&#xD;
      thioester linkages are labile, drugs with nucleophilic property are likely to mimic PPT1 and&#xD;
      may have therapeutic potential for INCL. We previously reported that cysteamine,&#xD;
      phosphocysteamine, cysteamine bitartrate (cystagon) and N-acetylcysteine disrupt thioester&#xD;
      linkages in a model PPT1-substrate, C(14) palmitoyl-CoA, releasing C(14) palmitic acid. The&#xD;
      results of our laboratory studies have shown that cysteamine mediates the depletion of&#xD;
      intracellular ceroid deposits and prevents their reaccumulation. For the last 9 years, we&#xD;
      have been conducting a clinical trial to determine whether a combination of Cystagon&#xD;
      (Cysteamine bitartrate) and N-acetylcysteine (mucomyst) is beneficial for INCL patients. In&#xD;
      parallel with these studies, using an animal model of INCL we found that this combination&#xD;
      therapy reduces oxidative stress caused by high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in&#xD;
      the brain of mice lacking the PPT1 enzyme. To date, we have admitted a total of 10 patients&#xD;
      (5 females and 5 males) to this protocol; however, one male patient was lost to follow-up.&#xD;
      Thus, we have treated 9 patients (5 females and 4 males) and these patients showed no adverse&#xD;
      reactions to these drugs except for one patient who initially had mild gastrointestinal&#xD;
      discomfort which went away when cystagon was stopped and restarted from the lowest dose and&#xD;
      this mild adverse effect did not recur. Compared with the published natural history of INCL,&#xD;
      our preliminary results show that although several parameters of disease progression are&#xD;
      slowed due to the treatment it does not completely arrest the neurodegenerative process. We&#xD;
      are currently analyzing all the data gathered so far and a manuscript describing the results&#xD;
      will be prepared for submission to a peer-reviewed journal.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Only patients between 6 months and 3 years of age will be admitted in this study. Parents&#xD;
        or caregivers of patients recruited to the study will be provided with a copy of the&#xD;
        protocol and the consent form to review prior to their coming to the NIH. They will be&#xD;
        encouraged to call either Dr. Levin or Dr. Mukherjee to discuss any questions they may have&#xD;
        concerning the protocol prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The proposed age range (6 mo to 3 yrs) was chosen because these children are expected to&#xD;
        have a mild to moderate neurological deficiency but are well enough to be cared for at home&#xD;
        by the family. Therefore, these patients should not require extensive medical or nursing&#xD;
        care during their stay at the Clinical Center. Moreover, the patients are locally cared for&#xD;
        by neurologists and pediatricians on a regular basis, and such care will continue when the&#xD;
        patients return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The rigid age exclusion criteria will be used because the majority of INCL patients have&#xD;
        more frequent seizures, complete retinal blindness and significant cerebral atrophy beyond&#xD;
        3 years of age. Dr. Santavuori (one of our consultants who is now deceased), who had the&#xD;
        most extensive experience with these patients, believed that the neurological degeneration&#xD;
        after age 2 might not be reversible. While Dr. Santavuori s speculation is well taken, we&#xD;
        feel that since to date there has not been any effective treatment to slow the progression&#xD;
        of neuronal death in INCL, and since our preliminary results show that Cystagon slows the&#xD;
        progression of neurodegeneration, we feel that a combination of Cystagon plus N-Ac with its&#xD;
        anti-apoptotic and neuro-protective effects may show some added benefits over Cystagon&#xD;
        therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In our initial protocol we restricted the admission of patients that carried two lethal&#xD;
        mutations in the PPT1 gene. The purpose of including only those patients who carry specific&#xD;
        PPT1 mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
        (L10X, R151X, R164X, W296X, R122W, c.169insA and E184K) was to establish that the&#xD;
        beneficial effects of the combination therapy because a patients who had any two of these&#xD;
        mutations manifested the most severe disease phenotype. Because of the uniform&#xD;
        manifestation of the disease it was easier to determine any beneficial effects of the&#xD;
        combination drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subsequently, our protocol was approved for treatment of INCL patients with any two&#xD;
        mutations in the PPT1 gene. Our protocol has been previously amended to include all INCL&#xD;
        patients regardless of the PPT1 mutations they carry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with intractable seizures that cannot be controlled by two or fewer antiepileptic&#xD;
        medications will not be accepted for this study. Patients who cannot take nourishment&#xD;
        orally or who are in a vegetative state will not be enrolled in this study even if the 6&#xD;
        months to 3 year age criterion is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both male and female patients are eligible for enrollment in this study.&#xD;
