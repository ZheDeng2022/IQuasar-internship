    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thalidomide may stop the growth of&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the response rate and time-to-progression (TTP) in previously treated patients&#xD;
      with low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effect of thalidomide on microvascular density in the bone marrow of&#xD;
      patients with low grade cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effects of thalidomide on bFGF levels in serum and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically documented non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; core biopsies are acceptable if they&#xD;
             contain adequate tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping; bone marrow&#xD;
             biopsies as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable for follicular lymphomas;&#xD;
             patients with NHL must have one of the following World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
             histologic subtypes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Follicular, grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Follicular, grade 2&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Follicular, grade 3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Patients diagnosed more than one year prior to entry on protocol must have&#xD;
                  a repeat lymph node biopsy; in the event of rapid tumor growth, rising LDH, or&#xD;
                  the onset of B symptoms in a period of time less than one year a rebiopsy is also&#xD;
                  required; patients are ineligible for this study if a separate lymph node biopsy&#xD;
                  shows a lymphoma with a higher grade; failure to submit pathology slides within&#xD;
                  60 days of patient registration will result in patient being declared ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known lymphomatous involvement of the CNS including either parenchymal or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal involvement (lumbar puncture prior to study is not required in the&#xD;
             absence of neurologic symptoms) or any seizure disorders or prior brain injury which&#xD;
             could precipitate seizures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies;&#xD;
             evaluable disease alone is not acceptable; any tumor mass reproducibly measurable in&#xD;
             two perpendicular diameters and &gt; 1x1 cm by physical examination, X-ray, computerized&#xD;
             tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acceptable; whenever CT is&#xD;
             specified, it should be understood that MRI may be substituted as long as the&#xD;
             measurements for tumor response are made on two successive studies employing the same&#xD;
             procedure; the following lesions are not considered measurable:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Barium studies&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ascites or pleural effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bony disease (lesions if present should be noted)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bone marrow&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and no more&#xD;
             than 2 prior antibody treatments; patients who have failed to respond to 3 regimens of&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy (i.e., refractory to 3 regimens) are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NCI CTC performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing women are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to abstain from all intercourse or use two methods&#xD;
             of birth control for 28 days prior to treatment and while under treatment with&#xD;
             thalidomide and for four weeks after completing therapy; one of the methods of birth&#xD;
             control must be highly active (IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy)&#xD;
             and used concomitantly with one additional method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm or&#xD;
             cervical cap); these precautions are required even in patients with a history of&#xD;
             infertility unless due to hysterectomy or because the patient has been post menopausal&#xD;
             or has had no menses for at least 24 consecutive months; in addition, women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have serum B-HCG performed prior to treatment, weekly for&#xD;
             the first 4 weeks of treatment and then every four weeks if menses are regular and&#xD;
             every two weeks if menses are irregular; men must agree to abstain from unprotected&#xD;
             sexual intercourse; male patients should request that female partners use a second&#xD;
             method of birth control in addition to the male barrier method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known HIV disease; patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other&#xD;
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for&#xD;
             exposure to the HIV virus; because peripheral neuropathies are a common toxicity of&#xD;
             antiviral therapy and of viral infection in HIV patients, as well as a common&#xD;
             significant toxicity with thalidomide, patients who test positive or who are known to&#xD;
             be infected are not eligible; an HIV test is not required for entry on protocol, but&#xD;
             is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring the use of bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid) are not&#xD;
             eligible; patients who receive thalidomide in combination with zoledronic acid are&#xD;
             potentially at increased risk of renal dysfunction; patients enrolled on study prior&#xD;
             to 15 September 2003 who are receiving bisphosphonates may continue to receive&#xD;
             thalidomide and bisphosphonate but must have serum creatinine monitored prior to each&#xD;
             bisphonate infusion; in addition, please inform these patients of the potential for&#xD;
             renal dysfunction with this combination; this discussion must be documented in the&#xD;
             patient record&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ANC â¥ 750/Î¼L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Î²HCG negative (in female patients unless S/P hysterectomy or menopausal or no menses&#xD;
             for 24 consecutive months); assay must have a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine â¤ 2 x normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bilirubin â¤ within institutional normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST and ALT â¤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
