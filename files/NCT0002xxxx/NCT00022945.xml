      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by&#xD;
      CHOP and to see what effects it has on patients with previously untreated mantel cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is to determine the duration of response of the&#xD;
      sequential administration of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP for&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated MCL. The secondary efficacy endpoints for this study are&#xD;
      to determine the response rate, confirmed response rate, complete response rate, confirmed&#xD;
      complete response rate, duration of response for confirmed responders, duration of response&#xD;
      for complete responders, duration of response for confirmed complete responders,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and the predictive value of detection&#xD;
      of minimal residual disease by molecular techniques on response duration. The pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      endpoint is to determine the total body residence time of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody&#xD;
      following the dosimetric dose. The safety endpoints are to determine the incidence of adverse&#xD;
      experiences, hematologic toxicity, (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time to recovery), use of&#xD;
      supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine antibody (HAMA)&#xD;
      positivity, the effects of Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody on the growth and function of&#xD;
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, and survival of patients with previously untreated MCL&#xD;
      treated with Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody followed by six cycles of CHOP.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a confirmed initial diagnosis of mantle cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma&#xD;
             by histology according to the WHO classification .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have Ann Arbor bulky stage II, stage III, or stage IV disease at&#xD;
             diagnosis. Bulky stage II disease is defined as a mediastinal mass greater than&#xD;
             one-third of the maximum chest diameter, or any other mass greater than or equal to 10&#xD;
             cm in maximum diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have less than an average of 25% of the intratrabecular marrow space&#xD;
             involved by NHL in bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens as assessed microscopically&#xD;
             at study entry. A unilateral bone marrow biopsy demonstrating &lt;10% involvement with&#xD;
             NHL is also adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have evidence that their tumor tissue expresses the CD20 antigen.&#xD;
             Immunoperoxidase stains of paraffin-embedded tissue showing positive reactivity with&#xD;
             L26 antibody or immunoperoxidase stains of frozen tissue showing positive reactivity&#xD;
             with Anti-B1 Antibody (Coulter Clone) or similar commercially available CD20 antibody&#xD;
             or evidence of CD20 positivity by flow cytometry are acceptable evidence of CD20&#xD;
             positivity. This must be performed within 42 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status of at least 60% on the Karnofsky Performance&#xD;
             Scale and an anticipated survival of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an ANC greater than or equal to 1500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 100,000 cells/mm3 within 14 days of study enrollment. These&#xD;
             blood counts must be sustained without support of hematopoietic cytokines or&#xD;
             transfusion of blood products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal) and hepatic function (defined as total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal and AST &lt;5 times the upper limit of normal) within 14 days of&#xD;
             study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease. At least one lesion must be&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 2.0 x 2.0 cm by computerized tomography scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 50% by ventriculography or echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy, steroids, or&#xD;
             radiation therapy as treatment for their MCL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active obstructive hydronephrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious illness that would preclude evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin&#xD;
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease free for 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are HAMA positive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Males and females must agree to use a&#xD;
             contraceptive method while on study and for 6 months after receiving Iodine-131&#xD;
             Anti-B1 Antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active infection requiring IV anti-infectives at the time of study&#xD;
