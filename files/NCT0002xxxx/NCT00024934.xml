  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of BlyS, an experimental drug being developed to treat&#xD;
      immune deficiency. As of July 17, 2001, 7 persons with common variable immune deficiency&#xD;
      (CVID) have received BlyS, with no problems reported. This study will test the safety of the&#xD;
      drug in people with IgA deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with IgA deficiency who have recurrent or chronic sinus or&#xD;
      lung infections or chronic diarrhea or malabsorption may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests,&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray and a breathing test (spirometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into five groups of three persons each to receive different&#xD;
      doses (0.1, 1, 5, 15 or 45 micrograms/kilogram of body weight) of BlyS. The first group will&#xD;
      receive a single dose at the lowest dose level (0.l mg). Each succeeding group will receive a&#xD;
      single higher dose following a 2-week observation period of the preceding group. The drug&#xD;
      will be injected under the skin, with vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure and&#xD;
      breathing rate) monitored for one hour after dosing. Blood samples will be collected several&#xD;
      times on the day of dosing (before the dose and at 1.5, 3, 5, 8 and 12 hours after the dose)&#xD;
      and again at 1,2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the dose to measure BlyS levels and evaluate&#xD;
      safety. Participants receiving one of the three higher doses will have additional blood&#xD;
      samples collected 36, 48 and 60 hours after the dose. Blood will also be collected from all&#xD;
      participants 6 and 12 months after dosing to look for any unexpected long-term effects. A&#xD;
      total of 289 ml (1.2 cups) of blood will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood will be checked for changes in blood count, kidney and liver function, antibody levels&#xD;
      and autoimmune problems. Saliva will be collected four times by placing a cotton ball in the&#xD;
      mouth-once before the dose and three times after the dose-to measure antibody levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine samples will also be collected during the study.&#xD;

      B Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS (Trademark)) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#xD;
      superfamily of cytokines that is expressed on peripheral blood monocytes and dendritic cells.&#xD;
      Cellular receptors for BLyS are detected on mature immunoglobulin (Ig) expressing&#xD;
      B-lymphocytes. In vitro studies show that BLyS increases B cell number, Ig production,&#xD;
      antigen-specific immunoglobulin response, and induces production of secretory IgA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cells collected from patients with Common Variable Immune Deficiency show evidence for BLyS&#xD;
      binding to B cells and enhanced immunoglobulin secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 28-day toxicology studies in mice, pharmacological effects were restricted to B lymphoid&#xD;
      tissues including B lymphocyte hyperplasia, increased splenic weight without significant&#xD;
      increase in spleen size, and increased immunoglobulin production. Murine models suggest that&#xD;
      all of the pharmacological effects are fully and rapidly reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological profile of BLyS suggests that it may have therapeutic utility in the treatment&#xD;
      of immunodeficiency disorders characterized by low or absent immunoglobulin such as selective&#xD;
      IgA deficiency (IGA-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk that BLyS might contribute to IGA-D complications has been assessed. A series of special&#xD;
      in vitro and short-term in vivo studies have shown BLyS does not enhance tumorigenicity or&#xD;
      allergy/hypersensitivity. Enhanced autoimmunity with immune complex formation could not be&#xD;
      ruled out in two mouse studies in which BLyS was administered at higher doses on multiple&#xD;
      dosing schedules. Renal changes with glomerular protein deposits were noted in a subset of&#xD;
      mice treated at 0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg in the first study and 0.3 and 3.0 mg/kg in the second&#xD;
      study. Renal changes have not been reproducible in either of 2 repeat mouse studies designed&#xD;
      to replicate conditions on the first study. Renal changes were not observed in the GLP&#xD;
      toxicity study in which mice were treated for 4 weeks with BLyS followed by a 2-week recovery&#xD;
      period, or in an exploratory monkey study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a phase I; single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalation study of&#xD;
      BLyS administered subcutaneously to a total of 20 evaluable subjects with IgA-D. Each subject&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of BLyS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study consists of a screening phase, a 1-day treatment phase with&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic sampling, day 2 and day 3 follow-up, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12-week acute safety&#xD;
      evaluations. Dose escalation to the next cohort is dependent on results of the 2-week acute&#xD;
      safety evaluation. Autoimmunity and interim infection history will be evaluated 4-6 weeks and&#xD;
      6 and 12 months. Long-term data will be collected on incidence of malignancy for a minimum of&#xD;
      one year.&#xD;
