      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug pamidronate can safely and&#xD;
      effectively improve bone mineral density in growing children who have bone disease caused by&#xD;
      taking steroid medications. People who take steroid medications called glucocorticoids, like&#xD;
      prednisone or dexamethasone, for long periods almost always have decreased bone density and&#xD;
      are at increased risk of breaking a bone. Research has shown that pamidronate improves bone&#xD;
      density in adults who take glucocorticoids. However, use of pamidronate is not approved in&#xD;
      children because it has not been extensively tested in children. It is possible that children&#xD;
      will have a different response or unique problems with the medication because their bones are&#xD;
      still growing. We will assign all study participants to one of two groups. One group will&#xD;
      receive pamidronate intravenously (through a vein) every 3 months in addition of daily oral&#xD;
      calcium and vitamin D and the other group will receive calcium and vitamin D. The study is&#xD;
      scheduled to run for 36 months, with visits to the study center once every 3 months.&#xD;

      This is a randomized study to determine whether pamidronate can safely and effectively&#xD;
      improve bone mineral density (BMD) in children with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.&#xD;
      After we stratify participants on the basis of whether they are taking glucocorticoids for&#xD;
      treatment of inflammatory disease or for immunosuppression following organ transplant, we&#xD;
      will randomize them to receive daily calcium and vitamin D in addition to 30 mg/kg (1 mg/kg&#xD;
      for weight less then 30 kg) of pamidronate in normal saline every 3 months or daily calcium&#xD;
      and vitamin D only for 24 months, followed by a 12-month followup period off of therapy. We&#xD;
      will measure endpoints at 24 months. The primary endpoint is lumbar spine BMD determined by&#xD;
      DEXA. Secondary endpoints will include volumetric BMD of the spine, proximal femur BMD and&#xD;
      volumetric BMD, total body bone mineral content (BMC), fracture incidence, bone turnover&#xD;
      markers, and growth and skeletal changes. The study radiologist will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic inflammatory disease or transplant recipient, currently on steroid therapy at&#xD;
             supraphysiologic dose (greater than hydrocortisone equivalent of 15 mg/m2/day) for&#xD;
             more than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bone age less then 14 years in females, 16 years in males, to correspond to &lt; 90% of&#xD;
             peak BMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        And&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of glucocorticoid induced bone disease defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of at least one atraumatic fracture (defined as fracture that occurs during&#xD;
             activities of daily living, without a fall), or a vertebral fracture, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AP lumbar spine BMD (determined by DEXA) of more than 2 or more SD below the mean&#xD;
             lumbar BMD for a healthy child of similar stature (height age). OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A low trauma fracture (suspicious fracture - defined as a fracture the occurs with a&#xD;
             fall from standing height or below, and not during a high velocity activity) and AP&#xD;
             spine BMD 1.5 or more SD below the mean for height age, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent loss of BMD of greater then 3% over a 6 month or greater interval at any one of&#xD;
             the following sites, lumbar spine, total hip or whole body (excluding head). OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent increase in BMD of less then 3% over a 12 month period at all of the three&#xD;
             sites listed above.&#xD;
