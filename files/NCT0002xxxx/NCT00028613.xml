      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver&#xD;
      tumor-killing substances such as radioactive iodine to them without harming normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies in&#xD;
      treating patients who have large cell lymphoma that has been previously treated.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in&#xD;
           patients with previously treated diffuse large cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the response of patients to this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 40 minutes followed 15-30&#xD;
      minutes later by iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1&#xD;
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed weekly for 8 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-36 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

             system) confirmed by an independent central pathology reviewer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The tumor's B-cell phenotype will be confirmed by positive L-26 (CD20).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with 2 common combination chemotherapy regimens. Patients&#xD;
             previously treated with unlabeled monoclonal antibody therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men or women at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) estimated to be &gt; 60 at the time of the scheduled&#xD;
             therapeutic dose of 131I-Lym-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy estimated to be at least 3 months from the time of the therapeutic&#xD;
             dose of 131I Lym-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease demonstrable by physical examination or computerized tomography&#xD;
             (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CT scan evidence of at least one indicator lesion with at least one diameter that&#xD;
             measures &gt; 2 cm. (The CT scan should be done within 2 weeks of the imaging study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
