      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort of Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome (IBMFS) will provide new&#xD;
      information regarding cancer rates and types in these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathogenic variant(s) in IBMFS genes are relevant to carcinogenesis in sporadic cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IBMFS who develop cancer differ in their genetic and/or environmental features&#xD;
      from patients with IBMFS who do not develop cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cancer-prone families are well suited for cancer screening and prevention trials&#xD;
      targeting those at increased genetic risk of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carriers of IBMFS pathogenic variant(s) are at increased risk of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype disorder is Fanconi's Anemia (FA); other IBMFS will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the types and incidence of specific cancers in patients with an IBMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the relevance of IBMFS pathogenic variant(s) in the carcinogenesis pathway of&#xD;
      the sporadic counterparts of IBMFS-associated cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify risk factors for IBMFS-related cancers in addition to the primary germline&#xD;
      pathogenic variant(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the risk of cancer in IBMFS carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      North American families with a proband with an IBMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBMFS suspected by phenotype, confirmed by pathogenic variant(s) in an IBMFS gene, or by&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fanconi's anemia: birth defects, marrow failure, early onset malignancy; positive chromosome&#xD;
      breakage result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diamond-Blackfan anemia: pure red cell aplasia; elevated red cell adenosine deaminase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyskeratosis congenita: dysplastic nails, lacey pigmentation, leukoplakia; marrow failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome: malabsorption; neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia: early onset thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia absent radii: absent radii; early onset thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe Congenital Neutropenia: neutropenia, pyogenic infections, bone marrow maturation&#xD;
      arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson's Syndrome: malabsorption, neutropenia, marrow failure, metabolic acidosis; ringed&#xD;
      sideroblasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other bone marrow failure syndromes: e.g. Revesz Syndrome, WT, IVIC, radio-ulnar synostosis,&#xD;
      ataxia-pancytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First degree relatives of IBMFS-affected subjects as defined here, i.e. siblings (half or&#xD;
      full), biologic parents, and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grandparents of IBMFS-affected subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the general population with sporadic tumors of the types seen in the IBMFS (head&#xD;
      and neck, gastrointestinal, and anogenital cancer), with none of the usual risk factors (e.g.&#xD;
      smoking, drinking, HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural history study, with questionnaires, clinical evaluations, clinical and research&#xD;
      laboratory test, review of medical records, cancer surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints are all cancers, solid tumors, and cancers specific to each type of IBMFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are markers of pre-malignant conditions, such as leukoplakia, serum or&#xD;
      tissue evidence of carcinogenic viruses, and bone marrow morphologic myelodyplastic syndrome&#xD;
      or cytogenetic clones..&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The participants will be affected by an IBMFS, or be members of a family with an IBMFS, and&#xD;
        be at risk of being affected or carriers of the syndrome. Except for the rare X-linked&#xD;
        recessive disorder (e.g. some dyskeratosis congenita patients), there should be equal&#xD;
        numbers of male and female probands and family members. These IBMFS have been reported in&#xD;
        most racial and ethnic groups, and thus all such groups will be included. The age range&#xD;
        will be from birth to old age (grandparents of probands). The majority of the probands will&#xD;
        be children (10-20% will be adults), and their parents and grandparents will be adults. All&#xD;
        racial/ethnic groups are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fanconi s anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diamond Blackfan anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dyskeratosis congenita.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Shwachman Diamond Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Thrombocytopenia absent radii.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe congenital neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pearson Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other bone marrow failure syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family Members of IBMFS - Affected Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Family members include first degree relatives of IBMFS-affected subjects as defined here,&#xD;
        i.e. siblings (half or full), biologic parents, and children. Grandparents of&#xD;
        IBMFS-affected subjects are also included, specifically for Hypothesis 4. The age range&#xD;
        will be from birth to old age (grandparents of probands).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients in the general population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Patients in the general population with sporadic tumors of the types seen in the IBMFS&#xD;
        (head and neck, gastrointestinal, and anogenital cancer), with none of the usual risk&#xD;
        factors for those tumors (e.g. smoking, drinking, HPV). These patients will be further&#xD;
        evaluated for an IBMFS by the referring physician under the guidance of the study&#xD;
        investigators and if diagnosed with an IBMFS or if not diagnosed but highly suspicious for&#xD;
        an IBMFS, would be eligible for inclusion in the Field and Clinic Center cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Affected: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from&#xD;
        participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence that the hematologic disorder is acquired rather than genetic. Such evidence&#xD;
             includes temporal relation of the aplastic anemia to known marrow suppressant drugs,&#xD;
             chemicals, toxins, or viruses (in the absence of evidence indicative of an inherited&#xD;
             marrow failure disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known causes of cytopenias such as autoantibodies to red cells, platelets, or&#xD;
             neutrophils, viruses (especially hepatitis), micronutrient deficiencies, transient&#xD;
             erythroblastopenia of childhood, and cyclic neutropenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Assignment of the patient s physical findings to other syndromes or causes that are&#xD;
             not part of the IBMFS disease spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability of the participant or LAR to understand and be willing to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to permit access to medical records and pathology specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no other exclusion parameters not related to the primary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Unaffected/Family Members: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be&#xD;
        excluded from participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If there is no affected individual in the family who meets the inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability of the participant or LAR to understand and be willing to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness to permit access to medical records and pathology specimens.&#xD;
