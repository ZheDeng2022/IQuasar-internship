    <textblock>
      This study will explore new ways of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the&#xD;
      heart and blood vessels of patients with cardiovascular disease, including better detection&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and blockage of heart and leg arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with cardiovascular disease may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have magnetic resonance imaging of the heart. MRI uses a magnetic field&#xD;
      and radio waves to show structural and chemical changes in tissues. For the procedure, the&#xD;
      patient lies on a table surrounded by a metal cylinder (the scanner). A 'gadolinium contrast'&#xD;
      material may be injected into the patient s vein during part of the study to brighten the&#xD;
      images. Patients wear earplugs during the scan to muffle loud knocking sounds caused by the&#xD;
      electrical switching of the magnetic fields. They will be asked to hold their breath&#xD;
      intermittently for 5 to 20 seconds during the scan. They will be monitored with an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (EKG) during the procedure and will be in contact by intercom at all times&#xD;
      with the person performing the scan. Patients can request to stop the study and come out of&#xD;
      the scanner at any time. The procedure may last from 30 to 90 minutes. An echocardiogram a&#xD;
      test that uses sound waves to produce pictures of the heart and blood vessels-may be done to&#xD;
      confirm the MRI findings. In addition, patients may undergo one or more of the following&#xD;
      optional studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dobutamine stress MRI - This test uses dobutamine-a medicine that simulates exercise by&#xD;
           increasing heart rate and heart function-to detect blockages in the coronary arteries&#xD;
           (vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart) and locate areas of the heart&#xD;
           that are permanently damaged, perhaps by a previous heart attack. For this test, MRI&#xD;
           pictures of the heart are taken before, during and after administration of dobutamine.&#xD;
           Gadolinium may be injected during part of the study to brighten the images. An EKG will&#xD;
           be used to monitor the heart during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vasodilator MRI - The procedure and objectives of this test are the same as those&#xD;
           described for dobutamine stress MRI, except that this study uses dipyridamole or&#xD;
           adenosine. These drugs dilate blood vessels, causing increased blood flow to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plethysmography MRI - This test determines the presence and severity of narrowing in&#xD;
           arteries that supply blood to the leg. Blockage of these vessels often causes pain while&#xD;
           walking. This study will compare plethysmography MRI with venous occlusion&#xD;
           plethysmography, an older method of measuring blood flow in the legs. For venous&#xD;
           occlusion plethysmography, a large blood pressure cuff is placed around the upper leg&#xD;
           and a strain gauge (thin elastic band) is placed around the calf. The pressure cuff is&#xD;
           inflated very tightly for 5 minutes to block blood flow to the leg, and another pressure&#xD;
           cuff over the ankle is also inflated. When the large cuff is deflated, blood rushes to&#xD;
           the leg, a smaller cuff is inflated to a low pressure, and the strain gauge measures the&#xD;
           maximum blood flow to the leg for 1 or 2 more minutes. This procedure is done once or&#xD;
           twice outside the MRI scanner and once or twice inside the scanner. The scans are&#xD;
           performed as described above for the dobutamine and vasodilator studies. The strain&#xD;
           gauge is not used for plethysmography MRI the MRI pictures are used to measure flow.&#xD;

      The purpose of this protocol is to allow development and testing of new MRI techniques&#xD;
      suitable for evaluating patients with cardiovascular disease. Since such technical&#xD;
      development work often depends on preliminary studies in healthy volunteers, the protocol&#xD;
      also recruits healthy subjects. This protocol will provide the framework for technical&#xD;
      development scans in patients with cardiovascular disease.&#xD;

        Patients with cardiovascular diseases and healthy subjects 18 years of age or older were&#xD;
        recruited within this protocol. The exclusion criteria were developed from standard&#xD;
        clinical practice but were more restrictive to err on the side of safety. Recruitment was&#xD;
        via referral from local physicians. In addition, advertisements were placed in the&#xD;
        &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Finally, the protocol was listed on the NIH websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A patient could participate in any combination of these tests/procedures. Clinical judgment&#xD;
        was used to determine the number of tests/procedures suitable for a given patient.&#xD;
        Specifically, the responsible physician avoided prolonging tests/procedures in patients in&#xD;
        accordance with the patient's clinical status.&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Central nervous system aneurysm clips;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Implanted neural stimulator;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Cochlear implant;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings);&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Implanted Insulin pump;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Metal shrapnel or bullet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. In addition, the following patient groups will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant women (Patients who are uncertain as to whether they are pregnant will&#xD;
                  be required to have a screening urine or blood pregnancy test)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with active symptoms of myocardial ischemia occurring despite maximally&#xD;
                  tolerated doses of oral antianginal therapy and intravenous nitroglycerin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Furthermore, the following patient groups will be excluded from studies involving the&#xD;
             administration of MRI contrast agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  lactating women unless they are willing to discard breast milk for 24 hours after&#xD;
                  receiving gadolinium&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30&#xD;
                  ml/min/1.73 m(2) body surface area)&#xD;

             The eGFR will be used to estimate renal function if reported by the laboratory, or as&#xD;
             reported by NIH Clinical Center or Suburban Hospital or other clinically certified&#xD;
             laboratories. Otherwise, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be based on&#xD;
             the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation (see below) in&#xD;
             subjects with stable renal function. This formula is not applicable to patients with&#xD;
             acute renal insufficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
             eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m(2)) equal to 175 times (serum creatinine)-1.154 times (age)-0.203&#xD;
             times 0.742 (if the subject is female) times1.212 (if the subject is black)&#xD;
