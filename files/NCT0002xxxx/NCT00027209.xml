      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of synthetic hormone replacement therapy on&#xD;
      anti-seizure medication levels, menopausal symptom relief, and seizure frequency and safety&#xD;
      in menopausal women with epilepsy.&#xD;

      This study will help to answer questions regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
      that women with epilepsy face as they reach menopause. The total duration of the study is 6&#xD;
      months and involves 7 visits to the doctor. The purposes of the study are to discover if and&#xD;
      how menopause and treatments for the symptoms of menopause change epilepsy in women, to&#xD;
      determine which if any factors present before and/or during menopause may predict the&#xD;
      influence of menopause on a woman's seizure disorder, and to find any possible interactions&#xD;
      between hormone replacement therapy and anti-seizure medication in order to find the optimal&#xD;
      dose of hormone replacement therapy for women with epilepsy.&#xD;
