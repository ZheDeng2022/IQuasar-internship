  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how the drug tamoxifen affects the brain in patients&#xD;
      with bipolar I disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a severe, chronic, and often life-threatening illness for which safe&#xD;
      and effective treatments are necessary. The mood stabilizing effects of lithium and valproate&#xD;
      have revolutionized the treatment of patients with BD. However, a significant percentage of&#xD;
      patients do not respond fully to these drugs, and the biochemical basis for the antimanic and&#xD;
      mood-stabilizing actions of lithium and valproate is unclear. Both drugs inhibit protein&#xD;
      kinase C (PKC). There is a need to investigate the efficacy of a direct PKC inhibitor in the&#xD;
      treatment of acute mania. Tamoxifen is currently the only relatively selective PKC inhibitor&#xD;
      available for human use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be screened with a physical, psychiatric, and eye examination&#xD;
      and blood and urine tests. Eligible participants will be hospitalized at the Clinical Center&#xD;
      for at least 4 weeks. They will be tapered off all psychiatric medication and kept drug free&#xD;
      for 2 to 7 days. They will also be put on a low-monoamine, low-caffeine diet. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive either tamoxifen or placebo (an inactive pill) for 3&#xD;
      weeks. During this time, participants will have daily pulse and blood pressure measurements,&#xD;
      several electrocardiograms (EKGs), and blood draws. Weight measurements will be taken at&#xD;
      least twice during the study, and caffeine or dextromethorphan will be given at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of the study to test how tamoxifen affects the way the body eliminates other&#xD;
      medications. Participants will have a physical examination at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this 4-week study, some participants may continue the study and will receive&#xD;
      tamoxifen for an additional 3 weeks. At the conclusion of the study, participants'&#xD;
      psychiatric status will be reassessed and long-term psychiatric treatment for their mood&#xD;
      disorders will be arranged.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorder (BD) is a common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illness.&#xD;
      Suicide is the cause of death in 10-20% of individuals with BD. The discovery of lithium's&#xD;
      efficacy as a mood-stabilizing agent has since revolutionized the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      BD. However, approximately 50% of patients do not respond fully to lithium, and the&#xD;
      biochemical basis for lithium's antimanic and mood-stabilizing actions remains to be fully&#xD;
      elucidated. Elucidation of the mechanism(s) by which lithium stabilizes an underlying&#xD;
      dysregulation of limbic and limbic-associated function also offers the potential to delineate&#xD;
      the underlying pathophysiology of BD; however, a major problem inherent in neuropharmacologic&#xD;
      research is the difficulty in attributing therapeutic relevance to any observed biochemical&#xD;
      finding. One powerful approach is to identify common biochemical targets, which are modified&#xD;
      by drugs belonging to the same therapeutic class (e.g. mood-stabilizing agents) but&#xD;
      possessing distinct chemical structures when administered in a therapeutically relevant&#xD;
      paradigm (i.e., effects which are observed upon chronic drug administration, and yet persist&#xD;
      beyond abrupt drug discontinuation). In this context, it is noteworthy that both valproic&#xD;
      acid (VPA) and lithium, with different chemical structures, belong to the same therapeutic&#xD;
      class and cause considerable inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC). The PKC signaling pathway&#xD;
      is clearly a target for the actions of two structurally highly dissimilar antimanic agents --&#xD;
      lithium and VPA. Do these effects of lithium and VPA on PKC signaling have any clinical&#xD;
      relevance? There is thus a clear need to investigate the potential efficacy of a direct PKC&#xD;
      inhibitor in the treatment of acute mania. There is currently only one relatively selective&#xD;
      PKC inhibitor available for human use- Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen (TAM), a synthetic nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiestrogen, has been widely used in the treatment of breast cancer. TAM's potent inhibitory&#xD;
      effects on PKC are striking. Recently, our group conducted the first open-label study with&#xD;
      TAM in acute mania. In this study, TAM resulted in a significant decrease in manic symptoms&#xD;
      within a short period of time (3-7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that PKC inhibition is part&#xD;
      of the mechanism of the therapeutic effect of mood stabilizing drugs. The proposal derives&#xD;
      from and builds on our published open-label study of TAM in acute mania (Bebchuk et al.,&#xD;
      2000). However, the efficacy of TAM monotherapy in acute mania has only been reported in an&#xD;
      open-label study and has not yet been evaluated in a randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male or female patients, ages 18 to 65, with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder manic or mixed&#xD;
      (with or without psychotic features), will be randomized to double-blind treatment to receive&#xD;
      either TAM (20-140 mg/day) or placebo, for a period of 3 weeks. Following this acute period,&#xD;
      the patients will receive either open-label TAM or treatment as clinically indicated.&#xD;
      Approximately 50 patients with acute mania will be enrolled in the study. Biochemical&#xD;
      measures will be obtained during the study.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Male and female patients, 18 to 65 years of age. [Note: Only females who are premenopausal&#xD;
        with regular menstrual cycles will be able to participate].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted means of&#xD;
        contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests and&#xD;
        examinations required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each patient must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent&#xD;
        document. We will not permit patients with a Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) to participate&#xD;
        in this study. We will however, encourage all patients to sign a DPA after signing the&#xD;
        informed consent. However, signing a DPA is not a requirement for participating in this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and currently display an acute manic&#xD;
        or mixed episode (with or without psychotic features) according to the DSM-IV based on&#xD;
        clinical assessment and confirmed by structured diagnostic interview SCID-P. This includes&#xD;
        the following diagnoses: 296.4x, Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic; 296.6x,&#xD;
        Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Mixed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have a YMRS total score of greater than or equal to 14 at both Visits 1 and&#xD;
        2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        No decrease in total score of YMRS of greater than or equal to 20% during washout (between&#xD;
        Visits 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        DSM-IV rapid cyclers will be permitted to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Duration of current manic episode of not more than 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous trial with any one of the following antimanic agents: lithium, valproate,&#xD;
        carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, typical antipsychotic drug, or atypical antipsychotic drug&#xD;
        (olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine). If the subject has not&#xD;
        previously taken one of these antimanic treatments, then the research physician may start&#xD;
        one of them at NIH. Subjects not responding to a 3 week trial of an antimanic agent of&#xD;
        their choice (at least a 50% decrease on the YMRS rating scale from baseline) will be&#xD;
        eligible to be randomized if they continue to meet study criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be excluded from the study for any of the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Female patients who are either pregnant, nursing, or who are perimenopausal or&#xD;
        postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
