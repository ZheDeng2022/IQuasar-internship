      This study will test whether inhaling nitric oxide (NO) gas mixed with room air can improve&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs) in patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with sickle cell disease 18 years of age or older may be eligible to participate in&#xD;
      one or more parts of this three-stage study, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo the following tests to determine the cause of their pulmonary hypertension:&#xD;
      blood tests; echocardiogram (heart ultrasound); asthma test; oxygen breathing study with&#xD;
      measurement of arterial blood oxygen levels; chest X-ray; lung scans; MRI of the heart;&#xD;
      6-minute walk test; night-time oxygen measurement while sleeping; and exercise studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have a detailed MRI evaluation of the heart and are admitted to the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center intensive care unit (ICU) for the following test: A plastic tube is placed in a vein&#xD;
      in the patient's arm and another tube is placed in a deeper neck or leg vein. A third tube is&#xD;
      inserted through the vein into the heart and the lung artery to measure blood pressures in&#xD;
      the heart and lungs directly. Following baseline measurements, three medications (inhaled&#xD;
      oxygen, infused prostaglandin, and inhaled NO) are delivered for 2 hours each, separated by a&#xD;
      30-minute washout period. A small blood sample is drawn during the NO administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who cannot be treated with nitric oxide or for whom the treatment does not work may&#xD;
      receive monthly exchange transfusions for 3 months. For this procedure, 3 to 5 five units of&#xD;
      the patient's blood is removed and replaced with 3 to 5 units that do not have sickle&#xD;
      hemoglobin. Some patients who do not respond to NO or exchange transfusions may receive an&#xD;
      alternative therapy, such as oxygen, prostacyclin, L-arginine, bosentan or sidenafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients remain in the ICU with catheters in place for another 24 hours. During this time&#xD;
      they breathe NO. Lung pressures are measured every 4 hours and blood is drawn every 8 hours.&#xD;
      They then stay in the hospital 1 more day for observation. Patients then breathe nitric oxide&#xD;
      continuously for 2 months using a tank of gas that delivers the NO through tubes placed in&#xD;
      the nose. They may do this at home on an outpatient basis or may remain in the hospital for&#xD;
      the 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients have an echocardiogram and blood tests every week and do a 6-minute walk test every&#xD;
      2 weeks....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome&#xD;
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension has now been identified as a major cause of death in adults with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as a possible therapy for&#xD;
      both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension. Furthermore, a number of recent studies&#xD;
      have suggested that NO may have a favorable impact on sickle red cells at the molecular level&#xD;
      and could improve the abnormal microvascular perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell&#xD;
      anemia. In addition, chronic exchange transfusion therapy may reduce the progression and/or&#xD;
      severity of pulmonary hypertension in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed (1) to determine the pathophysiologic processes that are&#xD;
      associated with and potentially contribute to secondary pulmonary hypertension in adult&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell anemia, by comparing the cardio-pulmonary status of patients with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease with and without pulmonary hypertension (2) to determine the relative&#xD;
      acute vasodilatory effects of oxygen, intravenous prostacyclin, and inhaled nitric oxide on&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressures and other hemodynamic parameters in patients with secondary&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension and sickle cell anemia, (3) to determine the effects of two months of&#xD;
      inhaled nitric oxide on pulmonary artery pressures, other hemodynamic parameters, exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, and symptoms in this patient population, and (4) to determine the effects of three&#xD;
      months of exchange transfusion on pulmonary artery pressures, other hemodynamic parameters,&#xD;
      exercise tolerance, and symptoms in patients who do not receive or fail to respond to NO&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
