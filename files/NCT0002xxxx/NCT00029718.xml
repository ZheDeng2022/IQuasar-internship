    <textblock>
      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to identify interactions between&#xD;
      the unaffected and affected side of the brain in stroke patients. Results from previous&#xD;
      studies suggest that after a stroke, the motor cortex (part of the brain that controls&#xD;
      movement) of the unaffected side of the brain might negatively influence the motor cortex of&#xD;
      the affected side. TMS is a procedure that delivers brief electrical currents that stimulate&#xD;
      the brain. Studies of a small number of patients have shown that TMS can cause a temporary&#xD;
      decrease in activity of the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and chronic stroke patients may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Subjects may participate in up to four sessions of reaction time (speed of motor response)&#xD;
      testing. They will perform a series of movements with the index and middle fingers of either&#xD;
      the left or right hand in response to a signal from a computer monitor. The time it takes to&#xD;
      do the tasks will be measured and scored. There will be rest periods during each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS will be done each session to examine how the motor cortex affects recovery of function&#xD;
      after stroke. For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief&#xD;
      electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the&#xD;
      brain. Depending on where the coil is placed, the stimulation may cause a muscle twitch&#xD;
      (sometimes strong enough to move the limb), a feeling of movement or tingling in a limb, or&#xD;
      twitching of the jaw. During stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles&#xD;
      slightly or to perform other simple actions. The electrical activity in the muscles activated&#xD;
      by the stimulation will be recorded using metal electrodes taped to the skin over the&#xD;
      muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to draw a mark on a line on paper to rate their attention and&#xD;
      level of fatigue, and how well they think they are executing the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This procedure uses a strong&#xD;
      magnetic field and radio waves to provide detailed images of the brain. During the scanning,&#xD;
      the subject wears earplugs to muffle loud thumping sounds that occur with electrical&#xD;
      switching of the radio frequency circuits. The subject can communicate with the staff member&#xD;
      performing the study at all times through an intercom system.&#xD;

      Performance of accurate skilled movements relies on interhemispheric interactions between the&#xD;
      two motor cortices. It has been proposed that abnormal interactions could contribute to the&#xD;
      motor deficit that results from chronic hemispheric lesions after stroke. The purpose of this&#xD;
      protocol is to identify changes in interhemispheric inhibitory interactions associated with&#xD;
      performance of a motor task in patients with chronic hemispheric stroke. The overall&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the cortical representation of the paretic hand receives abnormally high&#xD;
      task-related interhemispheric inhibitory influence originated in the intact motor cortex in&#xD;
      stroke patients relative to healthy volunteers. It is important to test this hypothesis,&#xD;
      because if proven correct, it could lead to the development of novel neurorehabilitative&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
