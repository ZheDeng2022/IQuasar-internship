  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of islet cell transplantation in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is to&#xD;
      provide constant normal blood glucose levels. This may eliminate the need for insulin&#xD;
      altogether or provide a significant reduction in the amount of insulin necessary to maintain&#xD;
      constant normal blood glucose levels. This normalization may prevent or slow progression of&#xD;
      diabetic complications. Furthermore, the participant may enjoy a healthier lifestyle and a&#xD;
      better quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you meet the initial inclusion criteria for the trial, you must be able to give informed&#xD;
      consent personally. Then you will need to participate in an extensive screening process that&#xD;
      involves many standard tests and collection of laboratory samples to make sure that the&#xD;
      transplant is suitable and safe for you.&#xD;

      The trial may/will utilize the following immunosuppressive medications: tacrolimus&#xD;
      (life-long), sirolimus (life-long), daclizumab and infliximab You will be maintained on the&#xD;
      lowest doses possible with all the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP (1A): The first four participants will be assigned to Group A. These participants will&#xD;
      receive an islet cell transplant alone from two donors. They will receive the following&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications: tacrolimus (lifelong), sirolimus (lifelong), and daclizumab.&#xD;
      They will not receive the immunosuppressive medication infliximab. GROUP (1B): The second&#xD;
      four participants will be assigned to group B. These participants will receive an islet cell&#xD;
      transplant alone from one donor. They will receive the following immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications: tacrolimus (lifelong), sirolimus (lifelong), daclizumab and infliximab. Patients&#xD;
      in this group who are not able to stop injecting insulin by three months after the transplant&#xD;
      may be eligible to receive a second islet cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further participants will alternate group assignments in the same above-mentioned manner. The&#xD;
      participants in both groups will receive the following immunosuppressive medications for&#xD;
      life, tacrolimus and sirolimus. All participants will be required to live no more than two&#xD;
      hours from the transplantation center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the islets become available, you will be notified to come immediately to the hospital&#xD;
      for your transplant. At that time numerous tests and laboratory samples will be performed to&#xD;
      make sure you are ready and healthy for your transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have your islet cell transplant done in a special radiology procedure room in a&#xD;
      hospital. You will have local anesthetic in the area of your liver on your right side along&#xD;
      with sedatives that will minimize any discomfort the procedure might cause. A very small&#xD;
      (thin) needle will be inserted through your liver into your portal vein where the islet cells&#xD;
      are then injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will need to be followed at the Diabetes Research Institute after transplant&#xD;
      for laboratory sampling, testing and for general islet cell transplant care.&#xD;
