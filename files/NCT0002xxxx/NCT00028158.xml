  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the safety and effectiveness of an engineered herpes virus,&#xD;
      G207, administered directly into the brain of patients with recurrent brain cancer. G207 has&#xD;
      been modified from the herpes virus that causes cold sores (called herpes simplex virus type&#xD;
      1 or HSV-1). G207 has been designed so that it should kill tumor cells, but not harm normal&#xD;
      brain cells. G207 has been shown to be safe in animal testing completed to date and in&#xD;
      previous studies in patients with brain tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase Ib/II study. In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive G207&#xD;
      at a dose that is higher than tested in previous human studies. Patients will initially&#xD;
      receive 15% of the assigned dose injected directly into the brain tumor. Approximately two&#xD;
      days later, as much of the tumor as possible will be surgically removed, and more G207 will&#xD;
      be injected into the brain tumor bed. Patients will be monitored, and medical tests will be&#xD;
      done at specific study timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II portion will begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion.&#xD;
      The goals of the phase II portion of the study are to determine the safety of G207 and to&#xD;
      study patient survival at six months after G207 dosing. In the phase II portion of the study,&#xD;
      patients will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose determined to be safe in the&#xD;
      phase Ib portion of the study. The tumor will be removed, and G207 will be injected into any&#xD;
      remaining tumor tissue in the brain tumor bed. Patients will be closely monitored, medical&#xD;
      tests will be performed at specific study visits, and survival will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Protocol NG1-003 is an open-label, phase Ib/II study of the safety and efficacy of G207, a&#xD;
      genetically engineered herpes simplex type-1 virus. Up to 21 patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      phase Ib portion and will receive doses of G207 that are higher than tested in the previous&#xD;
      trials. The highest G207 dose tested in a previous phase I trial (NG1-001) was 3E9 plaque&#xD;
      forming units (pfu). G207 was generally well tolerated and safe in NG1-001, and there was no&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients' deaths were due to progressive cancer disease except for&#xD;
      one (due to radiation necrosis), and two patients remain alive today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the phase Ib portion of NG1-003 will receive G207 in divided doses. Initially,&#xD;
      15% of the assigned dose will be injected into the tumor. Two days later, the tumor will be&#xD;
      removed, and the assigned dose of G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of&#xD;
      resection. The assigned doses are as follows: 1E9, 3E9, and 1E10 pfu. Patient status will be&#xD;
      followed by MRI, Karnofsky performance, neurologic examination and the presence of G207 virus&#xD;
      in the body, in addition to other medical tests done at specific study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II portion of protocol NG1-003 is a two-stage study. The phase II portion will&#xD;
      begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion. The goals are to&#xD;
      determine the safety of G207 and survival at six months. Enrollment of up to 14 patients is&#xD;
      planned for stage one. Additional patients will be enrolled (up to 30 additional patients and&#xD;
      44 overall) in stage II if at least 6 of the 14 patients in stage 1 survive 6 months or&#xD;
      longer. Participants in phase II will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose&#xD;
      determined to be safe from phase Ib. G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of&#xD;
      resection. Again, patient status will be followed as previously described and survival will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;
