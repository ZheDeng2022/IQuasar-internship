  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that neutrophils (a specific type of cell) are involved in inflammation in&#xD;
      the lungs of CF patients. Neutrophil levels in CF patients have been measured by&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which samples cells in the fluid lining of the lungs. Other&#xD;
      studies have measured neutrophil levels and inflammation in other parts of the body using PET&#xD;
      scanning. This study aims to show that PET scanning can be used as a non-invasive marker of&#xD;
      inflammation in the lungs of patients with CF, which would be a useful tool in treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to draw a connection between the level of inflammation&#xD;
      shown in the PET scan and the number of neutrophils obtained from the BAL. This study will&#xD;
      also look at how the PET images relate to inflammatory molecules in the lungs and to the&#xD;
      FEV-1 obtained through spirometry.&#xD;

      All patients involved in the study will have a PET scan performed. This involves injecting a&#xD;
      small amount of radiolabelled glucose (sugar) into the blood. A scan will then be performed&#xD;
      to obtain an image of where in the body that glucose is being used. Patients will also have&#xD;
      spirometry done. Spirometry is a simple procedure measuring the functioning of the lungs&#xD;
      (FEV-1) by measuring the amount of air a patient can blow out and inhale (the patient&#xD;
      breathes into a machine). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be performed. This involves&#xD;
      putting a small amount of fluid into a section of the lung, then suctioning it out to&#xD;
      retrieve the cells and molecules contained in the substance lining the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be patients with cystic fibrosis. Ten subjects will be stable with either mild&#xD;
      or moderate disease. These subjects will receive a PET scan, spirometry, and BAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This portion of the study is made up of 10 stable CF patients, 5 of whom will have mild&#xD;
      disease, and 5 of whom will have moderate disease. These patients will receive a PET scan,&#xD;
      spirometry and a BAL over 2 consecutive days. On day 1, patients will have a PET scan and&#xD;
      spirometry. On day 2, patients will have a BAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will arrive on the first day after fasting for at least 6 hours and will be taken to&#xD;
      the PET facility. PET scanning consists of a 2-minute scan followed by a 15-minute scan,&#xD;
      injection of radiolabelled sugar into the vein, and 66 minutes of scanning. The patient will&#xD;
      then be instructed to empty his or her bladder to reduce total radiation exposure. The&#xD;
      patient will then be given a meal. Next, the patient will be taken for spirometry, the last&#xD;
      test of day 1, which simple involves breathing into a machine that measures the amount of air&#xD;
      inhaled and exhaled. Upon reporting to the GCRC on day 2, the patient will be taken for a BAL&#xD;
      (the patient will have fasted for at least 6 hours prior to admission). BAL involves a small&#xD;
      tube placed into the mouth, down the throat, and into the lung (lidocaine is used to numb the&#xD;
      entire area). Less than 3 tablespoons of saline (salt water) is poured down the tube, then&#xD;
      immediately sucked back up and collected by the doctor. This is repeated twice, for a total&#xD;
      of 8 tablespoons of liquid.&#xD;
