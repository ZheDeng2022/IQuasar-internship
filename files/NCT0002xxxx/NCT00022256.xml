      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs such as&#xD;
      motexafin gadolinium may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of motexafin gadolinium plus radiation&#xD;
      therapy to the brain in treating patients who have newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the safety of motexafin gadolinium and cranial irradiation, in terms of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity and clinically significant adverse events, in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these&#xD;
      patients. III. Determine the survival of patients treated with this regimen. IV. Assess the&#xD;
      activities of daily living and neurological status of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive motexafin gadolinium IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1 and 2, and on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 3-6. Patients undergo&#xD;
      cranial irradiation on days 1-5 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo a neurological examination and an&#xD;
      activities of daily living questionnaire at baseline, week 10, and during follow-up visits.&#xD;
      Patients are followed at weeks 10 and 16 and then every 2 months thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
