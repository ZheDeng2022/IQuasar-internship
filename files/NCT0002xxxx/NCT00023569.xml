      This study will determine whether an electric shock to the forearm can improve hand function&#xD;
      in patients with chronic stroke and, if so, whether the improvement is related to brain&#xD;
      reorganization. Some studies indicate that electromyography-triggered neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (EMG-triggered NMES) on the forearm improves wrist motor function in&#xD;
      patients with chronic stroke. The shock is delivered to the wrist extensor muscle of the&#xD;
      forearm, causing greater hand movement than the patient can make on his or her own. The study&#xD;
      will determine if the electric shock is more effective given after the patient initiates the&#xD;
      hand movement (EMG-triggered NMES) than at times unrelated to patient effort (NMES alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke patients with muscle weakness on one side of the body may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      The stroke must have occurred at least 12 months before the patient enters the study.&#xD;
      Candidates will have a medical history and physical and neurological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided randomly into two groups: EMG-triggered NMES, and NMES alone.&#xD;
      For EMG-triggered NMES, two electrodes from the NMES machine and two EMG electrodes are&#xD;
      placed on the wrist extensor muscle of the forearm. The patient relaxes the hand, then&#xD;
      contracts the wrist extensor muscle to produce movement. This movement triggers the NMES to&#xD;
      deliver enough electrical stimulation to produce maximum wrist extension. For NMES alone,&#xD;
      only the two NMES electrodes are placed on the forearm. The patient relaxes the hand and&#xD;
      stimulation is applied at an intensity to produce full wrist extension without any patient&#xD;
      effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first clinic visit, baseline hand function is measured with the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wrist extension - wrist extension is measured with a digital instrument called an&#xD;
           accelerometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pinch power - grip strength between thumb and index finger is measured with a digital&#xD;
           pinch analyzer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jebsen-Taylor hand function - function is evaluated through activities such as moving a&#xD;
           can and lifting a pin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H reflex - (Note: I could not find a description of this test or its purpose in the&#xD;
           consent or the protocol)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is done to examine brain activity. For&#xD;
      this test, an insulated wire coil is placed on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical&#xD;
      current passes through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that travels through the scalp and&#xD;
      skull and causes small electrical currents in the outer part of the brain. The stimulation&#xD;
      may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching, or may affect movement or reflexes. During the&#xD;
      stimulation, electrical activity of muscles are recorded with a computer or other recording&#xD;
      device, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed in how to use the NMES machine at the first visit. They will&#xD;
      be required to practice with the machine at home 30 minutes twice a day every day for 4&#xD;
      weeks, for a total of about 56 sessions. Follow-up evaluations of hand function will be done&#xD;
      one day after the first NMES or EGM-triggered NMES task, then after 2 weeks and after 4 weeks&#xD;
      of performing the exercise. These evaluations include the tests described above for baseline&#xD;
      measurements, plus TMS.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a newly developed electrical&#xD;
      technique, electromyography (EMG) triggered neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES) known&#xD;
      as EMG-Stim., on brain reorganization. Clinically EMG-Stim. is thought to improve a chronic&#xD;
      hemiparetic hand [1-3], but its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We plan to&#xD;
      determine: (1) if EMG-Stim. on a chronic hemiparetic hand as a result of stroke enhances&#xD;
      improved hand motor function; and (2) whether any clinical improvement is related to brain&#xD;
      reorganization.&#xD;
