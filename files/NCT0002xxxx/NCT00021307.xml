      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of temozolomide plus carboplatin in&#xD;
      treating patients who have recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temozolomide and carboplatin in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. II. Determine the toxic effects of this&#xD;
      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these&#xD;
      patients. IV. Determine the potential of either a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic-mediated&#xD;
      drug interaction in patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the objective response&#xD;
      rate and stabilization rate in patients treated with this regimen at the MTD. VI. Determine&#xD;
      the acute and long-term toxic effects of this regimen at the MTD in these patients. VII.&#xD;
      Determine the time to tumor progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to age (under 50&#xD;
      vs 50 and over), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1-2), and prior therapy with carmustine or&#xD;
      lomustine (yes vs no). Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral&#xD;
      temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responsive&#xD;
      disease may receive 6 additional courses of temozolomide. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of carboplatin and temozolomide until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study. A&#xD;
      total of 16-58 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.&#xD;
