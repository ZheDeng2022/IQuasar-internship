      Although Neopharm has terminated its sponsorship of this study, it is continuing under the&#xD;
      sponsorship of the NCI. Please contact Raffit Hassan, MD at 301-451-8742 for more&#xD;
      information. Also see the related NCI study &quot;Experimental Drug SS1(dsFv)-PE38 to Treat&#xD;
      Cancer&quot; (Study ID number 010011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 is an oncology drug product containing a bacteria toxin, fused to a high&#xD;
      affinity, disulfide stabilized antibody. The fused protein retains cell killing activity, but&#xD;
      binds only to cells expressing mesothelin. Tumors characterized by very high surface&#xD;
      mesothelin expression include mesothelioma; epithelial carcinomas of ovary and peritoneum;&#xD;
      and squamous cancers of cervix and upper aerodigestive tract, including esophagus, head, and&#xD;
      neck cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous&#xD;
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered once every other day for six doses. Dose escalation will proceed&#xD;
      in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of six doses of&#xD;
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered by intravenous infusion to patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 after intravenous infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine toxicities attributable to subsequent courses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate the response of selected advanced malignancies to intravenous infusion of six&#xD;
      doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the induction of antibody against SS1(dsFv)-PE38 and its relationship to&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: To exclude immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction, each patient will&#xD;
      receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38, and be observed for 30 minutes prior to receiving&#xD;
      study dosing. Each treatment will be given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every&#xD;
      other day. Hydration will be maintained. (Oral hydration may be adequate, but intravenous&#xD;
      hydration may be used at the Investigator?s discretion.) Patients will be observed for at&#xD;
      least 4 hours after infusion on Day 1 of each treatment course to exclude immediate allergic&#xD;
      reaction. Treatment may be repeated for a maximum of two additional courses after 4 weeks if&#xD;
      re-treatment criteria are met. At least three patients will be accrued at each dose level.&#xD;
      Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 30 patients&#xD;
