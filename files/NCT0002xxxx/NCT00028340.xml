      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, occurring in over 230,000 women&#xD;
           annually in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vast majority of breast cancers originate in the single layer of epithelial cells&#xD;
           that line the ductal/lobular system of the breast milk ducts. The premalignant changes&#xD;
           which occur in the transformed epithelium are not well understood, however several&#xD;
           cytologic or histologic changes have been identified which are associated with an&#xD;
           increased risk for breast cancer, including ductal or lobular hyperplasia, hyperplasia&#xD;
           with atypia, and lobular or ductal carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The identification of cytological or histological abnormalities in breast epithelial&#xD;
           cells is an important component of risk assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence and nature of cytologic changes in ductal epithelial cells&#xD;
           from the high-risk breast, in specimens collected by breast ductal lavage, and to&#xD;
           determine if these cytologic findings are different from those of female normal&#xD;
           volunteers not at increased risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize by breast duct endoscopy, high risk breast ductal epithelium and&#xD;
           architecture, and correlate these findings with the cytologic findings referenced in&#xD;
           above bullet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine what is the global gene expression pattern of high risk breast epithelial&#xD;
           cells from the high risk breast, and does this differ from that of breast epithelial&#xD;
           cells from female normal volunteersnot at increased risk for breast cancer. The gene&#xD;
           expression profile will be determined by cDNA microarray and validated by RT-PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for high risk individuals will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with a unilateral invasive or noninvasive (DCIS) breast cancer of epithelial&#xD;
           origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women without breast cancer, but with a Gail Index greater than 1.67 percent, or a&#xD;
           cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the age- and race-matched&#xD;
           general population risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women known to be BRCA1/2 or other hereditary genes mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with cytologic or histologic evidence of ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal&#xD;
           hyperplasia, or lobular carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women may be either premenopausal or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined by the&#xD;
           absence of menstrual periods for at least 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postmenopausal women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy&#xD;
           must have a serum FSH level of &gt; 40 IU/ml, and a serum estradiol level of less than40&#xD;
           pg/ml to document postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility for normal volunteers will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are premenopausal or postmenopausal with a Gail model risk index less than&#xD;
           1.67 percent, and without a cumulative lifetime risk greater than or equal to double the&#xD;
           age- and racematched general population risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who have previously undergone a hysterectomy without oophorectomy must have a&#xD;
           serum FSH level of &gt;40 IU/ml, and a serum estradiol level of less than 40 pg/ml to&#xD;
           document postmenopausal status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both breasts must be free of any suspicious areas by physical examination and, for women&#xD;
           over 30 years of age by mammogram. There must be no history of atypical hyperplasia,&#xD;
           invasive or in situ carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups must have acceptable white blood cell and platelet counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast ductal epithelial cells will be collected by breast ductal lavage from (a) the breast&#xD;
      in women at increased risk for breast cancer, and (b) the breast of female normal volunteers&#xD;
      who are not at increased risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ductal epithelial cell specimens will be analyzed cytologically for the presence of&#xD;
      hyperplasia, atypia, or in situ changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast duct endoscopy will be performed in breast cancer patients and in normal volunteers&#xD;
      with cytologic atypia on ductal lavage to determine ductal architectural changes associated&#xD;
      with increased risk for breast cancer, and to provide correlation with cytologic atypia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene expression profile of normal and high-risk ductal epithelial cells will be studied&#xD;
      by cDNA-microarray to determine changes in gene expression associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional molecular profiling experiments which will be performed as lavage cells are&#xD;
      available include DNA whole exome sequencing, Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH),&#xD;
      proteomic tissue lysate arrays, and identification of mammary stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 104 high-risk subjects and 110 normal volunteers will be studied, divided&#xD;
      approximately evenly between premenopausal and postmenopausal women.&#xD;
