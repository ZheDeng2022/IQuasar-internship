  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of pyridoxylated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene&#xD;
      conjugate (PHP) administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response syndrome (SIRS) patients with shock. PHP is a human-derived chemically modified&#xD;
      hemoglobin preparation. PHP selectively scavenges excess nitric oxide (NO) and does so in a&#xD;
      catalytic, concentration-dependent reaction that results in the formation of the non-toxic NO&#xD;
      metabolite, nitrate. PHP is postulated to reduce excess, toxic levels of NO while allowing&#xD;
      critical beneficial levels of the molecule to persist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study is designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of continuous IV infusion of PHP plus conventional vasopressor treatment,&#xD;
      as compared to continuous IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte A plus conventional vasopressor, as a&#xD;
      treatment for restoring hemodynamic stability in SIRS patients with shock. Conventional&#xD;
      vasopressors include dopamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min; or norepinephrine, phenylephrine or epinephrine&#xD;
      at any dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening period, a Pre-Treatment period, and a 28-day Treatment&#xD;
      period. Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality&#xD;
      and organ function over the 28-day treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a&#xD;
      number of measures including an evaluation of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all cause mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  median patient survival time and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adverse event rates and duration.&#xD;

        Determination of study eligibility will be made by the Investigator on the basis of the&#xD;
        inclusion criteria listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        SIRS Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with SIRS as characterized by two or more of the following conditions (worst&#xD;
        values in a 24 hour period):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either respiratory rate &gt;/= 20 breaths/minute, partial pressure of arterial carbon&#xD;
             dioxide (PaCO2) &lt;/= 32 torr, or mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart rate &gt;/= 90 beats/minute,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either hyperthermia &gt;/= 38 degrees C, or hypothermia &lt;/= 36 degrees C or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either white blood cell (WBC) &gt;/= 12,000 cells/mm3, &lt;/= 4,000 cells/mm3, or &gt;/= 10%&#xD;
             immature (band) forms&#xD;
&#xD;
        Shock Inclusion Criteria Patients with adequate fluid resuscitation (PCWP &gt;/= 12mmHg) and&#xD;
        with one or more conventional vasopressors (continuing up to the time of randomization)&#xD;
        being used to treat hypotension (MBP &lt; 60 mmHg or SBP &lt; 90 mmHg). Patients cannot be&#xD;
        entered if they have been in shock for more than 24 hours.&#xD;
