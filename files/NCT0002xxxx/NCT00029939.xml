  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how the brain prepares for&#xD;
      movement. It will look at 1) what changes occur in a person's brain just before voluntary&#xD;
      movement, 2) when the changes occur, 3) how consistent the changes are, and 4) how the&#xD;
      changes vary from person to person. The information from this study will be applied to other&#xD;
      studies, such as exploring how brain changes that signal movement can be used to control&#xD;
      prostheses in patients with spinal cord injuries or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. People&#xD;
      with neurologic or psychiatric disorders and people taking medicines that may affect brain&#xD;
      signals (e.g., Valium) may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center on two separate days for testing sessions&#xD;
      of 2 to 3 hours each. At each session, an EEG cap will be placed on the head to record brain&#xD;
      signals, and electrodes will be placed on the arms to record movement. Subjects will perform&#xD;
      simple movements during the EEG recording, such as flexing their arm of clenching their fist.&#xD;
      Researchers will use the first recording to determine the pattern of how the brain prepares&#xD;
      for movement. During the second recording, they will try to predict the subjects' movements,&#xD;
      based on the patterns discerned in the first recording.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Human voluntary movement is associated with at least two distinct types of scalp&#xD;
      electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Event-related potentials are slow, with DC signals&#xD;
      developing in the bifrontal region as early as 1.5 seconds prior to movement. They are&#xD;
      detected by averaging multiple events in the time domain and generally require at least 40-50&#xD;
      events to allow detection of the signal within the noise. Frequency changes however, are more&#xD;
      robust and may be seen reliably on individual traces. The frequency changes occur in the&#xD;
      alpha (8-13 Hz) range as well as beta (13-30 Hz) and may occur up to 2 seconds before&#xD;
      movement. This leads to the notion that real-time analysis of the EEG may allow one to&#xD;
      predict individual movement. If this could be done reliably, it may provide further insight&#xD;
      about how the brain prepares for movement, as well as potential therapeutic options such as&#xD;
      control of cortically based prosthetic device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial study, henceforth Phase 1, is an exploratory study using real-time EEG to&#xD;
      identify the factors that allow one to reliably predict normal human voluntary movement.&#xD;
      Subjects will be normal volunteers, studied in the EEG lab in the Human Motor Control&#xD;
      Section. Subjects will be asked to perform a simple motor task involving a sequence of finger&#xD;
      movements while undergoing a routine EEG recording with surface electromyography. The EEG&#xD;
      will then be processed using standard techniques to identify the location and time course of&#xD;
      EEG signals in response to movement. Once this has occurred, subjects will return for a&#xD;
      real-time study that will use their individually identified factors to predict their&#xD;
      movement. The effects of training on the accuracy of prediction will also be explored by&#xD;
      scheduling multiple real-time prediction sessions per subject over the course of several&#xD;
      weeks. The rate of successful movement prediction will be the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After we are able to accurately predict movement intention with healthy volunteers, i.e., the&#xD;
      false positive rate is under 20% with the false negative rate under 50%, we will study&#xD;
      whether we can achieve the same prediction accuracy with stroke patients and patients with&#xD;
      primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The stroke patients&#xD;
      and ALS/PLS patients will perform the same procedure as the subjects in the Phase 1 part of&#xD;
      the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the investigation will extend to a different type of movement, reaching, and to an&#xD;
      additional parameter, the spatial field of the intended target of the movement. In addition,&#xD;
      Phase 2 will also include magnetoencephalography (MEG) as well as EEG methods to classify the&#xD;
      spatiotemporal features of these movement parameters. Successful prediction of the intended&#xD;
      goals of reaches to either ipsilateral or contralateral fields, prior to the onset of&#xD;
      movement will be the main outcome measure of phase 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 3 of the investigation, healthy volunteers will perform a simple finger movement&#xD;
      task which will be analyzed with special attention given to the timing of the intention to&#xD;
      move and to how the intention affects the EEG signal. In order to assess whether spontaneous&#xD;
      movements without prior instruction are associated with different physiological markers from&#xD;
      typical self-paced paradigms, a recording session will be performed after the EEG cap is&#xD;
      placed without instructing the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will then be used to design further protocols studying human&#xD;
      voluntary movement and clinical applications as appropriate.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy volunteers will be over 18, and willing to participate, and able to give informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STROKE PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The stroke patients will have a clinically and radiologically documented stroke in the&#xD;
        sub-acute (2 weeks to 6 months to after onset) or the chronic state (more than 6 months&#xD;
        after onset), having a lesion in sub-cortical regions including the basal ganglia,&#xD;
        thalamus, internal capsule, or a combination of these structures, or cerebellum&#xD;
        unilaterally. These lesions can extend to the surrounding areas, however not including the&#xD;
        cortical areas. Patients will be over 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLS/ALS PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must fulfill the diagnostic criteria proposed by Pringle (1992) for PLS and have&#xD;
        been diagnosed with PLS for at least 3 years. Criteria include onset of spasticity alone in&#xD;
        adulthood, slow progressive course, no family history, no lower motor neuron signs, and&#xD;
        exclusion of known causes of spasticity. ALS patients should have probable or definite ALS&#xD;
        by El Escorial criteria. Patients must have evidence of upper and lower motor neuron signs&#xD;
        in two or more defined regions: cranial, arms, legs, or torso. Only the PLS/ALS patients&#xD;
        who have recently participated in the study under protocol 06-N-0174 will be included. Some&#xD;
        subjects will be studied as inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who are unable to perform simple voluntary movement with both hands.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have any neurological or psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have any implanted metal in or on their bodies that cannot be removed prior to&#xD;
        the MRI and MEG scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STROKE PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We are investigating a particular EEG pattern associated with voluntary movement that we&#xD;
        believe may not be present in patients with multiple strokes that involve the cerebral&#xD;
        cortex; therefore, we will exclude this population of stroke patients. We will, however,&#xD;
        include patients with multiple strokes if the cerebral cortex was not involved because we&#xD;
        hypothesize that the EEG pattern that we are looking for will be preserved in patients with&#xD;
        sub-cortical stroke lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A. Patients with MRI findings consistent with brain tumors, trauma or AVMs will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Patients with multiple stroke lesions that involve the cerebral cortex will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Subjects with a pre-stroke history of schizophrenia or bipolar disorders will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Subjects with cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. Patients not capable of giving an informed consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLS/ALS PATIENTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PLS/ALS patients with a history or evidence of a coexisting or other neurological disorder,&#xD;
        such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, polio, ataxia or neuropathy, or a history of&#xD;
        traumatic brain injury, skull defects or neurosurgery will be excluded. PLS/ALS patients&#xD;
        will have neuropsychological tests of frontal cortex function under protocol 06-N-0174.&#xD;
        Patients with scores below 133 (out of 144) on the Mattis dementia rating scale will be&#xD;
        classified as impaired patients who are unable to give their own informed consent and will&#xD;
        be excluded. PLS/ALS patients who are unable to travel will be excluded. PLS/ALS patients&#xD;
        who are respirator dependent will be excluded.&#xD;
