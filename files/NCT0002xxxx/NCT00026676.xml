  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that patients receiving state-of-the-art treatment for HIV&#xD;
      infection (highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART) show discordant responses to&#xD;
      therapy-that is, they improve both clinically and immunologically (increased CD4 immune cell&#xD;
      counts), but their levels of HIV in the blood do not drop. This study will examine blood&#xD;
      samples taken from HIV-infected children treated with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine, or&#xD;
      ddI) in an earlier NCI study to determine if these patients had similar discordant responses&#xD;
      to therapy. If so, the study will also examine how these factors may be predictive of disease&#xD;
      progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will measure HIV levels in blood specimens from children previously enrolled in&#xD;
      NCI protocol 88-C-0129. The measurements will be done in specimens drawn before initiation of&#xD;
      treatment with ddI and at various times during the course of treatment. The viral responses&#xD;
      to therapy will then be correlated with short- and long-term clinical and immunologic&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, researchers will examine these patients' blood samples for additional factors&#xD;
      recently discovered to potentially influence disease progression. They include selenium&#xD;
      levels and certain genetic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of discordant responses to therapy will help physicians determine the&#xD;
      best treatment option in situations where therapy results do not show uniform benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol involves the scientific examination of laboratory specimens only and is not a&#xD;
      clinical study open to patient enrollment.&#xD;

      This study will examine clinical and immunologic data and HIV-1 RNA levels in banked serum&#xD;
      specimens from HIV-infected pediatric patients previously enrolled on NCI protocol 88-C-0219,&#xD;
      a phase I/II study of 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI). In the original study serum p24 antigen&#xD;
      was used as the direct measurement of viral quantitation. Advances in understanding of HIV&#xD;
      pathophysiology have demonstrated that HIV-1 RNA level as measured by quantitative RNA PCR is&#xD;
      a far superior molecular tool for assessing viral replication and burden in vivo. Analysis of&#xD;
      clinical, HIV-1 RNA and CD4 responses will be performed to identify patients with discordant&#xD;
      surrogate marker responses to therapy, defined as: improvement in immunologic parameters in&#xD;
      the setting of virologic non-response or failure. Correlation will then be made with short&#xD;
      and long term clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the initial analysis to identify patients with discordant responses, selenium&#xD;
      levels, viral genotypic and phenotypic profiles of resistance to ddI, and in vitro viral&#xD;
      fitness will be examined. These biologic parameters have recently been determined to&#xD;
      potentially play an important role in clinical, immunologic and virologic HIV-related&#xD;
      outcomes. Parameters will be examined in subsets of patients with the following surrogate&#xD;
      marker response profiles: a.) immunologic and virologic responders; b.) immunologic and&#xD;
      virologic non-responders; and c.) discordant immunologic and virologic responders. Specimens&#xD;
      from the ddI monotherapy study were chosen for this analysis because a substantial body of&#xD;
      clinical and immunologic data is available on patients up to 7 years.&#xD;
