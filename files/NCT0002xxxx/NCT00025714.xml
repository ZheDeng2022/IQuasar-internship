  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect brain tissue samples for research purposes from patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery to treat epilepsy. The standard surgical procedure for medically intractable epilepsy&#xD;
      i.e., epilepsy that cannot be controlled with medicine requires removal of more brain tissue&#xD;
      than is needed for diagnostic study. This extra tissue, which would otherwise be discarded,&#xD;
      will be used for research purposes. In addition, a blood vessel in the scalp, called the&#xD;
      superficial temporal artery, is also normally cut during surgery, and a piece of this vessel&#xD;
      will be taken for research use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 4 years of age or older who undergo surgery for medically intractable epilepsy may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain tissue collected under this protocol will be used for studies of brain cells in other&#xD;
      diseases and of serotonin receptors. Any remaining brain tissue will be frozen for use in&#xD;
      future research. The superficial temporal artery will be used for comparison with carotid&#xD;
      arteries (a neck artery that supplies the brain) from patients with blockage of this blood&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a protocol to perform research studies on tissues that are removed in the operating&#xD;
      room during surgical procedures for drug resistant epilepsy. Our aim is to acquire and supply&#xD;
      useful tissue specimens for intramural NIH research projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate participants with medically intractable drug resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy who are considered for surgery to determine whether surgical specimen may be&#xD;
      available for this protocol. Surgery and standard care for these participants will be&#xD;
      performed under a separate protocol, 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. The intent of this protocol&#xD;
      is solely for procuring tissue that is resected for standard clinical care during surgery.&#xD;
      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are the research aspects of the protocol: 1) Any brain tissue that is removed and is&#xD;
      not required for diagnostic studies will be used for laboratory studies, consistent with&#xD;
      institutional guidelines. 2) Blood tests to test for immune and inflammatory mediators will&#xD;
      be performed. 3) Saliva will be collected to test for immune and inflammatory markers.&#xD;

        The participant population for this study is restricted to participants with drug resistant&#xD;
        epilepsy because they require surgery for their condition. Because the research objective&#xD;
        is to obtain specimens for neuroscience research, only participants who require a surgical&#xD;
        procedure that requires a craniotomy and removal of brain tissue will be included.&#xD;
