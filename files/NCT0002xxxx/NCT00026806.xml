  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the emotional and behavioral aspects of long-term survival of&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS among adolescents and young adults with HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals between 13 and 23 years of age may be eligible for this study. They&#xD;
      must be aware of their HIV diagnosis, have been infected for at least 13 years and have been&#xD;
      on an active NIH protocol during the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the usual stresses of growing up, children with HIV infection may have spent&#xD;
      much of their time in hospitals and may have lost parents, friends and other loved ones. This&#xD;
      study will explore psychological aspects of growing up with HIV, including self esteem,&#xD;
      possible risk behaviors, how disclosure to others changes over time, the commonness of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression, and the impact that losses have had on the adolescents' emotional&#xD;
      health. To gather this information, participants will be interviewed and asked to fill out a&#xD;
      set of forms. Caregivers will also fill out forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are not currently on an active NIH protocol will have the option of having a&#xD;
      physical examination and routine blood work. The results will be sent to their home care&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children and adolescents with HIV/AIDS are living well beyond the life expectancy that was&#xD;
      projected for them in the past. As the number of survivors of vertically or transfusion&#xD;
      associated pediatric HIV disease increases, attention to the psychosocial adjustment of these&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults becomes increasingly important. Studies in the late 1990s&#xD;
      described child and adolescent survivors as generally well adjusted, though difficulties&#xD;
      become more apparent as the child approached the age of 18. Nothing is known about these HIV&#xD;
      positive youngsters as they enter late adolescence and young adulthood. This study will&#xD;
      examine psychosocial factors associated with long-term survival of HIV/AIDS, including the&#xD;
      prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses, risk behaviors, evaluation of self competence, and the&#xD;
      impact that multiple losses has on the adolescents' emotional well-being. In addition, data&#xD;
      will be collected from the primary caregivers on the prevalence of parenting stress compared&#xD;
      to national norms. Subjects will include children who have been infected (either perinatally&#xD;
      or through transfusion) for at least eight years and who are aware of their diagnosis.&#xD;
