  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of different doses of CCI-779 in&#xD;
      treating patients who have extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy&#xD;
      use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To study the progression-free survival in patients who receive a lower or a higher dose of&#xD;
      CCI-779, a cytostatic agent following cytoreductive chemotherapy in extensive SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the toxicity of two treatment regimens involving a lower or a higher dose of&#xD;
      CCI-779.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To quantify the effects of CCI-779 treatment on p70S6 phosphorylation in peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells of patients with small cell lung cancer who are treated with CCI-779.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the effects on mTOR activation and signaling of plasma from patients treated&#xD;
      with CCI-779.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the relationship between CCI-779 dose and its pharmacodynamic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate the inhibition of p70S6 with indices of patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to brain&#xD;
      metastases (yes vs no), prior induction chemotherapy regimen (platinum and etoposide vs&#xD;
      platinum and irinotecan), and response to prior induction chemotherapy (complete or partial&#xD;
      response vs stable disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive low-dose CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment continues&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive high-dose CCI-779 as in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
