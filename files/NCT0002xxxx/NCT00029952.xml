      Although most patients with hypercortisolism can be diagnosed and treated the long-term&#xD;
      effects of hypercortisolism and its treatment are unknown. This study will attempt to answer&#xD;
      the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the rate of perioperative complications? Patients with Cushing syndrome often&#xD;
           undergo transsphenoidal surgery of the pituitary gland as treatment for the disease.&#xD;
           During this surgical procedure the pituitary gland is reached by passing through the&#xD;
           sphenoid bone. The risk for patients to develop hypopituitarism in the immediate&#xD;
           postoperative period is unknown. Patients with Cushing syndrome have abnormal levels of&#xD;
           hormones circulating in the blood and affects of the surgery are often not apparent&#xD;
           until long after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the recurrence rate? The recurrence rate of the disease has been estimated&#xD;
           between 5 - 10%. However, these figures have not been confirmed. If the actual rate of&#xD;
           recurrence is higher than estimated many patients may elect to undergo radiation therapy&#xD;
           which has a lower rate of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do any factors in the immediate postoperative period predict who will experience a&#xD;
           recurrence of Cushing syndrome?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the long-term complications of hypercortisolism? Studies have shown that&#xD;
           patients with hypercortisolism have a four times greater risk of death than people of&#xD;
           the same age without hypercortisolism. Researchers tend to believe this figure is too&#xD;
           high. However, it is well established that hypercortisolism weakens bones (decreased&#xD;
           bone density), causes secondary hypogonadism, increases levels of fat in the blood&#xD;
           (hyperlipidemia), and decreases thyroid function (hypothyroidism). The potential for&#xD;
           these conditions to be reversed is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questions will be addressed by blood and urine sampling in the postoperative period,&#xD;
      and by outpatient follow-up and periodic questionnaires in the first 10 years after curative&#xD;
      surgery for Cushing syndrome performed at the NIH.&#xD;

      Although most patients with hypercortisolism now can be diagnosed correctly and successfully&#xD;
      treated, the long-term sequelae of hypercortisolism and its treatment are unknown. This study&#xD;
      addresses the following questions: 1) What is the recurrence rate after successful treatment&#xD;
      of Cushing's syndrome? 2) Do any factors in the immediate postoperative period predict&#xD;
      recurrence of Cushing's syndrome? 3) What are the long-term complications of hypercortisolism&#xD;
      in terms of mortality, morbidity, return of endocrine function and bone density? and 4) What&#xD;
      is the quality of life for patients after surgical treatment of Cushing's syndrome? While&#xD;
      most of these questions relate specifically to the care of patients with Cushing syndrome,&#xD;
      the final question has relevance to the many patients rendered Cushingoid by the therapeutic&#xD;
      use of glucocorticoids. These questions will be addressed by blood and urine sampling in the&#xD;
      post-operative period, and by outpatient follow-up and periodic questionnaires in the first&#xD;
      20 years after curative surgery for Cushing syndrome performed at the NIH.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with Cushing syndrome documented at the NIH will be recruited into this protocol&#xD;
        prior to surgery intended to cure Cushing syndrome selectively. Thus, patients undergoing&#xD;
        transsphenoidal exploration for resection of an adenoma, or unilateral adrenalectomy for an&#xD;
        adenoma, or resection of a tumor producing ACTH ectopically will be candidates for this&#xD;
        study. We will also recruit as many of the 500 patients treated since 1983 as possible, so&#xD;
        as to have a group of &quot;late follow-up&quot; patients. These individuals will participate&#xD;
        primarily by questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematocrit about 30%. A CBC will be obtained prior to entering the study. Patients with&#xD;
        hematocrit above 30% will be accepted into the study; iron replacement will be given to&#xD;
        those patients with low TIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ages 18 - 85. Children less than 18 are being studied under other protocols and the&#xD;
        questionnaire has not been validated for younger individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the questionnaire portion of the protocol there is an additional inclusion criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to read and write in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There are no formal exclusion criteria, if the patient meets the inclusion criteria above.&#xD;
        All ethnic groups and both genders will be recruited. However, patients may be withdrawn&#xD;
        from the study by the PI if they are unable to meet study requirments, such as mailing&#xD;
        questionnaires.&#xD;
