      To determine the effects of four treatments (placebo, a vitamin E and C regimen, a hormone&#xD;
      replacement regimen, and a combined vitamin/hormone replacement regimen) on specific markers&#xD;
      of oxidative damage in coronary arteries of postmenopausal women.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental vitamin E has been associated with a reduced risk of recurrent myocardial&#xD;
      infarctions, with efficacy related to dosage and the duration of treatment. Its effects may&#xD;
      be enhanced by vitamin C, an antioxidant that can regenerate vitamin E activity.&#xD;
      Theoretically vitamin E and C (VitE/C) accumulate in the vascular wall with a concurrent&#xD;
      reduction in oxidative damage, a primary feature of atherosclerotic lesions. Estrogen/hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy (HRT) also may reduce oxidative damage, and it may enhance the effect of&#xD;
      vitamin E and C. These hypotheses are supported by studies defining oxidation-dependent&#xD;
      accumulation of lipids in developing atherosclerosis; the detection of oxidative damage&#xD;
      products, such as oxidized-LDL particles, in human atherosclerotic lesions; and clinical&#xD;
      studies associating antioxidant or estrogen supplementation with reductions in oxidative&#xD;
      damage cardiovascular disease. Nevertheless, no human studies have evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      long-term VitE/C treatment, which has been reported as being the most effective prevention&#xD;
      factor by epidemiologic studies, on specific. biochemical markers of oxidative damage and&#xD;
      concurrently their association with recurrent cardiovascular disease. In addition, no studies&#xD;
      have characterized the effect of long-term HRT on markers of oxidative damage or HRT's&#xD;
      potential synergistic effect with VitE/C therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study assayed specific biochemical measures of oxidative damage (all markers at closeout&#xD;
      and nitrotyrosine and chlorotyrosine also at baseline) in the Women's Angiographic Vitamin&#xD;
      and Estrogen (WAVE) Trial, which randomized 420 38-86 year old women with a prior&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease event to placebo, Vitamin E/C, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or&#xD;
      the combination of VitE/C and HRT. WAVE determined the efficacy of these treatments on&#xD;
      quantitative angiographic evaluation of minimal coronary artery diameter performed at&#xD;
      baseline and at the final visit to be completed during the first 10 months of 2001. The&#xD;
      ancillary study measured oxidation products from several classes of compounds (lipids by&#xD;
      F2-isoprostanes, proteins by nitrotyrosine and chlorotyrosine, and DNA by&#xD;
      8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine), thereby studying several major pathways that may lead to&#xD;
      atherogenesis. In addition, inflammation with C-reactive protein, platelet activation with&#xD;
      p-selectin, altered lipid metabolism with a lipid profile and other characteristics of the&#xD;
      study population were integrated into the assessment of oxidative damage in WAVE. By&#xD;
      measuring these various factors and by assessing oxidative damage in several classes of&#xD;
      compounds, the authors tested the relationships among specific pathways of oxidative damage,&#xD;
      supplemental VitE/C and/or HRT and other risk factors upon the progression of established&#xD;
      macrovascular disease.&#xD;
