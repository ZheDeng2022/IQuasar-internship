      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Research in NCI's Radiation Oncology Branch depends on the availability of blood and urine&#xD;
      samples from patients receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To explore the effects of radiation therapy on gene expression in white blood cells, to&#xD;
      measure radiation damage in red blood cells and to examine changes in hormone levels in the&#xD;
      blood and urine after radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients 18 years of age and older who are receiving radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples are collected when participants enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional samples may be collected at different times during and after treatment.&#xD;
           Ideally, samples are obtained before, at the completion of, and 1 month following&#xD;
           radiation therapy. Blood samples usually will be collected during routine patient&#xD;
           monitoring procedures and will not require an additional needle stick.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A total of 300 patients will be studied at the NCI in Bethesda, MD, Johns Hopkins&#xD;
           University in Baltimore and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolving research initiatives in the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) NCI, depend upon the&#xD;
      availability of blood and urine samples from patients receiving radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of planned studies include an exploration of the effects of radiotherapy on&#xD;
      peripheral leukocyte phenotype, peripheral blood protein and metabolism changes as well as&#xD;
      measurements of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol provides a means of acquiring blood and urine samples in patients receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy for a variety of conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen in the radiation oncology clinic will be asked to donate blood and/or urine&#xD;
      before, during and after their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot, exploratory study to evaluate the effects of ionizing radiation in blood&#xD;
      and/ or urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On most occasions, the blood samples will be obtained as a component of routine patient&#xD;
      monitoring and will not necessitate an additional venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine samples will be processed and stored in the Radiation Oncology Branch and&#xD;
      Basic Research Laboratory, CCR, NCI, for use in the research efforts of the branch.&#xD;
