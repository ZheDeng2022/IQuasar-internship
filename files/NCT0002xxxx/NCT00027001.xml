  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve the overall physical health and quality of life of&#xD;
      patients attached to mechanical heart devices while awaiting heart transplantation. Qigong,&#xD;
      an ancient Chinese exercise that involves active participation of the individual in the form&#xD;
      of meditation, breathing exercises and simple physical movements, is used in combination with&#xD;
      a structured exercise program. We are testing the hypotheses that Qigong, in combination with&#xD;
      a structured exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training will improve the&#xD;
      cardiovascular health and improve the quality of life of patients on mechanical heart&#xD;
      devices. To test these hypotheses, we are measuring cardiovascular function and quality of&#xD;
      life parameters in patients attached to mechanical heart devices who have participated in the&#xD;
      exercise program and have practiced Qigong, and comparing these measures to patients who&#xD;
      participated in the exercise program, but did not practice Qigong. Information gained from&#xD;
      this research will serve as a basis from which the application of exercise training and&#xD;
      Qigong can be applied to the treatment of other chronic diseases in which the physical&#xD;
      conditioning and/or quality of life of individuals is compromised.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to improve the overall physical health and quality of life of&#xD;
      patients attached to mechanical hearts or assist devices while awaiting heart&#xD;
      transplantation. Qigong, an ancient Chinese exercise that involves active participation of&#xD;
      the individual in the form of meditation, breathing exercises and simple physical movements,&#xD;
      will be used as an adjunct to the therapies, including a structured exercise program,&#xD;
      currently provided to these patients at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center.&#xD;
      Based on the results of studies that have demonstrated physiological and psychosocial&#xD;
      benefits of structured exercise programs and the practice of qigong, the following hypotheses&#xD;
      are proposed: 1) a structured exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training&#xD;
      will improve the cardiovascular health of patients on mechanical hearts and assist devices;&#xD;
      these conditioning effects will be amplified by the practice of Qigong; 2) a structured&#xD;
      exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training will improve the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients on mechanical hearts and assist devices; these conditioning effects will be&#xD;
      amplified by the practice of Qigong; 3) improved quality of life and physical conditioning&#xD;
      effected by the structured exercise program and Qigong will enhance quality of life and&#xD;
      physical conditioning after cardiac transplantation. To test these hypotheses, the following&#xD;
      specific aims will be accomplished: 1) obtain pilot data to evaluate alterations in specific&#xD;
      measures of cardiovascular function and health in patients attached to mechanical heart or&#xD;
      assist devices who have participated in a structured aerobic/resistance exercise program,&#xD;
      with and without Qigong; 2) obtain pilot data to evaluate alterations in specific quality of&#xD;
      life measures in patients attached to mechanical heart or assist devices who have&#xD;
      participated in a structured aerobic/resistance exercise program, with and without Qigong; 3)&#xD;
      as part of the clinical follow-up of these patients following heart transplantation, obtain&#xD;
      pilot data to evaluate specific parameters of cardiovascular health and quality of life of&#xD;
      individuals who were attached to mechanical heart or assist devices prior to receiving the&#xD;
      transplant. Information gained from this research will serve as a basis from which the&#xD;
      application of exercise training and Qigong can be applied to the treatment of other chronic&#xD;
      disease states in which the physical conditioning and/or quality of life of individuals is&#xD;
      compromised.&#xD;
