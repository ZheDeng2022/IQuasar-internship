  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in which&#xD;
      the donors T lymphocytes have undergone &quot;selective depletion.&quot; Certain patients with cancers&#xD;
      of the blood undergo transplantation of donated stem cells to generate new and normally&#xD;
      functioning bone marrow. In addition to producing the new bone marrow, the donor's&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes also fight any tumor cells that might have remained in the body. This attack on&#xD;
      tumor cells is called a &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot; (GVL) effect. However, another type of&#xD;
      T-lymphocyte from the donor may cause what is called &quot;graft-versus-host-disease&quot; (GVHD), in&#xD;
      which the donor cells recognize the patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response&#xD;
      to reject them. Selective depletion is a technique that was developed to remove the&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes that cause harmful GVHD, while keeping those that produce the desirable GVL&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improved prophylaxis and treatment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major&#xD;
      complication after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although the most effective way to&#xD;
      prevent GVHD is T cell depletion, this process results in poor immune function leading to&#xD;
      increased rates of relapse, graft rejection, and post-transplant infections. Ideally, a&#xD;
      method of removing GVHD- producing effector cells while retaining a broad T cell repertoire,&#xD;
      including preservation of 3rd party, antiviral and anti-tumor responses would be desirable.&#xD;
      Preclinical studies from our lab have demonstrated that alloreactive T cells can be&#xD;
      selectively removed from the donor lymphocyte pool in vitro with the use of a specific&#xD;
      immunotoxin directed against the interleukin-2 receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this clinically, we will perform nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplants in&#xD;
      older patients with hematologic malignancies. Although these patients can be cured with this&#xD;
      approach, they have significant morbidity and mortality from GVHD. At our institution,&#xD;
      nonmyeloablative transplantation is associated with an incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD of&#xD;
      approximately 50%. Although well tolerated in younger patients, patients over the age of 50&#xD;
      years have a transplant-related mortality (TRM) of approximately 35%, which is mostly related&#xD;
      to GVHD. Through selective depletion of alloreactive donor lymphocytes, we hope to reduce&#xD;
      GVHD mortality, while preserving the transplant efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive a reduced intensity preparative regimen, followed by a mobilized peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell allograft from an HLA-identical sibling donor, containing&#xD;
      &quot;selectively-depleted&quot; donor lymphocytes. To obtain such a graft, colony stimulating factor&#xD;
      (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood from the donor undergoes a positive cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation (CD34) selection followed by a negative T cell selection using the &quot;Nexell&quot;&#xD;
      Isolex 300i system. This stem cell-rich, T cell-depleted product will contain a CD34+ cell&#xD;
      dose of at least 5x10(6)/kg. The unabsorbed fraction, remaining after the positive CD34&#xD;
      selection, is then co-cultured for 72 hours with irradiated lymphocytes from the patient. The&#xD;
      immunotoxin, RFT5-SMPT-dgA, is added during the last 24 hours of culture to remove&#xD;
      alloreacting cells. The washed T cell product (CD3+ cell dose of 1-4 x 10(8)/kg) is&#xD;
      cryopreserved. Following the preparative regimen, the patient receives successive infusions&#xD;
      of the stem cell product and selected lymphocytes. All patients receive standard post&#xD;
      transplant immunosuppression with cyclosporine for a minimum of 30 days, followed by dose&#xD;
      reduction depending on the degree of donor lymphocyte chimerism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point of this study is the incidence and severity of acute GVHD. We will also&#xD;
      examine the incidence of chronic GVHD, engraftment, degree of donor-host chimerism,&#xD;
      transplant related morbidity and mortality, as well as disease-free and overall survival.&#xD;
      Stopping rules will minimize the risk of untoward or unexpected side effects.&#xD;
