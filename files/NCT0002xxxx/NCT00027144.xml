    <textblock>
      Description: The trial is designed to determine the response of the immune system of patients&#xD;
      with CML to a vaccine made from their own tumor. Researchers believe that this particular&#xD;
      vaccine, which is made from purified heat shock proteins taken from each patient's tumor,&#xD;
      alerts the body's immune system to recognize and attack invading cancer. To be considered&#xD;
      potentially eligible for this study you must have CML in the chronic phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length/Duration: Vaccinations will be administered weekly for eight weeks. One clinic follow&#xD;
      up visit will be scheduled two weeks after the final vaccination.&#xD;

      Rational for immunotherapy of CML&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptually,CML in chronic phase is the best model for immunological intervention. It is a&#xD;
      disease as a result of chromosomal translocation, which generates a true tumor-specific&#xD;
      antigen. Patients in chronic phase have relatively preserved immune function for a prolonged&#xD;
      period of time. Studies have indeed shown that peptides spanning the junctional region of&#xD;
      both the bcr/abl and abl/bcr fusion proteins can bind to major histocompatibility complex&#xD;
      (MHC) class I molecules (Berke et al. 2000). Vaccination of patients with bcr/abl breakpoint&#xD;
      fusion peptides generates specific immune responses (Pinilla-Ibarz et al. 2000). In addition,&#xD;
      for patients relapsed after bone marrow or stem cell transplant, donor lymphocyte infusion is&#xD;
      effective in inducing a majority of them into remission. The role of donor lymphocyte&#xD;
      infusion has proven the original concept of graft versus leukemia effect and the&#xD;
      effectiveness of immunotherapy, in practice, towards CML (Dazzi et al. 1999). More recently,&#xD;
      it was found that the presence of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HLA-A2-restricted&#xD;
      myeloid-specific antigen proteinase 3 correlates significantly with cytogenetic remission of&#xD;
      CML treated either with IFN or stem cell transplant (Molldrem et al. 2000), which provides&#xD;
      strong evidence for a role of T cell immunity in clearing malignant cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current proposal and hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the established roles of HSPs in T cell immunity and a large body of preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical safety data, we propose to initiate a pilot study to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      immunization with autologous tumor-derived HSP70 in the treatment of CML in chronic phase.&#xD;
      This study will facilitate more clinical trials in the future, testing the ultimate&#xD;
      hypothesis that the combination of the cytostatic therapy such as IFN and STI571, with&#xD;
      specific immunomodulator such as HSP70 offers the best chance of eradication of CML. A total&#xD;
      of 10 eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. All eligible patients will undergo&#xD;
      aphaeresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The autologous HSP70 is then&#xD;
      purified using the standard protocol. After passing the established sterility testing, the&#xD;
      patients are immunized intradermally with 50 micrograms HSP70 for a total of 8 injections in&#xD;
      2 months. They may receive their standard therapy during this time. In addition to collecting&#xD;
      the feasibility and toxicity data, the development of anti-tumor immunity will be measured&#xD;
      by,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an increase in peripheral blood of IFN-gamma producing CD8+ T-lymphocytes which are&#xD;
           reactive to the autologous bcr/abl positive peripheral mononuclear cells&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. an increase of PR-1 specific CTLs by PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer techniques in patients who are&#xD;
           HLA-A2 positive&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the change of immunophenotype of peripheral lymphocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the cytogenetic remission of Philadelphia chromosome from the bone marrow&#xD;
