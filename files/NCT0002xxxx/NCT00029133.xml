  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large multi-center, prospective, randomized trial designed to determine whether&#xD;
      mild intraoperative hypothermia results in improved neurological outcome in patients with an&#xD;
      acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who are undergoing an open craniotomy to clip their&#xD;
      aneurysms.&#xD;

      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether mild intraoperative body cooling (body&#xD;
      temperature = 33 degrees Celsius or 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit) during open neurosurgical&#xD;
      craniotomies for aneurysm clipping improves neurological outcome (measured as 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery) in patients who have suffered an aneurismal SAH. This may be the only NIH-funded&#xD;
      trial to examine the impact of an intraoperative intervention on neurological outcome&#xD;
      following any neurosurgical procedure, and is certainly the largest trial of its kind yet&#xD;
      undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many methods have been proposed to &quot;protect&quot; neurosurgical patients from neurological&#xD;
      complications that can occur during and after intracranial vascular procedures. However, no&#xD;
      treatment targeted at the intraoperative period has ever been systematically tested. Mild&#xD;
      hypothermia was chosen as the treatment to be tested after an extensive review of medical&#xD;
      literature and discussions with many anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons expert in the field&#xD;
      suggested it was the intervention most likely to be beneficial. Hypothermia is also easily&#xD;
      produced in the operating room and most anesthesiologists are familiar with managing mild&#xD;
      hypothermia. As a result, the investigators felt that a trial of hypothermia was practical&#xD;
      and reasonably safe.&#xD;

        -  Adult greater than 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-obese (body mass index less than 35kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons preoperative Grade I, II, or III patients with&#xD;
             acute SAH and scheduled to undergo open craniotomies for aneurysm clipping within 14&#xD;
             days of a documented SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There must be no contraindications to cooling (e.g., sickle cell anemia,&#xD;
             cryoglobulinemia, or severe Raynaud's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must also have pre-SAH Rankin disability scores of 0 to 1 (i.e., no serious&#xD;
             pre-existing functional disability of any kind), and a perioperative course of&#xD;
             Nimodipine (a calcium-channel blocker and the only drug known to improve outcome in&#xD;
             patients with SAH) must be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each center must have approval from their local Human Subjects Committee to&#xD;
             participate in the trial and written informed consent from either the patient,&#xD;
             next-of-kin, or legal guardian is required.&#xD;
