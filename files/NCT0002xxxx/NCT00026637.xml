      To define the benefits of antidepressant treatment or cognitive behavior therapy on mood,&#xD;
      function, and quality of life in persons with depression and refractory epilepsy.&#xD;

      This randomized clinical trial will be conducted to compare the drug sertraline to cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy on symptoms of depression, antiepileptic medication compliance, seizure&#xD;
      frequency, and quality of life outcomes in persons with depression and a seizure disorder or&#xD;
      epilepsy. Approximately 140 persons will be enrolled in this study over a period of five&#xD;
      years. Individual participation will last approximately 16 weeks. Study participants will be&#xD;
      chosen randomly to receive either the study medication (sertraline) or cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy for 16 weeks. Sertraline is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&#xD;
      Subjects who receive cognitive behavior therapy will be provided with a one-hour individual&#xD;
      session with a licensed clinical psychologist each week for 15 weeks. All study participants&#xD;
      will attend scheduled clinic visits every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Sertraline: 25-200mg PO (orally); Subjects begin at 25mg for week 1 and increase to 50mg at the beginning of week 2. Sertraline is increased in 50mg increments when subjects score in the depressed range on the CES-D, a questionnaire that is administered every 2 weeks over the 16 week intervention period. Subjects may reduce dosage if toxicity occurs.</description>
