  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to allow for the careful screening of patients and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers for participation in research protocols in the Experimental Therapeutics and&#xD;
      Pathophysiology Lab (ETPB) at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and for the&#xD;
      collection of natural history data. In addition the protocol will allow clinicians to gain&#xD;
      more experience in the use of a variety of polysomnographic and high-density EEG recordings.&#xD;
      Subjects in this protocol will undergo an evaluation which may include: a psychiatric&#xD;
      interview; a diagnostic interview; rating scales; a medical history; a physical exam; brain&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); electroencephalography (EEG); electrocardiography (EKG),&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG); blood, saliva and urine laboratory evaluation; and a request&#xD;
      for medical records. Subjects may also be asked to complete questionnaires about attitudes&#xD;
      towards research and motivation for research participation. The data collected may also be&#xD;
      linked with data from other mood and anxiety disorder protocols (e.g., brain imaging, DNA,&#xD;
      psychophysiology tests, treatment studies, etc) for the purposes of better understanding the&#xD;
      diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment response of patients with mood disorders. Parents&#xD;
      of minors will be interviewed. Upon conclusion of the screening process, subjects will either&#xD;
      be offered participation in a research protocol and will sign the appropriate informed&#xD;
      consent, or will be considered not appropriate for participation in research and will be&#xD;
      referred back into the community. The current protocol thus serves as an entry point for&#xD;
      individuals with mood or anxiety disorders or healthy volunteers to enter NIMH IRB approved&#xD;
      ETPB protocols.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be competent to comprehend the purpose of the screening process and to&#xD;
        provide written informed consent and be willing to participate in NIMH IRB approved&#xD;
        research protocols. Minors will be asked to assent and their parents will sign the consent&#xD;
        form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will undergo an evaluation which may include a psychiatric interview, medical&#xD;
        (including Tanner staging for minors), neurological, and laboratory examinations (as&#xD;
        appropriate such as EKG, EEG, renal and liver function tests, serum electrolytes,&#xD;
        urinalysis, HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C, blood levels of psychotropic drugs, pregnancy&#xD;
        testing, and urine drug screen for the presence of psychoactive drugs and drugs of abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects should have no general medical illness that is primary (i.e., appears to be&#xD;
        causing the mood disorder or anxiety disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Current alcohol or substance use or dependence (excluding nicotine) of sufficient magnitude&#xD;
        to require independent, concurrent treatment intervention (e.g., antabuse or opiate&#xD;
        treatment, but not including self-help groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Whether the minor lives with both parents or one parent, the parent(s) he/she lives with&#xD;
        must have legal custody. If a parent has shared custody, both parents must consent to&#xD;
        participate in this protocol.&#xD;
