      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the drug riluzole (RilutekÂ®&#xD;
      (Registered Trademark)) for short-term treatment of depression symptoms, such as depressed&#xD;
      mood, psychomotor retardation, and excessive sleeping. Despite the availability of a wide&#xD;
      range of antidepressant drugs, studies indicate that 30 to 40 percent of patients with major&#xD;
      depression do not respond to first-line antidepressant treatment with drugs such as&#xD;
      fluoxetine, upropion, venlafaxine and others. Riluzole, which is approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes chemical changes in&#xD;
      the brain that may also have antidepressant properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with major depressive disorder without psychotic&#xD;
      features may be eligible for this 2-stage 7-week study. Candidates will be screened with a&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, including an electrocardiogram (EKG), blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, and a psychiatric evaluation. A&#xD;
&#xD;
      blood or urine sample will be tested for illegal drugs.Women of childbearing potential will&#xD;
      have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete stage 1 of the study, which lasts 1 week, and may then continue&#xD;
      with stage 2 for an additional 6 weeks. At the start of the study, patients will be tapered&#xD;
      off all psychiatric medicines and will begin treatment with a placebo (a sugar pill&#xD;
      formulated to look like the active drug). At some point, they will be switched from placebo&#xD;
      to riluzole. In addition, participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and electrocardiograms (EKG) at the beginning and end of the study,&#xD;
           with vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and heart rate) checked daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly 1-hour interviews consisting of psychiatric and psychomotor rating scales to&#xD;
           assess treatment response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly blood tests to measure blood levels of riluzole and evaluate drug side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, participants' psychiatric status will be reassessed and appropriate&#xD;
      long-term psychiatric treatment arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages 18 to 70 with a diagnosis of major depression without psychotic features, will&#xD;
      in this pilot study (single arm, single blind) receive riluzole (50-200 mg/day) for a period&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a greater response rate using&#xD;
      specified criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will enter the study to obtain 22 subjects who complete the 6 weeks&#xD;
      of acute riluzole treatment. Therefore, if 7/22 patients or greater have greater than 50%&#xD;
      improvement on the primary efficacy measure, then based on statistically guidelines from the&#xD;
      Optimal Two Stage Design for Clinical Trials, a controlled trial would be indicated to&#xD;
      scientifically confirm the signal observed in the single arm trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major affective disorders are common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illnesses.&#xD;
      Major depression contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Impairment in physical&#xD;
      and social functioning resulting from depression can be just as severe as other chronic&#xD;
      medical illnesses. Suicide is the cause of death in 10-20% of individuals with either bipolar&#xD;
      or recurrent depressive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, clinical trials indicate&#xD;
      that 30% to 40% of patients with major depression fail to respond to first-line&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment, despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for unipolar and bipolar depression.&#xD;
      Recent preclinical studies suggest that antidepressants may exert delayed indirect effects on&#xD;
      the glutamatergic system. Furthermore, a growing body of data suggests that mood disorders&#xD;
      are associated with regional volumetric reductions, and cell loss and atrophy. It is thus&#xD;
      noteworthy that lamotrigine, which, among other effects reduces glutamate release, has&#xD;
      antidepressant effects, and a pilot study has suggested that NMDA antagonists may have&#xD;
      antidepressant effects. Together, this data suggests that the glutamatergic system may play a&#xD;
      role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and that agents, which more directly&#xD;
      reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Riluzole, an agent that is Food and Drug Administration-approved for Amyotrophic Lateral&#xD;
      Sclerosis has significant antiglutamatergic and neuroprotective properties, may prove to have&#xD;
      antidepressant properties in depressed patients. In this study, we propose to investigate the&#xD;
      potential antidepressant efficacy of riluzole, an agent which reduces glutamatergic&#xD;
      throughput via inhibition of its release, which also exerts robus neurotrophic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 6-week single-arm, single-blind study that will examine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      riluzole in patients with major depression without psychotic features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has two Study Periods. Study Period I is the washout phase that will last 7 days.&#xD;
      Study Period II is a monotherapy 6-week acute treatment phase in which the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of riluzole is compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, ages 18 to 60 with a diagnosis of major depression without psychotic features, will&#xD;
      in this pilot study (single arm, single-blind) receive riluzole (50-200 mg/day) for a period&#xD;
      of 6 weeks. Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a greater response rate using&#xD;
      specified criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 25 patients will enter the study to obtain 22 subjects who complete the 6 weeks&#xD;
      of acute riluzole treatment. Therefore if 7/22 patients or greater have greater than 50%&#xD;
      improvement on the primary efficacy measure, then based on statistically guidelines from the&#xD;
      Optimal Two Stage Design for Clinical Trials, a controlled trial would be indicated to&#xD;
      scientifically confirm the signal observed in the single arm trial.&#xD;
