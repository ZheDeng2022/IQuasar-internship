  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety, side effects and antiviral activity of different doses of&#xD;
      tenofovir DF in children and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.&#xD;
      Tenofovir DF belongs to a group of drugs called nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      inhibitors. These drugs prevent the virus from replicating (making more copies of itself).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV becomes resistant to many drugs used to fight the virus and these drugs become&#xD;
      ineffective. In laboratory tests, tenofovir DF has remained effective against HIV longer than&#xD;
      other anti-HIV medicines, and when resistance does develop, the virus may still be sensitive&#xD;
      to other drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV-infected children between the ages of 4 and 18 years who weigh at least 10 kg (22 pounds)&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. They must be able to receive antiretroviral therapy and have&#xD;
      completed at least two previous antiretroviral courses of treatment without benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon entering the study, participants will have physical, eye and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      examinations, blood tests, including tests to determine what anti-HIV drugs the patient is&#xD;
      resistant to, an echocardiogram (echo), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, head CT scan,&#xD;
      skin tests, and special tests to examine the bones. These physical exams and tests will be&#xD;
      repeated throughout the study to determine changes in health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue their current anti-HIV therapy for 2 weeks and then stop all&#xD;
      medicines for a 1-week 'washout' period. After the washout period, patients will begin taking&#xD;
      tenofovir DF. For the first 2 days on the drug, a small blood sample (1/2 teaspoon) will be&#xD;
      collected 11 times over a 48-hour period through. A heparin lock (a tube kept in place in a&#xD;
      vein) may be put in place to avoid multiple needle sticks. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      for another 4 days to measure how well tenofovir DF alone works against HIV before other&#xD;
      drugs are added to the treatment regimen. After these first 6 days, at least two other&#xD;
      anti-HIV drugs will be added. They will be selected based on the results of the earlier blood&#xD;
      tests for resistance and on the child's medication history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 days of combination therapy, patients will continue therapy on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
      They will be seen in the clinic every 4 weeks at the start of the study and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for physical exams, lab tests and other procedures as needed. The study will last&#xD;
      approximately 48 weeks. Patients who benefit from therapy may be able to continue to receive&#xD;
      tenofovir DF from the drug company sponsor or as part of another study, or the protocol for&#xD;
      this study may be amended to lengthen the treatment period.&#xD;

      This is a pediatric phase I study to determine a biologically active dose and to obtain&#xD;
      information concerning the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate (TDF, (9 - [(R)-2[[bis [[isopropoxycarbonyl) oxy] methoxy] phosphinyl]&#xD;
      -methoxy]propyl] adenine fumarate (1:1)), formerly known as PMPA prodrug, a potent nucleotide&#xD;
      analogue HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, that demonstrates antiviral activity&#xD;
      against most NRTI-resistant HIV-1. In addition to obtaining needed biological activity,&#xD;
      pediatric safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, the study will utilize tenofovir&#xD;
      DF's potent antiretroviral activity and novel resistance mutation pattern, together with&#xD;
      serial measurements of plasma HIV viral load, T-cell flow cytometry, and genotypic and&#xD;
      phenotypic viral resistance analysis to conduct pilot studies in pediatric HIV pathogenesis,&#xD;
      the response to antiretroviral therapy and to develop strategies to optimize the management&#xD;
      of pediatric antiretroviral therapy. We will also use initial viral decay dynamics and other&#xD;
      patient characteristics to model prediction for the long-term response to antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy. We will enroll children who have become refractory to or have experienced toxicity&#xD;
      on prior antiretroviral therapy. Initial viral genotyping and phenotyping will be performed&#xD;
      on the failing regimen, and this data will be used to create the most effective combination&#xD;
      regimen with tenofovir DF. After an initial 6 days of tenofovir DF monotherapy, patients will&#xD;
      receive tenofovir DF in combination with the optimal antiretroviral therapy as determined by&#xD;
      their baseline viral resistance mutation pattern and history. The patients will be followed&#xD;
      for at least 96 weeks to assess long-term tolerability and toxicity, and to assess the&#xD;
      clinical, virological, and immunological response to tenofovir DF.&#xD;
