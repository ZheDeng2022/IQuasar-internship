    <textblock>
      This study seeks to learn about brain function in adolescents with depression and to&#xD;
      determine whether adding lithium carbonate to antidepressant medication can reduce depression&#xD;
      in children and adolescents. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will examine brain chemistry and function.&#xD;

      The participants may or may not have taken a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)&#xD;
      (such as paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft) or fluoxetine (Prozac)) to treat their&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants and their parents are interviewed both individually and together with&#xD;
      questions about the child's general mood, degree of nervousness, and behavior and how family&#xD;
      members are doing. Children and adolescents will have a physical examination, blood tests,&#xD;
      and intelligence and memory evaluations. Tests include standardized questions and tasks that&#xD;
      involve looking at pictures, remembering things, testing reaction times, and making simple&#xD;
      choices. Participants spend time in a, mock MRI scanner, to become comfortable with the&#xD;
      procedure. Participants and their parents meet weekly for 2 weeks with a psychologist or&#xD;
      psychiatrist for sessions. Those who remain depressed after these two sessions will begin&#xD;
      study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who are not currently taking an SSRI will be offered paroxetine. Those already taking&#xD;
      an SSRI will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium or a placebo (non-active pill) in&#xD;
      addition to the SSRI. Treatment continues for 8 weeks. During this time, the participant and&#xD;
      parent meet with the doctor once a week and complete written and oral evaluations. Blood will&#xD;
      be drawn before medication begins and at the end of the 8-week treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      have additional blood taken after 1 week on medication to help in deciding whether dose&#xD;
      adjustment is needed. Additional blood tests might be needed later on to ensure that the dose&#xD;
      is correct. Those who improve after 8 weeks will continue treatment at NIH until&#xD;
      responsibility for their care can be assume by an outside physician. Program staff will help&#xD;
      in facilitating referrals to physicians who will monitor the medication after the child&#xD;
      leaves the study.&#xD;
