      This study will examine prostate tumor tissue cultures to try to identify genetic&#xD;
      abnormalities that contribute to the cause or progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with prostate cancer enrolled in the National Cancer Institute protocol 97-C-0147&#xD;
      (Collection of Serum and Tissue Samples from Patients with Biopsy-Proved or Suspected&#xD;
      Malignant Disease) may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens for tissue culture for this study will be obtained from tumors surgically removed&#xD;
      from patients participating in NCI protocol 97-C-0146.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of this study may lead to better methods of predicting the course of disease in&#xD;
      individual patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor in American males and the most common&#xD;
      malignancy among men in Western industrialized countries. Widespread testing for early&#xD;
      detection of prostate cancer utilizing digital rectal examination and prostate specific&#xD;
      antigen (PSA) has led to a significant clinical conundrum. Differentiating organ confined&#xD;
      indolent disease from aggressive cancer has been imperfect. Nonetheless, increased detection&#xD;
      has led to increased radical prostatectomies. A prevailing goal of the contemporary, ardent&#xD;
      research seeks to discover a molecular biomarker for prognostication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the limitations of the current knowledge of the molecular pathology of prostate cancer,&#xD;
      there are several viewpoints regarding the process of tumorigenesis. However, a generally&#xD;
      accepted hypothetical model describes normal prostatic epithelium progressing to a&#xD;
      pre-malignant or low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Then, after further&#xD;
      genetic alterations, a succession of histologically apparent adenocarcinoma--first confined,&#xD;
      then metastatic, and finally refractory to hormone treatment ensues. Current molecular&#xD;
      research has shown already complex genetics alterations at the high-grade prostatic&#xD;
      intraepithelial neoplasia stage. Thus, invasive disease represents amplification or further&#xD;
      aberration of precursor events. The seminal event or events have not been recognized and the&#xD;
      undiscovered tumor suppressor gene or proto-oncogene may be a principal tumor marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify specific, shared, consistent, chromosomal&#xD;
      rearrangements found in metaphase preparations for short-term cultures of pathologically&#xD;
      identified and scored primary prostate tumors. These, tumor specimens will be obtained from&#xD;
      patients enrolled in protocol (97-C-0147) by the NCI. Fresh tumor, taken from bi-valved&#xD;
      specimens with one half undergoing tissue pathology, will be immediately placed in growth&#xD;
      media and transferred as a coded specimen as a sample from patients selected and enrolled in&#xD;
      protocol (97-C-0147). Informed consent will be obtained by participating investigators in the&#xD;
      NCI protocol. The outcome measurement will be the characterization, or failure of&#xD;
      characterization, of specific, shared consistent, chromosomal rearrangements. Current&#xD;
      molecular cytogenetics technologies, primarily utilizing chromosomal microdissection, will be&#xD;
      employed toward this goal. Ultimately, this research may help to focus further molecular&#xD;
      studies towards the ultimate goal of finding a unique, cancer specific alteration.&#xD;
