  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the frequency and severity of problems in women with breast cancer&#xD;
      during the first year after initial medical treatment, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical impairments, such as loss of strength or flexibility, increased weight and&#xD;
           swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom distress, such as pain, fatigue and weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional limitations and disabilities, such as loss of independence in activities of&#xD;
           daily living (e.g., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving a car), work and social and&#xD;
           recreational activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will identify factors associated with these problems and try to determine their&#xD;
      relationship to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with stage I, II, III or IV breast cancer may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Participants will be drawn from patients referred to the National Naval&#xD;
      Medical Center for diagnosis and treatment during 2000-20001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be interviewed and their medical records reviewed for past medical history,&#xD;
      history of the present illness and social and recreational history. They will be seen five&#xD;
      times over a 1-year period (initial visit and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), for 30-minute&#xD;
      visits, which will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interview about past medical history and present illness, social and recreational&#xD;
           activities, functional independence at work and during activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete health survey and upper limb disability questionnaire; physical activity&#xD;
           questionnaire to be completed at 6 and 12 months after medical treatment begins. The&#xD;
           questionnaires take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper body examination, including pain measurement using a 10-point scale, an upper limb&#xD;
           lift test, and measures of upper limb volume and girth.&#xD;

      This retrospective (case-control) outcome study will investigate the frequency and severity&#xD;
      of morbidities in a population of approximately 160 patients diagnosed with breast cancer&#xD;
      before and after medical and surgical treatment. Subjects will be followed for one-year with&#xD;
      quarterly examinations (baseline [pre-medical treatment] and at 1, 3 months, 6 months, 9&#xD;
      months and 12 months after treatment). In order for cancer survivors to understand the risk&#xD;
      of impairment and functional limitations, and disability; and for health care providers to&#xD;
      determine the risk of physical impairment, functional limitations, and loss of independence&#xD;
      (morbidity) in patients with breast cancer; it is necessary to study these patients from the&#xD;
      point of diagnosis (before surgery) to a reasonable period following the completion of the&#xD;
      primary treatment program (1 year after medical treatment). Although pain, numbness, fatigue,&#xD;
      lymphedema and diminished physical function are described as prevalent and debilitating&#xD;
      conditions, remarkably few clinical studies are published describing the associated physical&#xD;
      impairments, functional limitations or on methods for their control with measures prior to&#xD;
      medical intervention and long-term follow-up. While several past reports have identified the&#xD;
      impact of medical and surgical intervention on symptom distress and functional capacity of&#xD;
      these patients, these studies do not provide sufficient evidence to identify the: 1) level of&#xD;
      physical impairment that predicts morbidity in these patients, 2) individual factors that are&#xD;
      specific predictors of morbidity in these patients, or 3) time period in which these&#xD;
      morbidities occur. The majority of previous studies investigating morbidity of patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer following medical and surgical intervention are cross-sectional, case series,&#xD;
      retrospective analysis without a comparison/control group and without baseline measures prior&#xD;
      to intervention. The proposed outcome study will include: 1) a retrospective review of&#xD;
      specific medical record information such as staging conference information and the standard&#xD;
      clinical quarterly examination during a one year period, and 2) administration of a follow-up&#xD;
      outcome questionnaire, a physical activity questionnaire and a quality of life questionnaire&#xD;
      at the 6 and 12 months time points. The outcome survey is an upper limb disability&#xD;
      questionnaire developed as an outcome measure for this project. Data available in these&#xD;
      measurement domains will allow the researchers to determine the: 1) frequency and severity&#xD;
      of: a) symptom distress (fatigue, pain including chronic pain, aching, weakness, burning,&#xD;
      tingling, numbness, anxiety, and depression) and pathological conditions (adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis, weakness and atrophy, neuropathy, scar/skin adhesions, lymphedema), b) physical&#xD;
      impairments (diminished upper extremity and trunk range of motion/flexibility, strength,&#xD;
      coordination and increased girth), and c) functional imitations and disabilities during the&#xD;
      course of the medical treatment (loss of independence in or ability to perform routine&#xD;
      activities of daily living i.e., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving an automobile, and in&#xD;
      some cases, return to their regular work, recreational and social activities). 2) level of&#xD;
      impairment at which these patients have lost independence in function and identity those&#xD;
      patients at higher risk for the loss of independence in function (e.g., ADL's).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population/Subjects: Individuals with breast cancer are identified among the patient&#xD;
        population at National Naval Medical Center (NNMC). Patients referred to the NNMC Breast&#xD;
        Care Center (NNMC-BCC) for diagnosis and management (surgical treatment and radiation&#xD;
        treatment or chemotherapy) of histologically established breast cancer (stage I, II, III,&#xD;
        or IV) during 2000-2001, are eligible to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must be over age 18. This age ensures they are post-puberty as breast cancer does&#xD;
        not occur prior to puberty; and been seen pre-surgical or medical intervention for baseline&#xD;
        measurements and agree to participate in five follow-up visits of 30 minutes in duration&#xD;
        during the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject's medical records are unavailable and clinical examination forms are incomplete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects choose not to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are unable to complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are under age 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Men are not excluded from the study.&#xD;
