  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to ensure that the HIV Prevention Trials Unit (HPTU) in Pune&#xD;
      will be able to enroll and retain participants for 2 upcoming HPTN clinical trials.&#xD;
      Specifically, this study seeks to find the rate of HIV infection and follow-up among a group&#xD;
      of high-risk, HIV-negative non-sexworker women in Pune, as well as among HIV-discordant&#xD;
      couples (couples where 1 partner is HIV-infected and the other is not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III studies of HIV prevention require the participation of a large number of people at&#xD;
      high risk for HIV infection. It is also important that these participants continue and follow&#xD;
      through with the study through the extended period of follow-up. A measurement of HIV&#xD;
      incidence and retention rate among high-risk women and HIV-discordant couples is necessary&#xD;
      for upcoming HPTN trials. Taken together with the need for estimates of HIV incidence and the&#xD;
      need for data to ensure high retention rates, this protocol is important for the HPTN&#xD;
      generally and for HPTU in Pune in particular.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous prevention-trial planning efforts have indicated that Phase III studies of HIV&#xD;
      prevention interventions will require the participation of large numbers of persons at high&#xD;
      risk for HIV infection. In addition to accruing large numbers of participants, research&#xD;
      centers conducting Phase III HIV prevention studies must retain participants in extended&#xD;
      periods of follow-up in order to accurately reflect the impact of the intervention in the&#xD;
      target population. A current measurement of HIV incidence, the risk factors associated with&#xD;
      HIV infection, and the retention rate of newly enrolled high-risk women is necessary for an&#xD;
      upcoming HPTN trial. In addition, HPTN requires an assessment of its ability to enroll and&#xD;
      retain HIV-discordant couples for a proposed HPTN trial, as well as a timely assessment of&#xD;
      the HIV incidence rate in these exposed partners. This study will provide essential&#xD;
      experience and a preliminary base for the enrollment of discordant couples into future HPTN&#xD;
      clinical trials. Taken together with the need for current estimates of HIV incidence in the&#xD;
      cohort and community populations and the need for data to ensure high retention rates, this&#xD;
      protocol is important for the HPTN generally and for HPTU in Pune in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will undergo eligibility screening, including administration of&#xD;
      a questionnaire, physical examination, and HIV antibody testing. Once participants are&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, the requirements will include follow-up every 3 months for 17.5&#xD;
      months, phlebotomy, physical exams, and questionnaires. At every follow-up visit, a short&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered to all participants to assess their continued&#xD;
      understanding about the nature, duration, benefits and risks of being in the study and to&#xD;
      assure their voluntary participation in the study. Participants seen in follow-up also will&#xD;
      have a physical examination, be evaluated and treated for any STDs, receive additional&#xD;
      counseling, and be offered retesting for HIV infection. In addition, participants also will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in additional assessment issues addressing retention using a series&#xD;
      of focus groups, key informant interviews, and individual qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      assessments. Participants in this protocol may also be eligible to enroll into 1 of 2&#xD;
      proposed ancillary laboratory substudies (HPTN 034A and 034B).&#xD;
