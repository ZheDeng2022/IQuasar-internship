  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the role of two active interventions and their placebo effects in&#xD;
      randomized control trials. The study conducts two parallel trials of treatments for upper&#xD;
      extremity pain secondary to repetitive stress disorder, including carpal tunnel syndrome. The&#xD;
      active interventions are amitriptyline and acupuncture. The placebo are sham acupuncture&#xD;
      device and placebo pill.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the magnitude of the placebo effect produced by a device is greater&#xD;
      than that produced by a pill. If this is the case, it has significant ramifications for all&#xD;
      trials involving devices and for our understanding of the role of the placebo effect in&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials (RCT). This two phase study 1)investigates the role of the&#xD;
      placebo effect in RCT's and 2)conducts two trials of treatments for persistent upper&#xD;
      extremity pain secondary to repetitive strain injury (RSI), including carpel tunnel syndrome.&#xD;
      In Phase I. 240 patients with RSI are randomly assigned to receive a placebo device (a&#xD;
      recently validated sham acupuncture device) or a placebo pill (dummy amitriptyline). Our&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that patients will respond better to the sham device than the placebo&#xD;
      pill. A finding that sham acupuncture produces a greater placebo response than a placebo pill&#xD;
      has important implications for the interpretation of results in trials that compare devices&#xD;
      to sham devices, devices to pills, and medical management to surgery. Phase II randomly&#xD;
      assigns patients from the sham acupuncture arm of Phase I to receive either TCA or continue&#xD;
      to receive the sham version. Patients in the placebo pill arm of Phase I will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either AMI or continue receiving the placebo pill. From the&#xD;
      patients'perspective, the shift in treatment assignment from Phase I to II should not be&#xD;
      noticeable. Phase II will allow us to test whether the active treatments outperform their&#xD;
      respective placebos. Both of these treatments have shown promise in small studies, but&#xD;
      neither has been prospectively studied in a large trial with appropriate controls. Because&#xD;
      Phase I also functions as a run-in period for Phase II, analysis combining both phases will&#xD;
      allow us to examine whether a run-in has methodological advantages in a device trial.&#xD;
      Moreover, combined analyses permit testing whether patients level of response to placebo in&#xD;
      Phase I affects their response to active treatment Phase II. A positive finding here would&#xD;
      contribute importantly to our understanding of the role of the placebo in RCTs.&#xD;
