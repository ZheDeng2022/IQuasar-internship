      This study will assess clinical efficacy and/or adverse effects of dietary borage oil (which&#xD;
      contains gamma-linolenic acid [GLA]) and Ginkgo biloba in patients with mild persistent to&#xD;
      moderate asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of asthma as a condition in which acute and chronic inflammatory changes in&#xD;
      airways play a fundamental role is well established. The role of leukotrienes as a crucial&#xD;
      element of these inflammatory processes is supported by abundant laboratory and clinical&#xD;
      evidence. There is a potential for herbal medicinal approaches to ameliorate&#xD;
      leukotriene-mediated inflammation in asthma based on data from the literature and our&#xD;
      laboratory. Studies suggest that dietary GLA, found in borage and evening primrose oils, is&#xD;
      unique among the (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acid family members (linolenic acid, GLA and&#xD;
      arachidonic acid) in its potential to attenuate inflammatory processes. For instance, there&#xD;
      are randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating efficacy of dietary GLA in&#xD;
      treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis and active synovitis. Ginkgo biloba, a&#xD;
      flavonoid-rich extract of leaves of the Ginkgo biloba tree, has been studied in one RCT with&#xD;
      asthma patients and is recommended by complementary and alternative practitioners as&#xD;
      treatment for allergic inflammation and asthma. Ginkgo biloba supplements have no known&#xD;
      adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will assess clinical efficacies and/or adverse effects of dietary borage oil and Ginkgo&#xD;
      biloba in patients with asthma in a 17 month RCT. We also propose to delineate whether or not&#xD;
      the clinical course of treatment correlates with suppression of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), LTC4&#xD;
      and LTD4 generated by activated polymorphonuclear cells. Additionally, in the Ginkgo biloba&#xD;
      arms of study, the in vitro/ex vivo inhibition of histamine release will be assayed, since&#xD;
      one of its major constituents, quercetin, is known to be structurally related to cromolyn&#xD;
      sodium and has been shown in vitro studies to exhibit similar activities. Furthermore,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activities of Ginkgo biloba will be compared to those of some of its&#xD;
      individual constituents in a series of in vitro experiments. It is hoped that findings from&#xD;
      these studies will evolve relatively non-toxic therapeutic alternatives for attenuating&#xD;
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in patients with asthma.&#xD;
