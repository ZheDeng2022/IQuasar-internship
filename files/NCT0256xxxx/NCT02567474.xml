      This study evaluates the effectiveness of self management programs based on 5A model on the&#xD;
      lung function status, dyspnea and exercise tolerance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      patients. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group.&#xD;
      The control group were receiving standard practice care and the intervention group were&#xD;
      receiving intervention in addition to standard practice care. The intervention content&#xD;
      include implementation of a self management plan based on 5A model.&#xD;

      5 A model implemented during a period of 12 weeks including 5 stags: assessment of behavior,&#xD;
      beliefs and motivation of the patient (Assess); provide information about personal health&#xD;
      risks and benefits of change (Advise); mutual contribution of patients and health care&#xD;
      provider on setting realistic goals based on the patient's interest and confidence in their&#xD;
      ability to change the behavior (Agree); help anticipate barriers and develop practical&#xD;
      applications based on the identified patient's strategies, problem-solving techniques and&#xD;
      social/environmental support (Assist) and specify plan for follow-up (Visits, Phone calls)&#xD;
      and providing support in the course of follow up (Arrange).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>dyspnea severity measured by dyspnea Borg scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>dyspnea was measured by dyspnea Borg scale. This scale is visual tool ranging from 0(not dyspnea) to 10(maximum dyspnea).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>exercise tolerance rate</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>exercise tolerance was measured by Six Minutes Walking Test.in this test the distance that each patient was able to walk under standard condition in 6 minutes was measured by researchers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>lung function status measured by spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>lung function was measured by spirometry. Spirometry is a test that measures how an individual inhales or exhales volumes of air as a function of time</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>quality of life was measured by SF-36 Questionnaire. It consisted of 36 questions that examine the eight quality of life dimensions, each question has a continuous quantitative scale from 0 to 100, in which higher scores indicate better situation.</description>
