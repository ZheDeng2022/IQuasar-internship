      Three hundred women with severe premenstrual syndrome will be divided into 3 groups using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. Group 1 will receiveCombined oral contraceptives (COC)&#xD;
      containing drospirenone (drospirenone 3mg+Ethinylestradiol 0.03mg) daily for 21 days starting&#xD;
      from the 3rd day of menstruation in addition to oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Group 2 will&#xD;
      receive fluoxetine 20 mg daily in addition to an oral placebo similar to COC daily for 21&#xD;
      days starting from the 3rd day of menstruation.Group 3 will receive oral placebo similar to&#xD;
      COC daily for 21 days starting from the 3rd day of menstruation in addition to a daily oral&#xD;
      placebo similar in size, color and structure to fluoxetine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) manifests with distressing physical, behavioral and psychological&#xD;
      symptoms, in the absence of organic or underlying psychiatric disease, which regularly recur&#xD;
      during luteal phase of each menstrual cycle and disappear or significantly improve by the end&#xD;
      of menstruation. Approximately 85-90 % of women may experience premenstrual emotional and&#xD;
      physical changes in their reproductive age and the prevalence of severe PMS ranges from 3% to&#xD;
      8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of PMS is unknown but cyclical ovarian activity and the effect of estradiol and&#xD;
      progesterone on serotonin and gamma-amino butyric acid are key factors. Absence of PMS before&#xD;
      puberty, in pregnancy and after the menopause supports a role of cyclical ovarian activity in&#xD;
      PMS etiology. PMS symptoms include psychological symptoms like mood swings, irritability,&#xD;
      depression and feeling out of control; physical symptoms like breast tenderness, bloating and&#xD;
      headaches; and behavioral symptoms like reduced visuospatial and cognitive ability. To&#xD;
      diagnose PMS, symptoms should be recorded prospectively over two cycles using a symptom&#xD;
      diary. Several symptom diaries exist but the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP) is&#xD;
      reliable, simple for patients and recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life style modifications like stress reduction, exercise, and low carbohydrate diet have been&#xD;
      suggested for management of PMS but have not been thoroughly investigated. Pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments of PMS include COC, serotonin reuptake inhibitors gonadotrophin-releasing hormone&#xD;
      agonists, anxiolytics, and diuretics. Various other treatments have also been recommended&#xD;
      including acupuncture, dietary supplements, and bright light therapy, PMS treatment should be&#xD;
      based on individual symptoms, concomitant medical history and the need of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to investigate the role of the combined use of fluoxetine and&#xD;
      COC versus fluoxetine in the treatment of PMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hundred women with severe premenstrual syndrome will be divided into 3 groups using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers. Group 1 will receive COC containing drospirenone&#xD;
      (drospirenone 3mg+Ethinylestradiol 0.03mg) daily for 21 days starting from the 3rd day of&#xD;
      menstruation in addition to oral fluoxetine 20 mg daily. Group 2 will receive fluoxetine 20&#xD;
      mg daily in addition to an oral placebo similar to COC daily for 21 days starting from the&#xD;
      3rd day of menstruation.Group 3 will receive oral placebo similar to COC daily for 21 days&#xD;
      starting from the 3rd day of menstruation in addition to a daily oral placebo similar in&#xD;
      size, color and structure to fluoxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To diagnose PMS women will be asked to document their symptoms daily for 2 months using the&#xD;
      daily record of severity of problems (DRSP). DRSP is a questionnaire comprised of 25 physical&#xD;
      and emotional symptoms including impairment of physical and social activities, women will be&#xD;
      asked to give a score of 1 to 6 for each symptom 1 = not at all, 2 = minimal, 3 = mild, 4 =&#xD;
      moderate, 5 = severe, 6 = extreme. The investigators will add the symptoms scores of the&#xD;
      first day of menses and PMS will be excluded if the score is&lt; 50. If the total score is&#xD;
      greater than 50, the investigators will recorded two cycles of symptoms. If more than three&#xD;
      items have an average score of more than 3 (mild) during the luteal phase, the investigators&#xD;
      will add the scores of five-day intervals during the luteal and follicular phases. PMS will&#xD;
      be diagnosed when the luteal phase score is 30 percent greater than the follicular phase&#xD;
      score in the 2 months. All women will have a psychiatric review and women with underlying&#xD;
      psychiatric disease will be excluded. Women who are unable to interact socially or&#xD;
      professionally because of the symptoms will be considered to have severe PMS. All married&#xD;
      women will be advised to use barrier contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be asked to take the medications for 6 months and record their symptoms using&#xD;
      the DRSP. Women with suboptimal social or professional interaction will be considered having&#xD;
      moderate PMS. Women with no interference with the social or professional activity will be&#xD;
      considered as having mild PMS. Women with day 1 DRSP score &lt;50 and women with average luteal&#xD;
      phase scores &lt;30% more than the average proliferative scores will not be considered having&#xD;
      PMS.&#xD;
