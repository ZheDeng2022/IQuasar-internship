  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 13,000 participants are diagnosed with melanoma in the UK each year and that number is&#xD;
      growing quicker than any other cancer. About 20% of participants will see their cancer return&#xD;
      following their initial treatment and at present would survive a median time of 912 months.&#xD;
      In recent years, the development of new effective drugs has revolutionised the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced melanoma, However, response rates are still low and new therapeutic approaches are&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II study to look at the effectiveness and safety of the combination of a new&#xD;
      drug called pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy compared to pembrolizumab alone. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to see if the addition of radiotherapy to pembrolizumab is better than&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone by measuring how long these treatments can control the growth of the&#xD;
      cancer. Also it will assess if by adding radiotherapy the investigators can see its effects&#xD;
      not only in the tumour that has had radiotherapy but also in other tumours in the rest of the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Risk and burden for participants Participants in this study have cancer but may still be&#xD;
           eligible for standard therapy and may not show any benefit from the trial drug. If this&#xD;
           is the case will be withdrawn from the trial and will receive standard care. The study&#xD;
           itself carries a number of potential burdens:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study drug and Radiotherapy. Although the dose and safety effects of the drug have&#xD;
                been previously assessed in phase I trials and the radiotherapy used is considered&#xD;
                standard of care, it is possible for participants to experience some side effects.&#xD;
                To ensure any side effects are treated appropriately all participants will be&#xD;
                reviewed regularly by experienced clinicians while having the study treatment.&#xD;
                Comprehensive assessments for safety will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Burden of frequent hospital visits and tests. Participants in this study must&#xD;
                attend hospital every 3 weeks to check for any side effects of the drug, have&#xD;
                routine blood and clinical biochemistry tests, clinical examinations and administer&#xD;
                the next dose of pembrolizumab. Additionally, for research purposes some&#xD;
                participants may consent to have additional tumour biopsies and blood tests. These&#xD;
                will not be mandatory for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment Participants will be offered information about this study by their clinical&#xD;
           teams if they are considered to meet the entry criteria and express interest in taking&#xD;
           part in the study. It will be made clear that there will not necessarily be a&#xD;
           therapeutic benefit from taking part in the study. It will also be made clear that,&#xD;
           should participants decide not to take part their future care will not be affected.&#xD;
           Participants will be given sufficient time and information to make an informed decision&#xD;
           about entering the trial, all participants entering the trial will give written informed&#xD;
           consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confidentiality Participants will be linked to a unique identifier the code for which&#xD;
           will be held on a password protected database held only by the study team. This study&#xD;
           will run across twenty two hospital sites. Tumour data will be analysed at Manchester&#xD;
           University and research blood will be analysed at Leeds University. Sample processing&#xD;
           will take place using the trial ID only. No other patient identifiable information will&#xD;
           be available on study samples. Investigators will have access to patient identifiable&#xD;
           information on password protected NHS hospital notes and databases only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Conflict of Interest Participants may be recruited to the study by those involved in&#xD;
           their prior clinical care. Investigators do not expect conflict of interest between&#xD;
           research and healthcare duties for a number of reasons: participants must give their&#xD;
           full informed consent before entering the study, specifically regarding the unknown&#xD;
           efficacy of the study drug. Those participants who do not continue in the study will&#xD;
           maintain a relationship with the clinical team if required for symptom control. At the&#xD;
           end of the study, participants will be able to access the results if they wish, through&#xD;
           the Royal Marsden Website. They will also be sent a written summary of the results if&#xD;
           they indicate this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Use of tissue samples in future research If participants give their consent, any&#xD;
           leftover blood or tissue samples which are not required for this study will be stored&#xD;
           for future unspecified research in line with the human tissue act regulations. Access&#xD;
           and use of samples for research purposes will require appropriate ethical approval.&#xD;
           Future researchers will not be able to identify individual participants from their&#xD;
           biobank data, demographic and clinical information will be available.&#xD;
