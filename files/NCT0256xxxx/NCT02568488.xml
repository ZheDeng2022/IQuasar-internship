  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty eight PCOS patients were included . The diagnosis of PCOS was made based on the three&#xD;
      criteria set by the Rotterdam Consensus meeting definition of PCOS (ESHRE, ASRM, 2004). The&#xD;
      criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. history of chronic anovulation defined as cycle length &gt; 35 days, or less than 9 cycles&#xD;
           per year or amenorrhoea (cycle length &gt; 12wks),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. infertility with hirsutism or acne or elevation of one or more of serum androgen levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ultrasonographic findings of polycystic ovaries ( increased ovarian volume, more than&#xD;
           eight follicles in an ovary ranging from 2-10mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the studied subjects were to receive metformin 850 mg twice daily over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at the start of the study, before receiving metformin, where&#xD;
      baseline serum insulin (fasting and 2 hr postprandial), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) ,&#xD;
      total and free testosterone, Dihydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEAS) and Antimullerian&#xD;
      Hormone (AMH) were obtained before starting metformin. Blood samples were collected at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months respectively of metformin treatment , to asses its effect on serum levels of the&#xD;
      previously mentioned hormonal parameters.&#xD;

      Forty eight PCOS patients attending the OBGYN clinic at kasr al aini were included in the&#xD;
      study. The diagnosis of PCOS was made based on the three criteria set by the Rotterdam&#xD;
      Consensus meeting definition of PCOS (ESHRE, ASRM, 2004). The criteria were as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. history of chronic anovulation defined as cycle length &gt; 35 days, or less than 9 cycles&#xD;
           per year or amenorrhoea (cycle length &gt; 12wks),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. infertility with hirsutism or acne or elevation of one or more of serum androgen levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ultrasonographic findings of polycystic ovaries ( increased ovarian volume, more than&#xD;
           eight follicles in an ovary ranging from 2-10mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      the studied subjects were to receive metformin 850 mg twice daily over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected at the start of the study, before receiving metformin, where&#xD;
      baseline serum insulin (fasting and 2 hr postprandial), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) ,&#xD;
      total and free testosterone, Dihydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEAS) and Antimullerian&#xD;
      Hormone (AMH) were obtained before starting metformin. Blood samples were collected at 3 and&#xD;
      6 months respectively of metformin treatment , to asses its effect on serum levels of the&#xD;
      previously mentioned hormonal parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of metformin on PCOS patients regarding its clinical and radiological parameters&#xD;
      was also assessed. Each patient was asked to keep a diary of her menstrual periods over the&#xD;
      study period; to elicit if there could be an effect by metformin on the regulation of&#xD;
      menstrual cycles secondary to improvement of ovarian function as a result of improving&#xD;
      insulin resistance in such patients. The effect of metformin on ovarian morphology by&#xD;
      ultrasound was also assessed at baseline, 3months and 6 months of the study period; ovarian&#xD;
      volume and number of follicles was noted down at each visit.&#xD;
