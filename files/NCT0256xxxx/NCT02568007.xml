      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of standard dosing of cyproheptadine for&#xD;
      both cycled and continuous administration, as compared to no medication, on appetite&#xD;
      stimulation and growth in the pediatric gastroenterology feeding team patient population. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to evaluate the effect, if any, of the suspected tachyphylaxis that is&#xD;
      commonly associated with cyproheptadine use. The third aim will be to examine the type and&#xD;
      duration of side effects of cyproheptadine in this population. The ultimate goal will be to&#xD;
      create a standardized protocol for cyproheptadine therapy in children with feeding disorders&#xD;
      and suboptimal growth.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE, AND RATIONALE Failure to thrive or inadequate weight gain is a&#xD;
      frequent complaint amongst patients seen by general pediatricians and pediatric&#xD;
      gastroenterologists. The reasons behind this diagnosis vary widely including, but not limited&#xD;
      to feeding disorders of diverse etiologies, poor environmental structure and inadequate&#xD;
      intake, medication side effects, swallowing disorders, and a variety of underlying organic&#xD;
      diseases. For most feeding disorders, behavioral feeding techniques and strategies to&#xD;
      increase caloric intake is utilized to correct the suboptimal growth. However, feeding&#xD;
      disorders are sometimes so imprinted that behavioral interventions may be insufficient to&#xD;
      promote ideal growth or, if sufficient for growth, are inadequate in helping children avoid&#xD;
      or graduate from nutritional support such as enteral tubes. For this reason, medications that&#xD;
      promote and stimulate appetite and weight gain are frequently used in children with feeding&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In pediatric gastroenterology practice, cyproheptadine is the most commonly used drug for&#xD;
      appetite stimulation, weight gain, and feeding intolerance in younger children with feeding&#xD;
      disorders. A first generation histamine and serotonin antagonist, cyproheptadine is thought&#xD;
      to promote appetite stimulation and weight gain by increasing insulin-like growth factor-1&#xD;
      (IGF-1) concentration. It may also interact with receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus&#xD;
      and exert hormonal effects. While the exact mechanism of action is still being investigated,&#xD;
      several studies have evaluated the benefits of cyproheptadine in select patient groups,&#xD;
      including patients with cystic fibrosis, cancer, undernourished children, and children with&#xD;
      feeding disorders. These studies have all reported that cyproheptadine promotes weight gain&#xD;
      and stimulates appetite. Reported side effects of cyproheptadine in these studies are&#xD;
      primarily related to drowsiness which tends to significantly improve or resolve within two&#xD;
      weeks of use. Another undesired effect is the development of drug tolerance, i.e.&#xD;
      tachyphylaxis. To avoid this, it is common clinical practice to cycle on and off the&#xD;
      medication a few weeks each month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While a few studies report outcomes of the use of cyproheptadine in children with feeding&#xD;
      disorders or failure to thrive, these studies have enrolled only small patient cohorts and&#xD;
      there are no randomized trials in children enrolled in a feeding team program. Two recent&#xD;
      studies examined the role of cyproheptadine in patients who are undernourished or followed in&#xD;
      pediatric feeding programs. However, a randomized study examining the effects of continuous&#xD;
      cyproheptadine versus a fixed cycled medication dosing versus abstaining from medication has&#xD;
      not been performed in the pediatric gastroenterology population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Participants in Study: The total number of patients required for this study is 75&#xD;
      (25 in each group). The groups consist of three treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. continuous use of cyproheptadine&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cycled cyproheptadine or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. no drug intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number was derived from looking at past statistical data from other studies and using&#xD;
      similar power, alpha error, and beta error. Investigators used Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      analysis for multiple groups looking at repeat measures within factors. Alpha error was 0.05,&#xD;
      Power 0.95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: The following categories of data will be collected (see subsections list&#xD;
      below): medical record number (MRN), demographics, feeding behavior, side effects experience&#xD;
      from use cyproheptadine, 24 hour diet recalls, medical history, and anthropometrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic Information: Data will be collected as part of the demographics questionnaire.&#xD;
      This includes participant's age, sex, ethnicity, identification of primary caretaker,&#xD;
      caretaker's relation to participant, caretaker education level, and caretaker marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feeding Behavior Questionnaire: Patients/parents will complete the Mealtime Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MBQ). Participants' guardians will complete the Mealtime Behavior&#xD;
      Questionnaire (MBQ). This is a validated, 31-item, parent-report questionnaire assessing the&#xD;
      mealtime behavior structure in young children above 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire measures variables including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. food refusals/avoidance&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. food manipulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. mealtime aggression and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. choking/gagging/vomiting related to meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each behavior is assigned a frequency scale with 1 corresponding to &quot;never&quot; and 5&#xD;
      corresponding to &quot;always.&quot; The MBQ then consist of a total score and four subcategory scores&#xD;
      (listed above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 Hour Diet Recall: Guardians of participants will be questioned weekly regarding oral&#xD;
      intake (type of food consumed and amount) over the past 24 hrs. Caloric intake will be&#xD;
      calculated based on these recalls and compared across duration of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine Side Effect Questionnaire: Guardians will undergo weekly questionnaire looking&#xD;
      at common side effects of cyproheptadine. A list of side effects will be read to the&#xD;
      participant's guardians with positive (yes) or negative (no) replies if the participant has&#xD;
      experienced individual side effects since the last survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Information: Data collected will include anthropometrics at initial and final visit&#xD;
      (weight, height, BMI, mid-arm circumference, upper arm skin fold), current and past medical&#xD;
      diagnoses and surgeries, current medications, current gastrointestinal symptoms, dependence&#xD;
      on tube feeds&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK CATEGORY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research not involving greater than minimal risk to the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF CYPROHEPTADINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine has both antihistamine and antiserotonergic and has side effects related to&#xD;
      these mechanisms. These side effects include drowsiness or sleepiness, confusion, excitement,&#xD;
      fatigue, insomnia, hallucinations, blurred vision, tinnitus, dizziness, tachycardia, increase&#xD;
      perspiration, appetite stimulation, weight gain, constipation, diarrhea, changes in frequency&#xD;
      of urination, thickening of secretions, and dry mucus membranes. Over-dosage can results in&#xD;
      atropine-like effects as well as central nervous depression, convulsions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECURITY OF DATA COLLECTED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All investigators have received Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&#xD;
      training and a certificate of completion for the Collaborative Institutional Training&#xD;
      Initiative (CITI) training course on the protection of human research subjects before&#xD;
      starting the review. Information derived from questionnaires, data collection will be&#xD;
      compiled on one central data collection form. These forms will be coded (have a special&#xD;
      identifier number that is linked to patient's MRN). The central database used for data&#xD;
      collection will be password protected. A separate secure (password protected) database will&#xD;
      link the coding number to the patient's MRN. Only the principal investigator (PI),&#xD;
      co-investigators and the members of the study team will be gathering the data and have access&#xD;
      to the study database. Paper records will be locked in file cabinets within the&#xD;
      Gastroenterology office area and electronic records will be stored in password-protected&#xD;
      computers. Each subject's identifying number and related electronic data will be kept on a&#xD;
      secured, password-protected database that provides access only to the PI and research staff.&#xD;
      Only authorized research personnel will have access to the databases and paper records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROVISION FOR THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY OF SUBJECTS (confidentiality, health and financial&#xD;
      risks) AND TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored on Medical College of Wisconsin secured shared drives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROVISIONS FOR MONITORING DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS; AND ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO&#xD;
      PROTECT THE RIGHTS AND WELFARE OF SUBJECTS WHO ARE LIKELY TO BE VULNERABLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PI will monitor the health of all patients in the study per standard clinical practice.&#xD;
      Primary and Co-investigators will monitor protocol adherence and supervise data collection,&#xD;
      entry, and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL (value or desired outcome / advantage) TO&#xD;
      HUMAN RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS AND SOCIETY (medical, psychosocial, altruistic) Anticipated&#xD;
      direct benefits of this study include the improvement in appetite/behavior and growth amongst&#xD;
      the patients receiving cyproheptadine. These benefits may also be present in group abstaining&#xD;
      from cyproheptadine due to standard education that is given to all groups. However, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate these benefits to be significantly lower in this group as compared&#xD;
      to patients who are on cyproheptadine. Long-term benefits include the creation and&#xD;
      utilization of a protocol outlining the use of cyproheptadine in feeding team patients. The&#xD;
      results of this study will also address the side effect profile of cyproheptadine in this&#xD;
      population. It may also further investigators' knowledge of the treatment approaches that are&#xD;
      most successful, allowing physicians to develop standardized care to better serve these&#xD;
      patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STOPPING POINTS THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW THE STUDY TO CONTINUE AS PROPOSED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping points for the study include achieving adequate information on enough of the goal&#xD;
      subjects, inability to obtain enough data, or patients/caregivers electing to discontinue the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESCRIBE HOW THE CONSENT (AND ASSENT, IF APPLICABLE) PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE. INCLUDE A LIST&#xD;
      OF APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO WILL BE INVOLVED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent for participation will be obtained from guardians for their child's&#xD;
      participation. Consent will be obtained by study personnel at the participant's appointment&#xD;
      in the GI Clinic. Participants' consent will allow for accessing information collected for&#xD;
      program evaluation/clinical purposes. Participants' guardians will have the option of having&#xD;
      the consent document read aloud to them to facilitate understanding. Copies of signed consent&#xD;
      documents will be given to participants' guardians. Consent will be obtained by the study's&#xD;
      principal investigator, co-investigators, or members of the research team. As additional&#xD;
      research staff or team members are added, their names will be submitted to the International&#xD;
      Review Board (IRB) as a protocol amendment to allow them to obtain consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING DATA (including a power analysis) AND THE ANTICIPATED&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY Analyses will be conducted with Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Statistical Analysis System (SAS) software programs.&#xD;
      Probability levels of &lt; .05 will be used as cut offs for statistical significance.&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses will examine distribution normality and the extent to which parametric&#xD;
      test assumptions are met. Descriptive analyses will also provide summary information about&#xD;
      participant characteristics. Pearson correlations will be used to examine relationships&#xD;
      between continuous variables, while chi square analyses will examine associations between&#xD;
      categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key significance of this study is the analysis of the effect that cyproheptadine has on&#xD;
      stimulating weight gain and improving behaviors associated with feeding. In addition, it will&#xD;
      help give clear comparison between the use of continuous versus cycled cyproheptadine.&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine has been suspected to have tachyphylaxis after a couple weeks and many&#xD;
      practitioners implement cycling of medication without clear evidence supporting this&#xD;
      practice. Investigators expect after this study to be able to design a protocol regarding use&#xD;
      of cyproheptadine in feeding team patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no financial relationships or interests to disclose.&#xD;
