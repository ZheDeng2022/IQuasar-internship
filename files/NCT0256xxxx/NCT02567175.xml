    <textblock>
      FDA currently allows patients 12 years of age and older with various gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      conditions to be treated with Domperidone through the Expanded Access to Investigational&#xD;
      Drugs program. These conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease with upper GI&#xD;
      symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation. Patients must have failed standard&#xD;
      therapies to be eligible to receive Domperidone. This program facilitates availability of&#xD;
      investigational drugs, (such as Domperidone) to patients with serious diseases or conditions&#xD;
      when there is no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor, or&#xD;
      treat the patient's disease or condition.&#xD;

      Expanded Access Program Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the Expanded Access Program is to provide oral Domperidone to patients' â‰¥12&#xD;
      years of age where, according to the investigator's judgment, a prokinetic effect is needed&#xD;
      for the relief of refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease with upper gastrointestinal (GI)&#xD;
      symptoms, gastroparesis, and chronic constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Expanded Access Program is to allow the use of Domperidone by patients&#xD;
      with gastrointestinal disorders who have failed standard therapy. Failed standard therapy can&#xD;
      be constituted by the following treatments: PPI Therapy, Erythromycin, allergy to&#xD;
      medications. Subject must be on these therapies for a time period of 1 month before they are&#xD;
      considered to be ineffective.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female&#xD;
&#xD;

          3. Symptoms or manifestations secondary to GERD (e.g., persistent esophagitis, heartburn,&#xD;
             upper airway signs or symptoms or respiratory symptoms), gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
             disorders such as nausea, vomiting, severe dyspepsia or severe chronic constipation&#xD;
             that are refractory to standard therapy. Failed standard therapy can be constituted by&#xD;
             the following treatments: PPI Therapy, Erythromycin, allergy to medications. Subject&#xD;
             must be on these therapies for a time period of 1 month before they are considered to&#xD;
             be ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have a comprehensive evaluation to eliminate other causes of their&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient or Parent/Legal Guardian has signed informed consent and child assent (as&#xD;
             appropriate) for the administration of Domperidone that informs the patient of&#xD;
             potential adverse events including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  increased prolactin levels&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  extrapyramidal side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  breast changes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  cardiac arrhythmias including QT prolongation and death&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There is a potential for increased risk of adverse events with the drugs listed&#xD;
                  in the Domperidone protocol addendum (see Appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with a weight &gt; 35kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients are able to swallow the Domperidone pill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History of, or current, arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular&#xD;
             fibrillation and Torsade des Pointes. Patients with minor forms of ectopy (PACs) are&#xD;
             not necessarily excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinically significant bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or heart block. Prolonged&#xD;
             QTc (QTc&gt; 450 milliseconds for males, QTc&gt;470 milliseconds for females).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Hepatic dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Renal insufficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant electrolyte disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage or obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Presence of a prolactinoma (prolactin-releasing pituitary tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Pregnant or breast feeding female&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known allergy to Domperidone&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The use of medications that interact with Domperidone. a. Subjects may be required to&#xD;
             stop use (wash-out) of medications that interact with Domperidone. If the subject is&#xD;
             not willing or able to stop use of the interacting medication, they may be excluded or&#xD;
             withdrawn from the study at the investigator's discretion. Based on the medication the&#xD;
             subject may be required to stop-use or wash out from, the PI will determine the&#xD;
             appropriate washout period using clinical judgment. Some medications may require much&#xD;
             longer washout periods than others, and this will be explained to each respective&#xD;
             subject that requires stopping a medication.&#xD;
