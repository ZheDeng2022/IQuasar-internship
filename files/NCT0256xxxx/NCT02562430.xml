      In summary, the proposed research is novel with respect to design, technology, and its&#xD;
      multi-level integration probing psychological and neurobiological constructs assumed to be&#xD;
      crucially implicated in placebo response and has significant clinical and research&#xD;
      implications for the future. Specifically, the future implications include: 1) identification&#xD;
      of biomarkers and biosignatures of placebo responders, 2) new possibilities to understanding&#xD;
      and manipulating the system, 3) possibly decreasing or eliminating a major confounder in&#xD;
      clinical trials and drug development, and 4) refining treatments with novel drugs that&#xD;
      decrease (in clinical trial) or increase (in clinical practice) the placebo response.&#xD;

      The objective of this pilot study is to investigate possible dopaminergic mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying the placebo response in MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that mesolimbic DA mechanisms implicated in reward anticipation, reinforcement&#xD;
      learning, and expectation play a critical role in mediating placebo responses in MDD. A&#xD;
      better understanding of the neurobiological basis of placebo has enormous potential on&#xD;
      different levels. On a clinical level, the understanding of placebo mechanisms could lead to&#xD;
      a number of applications for therapeutic purposes, such as developing drugs that could&#xD;
      enhance the effects of a therapeutic relationship or accelerate the onset of action of an&#xD;
      antidepressant by manipulating the placebo-related mechanisms, even if the patient is&#xD;
      hopeless or severely anhedonic. On a level of clinical trial innovation, if we confirm the&#xD;
      role of dopamine in placebo response and we comprehend how the placebo response&#xD;
      mechanistically takes place, this could lead to developing new drugs that could block the&#xD;
      placebo effects in clinical trial participants and greatly decrease if not eliminate the&#xD;
      placebo effect nested even in those subject who are drug responders, therefore increasing the&#xD;
      effect size and decreasing the sample size of studies. Moreover if we can identify&#xD;
      biosignatures of placebo effect and use them to predict response, we could potentially enrich&#xD;
      samples with subjects who are less likely to be placebo responders and again this would&#xD;
      result in increased signal detection in a clinical trial. Finally, with this initial study we&#xD;
      plan to lay the foundation for other studies to investigate how this dopaminergic circuitry&#xD;
      is affected by other treatments, such as psychotherapy, and what are the changes that are&#xD;
      similar or different between antidepressants, placebo and specific forms of psychotherapy,&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroconvulsive therapy or deep brain stimulation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for MDD, the following conditions must be&#xD;
        met for patient eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Men or women aged 18 to 60 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A score of 16 or greater on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale -32 items (HAM-D- 32)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Continuing to meet criteria for current MDD at baseline and Clinical Global Impression&#xD;
             Improvement (CGI) scores ≤ 3 (i.e. minimally improved or less) from the screen to the&#xD;
             baseline visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Only one failed one prior antidepressant in the current episode or are currently&#xD;
             taking an antidepressant as defined by the MGH-ATRQ, in the current episode and are&#xD;
             willing to take bupropion or placebo as augmentation, since we are using subjects as&#xD;
             their own controls and we are comparing changes within subjects. Subjects with&#xD;
             secondary anxiety disorders, like panic, GAD or simple phobia will be allowed, in&#xD;
             order to make the population studied more representative of the general population of&#xD;
             MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential not using a medically accepted&#xD;
             means of contraception.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Any history of abuse of stimulants or opiates.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Currently taking any exclusionary medications (i.e., antipsychotics, anticonvulsants,&#xD;
             stimulants, dopaminergic agents), potential augmenting agents (e.g., T3, SAMe, St.&#xD;
             John's Wort, lithium,). Gabapentin and pregabalin are allowed. Patients must have&#xD;
             either no antidepressant treatment or stable (for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;

             are excluded. Concomitant use of trazodone (up to 200 mg daily) is allowed. In&#xD;
             agreement with patient's treating provider and under clinical monitoring, exclusionary&#xD;
             drugs can be tapered and washed out prior to baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any investigational psychotropic drug within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have not responded to two or more antidepressant trials of adequate doses&#xD;
             (e.g., fluoxetine 40 mg/day or higher) and duration (e.g., ≥6 weeks) over the past&#xD;
             five years according to the ATRQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of inadequate response/poor tolerability to bupropion.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with medical contraindications to bupropion (e.g., history of seizures,&#xD;
             uncontrolled electrolyte imbalance due to eating disorders, etc.) unless stable for 8&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Any unstable concomitant form of psychotherapy (depression-focused). Concomitant&#xD;
             psychotherapy would be allowed if the frequency and the modality have been stable for&#xD;
             the 8 weeks prior to screening and there will be no changes during the participation&#xD;
