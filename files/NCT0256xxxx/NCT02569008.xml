      This study evaluate the effect of different doses of crystalloids on the changes on cardiac&#xD;
      output (CO) and on the proportion of responders and non-responders and aims to determine the&#xD;
      minimal volume required to increase the mean systemic filling pressures (Pmsf) in&#xD;
      post-cardiac surgical patients.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if different doses of fluids in a fluid challenge affect the change in CO&#xD;
           and the proportion of responders / non-responders&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the minimal amount of volume required for performing an effective fluid&#xD;
           challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To define the least significant change of the Pmsf measured by Pmsf-arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To define the stop-flow time required to measure Pmsf-arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study the changes generated by a fluid challenge in the microcirculation and&#xD;
           correlate those changes with the changes in the Pmsf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TYPE OF STUDY This is an quasi-randomised open-label study. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
           non-commercial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OF MINIMAL VOLUME Once the participant is admitted to the ICU, and the monitors&#xD;
           are in place, the fluid challenge will be administered. Each fluid challenge will be&#xD;
           administered with a syringe (50 ml) in five minutes. In order to observe the effect of&#xD;
           the volume on Pmsf-arm, the total sample of patients will be divided in 4 groups: in&#xD;
           group one Pmsf-arm will be measured at baseline and after 1 ml/kg of body weight; in&#xD;
           group 2 after 2 ml/Kg; in group 3 after 3 ml/kg and finally in group 4 after 4 ml/Kg.&#xD;
           The fluid challenge will be completed in everybody after the measurement of Pmsf-arm, in&#xD;
           order to respect clinical practice. Pmsa will be observed also. The total duration of&#xD;
           the fluid challenge will be 5 minutes. The fluid challenge will be repeated in&#xD;
           accordance with the clinical protocol or with the clinician advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first 20 patients will receive 4 ml/kg (normal clinical practice) between the base&#xD;
           line and the second measurement of Pmsf-arm. The subsequent 20 patients will receive&#xD;
           3ml/kg between the two measurements of Pmsf-arm, and then 1ml/kg will be added to&#xD;
           complete the normal fluid challenge. The following 20 patients will receive 2 ml/Kg&#xD;
           between the two measurement of Pmsf-arm, and then the remaining 2 ml/kg will be given to&#xD;
           complete the normal fluid challenge. And finally, the last 20 patients will receive 1&#xD;
           ml/kg between the two measurements of Pmsf-arm, and 3 ml/kg will be added to complete&#xD;
           clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY OF MICROCIRCULATION In 25 patients, functional capillary density (FCD)&#xD;
           microvascular flow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) and microvascular&#xD;
           heterogeneity index (MHI) will be measured with a side-stream dark-field (SDF) camera at&#xD;
           five time points: (1)Baseline, (2) At the end of the fluid challenge (4 ml / kg in 5&#xD;
           minutes), (3) 5 minutes after the end of the fluid challenge, (4) 10 minutes after the&#xD;
           end of the fluid challenge, (5) 15 minutes after the end of the fluid challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The ventilation settings, sedation and vasoactive support will be kept constant during&#xD;
           the study period, unless other clinical instruction, in which case the data will be&#xD;
           excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HAEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 CLINICAL MONITORING These measurements are using normally in clinical practice and will&#xD;
      be used during the study but do not constitute any change in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean arterial pressure (MAP) will be measured with a radial artery catheter (p.e.&#xD;
           115.090 Vygon, Ecouen, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Central venous pressure (CVP) will be measured with a venous central catheter (p.e.&#xD;
           CV-15854, Arrow International, Reading, USA) inserted in the internal jugular vein or&#xD;
           the subclavian vein. This line will be ideally inserted in the anaesthetic room after&#xD;
           induction of general anaesthesia. Once the study finishes, this line will be removed&#xD;
           unless the clinical team taking care of the patient decided to use it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both catheters will be connected to a pressure transducer (T001650A, Edwards&#xD;
           Lifesciences LLC, Irvine, USA) and to a multi-parameter monitor (InfinityTM Delta,&#xD;
           Dragger Medical Systems, USA). Zero levels of blood pressures were referenced to the&#xD;
           intersection of the anterior axillary line and the fifth intercostal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac output will be monitored using LiDCO TM plus (LiDCO Ltd, Cambridge, UK)&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 DETERMINATION OF PMSF-ARM Pmsf can be estimated measuring the venous pressure (Pv) and&#xD;
      the arterial pressure (Pa) in on limb after rapid vascular occlusion. This estimation assumes&#xD;
      Pa and Pv equilibrium following a rapid vascular occlusion as described by Maas et al[2]. In&#xD;
      order to determine stop-flow time (or time of arterial / venous balance), we will perform a&#xD;
      pilot study in 10 patients. We will measure the radial arterial pressure and venous pressure&#xD;
      in the same hand and we will then stop the blood-ï¬‚ow during 30 -60 seconds using an automatic&#xD;
      pneumatic tourniquet (APT pneumatic tourniquet, Anetic Aid, Ltd. Guiseley, UK) to pressures&#xD;
      50 mmHg above systolic pressure. Measures will be taken three times in order to assess&#xD;
      repeatability. The time required to equilibrate arterial and venous pressure will be the&#xD;
      stop-flow time, and will be the time that we need to wait with the tourniquet inflated. In&#xD;
      Maas study was between 25 - 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 MICROCIRCULATION MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study microcirculatory changes, sublingual microcirculatory videos will be&#xD;
      obtained using a side-stream dark field-imaging device (SDF; Microscan, MicroVissionMedical,&#xD;
      Amsterdam, the Nederlands) derived from the orthogonal polarized spectral imaging technology.&#xD;
      Images acquisition and analysis will be performed according international recommendations [3]&#xD;
      with dedicated software analysis (Automated Vascular Analysis (AVA) v. 1.0; Academic Medical&#xD;
      Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Nederlands). These recommendations are&#xD;
      summarised below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Image acquisition will include five sublingual good quality sequences of 20 seconds each&#xD;
           at every observation time-point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scoring will include measurement of perfused capillary density and evaluation of&#xD;
           heterogeneity. We will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Functional capillary density (FCD): this can be calculated counting the number of&#xD;
                intersection of capillaries with arbitrary grid lines and measurement of total&#xD;
                capillary length relative to image area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Microcirculatory flow index (MFI): this is based on determination of the&#xD;
                predominant type of flow in four quadrants. Flow is characterised as absent (0),&#xD;
                intermittent (1), sluggish (2) or normal (3). The values of the four quadrants is&#xD;
                averaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Proportion of perfused vessels (PPV %): calculated as the total number of vessels&#xD;
                minus the number of vessels with intermittent flow or no flow divided by the total&#xD;
                number of vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Flow heterogeneity index (FHI): the difference between the highest MFI minus the&#xD;
                lowest site MFI divided by the mean flow velocity of all sublingual sites at a&#xD;
                single time point.&#xD;
