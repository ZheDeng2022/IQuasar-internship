      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody (mAb)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the VRC01 antibody in&#xD;
      preventing HIV-1 infection in healthy women at high risk of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled from a cohort of heterosexual women in sub-Saharan Africa. An&#xD;
      equal number of study participants will be randomized to receive VRC01 mAb by IV infusion at&#xD;
      a dose of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg every 8 weeks, or to receive control infusions every 8 weeks.&#xD;
      All participants will receive the VRC01 antibody or placebo by intravenous infusion at Weeks&#xD;
      0 (study entry), 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, and 72. For 3 days following each infusion,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to record and report any symptoms to study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the infusion visits, participants will attend study visits at Weeks 4, 8 + 5&#xD;
      days, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, 60, 68, 76, 80, 84, 88, and 92. All study visits will include&#xD;
      blood collection and HIV testing and counseling. Select study visits will include a medical&#xD;
      history review, physical exam, urine collection, pregnancy testing for participants capable&#xD;
      of becoming pregnant, risk reduction counseling, and an interview/questionnaire.&#xD;
