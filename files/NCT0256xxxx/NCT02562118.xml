  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre study comprising two phases: a lead-in phase Ib and a phase II&#xD;
      randomized portion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lead-in Phase Ib study A lead-in phase I study will be built into this protocol to confirm&#xD;
      the dose of lenvatinib that can safely be combined with letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that the optimal phase II dose level will be determined after recruiting 12-18&#xD;
      subjects into phase Ib. This dose level will be the one to be tested in the phase II portion&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II open label study In this part of the study, eligible patients will be treated with&#xD;
      single agent lenvatinib at the phase II recommended dose for 2 weeks, followed by lenvatinib&#xD;
      combined with letrozole 2.5mg daily for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients with ER positive breast cancer and measurable primary tumor will be&#xD;
      enrolled over a period of 24-30 months&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that combining a RET inhibitor such as lenvatinib with endocrine therapy may&#xD;
      potentiate anti-tumor effects in ER+ breast cancers in the clinic. Given that RET inhibition&#xD;
      is the primary mechanism of action of lenvatinib, we further hypothesize that RET expression&#xD;
      in the breast tumor may be a biomarker that predicts for better response to the combination&#xD;
      of a RET inhibitor and endocrine therapy in both a neoadjuvant (Part A) and a metastatic&#xD;
      (Part B) setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To confirm the dose of lenvatinib that can be safely combined with letrozole in the&#xD;
           lead-in Phase Ib part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Part A (For patients with non-metastatic breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant treatment)&#xD;
           : To determine the overall clinical response (measured by ultrasound) and pathological&#xD;
           complete response rate after 2 weeks of neoadjuvant single agent lenvatinib followed by&#xD;
           12 weeks of letrozole combined with lenvatinib and compare with historical controls&#xD;
           treated with single agent letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Part B (For patients with metastatic breast cancer and who have tumor lesion that can be&#xD;
           serially biopsied safely): to determine the clinical response (measured by RECIST&#xD;
           criteria) after 2 weeks of single agent lenvatinib followed by continuous dual therapy&#xD;
           of lenvatinib and letrozole, until time of progression or intolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the overall biological effects (Ki67 changes, histological response,&#xD;
           apoptosis, RET and downstream targets such as AKT and ERK) of 2 weeks of single agent&#xD;
           lenvatinib, and of letrozole + lenvatinib, in ER positive breast cancer, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify biological predictors for treatment response to letrozole + lenvatinib in ER&#xD;
           positive breast cancer using pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics, genomics and proteomics&#xD;
           strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the following parameters between RET positive versus RET negative, ER&#xD;
           positive breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Part A :&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Clinical response (measured by ultrasound) and biological effects of 2 weeks of single&#xD;
      agent lenvatinib, ii. Clinical response (measured by ultrasound) and biological effects after&#xD;
      2 weeks of single agent lenvatinib followed by 12 weeks of letrozole combined with lenvatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Part B : i. Clinical response measured by RECIST criteria after 2 weeks of single agent&#xD;
      lenvatinib followed by letrozole combined with lenvatinib ii. Progression-free and overall&#xD;
      survival with letrozole combined with lenvatinib&#xD;

    <description>Single agent lenvatinib daily continuously x 2 weeks, followed by letrozole 2.5mg daily + lenvatinib x 12 weeks. Lumpectomy or mastectomy should be considered after completing 14 weeks of pre-operative lenvatinib + letrozole for curative intent in non-metastatic patients and for local control for patients with metastatic disease. If surgery is planned, it should preferably be performed within 2-12 weeks after completing neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, and after toxicities (if any) from the neoadjuvant endocrine therapy have resolved. If the patient is deemed inoperable after 14 weeks of lenvatinib + letrozole, a final biopsy will be obtained, and the patient discontinued from the study and treated as per standard clinical practice by the treating physician.</description>
