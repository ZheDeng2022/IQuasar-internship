  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human performance during weightlessness was tested in a multiplicity of laboratory&#xD;
      experiments during parabolic flights and in space. It is therefore known that human fine&#xD;
      motor skills as grasping are affected by the impact of changing gravity levels. However,&#xD;
      because everyday life movements differ in several aspects from those done in an experimental&#xD;
      lab situation, investigators do not know until know if this kind of movements is altered in&#xD;
      the same extend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fine motor skills seem to depend on the context in which they are made. Thus, the performance&#xD;
      in weightlessness during everyday life could substantially differ from the results given by&#xD;
      previous laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assumption will be tested in the present project, with subjects executing one and the&#xD;
      same grasping movement in two different contexts, both in normal gravity conditions and in&#xD;
      weightlessness. To that end, the investigators developed a new method which allows comparing&#xD;
      the same grasping movements under different conditions.&#xD;

      Investigations description Subjects sit at a table in front of a 15&quot; computer screen, a&#xD;
      centrally located joystick and a sliding lever on the right side. All devices are fixed to&#xD;
      the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects hand is fitted with six adhesive reflexive markers so that hand movements can be&#xD;
      registered from above by two MX-F20 Vicon-Cameras, attached to a table-fixed metal frame.&#xD;
      Lever forces are registered by an ATI Nano17 force transducers, lever fore-aft position by an&#xD;
      inductive encoder, and eye position by an eye tracker (Tobii T60).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform two different tasks, one representing a typical laboratory (L), one an&#xD;
      everyday-like task (E). In task L, a visual stimulus on the screen will prompt subjects to&#xD;
      release the joystick, grasp the lever, move it forwards and back, and then return their hand&#xD;
      to the joystick. In task E, subjects will use the joystick in a computer game (&quot;spider&#xD;
      chasing&quot;) and occasionally release the joystick, grasp the lever, move it forwards and back&#xD;
      in order to collect a reward, and then return their hand to the joystick. In both tasks the&#xD;
      visual stimuli are accompanied with acoustic signals. To hear these signals during the flight&#xD;
      procedure, subjects are equipped with ear-phones, plugged into a laptop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one 20 second microgravity episode, task L will be performed five times or task E twice.&#xD;
      The investigator starts each task with a click on the keyboard and it stops automatically&#xD;
      after 20sec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control data will be registered from each subject for the same length of time during level&#xD;
      flight at 1g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the whole test procedure the subject is not constraint in its natural behaviour except&#xD;
      by an easy to open belt which fixes the subject to the chair. The subject can at any time end&#xD;
      the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment used For hand motion measurement and analysis we use a Vicon MX System, consisting&#xD;
      of two MX20+ infrared high-speed cameras, each connected via cables with an MX Ultranet which&#xD;
      processes the data. The Ultranet is connected with a network cable to a corresponding laptop&#xD;
      (Dell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force is measured by a 6 degree of freedom force transducer which is part of an ATI DAQ F/T&#xD;
      System, consisting of the force sensor Nano 17, a power supply box with booster and a 16-bit&#xD;
      A/D converter (DAQ-Card, NI 6036E). It uses the PCMCIA bus of a second laptop (Fujitsu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position of the object to move is measured by an inductive position encoder (dc position&#xD;
      encoder type 8740-5100 by burster).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eye movement will be recorded by a standard USB-camera or a commercial eye-tracker (Tobii&#xD;
      T60) when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices are commercially available and are used according their CE marking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol Before flight subjects will be familiarised with the protocol. Two&#xD;
      subjects will be studied during each flight. On ground, each subject gets 6 reflexive markers&#xD;
      (6mm diameter) stuck on their right hand (4 on index, 2 on thumb, fixed with double sided&#xD;
      adhesive tape).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first subject takes a seat at the experimental set-up, the second one on an aircraft&#xD;
      seat. The tested subject is then equipped with ear-phones plugged into a laptop. It helps to&#xD;
      focus the attention on the tasks which are accompanied with acoustic signals. Recording&#xD;
      devices are then adjusted to the subject by a standard calibration procedure, done by the&#xD;
      test-operator. Before entering the first parabola the subject executes the same two&#xD;
      grasping-tasks on level flight. After the first test parabola, during each 0g period it has&#xD;
      to execute the grasping movements in one of each task - 4 parabolas task L with five episodes&#xD;
      each, 10 parabolas task E with two episodes each. Entering the 0g phase the operator starts&#xD;
      the test by a click on the keyboard, afterwards the tasks stop automatically. During 1g and&#xD;
      1,8g phases the test is interrupted. After the 15th parabola the subjects switch places and&#xD;
      the second one starts with the tests during the 0g phases. On level flight back to the&#xD;
      airport it executes the same two tasks again as control condition.&#xD;
