      This study evaluates whether prospective pharmacogenetic testing is cost-effective in&#xD;
      affecting clinical treatment outcomes in patients with early-phase psychosis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large scale clinical trials have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of patients with&#xD;
      psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, discontinue their&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications due to either lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects, such as&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and weight gain. In clinical practice, it is essentially a&#xD;
      trial and error process in deciding the best antipsychotic drug to start or switch to after a&#xD;
      failed trial as there is little empirical data available to guide clinicians in drug&#xD;
      selection. One promising tool, which can potentially provide valuable information to help&#xD;
      guide medication management, is pharmacogenetic testing of certain genetic variants that are&#xD;
      associated with psychiatric drug response. However, most pharmacogenetic studies to date have&#xD;
      been retrospective, and there is no prospective clinical trial evaluating the clinical&#xD;
      utility of pharmacogenetic testing in guiding clinical practice. Furthermore, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether pharmacogenetic testing is cost effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, pharmacogenetic testing has been expensive and time-consuming. New technology&#xD;
      in the past few years makes it possible for cheaper and faster testing. One of the companies&#xD;
      that offer pharmacogenetic testing services, Genomind LLC, provides genotyping of variants&#xD;
      (GeneceptTM Assay) that are relevant to psychiatric drug response. For example, the serotonin&#xD;
      2C receptor gene (HTR2C) has variants that protect patients from antipsychotic drug induced&#xD;
      weight gain (-759C/T, rs3813929); a deletion variant of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2)&#xD;
      suggests poor efficacy with antipsychotic drug treatment (-141C Ins/Del, rs1799732); the&#xD;
      short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) is associated with antidepressant&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, investigators propose to conduct a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      rater-blinded clinical trial to test the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic testing in guiding medication treatment in patients with recent-onset&#xD;
      psychotic disorders. Patients will be assigned to either a pharmacogenetic testing guided&#xD;
      treatment condition (PGT) or a treatment as usual condition (TAU). In the PGT condition,&#xD;
      patients will utilize the GeneceptTM Assay and results will be provided to their prescribers&#xD;
      who may use the results to guide medication management. In the TAU condition, patients will&#xD;
      also utilize the GeneceptTM Assay but the results will not be provided back to their&#xD;
      prescribers, who will treat the patients without the knowledge of pharmacogenetic testing&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenetic testing may be more relevant in recent-onset or early stage illnesses because&#xD;
      past medication history that is typically used to guide medication choice may not be&#xD;
      available. Pharmacogenomic testing may be particularly pertinent to younger patients because&#xD;
      they tend to be medication na√Øve and do not have previous medication history to guide future&#xD;
      treatment. Pharmacogenomic testing may provide valuable information to guide medication&#xD;
      choice in clinical practice.&#xD;
