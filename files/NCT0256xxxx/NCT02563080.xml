    <textblock>
      Severe pancreatitis induces more damage in the pancreas and might therefore result reduced&#xD;
      exocrine function leading to the insufficiency. The aim of this prospective study is to&#xD;
      investigate development of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in patients recovering from&#xD;
      first attack of moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study of 50 patients with first attack of moderately severe or&#xD;
      severe acute pancreatitis (AP) classified by the new revised criteria for AP 2012 treated in&#xD;
      Helsinki University Hospital. The included patients are treated according to the existing&#xD;
      hospital practice and current guidelines for AP (American Pancreatic Association guidelines).&#xD;
      The development of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is determined by measuring the fecal&#xD;
      elastase-1 test. The test is measured during the hospitalization time (baseline testing), and&#xD;
      in the follow-up period 1-2 months and 12 months after discharging from hospital. The&#xD;
      baseline test will be measured as soon as the severity of AP is known and patient is included&#xD;
      in the study, and the first stool sample is available. Patients with previous history of AP,&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis, known pancreatic exocrine insufficiency or previous pancreatic surgery&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities) and etiology of AP, laboratory&#xD;
      values on admission, imaging findings and data of given treatments and interventional&#xD;
      therapies and length of hospital stays are collected from hospital charts. Also the 30-day&#xD;
      and hospital mortality will be recorded. Patients' symptoms (weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal&#xD;
      pain) and BMIs are recorded with physical examinations in the 1-2 months follow-up visit. 12&#xD;
      months after discharging from hospital the patients' symptoms and BMIs are recorded with&#xD;
      phone inquiries. 5-year survival after the first AP attack will be determined from hospital&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approval of the ethics committee of the hospital has been obtained. An informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency after first attack of moderately severe or&#xD;
      severe AP confirmed by fecal elastase-1 test is the primary endpoint of this study. Also, the&#xD;
      persistence pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and probable new developments of it during the&#xD;
      follow-up will be assessed (secondary endpoints). 30-day and hospital mortality and 5-year&#xD;
      survival after first attack of moderately severe or severe AP will be determined as well&#xD;
      (secondary endpoints).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim in this study (during the study period) is not to change the existing management of&#xD;
      AP. The existing guidelines for treatment of severe AP patients do not include enzyme&#xD;
      supplementation therapy. However, if the patients have low fecal elastase-1 levels indicating&#xD;
      pancreatic exocrine insufficiency after the follow-up period of 12 months, they will be&#xD;
      informed about the enzyme supplementation therapy. And if the patients are willing to start&#xD;
      the therapy, it can be administrated.&#xD;
