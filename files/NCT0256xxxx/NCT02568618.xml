  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes the Medication DNA Insight™ tests for pain and mental health medications.&#xD;
      We are testing the pain and mental health medications commonly used in pain treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects will give a sample of saliva that will be tested for the metabolism of the different&#xD;
      medications. Consented providers will be given the results of the test and can determine&#xD;
      whether to change the subject's medication regimen. Providers and subjects will be ask to&#xD;
      complete surveys both pre and post visits. The purpose is to examine provider and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, confidence and certainty of using the test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, interventional pilot study analyzing both&#xD;
      providers' and patients' perceptions and responses to the DNA Insight test. Twelve military&#xD;
      health system primary care providers and 4 of each provider's patients will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the study. (12 providers and 48 patients total) Each provider's patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into delayed treatment (Group A) or immediate treatment (Group B) at a 1:1 ratio. All&#xD;
      patients receive the Pain Medication and Mental Health DNA InsightTM test (intervention).&#xD;
      Results for patients in Group A will be given to the provider with a 3 month delay. Those in&#xD;
      the 3 month delay will serve as a comparison group for the period prior to receiving&#xD;
      intervention. Results for patients in Group B will be given to the provider without delay,&#xD;
      2-3 weeks after saliva sample collection. The provider will use the results of the Pain&#xD;
      Medication and Mental Health DNA InsightTM test to evaluate whether changes of medications&#xD;
      are indicated based on the individual patient's genetic profile. A measure of the provider's&#xD;
      certainty, confidence, satisfaction, perception of care and global impression of change will&#xD;
      be assessed at baseline, prior to obtaining the test results, and after obtaining the test&#xD;
      results, as outlined in the data collection section. Patients' pain related self-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, certainty, confidence and satisfaction will be assessed at baseline, prior to&#xD;
      obtaining the DNA InsightTM test results, and after receipt and implementation of the test&#xD;
      results, as described in the data collection section of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit (Visit 0) each enrolled patient will provide a saliva sample for the&#xD;
      Pain Medication DNA InsightTM test that identifies genetic variation in CYP metabolism. The&#xD;
      providers and patients will be recruited from any of the Womack Army Medical Center's Primary&#xD;
      Care Medical Homes and family practice clinics.&#xD;
