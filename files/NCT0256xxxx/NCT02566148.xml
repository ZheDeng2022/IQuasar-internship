  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Populations from Sub-Saharan Africa represent one of the most dynamic immigration flows in&#xD;
      France and are among the most exposed to HIV infection and hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Parcours study aims to understand, among sub-Saharan African migrants, how social and&#xD;
      individual factors combine in the course of migration and settlement in France, and influence&#xD;
      the risk of infection, access to prevention and care, and the effectiveness of care for both&#xD;
      HIV and hepatitis B diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research was conducted in Ile-de-France, where 60% of sub-Saharan African migrants&#xD;
      reside. It consists in a cross-sectional observational survey, using a life-event history&#xD;
      approach that reproduces the sequence of different life and health events, and contributes to&#xD;
      explain the present situation (type of disease management, patient's quality of life) in&#xD;
      light of all the elements of the past trajectory (administrative, familial, socio-economic,&#xD;
      professionals).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A representative survey was conducted between February 2012 and May 2013 in health care&#xD;
      facilities in Ile-de-France, among three groups of migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa: a group&#xD;
      living with HIV, a group living with chronic hepatitis B and a group who has neither of these&#xD;
      diseases. For each group, stratified random sampling was used. The survey was conducted in 24&#xD;
      hospital services providing HIV care, 20 health care facilities providing hepatitis B care,&#xD;
      and 30 primary health care facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Were eligible all patients attending these health care facilities, born in a Sub-Saharan&#xD;
      African country and with Sub-Saharan African citizenship at birth, aged 18 to 59 years, with&#xD;
      an HIV diagnosis (HIV group) or chronic hepatitis B diagnosis (hepatitis B group) more than&#xD;
      three months prior or not diagnosed with HIV or chronic Hepatitis B (reference group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the patients offered participation, 926 HIV-infected patients, 779 patients infected by&#xD;
      hepatitis B, and 763 patients without these two diseases participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, detailed information on socio-demographic characteristics; migration&#xD;
      and life conditions in France; social, sexual and reproductive life history; and screening&#xD;
      and care history were collected using a life-event history questionnaire administered&#xD;
      face-to-face by a specialized interviewer. Health care professionals documented clinical&#xD;
      information from the medical records. Data was collected anonymously.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PARCOURS study was conducted to study how health trajectories and social and migratory&#xD;
      paths are interlaced for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa living in France. This&#xD;
      retrospective quantitative life-event survey was conducted from February 2012 to May 2013 in&#xD;
      health-care facilities in the greater Paris metropolitan area (Ile-de-France), among three&#xD;
      groups of migrants born in sub-Saharan Africa: one group receiving HIV care, one group with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis B, and a third group of people visiting primary-care centres. Recruitment&#xD;
      took place at facilities randomly selected from an exhaustive list of HIV outpatient hospital&#xD;
      clinics (n=24), hepatitis treatment clinics (n=20) and general practice medical centres&#xD;
      (n=30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment procedure for patients in each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each health care facility selected for the study, all health care professionals&#xD;
      providing outpatient care to patients born in sub-Saharan Africa were asked to participate in&#xD;
      the study. They identified eligible patients during consultations based on medical records,&#xD;
      and offered study participation to all eligible patients, except when the patient was deemed&#xD;
      unable to be interviewed (for mental health or physical health reasons or because were unable&#xD;
      to be interviewed in one of the languages spoken by the interviewer). When the patient agreed&#xD;
      to participate in the study, health care professionals gave her/him an information leaflet on&#xD;
      the study and obtained written consent. They also gave the participant a card bearing an&#xD;
      identification number to ensure data collection anonymity and confidentiality, and referred&#xD;
      her/him to the Parcours interviewer at the end of the consultation. The Parcours interviewer&#xD;
      conducted the interview right after the consultation, in face-to-face mode, in a dedicated&#xD;
      room, with closed door to ensure privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health care professional could also suggest an appointment in the following days, always&#xD;
      on site, to patients who agreed to participate in the study but were not immediately&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consideration of non-Francophone participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take into account difficulties in participating in the survey due to poor or no knowledge&#xD;
      of the French language, the patient questionnaire was available in French or English, and, by&#xD;
      appointment, an interpreter could be made available to conduct the interview in an African&#xD;
      language spoken by the respondent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of data collected&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several data collection tools were used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information register :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each service investigated, each health care professional participating in the study held&#xD;
      an information register. Each page of the register had two parts, one with a detachable&#xD;
      section specifying the correspondence between the identity of study patients and their&#xD;
      identity number, and an anonymous one describing the main characteristics of eligible&#xD;
      patients. During each consultation day, the health care professional listed in the register&#xD;
      all eligible patients, their gender, age group, if the patient had worked at least one day in&#xD;
      the previous month, a health indicator (last CD4 count for HIV + patients, last alanine&#xD;
      transaminase (ALT) level for patients with hepatitis B, the fact of consulting in this&#xD;
      facility for the first time for patients in the reference group), and participation in the&#xD;
      survey (participant, not offered participation, refusal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life-event history questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were interviewed using a standardized life-event history questionnaire&#xD;
      administered by an interviewer face-to-face (average duration 55 minutes). The life-event&#xD;
      questionnaire consisted of two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A list of questions associated with a life event calendar (or biographical grid), which&#xD;
           allowed identifying, recording and dating (per year) events in the lives of the&#xD;
           respondents, from birth to the date of the survey, and in the various themes explored in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A book of thematic modules, aimed at describing in-depth the events previously&#xD;
           identified in the biographical grid (or some of them).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The life-event calendar has a very graphic and visual form, which makes it easier to&#xD;
      remember, record and date the events in the lives of the respondents. In particular, it&#xD;
      encourages and easily adapts to the process of remembering that works by association of ideas&#xD;
      and connections between life-event areas and as such optimizes data collection, in terms of&#xD;
      completeness and reliability of the data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The themes explored in the life-event questionnaire were:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gender, age ; Residential biography and housing history ; Place of birth and places of&#xD;
      residence. ; Work history - Education and Resources ; Marital and family history ; History of&#xD;
      testing ; General health and history of disease ; Arrival in France and stay in France ;&#xD;
      Sexual and reproductive health ; Social networks, support networks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical questionnaire :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health care professional completed the medical questionnaire, from the patient's medical&#xD;
      record. For the HIV and hepatitis B groups, this questionnaire documented the chronological&#xD;
      landmarks and key parameters of the disease and its treatment. For the reference group, it&#xD;
      informed the reason for consultation, potential diseases at the time of the survey, and&#xD;
      current treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymity of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identity number on the anonymity card given by the health care professional to the&#xD;
      patient was the only participant identifier for the different survey questionnaires (thematic&#xD;
      book and life-event calendar, medical questionnaire). The interviewer did not know the&#xD;
      identity of the patient. No personally identifiable data was collected directly or indirectly&#xD;
      for eligible individuals not offered participation or individuals refusing study&#xD;
      participation. The general characteristics collected on the register among refusals were&#xD;
      collected in the form of classes, and not precisely, thus not allowing for later&#xD;
      identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approvals :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey was approved by the Advisory Committee for Data Processing in Health Research&#xD;
      (CCTIRS) (approval on 13 April 2011) and by the National Commission on Informatics and&#xD;
      Liberties (CNIL) (CD-2011-484 approval on 7 December 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 30/01/2012 and 31/12/2012, 1,829 individuals infected with HIV and meeting the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria presented at the participating services, among which 141 were not&#xD;
      offered participation by their physician (111 for health reasons and 30 for language&#xD;
      problems). Of the 1,688 individuals offered participation, 762 refused or abandoned during&#xD;
      the questionnaire. In total, 926 individuals were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 15/02/2012 and 31/05/2013, 1,169 individuals infected with hepatitis B and meeting&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria presented at the participating services, among which 17 were not&#xD;
      offered participation by their physician and 8 abandoned during the questionnaire due to&#xD;
      language problems. In total, among the 1,135 individuals offered participation, 779 were&#xD;
      included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 15/02/2012 and 31/05/2013, 1,184 meeting the eligibility criteria presented at the&#xD;
      participating primary health care facilities. Among these, 124 were not offered participation&#xD;
      by their physician (91 for health reasons and 33 for language problems). Among the 1,060&#xD;
      individuals offered participation, 297 refused or abandoned during the questionnaire. In&#xD;
      total, 763 individuals were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among all services and groups, the number of refusals due to language problems was 71 (30 in&#xD;
      HIV group, 8 in Hepatitis B group and 33 in reference group), to which can be added 10&#xD;
      interviews interrupted due to poor understanding of French (8 in hepatitis B group and 2 in&#xD;
      reference group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weighting :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to take into account the sample design and non-participation, data was weighted&#xD;
      according to each individual's probability of inclusion in the survey (i.e. considering the&#xD;
      probability of inclusion in the sample for each health care facility, the number of half-days&#xD;
      of weekly consultations in each facility included and the individual study participation per&#xD;
      half-day of included consultations).&#xD;
