    <textblock>
      Naïve CD4+ helper T (Th) cells, upon encountering their cognate antigens presented on&#xD;
      professional antigen-presenting cells, differentiate into different effector cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Th1 cells produce Interferon-γ and regulate antigen presentation and immunity against&#xD;
           intracellular pathogens;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Th2 cells produce IL-4 (Interleukin-4), IL-5 and IL-13, and mediate humoral responses&#xD;
           and immunity against parasites;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Th17 cells produce IL-17, IL-17F and IL-22 and regulate inflammatory responses by tissue&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional TH subset called follicular helper T (Tfh) cells has recently been identified&#xD;
      in germinal centers and also in whole blood (circulating Tfh cells). These cells regulate&#xD;
      B-cell maturation and immunoglobulin production during normal immune responses. They produce&#xD;
      factors essential for B cell selection and maturation into memory B-cells or long-lived&#xD;
      antibody-secreting plasma cells. Furthermore, they also seem to favor pathogenic autoantibody&#xD;
      production in systemic autoimmunity, and therefore could potentially represent a novel&#xD;
      therapeutic target in autoimmune diseases. Indeed, rheumatoid arthritis synovium is&#xD;
      characterized by the presence of ectopic lymphoid structures, resembling germinal centers.&#xD;
      Potentially, Tfh cells from these nonlymphoid tissues could promote B-cell maturation and&#xD;
      synthesis of pathogenic autoantibody production, thus potentiating tissue injury.&#xD;
      Interestingly, production of IL-21 by Tfh cells is implicated in B cell activation, and the&#xD;
      same cytokine have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-6 blocking therapy significantly reduces signs and symptoms as well as radiological&#xD;
      progression in RA. However, so far, it has not been determined which of the pleiotropic IL-6&#xD;
      effects impact the observed clinical response. Recently, Samson et al have demonstrated that&#xD;
      Tocilizumab (TCZ) corrects the imbalance between Th17 cells and Treg cells in patients with&#xD;
      RA. More interestingly, the group of Hans-Peter Tony has reported the impact of TCZ on B cell&#xD;
      compartment. They showed a significant reduction in the frequency of peripheral pre-switch&#xD;
      and post-switch memory B cells but also a reduction of serum immunoglobulin levels, that&#xD;
      could be the reflect of TCZ on Tfh cells development, circulation and/or function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the work studying the role of IL-6 on Tfh cells development has been performed in&#xD;
      mice. They showed that optimal Tfh cells formation requires IL-21 and IL-6, and that&#xD;
      cytokines alone are insufficient to drive Tfh cells differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand the impact of IL-6 on human Tfh cells, the investigators would like to&#xD;
      conduct a prospective study in patients with active RA and investigated the effects of&#xD;
      blocking IL-6 with TCZ on circulating Tfh cells levels and Tfh cells subsets over a 12-week&#xD;
      study period. Furthermore, the impact of TCZ treatment on Tfh cells generation will be&#xD;
      explored in vitro.&#xD;

        This study will be performed as a prospective observational open-labeled study&#xD;
        (non-interventional) to evaluate the impact of TCZ treatment on the evolution of&#xD;
        circulating Tfh cells levels. The administration of treatments (TCZ and MTX) will be done&#xD;
        according to current practice, and will not be motivated by the inclusion in this study.&#xD;
        TCZ will be administered in association with a conventional DMARD, or in monotherapy,&#xD;
        according to clinical recommendations. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact&#xD;
        of new therapy set-up, and patients included in the TCZ group would be under MTX treatment&#xD;
        for at least 3 months. The immunological analysis will be performed with drop-off of blood&#xD;
        samples used in the recommended follow-up of patients treated by MTX or TCZ. For the&#xD;
        healthy controls, the immunological analysis will be performed with drop-off of blood&#xD;
        samples used in the recommended follow-up of patients treated for osteoporosis or&#xD;
        osteoarthritis.&#xD;
