      The investigators will compare the reduction in Borg dyspnea score during the 3-min constant&#xD;
      rate shuttle walking test after 3 weeks of indacaterol 110 µg/Glycopyrronium 50 µg (Ultibro®)&#xD;
      versus Tiotropium 18 µg (Spiriva®) alone in patients with moderate to severe COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The foundation of COPD therapy is to combine inhaled therapy to optimize benefits as it was&#xD;
      done several years ago by associating short-acting β2-agonists and muscarinic antagonist. The&#xD;
      recent availability of once-daily LABA/LAMA fixed combination products makes this therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy even more appealing and appears as a promising treatment option in COPD. One&#xD;
      relevant question regarding these new LABA/LAMA combinations is whether they provide superior&#xD;
      benefits compared to a single agent. Once-daily LABA/LAMA fixed combinations consistently&#xD;
      improves lung function compared to monotherapy. The key question is whether they provide&#xD;
      superior efficacy to monotherapy on patient's oriented clinical outcomes, beyond lung&#xD;
      function improvement. In regards, once-daily LABA/LAMA fixed combinations can reduce&#xD;
      exacerbation rate and perception of dyspnea, further to what can be obtained with the&#xD;
      monocomponents. Once-daily LABA/LAMA fixed combinations also improve exercise tolerance&#xD;
      compared to placebo but whether they provide additional benefit over monotherapy is&#xD;
      uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyspnea is the most troublesome symptom in COPD and it is felt that the main mechanism&#xD;
      through which bronchodilators improve exercise tolerance is by reducing dyspnea. As such,&#xD;
      dyspnea measurement appears a valid surrogate of exercise tolerance. One advantage of dyspnea&#xD;
      measurement over the measurement of exercise endurance is that it does not require a maximal&#xD;
      effort. In this regard, it may be a less noisy outcome than exercise duration. Dyspnea can be&#xD;
      quantified during the 6-min walking test but pre and post-intervention comparisons are made&#xD;
      difficult since the walking speed and thus the exercise stimulus is not controlled during the&#xD;
      test. Another strategy to evaluate the effects of interventions on exertional dyspnea is to&#xD;
      compare dyspnea at isotime while controlling the walking or cycling speed during the&#xD;
      endurance shuttle walking test or the constant rate cycling test. One limitation of this&#xD;
      approach is that pre and post intervention dyspnea measurement is not always obtained at the&#xD;
      same time point since the duration of the test is variable. To overcome this problem, linear&#xD;
      interpolation can be used to estimate of dyspnea. However, this approach is not as robust as&#xD;
      when a &quot;real&quot; dyspnea score is directly obtained from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To circumvent these difficulties, the investigators have recently developed a strong and&#xD;
      simple exercise methodology whose primary objective is to assess exertional dyspnea in&#xD;
      patients with COPD: the 3-min constant rate shuttle walking test. During this test, which is&#xD;
      a modification of the endurance shuttle walking test, patients are asked to walk around two&#xD;
      cones set-up in a flat corridor and separated by 10m. An audio signal is used to impose the&#xD;
      walking speed and the test ends at a fixed duration of 3 minutes or until symptoms become&#xD;
      intolerable. At pre-specified time point during the test, and at the end of the test (3 min),&#xD;
      patients are asked to score their perception of dyspnea on a Borg scale. The feasibility and&#xD;
      reproducibility of this test in providing a standardized physical stimulus and a measurable&#xD;
      level of dyspnea in patients with moderate to severe COPD has been reported. In one study,&#xD;
      the investigators also confirmed the responsiveness of this test to bronchodilation,&#xD;
      reporting statistically and clinically significant reduction in Borg dyspnea score with&#xD;
      ipratropium bromide compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will require 7 visits; the run-in and familiarization phase (visits #1-3), the&#xD;
      treatment A phase (visits #4-5), and the treatment B phase (visits #6-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit will be used to review the inclusion criteria and to obtain consent. A&#xD;
      spirometry will be obtained. Patient on tiotropium or glycopyrronium will be switched to open&#xD;
      label ipratropium (see allowed medication). Visit #2 will include pulmonary function testing&#xD;
      including spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity measurements. A maximal incremental&#xD;
      shuttle walking test, the COPD assessment test (CAT) and the MRC scale will be also be&#xD;
      completed. Patients will then be familiarized with the 3-min constant rate shuttle walking&#xD;
      test. During Visit #3, patients will perform two 3-min constant rate shuttle walking test&#xD;
      which will serve to determine dyspnea at baseline. The investigators will aim for a dyspnea&#xD;
      Borg Score &gt; 3, the rationale being that it is important to obtain a significant dyspnea&#xD;
      signal considering that the objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      bronchodilation to improve dyspnea. Patients in whom it will not be possible to achieve this&#xD;
      level of dyspnea at the end of the 3- min constant rate shuttle walking test will be excluded&#xD;
      for further study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then enter the cross-over study design during which they will receive one of&#xD;
      the two study treatments: indacaterol 110 µg/Glycopyrronium 50 µg (Ultibro®) once a day or&#xD;
      Tiotropium 18 µg (Spiriva®) once a day. The treatment period will be three weeks. There will&#xD;
      be a 2-week washout period between the two treatment phases. Total study duration will thus&#xD;
      be 11 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit #4 and visit #6 will be the baseline visits for each treatment period (except for&#xD;
      dyspnea after the 3-min constant rate shuttle walking test which will be determined at Visit&#xD;
      #3). Participants will perform spirometry, lung volume measurements before and 1h 20 min&#xD;
      after receiving the study medication. Two 3-min constant rate shuttle walking tests will be&#xD;
      performed 2h 25 min after dosing, starting with the one performed and completed at the&#xD;
      highest speed at V3. This time schedule was chosen based on previous studies in this field.&#xD;
      Dyspnea will be assessed with the baseline dyspnea index (BDI) and health status will be&#xD;
      evaluated by the COPD Assessment Test (CAT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures will be repeated at the end of each 3-week study treatment (Visits #5 and&#xD;
      #7) the only difference being that chronic dyspnea will be assessed with the transitional&#xD;
      dyspnea index (TDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowed medication There will be a 3-week run-in period during which patients on will receive&#xD;
      open label ipratropium (Atrovent® MDI 20µg/ puff, 4 puffs QID) and prn salbutamol (Ventolin®&#xD;
      MDI 100µg/puff, 2 puffs every 3-4 hours PRN). Ipratropium will be allowed only during the&#xD;
      run-in and washout periods. Ipratropium will be stopped twelve hours before study visits&#xD;
      (Visit # 3, 4, and 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salbutamol on prn basis will allow throughout the study except that it will be stopped 6&#xD;
      hours prior to Visit #3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Long-acting 2-agonist will be prohibited after Visit&#xD;
      #1 and throughout study duration. Inhaled corticosteroids will be allowed at the same dosage&#xD;
      as before the study. PDE4 inhibitors and leukotriene antagonists will also be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding Patient and study staff will be blinded to the treatment administration during the 2&#xD;
      study periods. Treatments will consisted, for one treatment period of active Ultibro® once a&#xD;
      day and placebo Spiriva® handihaler, and for the other period of placebo Ultibro® once a day&#xD;
      and active Spiriva® handihaler. Active medication and placebo will be of identical appearance&#xD;
      and the order of study medication will be randomized. Pre-package envelopes containing equal&#xD;
      quantities of inhaler combination will be numbered and kept in a secure place (pharmacy of&#xD;
      the hospital or the research site). At the end of the study data collection the blind code&#xD;
      will be opened after having completed the primary data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization stratified by site will occur at Visit #4 and will be centralized using a&#xD;
      computerized system and pre-packaged study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be the difference in Borg dyspnea score after the 3-min constant rate&#xD;
      shuttle walking test after 3 weeks of treatment between indacaterol 110µg/Glycopyrronium 50µg&#xD;
      (Ultibro®) versus Tiotropium 18µg (Spiriva®) alone. Secondary endpoints will be the&#xD;
      difference in Borg dyspnea score after the 3-min constant rate shuttle walking test after 3&#xD;
      weeks of treatment between indacaterol 110µg/Glycopyrronium 50µg (Ultibro®) versus baseline&#xD;
      value (Visit #3) and between Tiotropium 18µg (Spiriva®) alone versus baseline value (Visit&#xD;
      #3). The dyspnea response after the first dose of therapy will also be assessed. The&#xD;
      between-treatment differences in the improvement of pulmonary function (FEV1 and inspiratory&#xD;
      capacity), TDI and CAT scores from baseline (V4) to end of treatment period (V5 and V7) will&#xD;
      also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function testing. Spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity will be measured&#xD;
      according to routine techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal incremental shuttle walk. As originally described by Singh and colleagues, the&#xD;
      incremental shuttle walk will be performed in an enclosed corridor on a flat 10-m-long&#xD;
      course. The course will be identified by two cones, each positioned 0.5 m from either end to&#xD;
      allow patients to walk in circle and thereby avoid the need for abrupt changes in direction.&#xD;
      Patients will walk at a predetermined rhythm, as dictated by an audio signal played from a&#xD;
      CD. Walking speed will initially be set at 0.50 m/sec and will be increased by 0.17 m/sec&#xD;
      every minute until the patient reaches maximal capacity. Since the effects of encouragement&#xD;
      on walking performance have been demonstrated, no encouragement will be given to patients&#xD;
      throughout the test. The final measure will be distance walked, expressed in meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-min constant rate shuttle walking test. This test consists in one bout of three minutes of&#xD;
      walking at the initial walking speed of 4.0 km/h. Thirty minutes after this first bout of&#xD;
      walking, a second test will be performed at a walking speed of either 6.0 or 2.5 km/h. The&#xD;
      second walking speed will be determined by the ability to carry through the test at 4.0 km/h.&#xD;
      If a patient cannot complete the first test, then the second speed will be stepped down to&#xD;
      2.5 km/h. If a patient is able to carry though the first test, then the second walking speed&#xD;
      will be raised to 6.0 km/h. Patients will be asked to perform two tests at two different&#xD;
      speeds in order to determine, amongst the 3 different walking speeds, the highest speed that&#xD;
      can be sustained for the entire 3 minutes. In doing so, our objective is to induce a level of&#xD;
      dyspnea that is sufficiently high to be amenable to therapy. These walking speeds are&#xD;
      selected based on our previous work19 showing that these were sufficiently demanding to&#xD;
      induce measurable levels of dyspnea and that most moderate to severe patients with COPD are&#xD;
      able to complete the test for the desired duration. Patients will be directed to follow the&#xD;
      audio signal for the entire 3 minutes of the test or until they became symptom limited. They&#xD;
      will be instructed to walk around the two cones set-up in the hospital hallway pacing their&#xD;
      walk in a way not to wait at the cones for the following audio signal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac and ventilatory measures. During each exercise test, cardiac and ventilatory&#xD;
      parameters will be measured using a commercially available exercise circuit. Dyspnea will be&#xD;
      assessed using a 10-point modified Borg scale that will be positioned at one extremity of the&#xD;
      course.&#xD;
