    <textblock>
      Making the diagnosis underlying a painful, swollen joint currently involves aspiration&#xD;
      followed by numerous microbiological and biochemical laboratory tests. This can be costly,&#xD;
      time consuming and in the case of an acutely swollen joint, lead to a lengthy inpatient&#xD;
      admission. There is an unmet need to provide a quick, easy, reliable dipstick like test to&#xD;
      analyse joint fluid in the community, clinic, or emergency department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to use well established metabonomic techniques to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analyse fluid from patients with swollen joints&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify potential biomarkers of inflammatory, infective and osteoarthritic causes of&#xD;
           joint swelling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlate this with lubrication and wear properties of the fluid The long term goal is&#xD;
           to develop time saving, cost effective, non-invasive diagnostic tests to improve&#xD;
           management of a swollen joint. The biomedical research centre at Imperial provides a&#xD;
           unique and unparalleled clinical and scientific environment to conduct this research.&#xD;
           The Imperial College division of Computational and Systems Medicine has an international&#xD;
           reputation in metabonomics and this, together with the high volume of patients with&#xD;
           swollen joints treated at Imperial National Health Service Trust (c1000/yr) ensures that&#xD;
           the study can take place in an environment conductive to success.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Swollen joints represent a diagnostic challenge. Possible diagnoses include: osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      gout, rheumatological disease or infection. Diagnostic methods are limited to microscopy,&#xD;
      microbiology and trace analysis. These methods can be slow, time consuming, expensive and&#xD;
      often inconclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis varies in the severity of any inflammatory response and subsequent symptoms.&#xD;
      To date no molecular link has been established to explain this ambiguity. Previous studies&#xD;
      have identified metabolites of the inflammatory response but failed to investigate any&#xD;
      correlation with symptoms or response to targeted injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial infections of joints are destructive. It typically takes 2-3 days to identify a&#xD;
      causative organism and confirm diagnosis. Recent studies suggest low-level bacterial&#xD;
      colonisation within joints. The investigators aim to analyse the joint fluid for any&#xD;
      bacterial colonisation using enrichment and 16S Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) then&#xD;
      correlate the results to the metabolic profile. In addition the investigators aim to seek&#xD;
      metabolites indicative of the presence of a biofilm which, if present severely limits&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabonomics is the quantitative measurement of the dynamic multiparametric response of a&#xD;
      living system to pathophysiological stimuli or genetic modification. This provides a global&#xD;
      metabolic profile despite a complex biological sample and has proven useful in many fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each pathology will have a unique metabolic profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inflammatory osteoarthritis will contain a different metabolic profile and potentially&#xD;
           biomarkers to treatment and/or response&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specifically the presence and detection of organism sub-type and biofilm biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. These profiles can be characterised by analysis of blood, urine and joint fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. This data can be used to generate diagnostic tests that will aid management of a swollen&#xD;
           joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. There will be a correlation between metabolic profile and lubricant properties of the&#xD;
           joint fluid, that can be utilised in future engineering strategies to manage&#xD;
           osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To analyse joint fluid from osteoarthritic joints to identify potential biomarkers of the&#xD;
      disease and further understanding of the cartilage destruction pathways 2. To assess&#xD;
      population variances in joint fluid composition using metabonomics and whether this&#xD;
      composition correlates to arthropathy of joints 3. To study the lubrication and wear&#xD;
      properties of the joint fluid and understand how the metabolic profile influences lubrication&#xD;
      and subsequently joint wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. To study joint fluid using metabonomics to identify biomarkers of bacterial colonisation&#xD;
      in tandem with microbial 16S Polymerase Chain Reaction and genomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phases of the project are to be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full research, Site and Ethical Approval: Provisional ethics is already granted. No obstacles&#xD;
      to research and site approval are expected and this should be achieved shortly afterwards.&#xD;
      (success = ethical approval) Expected June 2015&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Collection: The investigators aim to recruit 150 patients to the study capturing a&#xD;
      conservative estimate of 10 per week. All orthopaedic patients will be targeted. The majority&#xD;
      are expected to be recruited from the elective theatres. (success = 150 pts recruited) June -&#xD;
      September 2015 (onwards)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabonomic Analysis Method Development: Establishing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)&#xD;
      methodology for metabolic profiling of synovial fluid as a sample matrix. Method development&#xD;
      of Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (LCMS) untargeted and targeted methodology for&#xD;
      synovial fluid (success = achieving robust, sensitive methodology) October 2015&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint Fluid Tribology: Analysis of the lubricating properties of the joint fluid (success =&#xD;
      150 samples assayed) October - December 2015&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabonomic Analysis: In order to yield the maximum results the investigators aim to analyse&#xD;
      using NMR screening with untargeted and targeted LCMS analysis. With approximately 150&#xD;
      patients and thus 450 body fluid samples the investigators are estimating an analysis time of&#xD;
      6 months (success = metabolic profiling and targeted analysis) November - April 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial Genetic Analysis: PCR and sequencing of the microbial genetic content of the joint&#xD;
      fluid (success = completion in 150 samples) April - June 2016&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collation of results, Analysis and Reporting: Preparation of results for submission to a&#xD;
      journal with an impact factor &gt;10. (success = editorial acceptance of manuscript) July -&#xD;
      October 2016&#xD;
