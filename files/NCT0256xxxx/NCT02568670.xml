    <textblock>
      This is a two-centers, open label, prospective, randomized, noninferiority controlled trial&#xD;
      with cost-effectiveness analysis to verify if is non inferior to remove peripheral&#xD;
      intravenous catheter according to clinical signs in relation to every 96 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The care practice standards related to infusion therapy (IT) are stipulated and regulated by&#xD;
      US institutions, such as the Infusion Nurses Society (INS) and the Center for Disease and&#xD;
      Control (CDC), and, in Brazil, by the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA).&#xD;
      Within this topic, the investigators can mention peripherally administered IT through&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous catheters (PIC) as the most used one, since this is less complex and&#xD;
      less invasive, and it offers a lower risk of severe complications compared to central line&#xD;
      IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PIC placement, maintenance and removal procedures are not free of complications, and in order&#xD;
      to prevent them, regulatory agencies publish formal recommendations. One of these refers to&#xD;
      the time the PIC remains at the same site (residence time), which has been determined to be&#xD;
      96 hours for the adult population, i.e., it should be removed and punctured again at another&#xD;
      site, systematically, even if not showing any inflammatory sign within 96 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following literature review, one can see that these recommendations are based on limited&#xD;
      evidence, and supported by data from old studies. For this reason, the investigators discuss&#xD;
      if employing a systematic and elective change procedure for adults would be the best option,&#xD;
      as the investigators have taken some aspects into consideration, such as: Patient safety -&#xD;
      The PIC dwell time at the placement site, as shown by research results, has increased&#xD;
      throughout the decades to 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. If the PIC change is performed on a child&#xD;
      who, theoretically, is a less immune-competent patient as compared to adults, this is&#xD;
      performed according to clinical signs, then the investigators can conclude that adopting the&#xD;
      same procedure for adults would be safe. Peripheral venous depletion - Logic leads us to&#xD;
      consider that the less the investigators puncture a patient, more access is available, and&#xD;
      less outcomes with IT-specific complications occur. Patient satisfaction - With reduced&#xD;
      exposures to painful and invasive events, the patient will also benefit from it. Few patients&#xD;
      refrain from showing dissatisfaction when the PIC is to be placed again electively. Quality -&#xD;
      Producing scientific evidence and adopting the best practices in hospital environments is&#xD;
      practicing quality. Economic aspects - If these PIC changes were less frequent, they would&#xD;
      necessarily imply less spending with inputs and devices, as well as less time spent by the&#xD;
      team performing the procedure, which represents less cost and workload. Occupational safety -&#xD;
      Studies show an estimated relationship between the occurrence of an accident with biological&#xD;
      material and performing invasive procedures. Reducing the number of punctures performed by a&#xD;
      professional, in addition to decreasing the workload, may reduce the exposure to risk and&#xD;
      accidents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research studies carried out mostly in Australia aim at showing that the systematic PIC&#xD;
      removal and change do not bring benefits, when compared to change based on clinical&#xD;
      manifestations. However, a systematic review study in 2010 did not find conclusive evidence,&#xD;
      and suggested the development of other projects in several regions, of different natures and&#xD;
      realities, so as to further mature the hypothesis. To support this, the INS has also formally&#xD;
      stated that this theme is a research priority at this time.&#xD;
