      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA makes up the instruction book for people s cells. Cancer is a disease caused by DNA&#xD;
      changes that build up and affect cell function. Researchers want to learn more about what may&#xD;
      cause cancer by testing the DNA of people with the disease and their family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find DNA changes that may be inherited and may cause or influence whether a person gets&#xD;
      cancer. To study families with clusters of cancer to find out if there is a DNA mutation&#xD;
      specific to certain cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participated in the familial genetic part of NIH study 09-C-0079, a previous study or had&#xD;
      family members enrolled in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have been screened in the previous study. They will give permission for&#xD;
      researchers to use their data and their tissue or blood samples collected in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each stage of testing, participants will meet with a genetics health care provider. The&#xD;
      provider will explain the tests and answer questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If researchers find a DNA change that might increase the risk for cancer or other health&#xD;
      issues, they will confirm this result in a testing lab. This will require a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants personal DNA data and health information will be put in a database for research&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is to continue the analysis begun on 09C0079 which was focused on&#xD;
           identification of the genetic mutation associated with a new gastric polyposis syndrome,&#xD;
           Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polyposis of the Stomach (GAPPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GAPPS is an autosomal dominant gastric polyposis syndrome that confers a substantial&#xD;
           risk for gastric adenocarcinoma and has been found to be associated with germline point&#xD;
           variants in APC promoter 1B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At this time, any non-gastric phenotype associated with GAPPS is unknown and is being&#xD;
           explored using a phenotyping survey interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To specifically investigate families with clusters of cancer to determine if there is a&#xD;
      potential familial genetic mutation specific to a particular cancer and if present, to&#xD;
      compare these genetic abnormalities with individuals from the same family without cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must meet one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have been previously enrolled on the familial genetic analysis arm of NIH study&#xD;
                09-C-0079; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Be family members of patients previously enrolled on the familial genetic analysis&#xD;
                arm of 09-C-0079; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Have a documented pathogenic germline APC promotor 1B variant from a CLIA approved&#xD;
                laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be 10 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol was originally opened to continue same use of research that was approved&#xD;
           under protocol 09-C-0079, to analyze the data for publication, and to provide&#xD;
           participants with any results of clinical and analytic validity and clinical utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In a subsequent amendment carriers of a germline APC promoter 1B variant will&#xD;
           participate in a phenotyping assessment survey interview to assess the phenotype of&#xD;
           Gastric Adenocarcinoma and Proximal Polypopsis of the Stomach (GAPPS).&#xD;
