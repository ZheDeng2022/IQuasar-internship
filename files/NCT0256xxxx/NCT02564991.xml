      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way alcohol affects brain structure has been widely studied. But the way it affects all&#xD;
      parts of the brain is still unknown. Researchers want to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      scans to study brain structure and function. They hope this will help them better understand&#xD;
      changes that happen in brain regions during treatment of alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study changes in the brain by using MRI in people with and without alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
      To study how brain changes affect gait, balance, cognitive ability, and behavior. To see how&#xD;
      the brain recovers when alcohol use stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with alcohol dependence who are currently hospitalized in a particular unit at NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 30 60 years old without an alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under a separate protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a urine sample for a drug test and pregnancy test at each study visit.&#xD;
      They will also have to pass a breath alcohol test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, participants will have an MRI. The scanner is a metal cylinder in a&#xD;
      strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the&#xD;
      cylinder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will do behavior and memory tasks outside the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have gait and balance tested. They will have to stand on both legs, stand on just&#xD;
      one leg, and walk in a straight line. They will perform each task with eyes open, then with&#xD;
      eyes closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will have tests of memory, thinking, and problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have a second visit. They will have another MRI and repeat some of the&#xD;
      behavior and memory tasks.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to characterize cerebellar volumes and function in alcoholics&#xD;
      and recovery of cerebellar volume and function during early abstinence. This study also&#xD;
      investigates how cerebrocerebellar circuits contribute to cognitive and motor impairment in&#xD;
      alcoholism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and Inpatient participants with alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive whole-brain structural imaging and assessment of cerebellar&#xD;
      function at the time of admission and again at the time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary outcome of this study is to assess recovery of cerebellar structure and function&#xD;
      at the end of treatment compared to treatment entry measures.&#xD;
