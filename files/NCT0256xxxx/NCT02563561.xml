  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study&#xD;
      of apaziquone in participants with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), ≤3.5&#xD;
      centimeters (cm) in diameter, all of which must had been fully resected at TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Screening, participants underwent an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the&#xD;
      bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible participants were randomized to one of three treatment&#xD;
      arms in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 : One dose of Apaziquone. Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone. Arm 3 : Placebo. Primary&#xD;
      endpoint was to evaluate the Time to Recurrence with either a one instillation of 4 mg&#xD;
      apaziquone or two instillations of 4 milligram (mg) apaziquone relative to placebo&#xD;
      instillation following TURBT in a participant with NMIBC who received TURBT.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, multi-arm, placebo-controlled, double-blind study&#xD;
      of apaziquone in participants with ≤4 non-muscle invasive bladder tumors, ≤3.5 cm in&#xD;
      diameter, all of which must have been fully resected at TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to Screening, participants underwent an assessment of urothelial carcinoma of the&#xD;
      bladder via cystoscopy for clinically apparent tumor Ta, G1-G2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following TURBT on Day 1, eligible participants were randomized to one of three treatment&#xD;
      arms in a 1:1:1 ratio :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 : One Dose of Apaziquone:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15 (±5 days): administration of placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 : Two Doses of Apaziquone :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1: administration of 4 mg of apaziquone 60±30 minutes post-TURBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15 (±5 days): administration of 4 mg of apaziquone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 3: Placebo :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 1 : administration of placebo 60±30 minutes post-TURBT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 15 (±5 days) : administration of placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, Day 1 study drug instillation occurred 60 ±30 minutes post TURBT.&#xD;
      Participants returned on Day 15 (±5 days) for a second instillation unless their pathology&#xD;
      results showed non Ta, G1-G2 histology; in the absence of local pathology results by the Day&#xD;
      15 visit, participants received a second instillation of study drug. All histology specimens&#xD;
      were reviewed by a local pathology laboratory and all clinical treatment decisions and study&#xD;
      analyses were based on the local pathology review. Participants whose pathology was other&#xD;
      than Ta, G1-G2 were followed for safety at Day 35 (±5 days) from the last dose of study drug&#xD;
      and then discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with pathology confirmed Ta, G1-G2 disease were followed according to the&#xD;
      schedule below :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystoscopic examination and urine cytology every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from&#xD;
           date of TURBT) through 24 months for tumor recurrence and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at any time during the 24 months follow up period there was a tumor recurrence, the&#xD;
           participant continued on study with follow-up cystoscopic examination and urine cytology&#xD;
           every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24 months.&#xD;
           Participants with a recurrence were permitted to have a follow-up TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at any time during the 24 months follow up period there was a tumor recurrence and/or&#xD;
           participant started on another therapy, the participant was followed by telephone, for&#xD;
           safety every 90 days (±10 days) (calculated from date of TURBT) through the end of 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: The duration of the study for each participant was approximately 24 months&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period : 30-days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period : Day 1 and Day 15 (±5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and Follow-up Period: 24-months&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were adverse events that occurred from the first dose of study treatment until 40 days after the last dose of study drug administration or 40 days after the date of participant early discontinuation. Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment reported as possible, probable, definite, or missing. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the outcomes: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. TEAEs were adverse events that occurred from the first dose of study treatment until 40 days after the last dose of study drug administration or 40 days after the date of participant early discontinuation. Treatment-related AEs included TEAEs with relationship to study treatment reported as possible, probable, definite, or missing. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the outcomes: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
