  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide oral panobinostat (PAN) treatment to relapsed or&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients who are without satisfactory treatment&#xD;
      alternatives prior to the commercial availability* and reimbursement of panobinostat during&#xD;
      the regulatory approval process. This protocol will acquire additional safety data on the use&#xD;
      of panobinostat in combination with bortezomib (BTZ) and dexamethasone (Dex) in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In this protocol, PAN must be&#xD;
      administered in the defined regimen in combination with both BTZ and DEX.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *(Note: throughout this protocol &quot;commercially available&quot; means local health authority&#xD;
      approval and a functional method for reimbursement)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center study of oral panobinostat administered in&#xD;
      combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed, and relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panobinostat will be administered in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone over&#xD;
           2 weeks in each 21 day cycle; the third week will be without administration of any drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment phase 1 will consist of 8, 21 day cycles (24 weeks). Patients with clinical&#xD;
           benefit at the end of cycle 8 as per investigator assessment may continue to receive&#xD;
           study treatment in phase 2 for a maximum of an additional 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not achieved or maintained at least &quot;no change&quot; (EBMT response&#xD;
           criterion) by 8 cycles must discontinue from study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The protocol will remain open in each participating country until drug is commercially&#xD;
           available and reimbursable or until July 2017, whichever comes first (except in Norway&#xD;
           where this protocol will end by March 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing schedule for treatment is detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase 1 (weeks 1-24 starting C1D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAN given three times per week (TIW), weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days&#xD;
           1,3,5,8,10, and 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BTZ given twice a week (BIW) weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,4,8, and 11)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dex given for 2 days twice a week (BIW), with BTZ on weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle&#xD;
           (Cycle days 1,2,4,5,8,9,11, and 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase 2 (24 weeks starting C9D1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAN given TIW, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,3,5,8,10, and 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BTZ given once a week, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3 week cycle (Cycle days 1 and 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dex for 2 days once a week with BTZ, weeks 1 &amp; 2 of each 3-week cycle (Cycle days 1,2,8,&#xD;
           and 9)&#xD;

                       suppository In case of use of oral contraception women should have been&#xD;
                       stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study&#xD;
                       treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12&#xD;
        months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
        appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
        (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
        oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
        follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
