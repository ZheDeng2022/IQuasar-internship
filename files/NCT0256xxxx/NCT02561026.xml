    <textblock>
      Frozen plasma (FP) is commonly transfused to patients with abnormal coagulation results prior&#xD;
      to medical procedures associated with a risk of bleeding (e.g. involving a needle or&#xD;
      incision). The most frequent group that requires FP transfusions are patients admitted to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit. These patients frequently have abnormal coagulation tests and also&#xD;
      frequently require invasive medical procedures that can be associated with bleeding. While FP&#xD;
      transfusions can improve abnormal coagulation test results, there is no evidence to suggest&#xD;
      that prophylactic FP transfusions will reduce bleeding associated with medical procedures in&#xD;
      patients with mild coagulation abnormalities. Additionally, it is known that important&#xD;
      adverse complications occur with FP transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will undertake a pilot randomized controlled trial in non-bleeding ICU&#xD;
      patients who require an invasive medical procedure (central venous catheterization, chest&#xD;
      tube, thoracocentesis, paracentesis, biopsy, fluid drainage) in 3 Canadian hospitals.&#xD;
      Patients with an abnormal coagulation test (INR between 1.5 to 2.5) will receive a FP&#xD;
      transfusion or no treatment prior to an invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this pilot study will be feasibility (the number of patients enrolled&#xD;
      per month). Other important outcomes will include those that will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      definitive trial including bleeding post procedure, red cell transfusions, adverse&#xD;
      transfusion reactions, mortality and hospital length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to enrol 80 patients over 2 years in 3 Canadian hospitals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There are 3 accepted indications for transfusing FP:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. bleeding in patients with prolonged coagulation tests that cannot be corrected with&#xD;
           other products or medications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. prior to surgery or invasive procedures in patients who have prolonged coagulation test&#xD;
           that cannot be corrected with other products or medications and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. plasmapheresis for Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia Purpura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the indications for FP seem relatively straightforward, there are still large&#xD;
      variations in use and important inappropriate use. This is due to the lack of properly&#xD;
      conducted studies evaluating the true risk of bleeding in patients with an abnormal&#xD;
      coagulation tests and, as a consequence, a lack of knowledge about the true benefits or harms&#xD;
      of transfusing FP to reduce bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current paradigm for the use of FP to treat or prevent bleeding is based on the following&#xD;
      assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. elevated coagulation tests represent a decrease in coagulation factors that will&#xD;
           contribute to bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FP transfusions will increase the levels of coagulation factors and correct the&#xD;
           coagulation test abnormalities,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the correction of the coagulation test abnormality will decrease bleeding. However,&#xD;
           there is a lack of evidence to support each of the assumptions in this paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, while decreases in coagulation factor levels may increase the risk of bleeding, this&#xD;
      only occurs when coagulation factor levels decrease below a minimum hemostatic threshold. The&#xD;
      minimum hemostatic for most coagulation factors is 30%. In vitro data demonstrates that, in&#xD;
      samples with a single factor coagulation deficiency, the commonly used coagulation tests, the&#xD;
      prothrombin time (usually reported as an international normalized ratio (INR) and the&#xD;
      activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) will become abnormal when the levels are 25-40%&#xD;
      or below. However, in the setting of multiple factor deficiencies, which is the situation&#xD;
      usually encountered in clinical practice, mild to moderate increases in INR are seen with&#xD;
      coagulation factor levels that are considerably higher than the minimum hemostatic threshold&#xD;
      of 30%. Work by the group and others confirm that in patients with critical illness and liver&#xD;
      disease factor levels are consistently above the hemostatic threshold even when the INR is&#xD;
      elevated. This lack of correlation between abnormal coagulation test results and increased&#xD;
      bleeding risk is supported by a systematic review of observational studies that showed no&#xD;
      increased bleeding risk in patients with abnormal coagulation tests as compared to patients&#xD;
      with normal coagulation tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the expected improvement in coagulation factor tests following a FP transfusion is&#xD;
      often not seen especially in mild to moderate coagulation test abnormalities. Given the&#xD;
      concentration of 1 unit/ml for individual coagulation factor levels in FP, transfusing four&#xD;
      units of FP (approximately 800-1000 mls) to a 70 kg patient with a 5-litre blood volume,&#xD;
      would be expected to increase levels by a maximum of 16%. However, the effect on the INR will&#xD;
      also depend on the starting level of the coagulation factors. If the levels are very low&#xD;
      (less than 10%), this will result in a significant improvement in the INR, but if the initial&#xD;
      levels are only mildly decreased, the same increase in coagulation factor levels will make&#xD;
      little change in the INR. Furthermore, the INR FP units can be as high as 1.3. The lack of&#xD;
      efficacy of FP to correct the INR or aPTT in patients with mild increases in the INR has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in a number of studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, there is little data from clinical studies that demonstrates that attempting to&#xD;
      correct abnormal coagulation tests with FP reduces bleeding. Based on clinical experience, in&#xD;
      patients with a high INR and active bleeding, FP may be beneficial in controlling bleeding.&#xD;
      However, the prophylactic use of FP has never been shown to reduce bleeding. The only&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials showed no reduction in bleeding following FP transfusion in&#xD;
      neonates, patients with pancreatitis or after cardiac surgery. A retrospective study of FP&#xD;
      use in critical care patients showed no differences in bleeding after the administration of&#xD;
      FP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall there have been few randomized controlled studies that have examined the efficacy or&#xD;
      effectiveness of FP transfusions. Only 3 randomized controlled studies evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of FP (as compared to no treatment) prior to invasive procedures have been&#xD;
      carried out. All 3 studies failed to recruit sufficient patients due to important issues in&#xD;
      the design of these trials. The main failure in the first two studies was the narrow&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. Two studies only included patients undergoing a single type of&#xD;
      procedure and they included only patients with very mild coagulation abnormalities (i.e. an&#xD;
      INR equivalent of less than 2.0). Thus, many patients with modest coagulation abnormalities&#xD;
      were excluded thereby leaving only a small pool of potentially eligible patients. The third&#xD;
      study failed to recruit patients for a number of reasons including restrictive inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and inability to obtain consent for emergency procedures especially after hours.&#xD;
      While this study recruited patients undergoing a variety of invasive procedures and used a&#xD;
      wider INR threshold, they did reduce the number of potentially eligible patients by not&#xD;
      including patients with thrombocytopenia or patients on anti-platelet agents (both common in&#xD;
      ICU patients). Less than 30% of eligible patients were enrolled as informed consent from the&#xD;
      patients or a surrogate was required prior to enrolling the patient. As ICU patients&#xD;
      frequently have prolonged INR tests and require urgent procedures at the time of admission, a&#xD;
      deferred consent process and the ability to enroll patients after hours is absolutely&#xD;
      essential to ensure that eligible ICU patient who are usually not able to give consent are&#xD;
      not systematically excluded from the trial due to the need for informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, FP is commonly transfused prior to invasive procedures in patients with an&#xD;
      elevated INR. Remarkably, there is no evidence that transfusing FP reduces bleeding&#xD;
      complications when transfused prophylactically. Observational data suggests that an elevated&#xD;
      INR does not increase risk of bleeding from invasive procedures. However, there is no&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial data to support not transfusing FP. This lack of evidence combined&#xD;
      with fear of causing bleeding during an invasive procedure and an under-appreciation of the&#xD;
      potential harms associated with blood transfusions contributes to continued practice of&#xD;
      transfusing FP prior to invasive procedures. Given that mild to moderately increased&#xD;
      coagulation tests have not been associated with increased bleeding following invasive&#xD;
      procedures and the FP transfusion are known to only partially correct abnormal coagulation&#xD;
      tests, the prophylactic use of FP may be exposing patients to potentially life-threatening&#xD;
      adverse reactions without providing any benefit. Previous randomized controlled trials of FP&#xD;
      transfusions prior to invasive procedures have failed to enroll sufficient patients, but they&#xD;
      had important limitations in their design that affected their ability to recruit patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study is required to determine if, by using specific strategies to increase&#xD;
      enrollment, a large pragmatic clinical trial can successfully be implemented to determine the&#xD;
      benefit and safety of transfusing FP prior to invasive procedures. The planned study will be&#xD;
      pragmatic and open to the most common procedures in ICU patients who are known to represent&#xD;
      the largest group of patients receiving FP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial with blinded&#xD;
      outcome assessment. In this trial evaluating feasibility, the investigators will randomly&#xD;
      allocate ICU patients who have an elevated INR and require an invasive procedure to receive&#xD;
      either a FP transfusion or no transfusion. Patients will be followed for bleeding&#xD;
      complications and adverse transfusion reactions for 48 hours following the invasive&#xD;
      procedure, and for mortality for the duration of their hospital stay. All bleeding&#xD;
      complications will be recorded using a validated bleeding score and adjudicated by blinded&#xD;
      assessors.&#xD;
