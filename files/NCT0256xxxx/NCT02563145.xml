    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether real-time fMRI feedback is effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of aggressive behavior problems in adolescents with high callous unemotional traits&#xD;
      when compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;

      In this study, which is part of the European research project MATRICS (Multidisciplinary&#xD;
      Approaches to Translational Research), the investigators focus on testing an innovative,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological therapeutic approach for adolescents with a specific, difficult to treat&#xD;
      subtype of aggressive behavior problems. Participants will be trained to acquire control over&#xD;
      their own physiological parameters, in case of this study the activation of certain brain&#xD;
      areas. While trying to control these parameters, participants get direct continuous feedback&#xD;
      about their physiological state and its changes, and are rewarded for successful&#xD;
      manipulation. Biofeedback methods are currently used to treat patients with a variety of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) feedback will be used, where&#xD;
      participants will get feedback about activation levels and patterns from brain regions&#xD;
      associated with emotion processing (amygdala/insula) in almost real time while lying in a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance tomograph scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will focus on the following questions concerning the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can participants gain increasing control over the activation of defined brain regions&#xD;
           through real-time fMRI training?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Which short- and longer term consequences can be expected from improved self control&#xD;
           over brain activation upon aggressive and antisocial behavior problems?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the training, all participants will undergo an extensive pre-treatment assessment as&#xD;
      part of the characterization and subtyping of aggression within the large multicenter&#xD;
      subtyping studies (EU-Aggressotype and EU-MATRICS). The assessment includes clinical and&#xD;
      psychometric measures, neuropsychological testing, fMRI (3 active tasks + resting state), MRS&#xD;
      (anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as well as&#xD;
      biosampling (blood/saliva for genetics/epigenetics/hormones). Comparison with a typically&#xD;
      developing (TD) control group receiving no intervention will allow to interpret changes in&#xD;
      terms of normalization or compensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of this pretest, subjects meeting the inclusion criteria for the rt-fMRI&#xD;
      treatment study will be randomly assigned to two different treatment arms, either to the&#xD;
      experimental fMRI real-time feedback condition or to the comparator condition with treatment&#xD;
      as usual (TAU) lasting 10 weeks. Subjects assigned to the experimental condition will receive&#xD;
      10 sessions (1/week) of real-time fMRI feedback of amygdala and/or insula activation (based&#xD;
      on activation patterns during pre-training assessment). Each training will last about 1 1/2&#xD;
      hours and consist of 3 experimental blocks, including feedback- and transfer trials. Video&#xD;
      clips of emotional and aggressive interpersonal interactions will partly be used to enrich&#xD;
      feedback conditions with naturalistic, virtual reality type displays. Heart rate and&#xD;
      electrodermal activity will be recorded simultaneously during the sessions. Subjects in the&#xD;
      comparator TAU arm will receive several sessions of psychoeducation and counseling with their&#xD;
      parents/caregivers or group training over the 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of either the training or the TAU, subjects will undergo post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment, repeating the teachers and parents reports on behavioral measures, as well as the&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing, fMRI and MRS. A follow-up assessment will take place 6 months&#xD;
      after the end of the treatment phase and will comprise only parents and teachers reports on&#xD;
      behavioral measures.&#xD;
