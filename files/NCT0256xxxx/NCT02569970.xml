  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a tragic outcome of seizure disorders that&#xD;
      primarily affect young adults suffering from refractory epilepsy. In this population, SUDEP&#xD;
      incidence is estimated at 0.5%. While the mechanisms of SUDEP are not completely understood,&#xD;
      it appears that the majority of such death occurs in the immediate aftermath of a general&#xD;
      tonic-clonic seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no validated preventive treatment for SUDEP. Some evidence suggest that&#xD;
      modulation of the serotoninergic tone, and more specifically selective serotonin recapture&#xD;
      inhibitor (SSRI) such as fluoxetine, might prevent SUDEP. Indeed, fluoxetine prevents&#xD;
      seizure-induced lethal central apneas in DBA/2 and DBA/1 mice, one of the few animal models&#xD;
      of SUDEP. Furthermore, serotoninergic bulbar nuclei are known to play a major role in the&#xD;
      control of breathing, especially during sleep and in response to repeated hypoxia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with epilepsy undergoing in-hospital video-EEG monitoring, about one third of&#xD;
      seizures are associated with decrease in SpO2 &lt;90%, an abnormality suspected to represent a&#xD;
      risk factor of SUDEP. In a retrospective uncontrolled study, patients treated with SSRIs&#xD;
      displayed less frequent ictal/post-ictal hypoxemia than patients not taking SSRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators project aimed at testing whether fluoxetine can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      ictal/post-ictal hypoxemia by performing a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      in patients undergoing video-EEG monitoring as part of the pre-surgical evaluation of their&#xD;
      focal drug-resistant epilepsy.&#xD;
