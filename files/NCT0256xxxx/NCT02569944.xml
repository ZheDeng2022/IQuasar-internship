    <textblock>
      Randomize trial by including patients up to 12 months old in whom a urine sample by a&#xD;
      non-sterile method was requested under physician criteria. Intention-to-treat analysis was&#xD;
      made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine dipstick was considered as altered if it was positive in leukoesterase test (≥2+) or&#xD;
      nitrite test. In patients with an altered urine dipstick, a sterile sample was obtained for&#xD;
      culture. If there was an initial altered urine dipstick with a subsequent negative urine&#xD;
      culture it was considered as contaminated urine.&#xD;

      Randomised not-blind trial developed between june 1st, 2013 and December 31st, 2014 at the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of Rio Hortega Universitary Hospital, a secondary&#xD;
      hospital located in Valladolid (Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were infants up to one-year-old in whom a urine sample by a non-sterile method&#xD;
      was requested under physician criteria and a written consent was signed by&#xD;
      parents/caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study obtained the approval of Western Valladolid Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded from the study if they met at least one of the following criteria: a)&#xD;
      patients in whom a urine sample obtained by sterile method was needed by protocol (i.e.&#xD;
      febrile infants less than 3 months old), b) patients with underlying disease unable to oral&#xD;
      intake of liquids, c) patients whom parents/caregivers refused to sign the informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization process:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were assigned to one of the 2 groups of treatment (BS vs. PB) following a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      randomization sequence generated by one of the investigators (RV) using Stata® 12. (Stata&#xD;
      Corp, College Station, Texas). After being generated, the sequence was introduced in opaque&#xD;
      envelopes sequentially numbered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study When, under physician criteria, it was decided to obtain a urine sample&#xD;
      by a non-sterile method and the nurse staff that participates in the study were present at&#xD;
      the shift, informed consent was asked to parents/caregivers. Once the consent was signed, the&#xD;
      nurse opened the corresponding envelope, and the patient was assigned to one of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the nurse that developed the technique filled a spreadsheet with data&#xD;
      of the patient. Time was measured by using a stopwatch (the same one for all patients) that&#xD;
      was not used for any purpose but the study. Urine sample was sent to the laboratory where one&#xD;
      analyst performed the leukocyte-esterase and nitrite test. The analyst has no knowledge about&#xD;
      the technique used on each patient and the result of the urine culture was obtained from&#xD;
      hospital database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If urine dipstick result was altered, another urine sample was obtained by sterile method,&#xD;
      and urine dipstick and culture was done from that sample. Sterile sample was not routinely&#xD;
      obtained from patients in whom non-sterile sample dipstick was normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those patients who were considered as failure, the decision of obtaining an urine sample&#xD;
      by the alternative technique, or by urethral catheterization was up to the physician who was&#xD;
      attending the patient.&#xD;

    <description>Primary outcome is the obtention of an urine sample within the time determinate for each technique. Bladder stimulation technique is a procedure that lasts 5 minutes (300 seconds). If urine sample was obtained of patients that underwent this technique, it was considered a success. if not, a failure.&#xD;
The same was determined for the perineal bag group. In this case, our hospital's protocol recommends to use a perineal bag no longer than 30 minutes, due to risk of contamination, and after three attempts, to consider other options, so in the patients that a perineal bag was placed, if obtaining a urine sample within 90 min (5400 seconds) was considered a success. Otherwise, it was considered as a failure.&#xD;
For the purpose of the primary objective of the study, rate of falilures of each technique was compared.</description>
