      BACKGROUND: Central venous catheters (CVC) are the only option when hemodialysis is needed&#xD;
      for patients without definitive vascular access. However, CVC use is associated with&#xD;
      complications such as infection, thrombosis, and dysfunction, leading to higher mortality and&#xD;
      expenditures. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 30% trisodium citrate&#xD;
      (TSC30%) with heparin as CVC lock solution in preventing catheter-related bloodstream&#xD;
      infections (CRBSI) and dysfunction in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind controlled trial comparing the event-free survival of non-tunneled CVC locked&#xD;
      with heparin or TSC30% in adult hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

      METHODS Study Design This double blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from&#xD;
      July 2012 until July 2014 in the dialysis and transplantation unit of a Brazilian university&#xD;
      hospital. The patients were randomly assigned to have their catheter locked with either&#xD;
      unfractionated sodium heparin 5000 U/mL or 30% trisodium citrate. The randomization was&#xD;
      performed through a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of six. Patients and&#xD;
      investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments. Allocation concealment was performed&#xD;
      using opaque, sealed envelopes for assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each hemodialysis (HD) session, patients assigned to 30%TSC had their catheter lumens&#xD;
      flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride and locked with a volume of 30% TSC solution equivalent to&#xD;
      the catheter internal lumen. Patients assigned to heparin had their catheter lumens flushed&#xD;
      with 0.9% sodium chloride and locked with a volume of 5000 U/mL heparin equivalent to CVC&#xD;
      internal lumen. Catheter care was according to international guidelines, including strict&#xD;
      asepsis on insertion and exit-site dressing changes after each HD session by staff wearing&#xD;
      masks and sterile gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SELECTION OF PATIENTS Patients were eligible for enrollment in the RCT when they were older&#xD;
      than 18 years and had chronic or acute renal failure that required hemodialysis through a&#xD;
      catheter. Patients admitted to the intensive care ward, receiving a tunneled catheter, with&#xD;
      suspected heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, allergy to heparin or TSC30%, with systemic or&#xD;
      localized infection or pregnant women were excluded. The site of insertion and specific type&#xD;
      of catheter were decided by the interventionist physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN OUTCOMES Catheter related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): CRBSI was defined as fever&#xD;
      and/or chills during a dialysis session and at least one positive blood culture, with no&#xD;
      other obvious cause of infection after careful clinical examination. The management of the&#xD;
      CRBSI was performed according to guidelines. Empirical antibiotic therapy was immediately&#xD;
      given. The catheter was removed if there was isolation of S. aureus or fungus, or there was&#xD;
      no clinical recovery within 48 hours of antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter dysfunction: Dysfunction was defined as a persistent inability to obtain a blood&#xD;
      flow above 200 mL/min. In this situation, the catheter was removed or exchanged over&#xD;
      guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OTHER PREDICTORS Patients-related: Data was also collected about age, gender, skin color,&#xD;
      presence of diabetes, diagnosis of CKD or acute kidney injury, and hemodialysis vintage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter-related: Site of insertion (jugular, subclavian or femoral vein), and ordinal number&#xD;
      of catheter in the same patient (considering only the study period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Calculation of the required sample size was based on main outcomes. It&#xD;
      was assumed that the group with heparin lock would have a rate of catheter-related&#xD;
      bloodstream infection of 150% greater than that of catheters with TCS30% lock. With a&#xD;
      two-sided test, and an alfa error of 5% and 80% of power, it was required 112 catheters for&#xD;
      each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis was made through survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard&#xD;
      regression. Initially the investigators proceed to univariate analysis using Kaplan-Meier&#xD;
      curves and log rank test for the categorical variables, and univariate Cox regression for&#xD;
      continuous variables. The predictors which have a p-value lower than 0.25 in univariate&#xD;
      analysis were included in final model. Interactions were checked for any possible association&#xD;
      of predictors. The likelihood ratio test was used for compare nested with full models. The&#xD;
      proportionality of predictors was verified by introduction of time-dependent variables in the&#xD;
      model. If any predictor violates the proportionality assumption, the analysis would be&#xD;
      stratified for that predictor. Well-functioning catheters at the end of the study period,&#xD;
      catheters removed because patients acquired functional arteriovenous fistula, renal function&#xD;
      recovery, changed to peritoneal dialysis or had transplantation were analyzed as censored&#xD;
      data. The analysis was all done on intention-to-treat base. All reported p-value are two&#xD;
      sided. The analysis was performed using the STATA 11.2 statistical software (Stata&#xD;
      Corporation, College Station, TX, USA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS The study protocol was approved by the local review board. Written informed&#xD;
      consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment.&#xD;
