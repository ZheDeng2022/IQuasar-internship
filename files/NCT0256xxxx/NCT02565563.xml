  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to gain greater insight into Eye Movement Desensitisation&#xD;
      Reprocessing (EMDR). EMDR is an NHS recommended treatment, which can significantly reduce&#xD;
      trauma symptoms. There is some debate regarding how it actually works, however there is&#xD;
      evidence to suggest that the eye movements component helps reduce anxiety and increase&#xD;
      relaxation levels. To measure these arousal levels during EMDR previous research has used&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG) to measure heart rate, which offers insight into the effectiveness&#xD;
      of eye movements (EM). All studies to date have used ECG to measure arousal levels which&#xD;
      requires technical knowledge to administer and interpret. Furthermore, applying electrodes to&#xD;
      a patient experiencing PTSD may heighten anxiety. The present study will use new technology&#xD;
      which is a small device that would be gently attached to the end of the patient's index&#xD;
      finger. This device is very similar to one that measures oxygen levels in the blood and&#xD;
      therefore is a very simple piece of equipment and should cause no discomfort to the patient.&#xD;
      The study also requires patient's faces to be video recorded throughout and it will only be&#xD;
      their face that is recorded. This is to match the stages of treatment (i.e. when EM starts&#xD;
      and stops) to their corresponding arousal level outcome. The new technology will digitally&#xD;
      measure the patient's anxious and relaxed arousal levels during EM and no EM treatment&#xD;
      sessions. 10 NHS patients would be recruited to receive two treatment sessions; one with EM&#xD;
      and one without and then continue with treatment as usual without any of the recording&#xD;
      devices. EM and no EM phases occur at least three times within a treatment session and&#xD;
      therefore several measurements can be taken and analysed.&#xD;

      DESIGN Each patient will receive an Eye Movement Desensitisation Reprocessing (EMDR)&#xD;
      treatment session with eye movements (EM) and an EMDR treatment session without EM. Half will&#xD;
      complete the EM session first and the other half will complete the no EM session first. After&#xD;
      the first session is complete the patients will cross over to complete the other treatment&#xD;
      session, which will be approximately one week later. This is known as a cross over design and&#xD;
      allows patients to act as their own control group. Furthermore they will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into which condition they complete first to reduce order effects. During both&#xD;
      treatment sessions patients will have their arousal levels digitally measured and face video&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Patients who have been referred for trauma will be allocated from the NHS Tayside&#xD;
      waiting list. From January 2013 to January 2014 there were approximately 72 patients across&#xD;
      Tayside who were treated for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and/or 'reaction to severe&#xD;
      stress, and adjustment disorders'. This was taken from the online patient database (MiDIS),&#xD;
      which is mandatory for all clinicians in NHS Tayside to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE NHS Tayside Adult Psychological Therapies Service receives electronic referrals,&#xD;
      usually from the GP, stating the reason for referral. The patients' symptoms/diagnoses and&#xD;
      CHI number are then documented in a diary waiting to be allocated to the next available&#xD;
      appointment. The clinicians will look through the diary, noting the ones who appear to meet&#xD;
      the relevant diagnosis/symptoms to ensure that they will be seen by an EMDR qualified&#xD;
      clinician if they choose to be seen by psychology at all. Patient's who appear to meet the&#xD;
      initial criteria, will be sent a standard protocol appointment letter, stating that they must&#xD;
      contact the service within 2 weeks if they still wish to be seen by psychology. Those who&#xD;
      choose to be seen will be provided with an initial assessment session, where information is&#xD;
      gathered about their presenting problems and history. They will also be asked to complete&#xD;
      routine questionnaires. This will be completed by the EMDR qualified clinician, who at the&#xD;
      same time will offer them to take part in the study if they believe the patient is suitable&#xD;
      for EMDR. If the therapist believes the patient is not suitable for EMDR then as part of&#xD;
      standard protocol the assessment will be completed and the patient will be allocated to the&#xD;
      next available clinician for treatment. If the patient is suitable then the clinician will&#xD;
      explain the parameters of the study which will include, digitally measuring arousal levels&#xD;
      and video recording the patient's face during their first two treatment sessions of EMDR&#xD;
      therapy with the assessing clinician. Also at their first session the clinician will show the&#xD;
      equipment that will be used and provide them with a participant information letter about the&#xD;
      study for them to take away and think about. Within the information letter they will be&#xD;
      informed that choosing not to take part will not affect their routine care and even if they&#xD;
      choose to take part they can drop out at any time and continue with treatment as usual. The&#xD;
      chief investigator's contact details will also be provided, should they require further&#xD;
      information. At the end of the letter they will be provided with 2 options: 1. I agree to&#xD;
      take part in the study. 2. I do not wish to take part in the study. They will need to contact&#xD;
      the service within 5 days of their first session to inform us of their decision. This is to&#xD;
      allow the equipment to be set up in advance if they agree to take part. Regardless of whether&#xD;
      they decide to take part in the study or not, their next session will be within 2 weeks of&#xD;
      the initial assessment, which will be with the same clinician if they take part, but may be a&#xD;
      different clinician of they do not take part, which is within standard service protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who agree to take part in the study will be required to bring their signed consent form&#xD;
      (contained within the participant information letter) to their second session or complete&#xD;
      another one on the day before engaging within the study. Their second session will either be&#xD;
      to complete the assessment process/other formal measures (documented below) or start with&#xD;
      EMDR treatment. This will be up to the clinician depending on how much information was&#xD;
      gathered in session 1. This is within standard service protocol. Before treatment can begin&#xD;
      each patient must complete the formal assessment measures. Only the 2 treatment sessions will&#xD;
      use the recording equipment and following this they will continue with treatment without&#xD;
      being part of the study. If at any point they decide that they no longer wish to take part,&#xD;
      treatment will continue as usual, without the recording devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMDR trained clinicians will administer the EMDR treatment with 3 or 4 patients each. As&#xD;
      standard service protocol, patients will receive a minimum of one hour per treatment session&#xD;
      and each session will take place in an NHS psychological therapies service building.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the treatment sessions patients will be exposed to EMDR with eye movements (Condition&#xD;
      1, C1) and EMDR without eye movements (Condition 2, C2) conducted by the EMDR accredited&#xD;
      therapist. Patients will be randomly allocated into either C1 or C2 for his or her first&#xD;
      session. Session one and session two will be no more than two weeks apart with each session&#xD;
      lasting approximately one hour. At the beginning of each session patients will be required to&#xD;
      attach the small infrared transmittance heart rate sensor (HeartMath) to their index finger,&#xD;
      which will digitally record their arousal levels and transfer the responses to the laptop.&#xD;
      Their face will also be video recorded during the entire session by a small camera on a&#xD;
      laptop located approximately three feet across from them. The purpose of this is to be able&#xD;
      to match the time of when specific EMDR phases were administrated (the eye movements), to the&#xD;
      same time of the patients HRV response. Although faces will be recorded throughout the entire&#xD;
      session, only certain stages of the eight stage therapy protocol will be analysed. A five&#xD;
      minute adaptation period will be given to all individuals. During both treatment sessions the&#xD;
      therapist will use a chosen life event to use within the EMDR protocol. Where possible, the&#xD;
      clinician will seek to ensure that each patient will complete the full eight stage protocol&#xD;
      as outlined by Shapiro (1989) (Appendix 1). Each individual will also score the vividness&#xD;
      scale before and after each condition is completed. A self measure of distress level (known&#xD;
      as subjective units of distress [SUD]) are also obtained throughout each session as part of&#xD;
      standard EMDR protocol, requiring the patient to rate their level of distress on a scale of 1&#xD;
      to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routinely used within the National Health Service (NHS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) (Beck et al., 1961) will be administered in&#xD;
           session 1, to ascertain the participants' mental health and well being. The BDI-II will&#xD;
           be used because it is a widely used measure of depression (Beck et al, 1988).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Life Events Checklist (LEC) (Weathers et al., 2013) will be administered in session&#xD;
           1 or 2, but before treatment commences, to determine a specific trauma that patients&#xD;
           have been subjected to within their life. The LEC is a measure of exposure to&#xD;
           potentially traumatic events, which was developed at the National Centre for&#xD;
           Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Once a trauma has been identified this will be the&#xD;
           specific trauma that will be used within treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact of event scale (IES) (Horowitz et al., 1979) will be completed in session 1 or 2,&#xD;
           but before treatment begins. It will be administered in conjunction to the LEC, to&#xD;
           measure post trauma symptomology, which is one of the most widely used self-report&#xD;
           measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients self measure of distress (also known as Subjective Units of Distress [SUDs]) -&#xD;
           This will be measured on a scale of 1 to 10 and is part of the eight stage EMDR&#xD;
           protocol. This will occur during the 2 treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures not routinely used in the NHS service:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) (Bernstein &amp; Putnam): this will be administered in&#xD;
           session 1, to screen patients who dissociate, since EMDR is found to be ineffective with&#xD;
           patients who dissociate as they are unable to attend to the unpleasant thought. Patients&#xD;
           scoring 30 and above will be excluded from this study. Although a formal dissociate&#xD;
           measure is not routinely use, therapists will often use their clinical judgement to&#xD;
           determine if someone is dissociating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arousal levels - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) will be digitally recorded using an&#xD;
           infrared transmittance heart rate sensor (HeartMath) which will be connected to the&#xD;
           patient's index finger throughout the entire 2 treatment sessions. The device is very&#xD;
           similar to the device that measures oxygen levels in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Facial Behaviour - A laptop camera, located three feet away from the patient, will&#xD;
           record the patient's face throughout the entire 2 treatment sessions, so that the time&#xD;
           when the different phases of EMDR are administered can be matched to the same time on&#xD;
           the patient's arousal level response. In order to accurately match patients' arousal&#xD;
           responses to what treatment phase of EMDR was being administered recording must be&#xD;
           achieved. Recording facial behaviour may also allow for other observable analysis to be&#xD;
           completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Vividness Scale - Barrowcliff et al. (2004) found eye movements to produce a greater&#xD;
           reduction in arousal and vividness for memories associated with fear and anxiety&#xD;
           compared with an eye stationary condition using physiological measures of arousal. It&#xD;
           has also been found that eye movements resulted in reduced ratings of distress and&#xD;
           vividness compared to a no eye movement condition (Kavanagh et al, 2001). Therefore this&#xD;
           study will inform the degree of vividness associated with a particular image by asking&#xD;
           the patient to hold the image in mind for ten seconds and then indicate on a ten&#xD;
           centimetre visual analogue scale the degree to which the image appeared vivid from ''not&#xD;
           clear at all'' to ''very clear''. The scale will contain more than two anchors to&#xD;
           provide individuals with greater clarity. This is identical to a procedure used in&#xD;
           previous studies on vividness (van den Hout et al., 2001). This will be administered&#xD;
           during their 2 treatment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arousal levels and facial video recordings will be collected by the laptop program. The chief&#xD;
      investigator will review and analyse the results in order to determine whether eye movements&#xD;
      during EMDR treatment significantly improves arousal levels (i.e. is the patient more&#xD;
      relaxed) compared to no eye movements during EMDR treatment. Analysis will also include&#xD;
      taking time points across each treatment session in order to determine whether or not arousal&#xD;
      levels improve over the course of the session (i.e. do patients anxiety levels reduce over&#xD;
      the course of the session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME FRAMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify patients from waiting list by 1st October 2015. Patients to get in touch by&#xD;
      beginning of November to commence treatment end of November 2015 and complete by end of&#xD;
      February 2016. Analyse the data by the beginning of March 2016 and then commence write up to&#xD;
      complete by end of April 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study using the same technology and similar method as above was completed with 4&#xD;
      Undergraduate students.&#xD;
