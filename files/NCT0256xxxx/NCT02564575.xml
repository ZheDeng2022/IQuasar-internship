  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa highlights the need for prevention and&#xD;
      treatment strategies, as supportive therapy is currently the only treatment for Ebola virus&#xD;
      disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of two doses of the HPIV3-EbovZ GP vaccine candidate administered intranasally in healthy&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll healthy adults who have low pre-existing serum antibody titers to&#xD;
      human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). Participants will be enrolled sequentially in two&#xD;
      cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive two doses of 10^6.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3-EbovZ GP, approximately&#xD;
      4-8 weeks apart. Cohort 2 will receive two doses of 10^7.0 PFU/mL of HPIV3-EbovZ GP,&#xD;
      approximately 4-8 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the inpatient unit 1 or 2 days before receiving their first&#xD;
      dose of the vaccine. While in the inpatient unit, all participants will undergo a medical&#xD;
      history review, physical examination, nasal wash, blood collection, pregnancy testing (for&#xD;
      female participants), and pregnancy prevention counseling. Participants will be discharged&#xD;
      from the inpatient unit on Day 7 or possibly later, depending on the results of participant's&#xD;
      lab tests. An additional study visit will occur at Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 26, participants will be readmitted to the inpatient unit, and they will receive their&#xD;
      second dose of the vaccine on Day 28. Participants will undergo the same study procedures&#xD;
      that occurred during the first inpatient stay, and they will be discharged on Day 35.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 42, 56, 84, 112, 180, 270, and 360.&#xD;
