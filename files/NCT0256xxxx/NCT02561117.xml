  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether administering once-daily doses of&#xD;
      metronidazole, an intravenous (IV) antibiotic used to prevent infection in perforated&#xD;
      appendicitis, is as effective in children as delivering it in the standard method of once&#xD;
      every eight hours. Reducing the frequency of administration has the potential of decreasing&#xD;
      personnel time and healthcare cost and increasing the lifespan of the IV line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness once-daily administration, a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be conducted to compare outcomes between the two treatment schedules. We will recruit&#xD;
      100 patients (50 per treatment) aged 5-18 being surgically treated for perforated&#xD;
      appendicitis at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, who will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two treatment schedules. To compare the efficacy of the treatments, outcomes such&#xD;
      as duration of hospital stay and theoretical cost will be measured and analyzed using&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;

    <description>In our study, due to blinding, much of the potential cost-savings of once-daily administration of metronidazole - including nursing time, pharmacy time, and IV materials - will not be evident. However, we will calculate the potential cost-savings of once-daily administration. This will be based on number of hours of nursing time saved (the research coordinator (RC) will, on 10 occasions, observe a nurse administering a dose of metronidazole to a patient not enrolled in this study, and will average these to estimate the time required to administer one dose), number of hours of pharmacy time saved (the RC will, on 10 occasions, observe a pharmacist preparing a dose of metronidazole for a patient not enrolled in this study, and will average these to estimate the time required to prepare one dose), and cost saved on materials (the minibag used to deliver the antibiotic, the IV needle and line if it needed to be replaced, etc.)</description>
