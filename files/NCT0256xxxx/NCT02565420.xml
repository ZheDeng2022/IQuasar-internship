    <textblock>
      Perioperative volumes of saline cause a mild acidosis compared with buffered fluids. On the&#xD;
      other hand, saline administration maintains plasma osmolality and better repletes vascular&#xD;
      volume which is an important goal of perioperative fluid administration. Currently, there is&#xD;
      no convincing evidence that either saline or buffered solutions are preferable. Consequently,&#xD;
      both types of fluid remain in common use at the Clinic and worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has never been a large trial of perioperative saline and balanced salt solutions&#xD;
      comparing the incidence of major complications including acute kidney injury. The&#xD;
      investigators primary objective is thus to determine the relative safety of perioperative&#xD;
      saline and lactated Ringer's solution. Specifically, the investigators propose to test the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary hypothesis that a composite of major in-hospital postoperative complications is&#xD;
           lower in patients given lactated Ringer's solution compared to normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary hypothesis that acute kidney injury, measured by AKIN criteria, is lower in&#xD;
           patients given lactated Ringer's solution compared to normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acquisition cost of saline and lactated Ringer's solutions is similar in the United&#xD;
      States. (Curiously, buffered solutions are far more expensive than saline in Great Britain.)&#xD;
      But to the extent that one fluid or the other provokes more complications, cost of care may&#xD;
      be increased with that fluid selection. Cost may also be increased by the need for additional&#xD;
      electrolyte monitoring and electrolyte replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will therefore secondarily conduct an economic evaluation to determine the&#xD;
      relative incremental hospital cost of each fluid. To the extent that one fluid or the other&#xD;
      reduces cost (assuming similar complication rates), the Clinic will be able to reduce cost by&#xD;
      specifying the appropriate fluid without impairing quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence that one fluid or the other causes few complications would be a strong quality&#xD;
      indicator that the Clinic should standardize perioperative fluid selection.&#xD;
