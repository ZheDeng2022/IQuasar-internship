  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective of the study is to find out which everyday activities make the&#xD;
      kneecap unstable in people with patellofemoral instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysing how a patient with an unstable kneecap walks will help us to determine if surgery&#xD;
      is successful in these patients by seeing if better scores on patient questionnaires are&#xD;
      found in patients following surgery and whether these patients also have a better pattern of&#xD;
      walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to use cameras and pressure pads to see how patients walk before and&#xD;
      after surgery and see how this compares to patient scores on the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigators find that patients walk better after surgery they can justify that&#xD;
      surgery is worthwhile for the patient and cost effective for the NHS.&#xD;

      Recruitment strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred to a specialist patellofemoral clinic with an unstable kneecap(s) will be&#xD;
      approached by the student and asked whether they would be interested in participating in the&#xD;
      study (study group). Participants will be considered eligible for the study group if they&#xD;
      have had two or more episodes of kneecap dislocation or many episodes of instability with at&#xD;
      least one of the following: a feeling that the kneecap will dislocate with pressure,&#xD;
      tenderness along the inner side of the knee and/or abnormal movement or position of the&#xD;
      kneecap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be given a Patient Information Sheet (PIS) and be given time during the clinic to&#xD;
      ask questions about the study. During this first appointment as per routine current clinical&#xD;
      practice they will have an X-ray of their knee and fill in standard questionnaires to score&#xD;
      their knee function and pain (Norwich Patellofemoral Instability score, Kujala score,&#xD;
      PainDetect score, catastrophising score). The patient's knees will also be examined by the&#xD;
      consultant and a record made of the clinical findings. As per routine practice, a magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan of both knees will be organised for 4 weeks after the original&#xD;
      appointment and measurements of knee shape recorded. A total of 32 patients will be invited&#xD;
      to join the study to assess the movement of the kneecap in patients with kneecap instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of normal knees (control group) will be studied to compare the findings from students&#xD;
      aged 18 to 50 years at St George's University of London allowing both age and gender to be&#xD;
      matched to the study group . Students with no previous history of knee problems will be&#xD;
      eligible to join the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for both groups includes age 18-50 years, English language speakers, able&#xD;
      to use public transport or drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for both groups includes pregnancy, breast feeding, inability to give&#xD;
      informed consent, inflammatory arthropathy, osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in both the study and control groups will be provided with a Participant&#xD;
      Information Sheet (PIS) outlining the study design, objectives, procedures, data management&#xD;
      and dissemination plans. Participants will have a minimum of seven days to consider their&#xD;
      participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant expresses an interest in participating, and after time to read, consider and&#xD;
      discuss the PIS in clinic, they will be provided with an appointment at the MSk Lab at&#xD;
      Imperial College. At the start of the assessment the participant will be asked about their&#xD;
      potential eligibility based on the pre-defined eligibility criteria and will be provided with&#xD;
      a further opportunity to ask any questions about the study. If they are still interested in&#xD;
      participating, the potential participant will be asked to complete three Consent Forms and&#xD;
      they will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient participant will complete a Norwich Patellar Instability (NPI) Score&#xD;
      questionnaire, a Kujala Patellofemoral Disorders Score, a PainDetect score and a&#xD;
      Catastrophising score which are validated questionnaires. Baseline data recorded prior to&#xD;
      testing will include: presence of joint hypermobility syndrome (Beighton score), age, gender,&#xD;
      duration of symptoms, frequency of kneecap dislocation, knee range of motion, MRC (Medical&#xD;
      Research Council) muscle strength (flexion and extension), previous patellofemoral joint&#xD;
      surgery, family history of patellar instability and whether patellar instability is&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral. Basic demographic data for multi-variate regression analysis (e.g.&#xD;
      Body Mass Index data) will also be collected, along with measurements such as leg length /&#xD;
      height required for Hof scaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the control and study group will have gait analysis measurements performed as a baseline&#xD;
      for data collection. After a six minute acclimatization period at 4km/h on the instrumented&#xD;
      treadmill (Kistler Gaitway, Kistler Instrument Corporation, Amherst, NY), the speed is&#xD;
      increased until either the subject feels uncomfortable, or the walking performance&#xD;
      deteriorates. The procedure generally takes 12 minutes of continuous walking. Following the&#xD;
      flat ground assessment, the inclination is then increased in 5° increments at a steady 4&#xD;
      km/h, until either the subject feels uncomfortable, or the walking deteriorates. The&#xD;
      treadmill is then ramped to an inclination of 7° downhill. The subject is then asked to walk&#xD;
      initially at the same 4 km/h, and then at 0.5 km/h increments until they either feel&#xD;
      uncomfortable, or the walking performance deteriorates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all incremental intervals of speed and inclination, data on the way participants walk are&#xD;
      collected for both limbs with a by special plates under the treadmill track. Body weight&#xD;
      scaling for leg length are also applied to the outputted mechanical data to correct for&#xD;
      differences. All data are subject to averaging and filtering to handle the large amount of&#xD;
      continuous data the machine captures, normally entailing a minimum of six steps for each&#xD;
      limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to reproduce activities that have been associated with subjective&#xD;
      instability (e.g. running sideways, hopping, jumping, turning to look over a shoulder ) to&#xD;
      determine if the subjective feeling of instability correlates with physiological changes in&#xD;
      measurements captured on the instrumented treadmill. Electrical sensors on the skin will be&#xD;
      used to detect muscle activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study group during corrective surgery to deepen the groove, special markers and three&#xD;
      dimensional scanning will allow recording of kneecap movement without disturbing underlying&#xD;
      tissues to see if there is a statistically significant measurable difference, and if this&#xD;
      correlates to the change in performance/symptom scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months after surgery for the study group, gait analysis will be repeated at the MSk Lab&#xD;
      as previously outlined to determine the effect of surgery. The patients will be asked again&#xD;
      at this stage to fill in a Kujala and NPI score. It is anticipated that study subjects and&#xD;
      controls will be recruited over six months with data collection finished by a year from&#xD;
      enrolment of the first patient into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that there will be a direct relationship between&#xD;
      shape of the kneecap groove and participants' walking performance. This will be tested&#xD;
      formally by comparing the measurements taken of the kneecap and groove shape, and those from&#xD;
      the measurements of gait. The aim will be to see if surgery improves gait and stops the&#xD;
      kneecap dislocating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the study will be fed back to participants. Presentation of study findings&#xD;
      will be made at a local level with submission of a presentation to a regional meeting and&#xD;
      nationally prior to submission to journals offering open access publishing to allow&#xD;
      dissemination to other professionals and the public.&#xD;
