      PURPOSE OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to find out what is the true burden of surgical conditions&#xD;
      in pediatric population in a well defined geographical rural area in western Kenya.&#xD;

      MATERIAL This research will be conducted in the Homa Bay county in western Kenya in&#xD;
      previously selected locations around the county in rural area. An estimated 800 children and&#xD;
      youth under the age of 18 will be selected for this study. This study will take place between&#xD;
      October and November 2015. The investigators hypothesis, based on prior survey studies done&#xD;
      in Sub-Saharan Africa, is that roughly 6% of the people under 18 are suffering from a&#xD;
      surgical condition. In a sample size of 800 people the margin of error is 1,65%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who are currently being treated in a hospital will be excluded from the study. Also&#xD;
      the people who decline from the study will be excluded. The number of declinations will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The people will receive a written and a verbal information regarding the study and&#xD;
      its purposes from the primary research assistant. If they decide to participate in the study&#xD;
      they or their parent/guardian will be asked to sign an informed consent. Local interpreter&#xD;
      will be available to help with possible questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research assistant will conduct a short interview. Prior medical history will be&#xD;
      taken. The participants will be asked their age. If age is not known the primary research&#xD;
      assistant will estimate it. The height, weight and sex will be registered. A full physical&#xD;
      examination will then be conducted. In this examination the participants will be assessed for&#xD;
      visible deformations i.e. masses, scars, limb deformities. It will be determined whether the&#xD;
      deformation is congenital or acquired. If the deformity is acquired the cause will be asked&#xD;
      from the subject. The range of major joints will be registered. In case of palpable masses&#xD;
      the possible diagnosis will be figured out using basic clinical skills. A structured survey&#xD;
      sheet will be used collect the information. No other forms of diagnostic measures will be&#xD;
      used. No blood or microbial culture samples will be collected and no x-ray imaging will be&#xD;
      done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a surgical condition is diagnosed the participant will be informed about the nature and&#xD;
      possible cause of this condition. No treatment procedures will be done on site.&#xD;
