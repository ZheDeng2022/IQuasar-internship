  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a frequent consequence of amputation, and it is notoriously&#xD;
      difficult to treat. Amputation usually follows traumatic injuries or surgery following&#xD;
      vascular diseases, diabetes, osteomyelitis or tumours in cases where the loss of the limb is&#xD;
      required for the survival of the patient. The loss of a limb or other body parts is usually&#xD;
      followed by the sensation that the lost body part is still present and can be felt. These&#xD;
      phenomena are called, respectively, phantom awareness and phantom sensation. In 50-80% of&#xD;
      amputees neuropathic pain develops in the lost limb also referred to as phantom limb pain&#xD;
      (PLP). PLP can be related to a certain position or movement of the phantom limb, and might be&#xD;
      elicited or worsened by a range of physical factors (e.g. changes in the weather or pressure&#xD;
      on the residual limb) and psychological factors (e.g. emotional stress). It is well known&#xD;
      that most treatments available for PLP today, such as pharmacological, surgical, anaesthetic,&#xD;
      psychological and other, are ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today it is believed that phantom limb pain may be related to changes in the cortex of the&#xD;
      brain. There is evidence that these changes may be modulated - or even reversed - by&#xD;
      providing sensory input to the stump or amputation zone. For example, cortical reorganization&#xD;
      and alleviation of phantom limb pain has been observed in amputees following intense use of a&#xD;
      hand prosthesis. However, there is no consistent knowledge on which type of peripheral&#xD;
      sensory feedback may be effective in affecting the cortical plasticity or on how to best&#xD;
      apply the sensory feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed research is to create natural, meaningful sensations through&#xD;
      providing non-invasive sensory feedback (i.e. surface electrical stimulation) and the&#xD;
      effectiveness to alleviate phantom limb pain and restore the cortical neuroplastic changes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the experiment Up to 50-80 % of persons with amputations experience pain in the&#xD;
      part of the body that is missing. This phenomenon is called phantom limb pain. It is not&#xD;
      clear today why phantom limb pain occurs, and since the pain can be difficult to treat, it&#xD;
      can affect the quality of life. Other scientific studies have shown, that the use of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation applied through surface electrodes, can assist to decrease or&#xD;
      alleviate the phantom limb pain. The aim of this study is to investigate if surface&#xD;
      electrical stimulation for a period of 3 months can decrease or alleviate the phantom limb&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Before the study begins, it will be necessary to test if the participant can tolerate&#xD;
      the electrical stimulation and that the participant fulfill all criteria for participating in&#xD;
      the study. During the study, different electrical stimulation sequences will be applied. The&#xD;
      participant will be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires before, during and after the&#xD;
      electrical stimulation, to describe how the electrical stimulation is experienced, and if the&#xD;
      stimulation had an effect on the phantom limb pain and phantom sensations. The participant&#xD;
      will also be asked about their general mood to investigate if this has an effect on the pain.&#xD;
      The brain signals of the participants will be measured twice with either surface electrodes&#xD;
      or with a scanning technique, while the participant is thinking about moving the amputated&#xD;
      arm/hand, while moving the healthy arm, or while receiving electrical stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for the experiment The experiment will take place over a period of 3 months and consists&#xD;
      of a series of measurement and intervention sessions planned in 2 phases (intensive and&#xD;
      semi-intensive therapy). All sessions will take place at the University Hospital of Lausanne&#xD;
      (CHUV), Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 0. Interview and meeting with the subject (before the experiment begins, 1 session, 1-2&#xD;
      hours). Before the experiment begins, the participant is invited to a meeting and interview&#xD;
      with project responsible to inform the participant about the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1. Preliminary investigations (before the experiment starts, 1 session, maximum 3 hours&#xD;
      pr session). Before the experiment starts, but after the participant has signed the informed&#xD;
      consent, the investigators will test if the participant can tolerate the electrical&#xD;
      stimulation.The evoked sensory feedback sensations over the hand, will be characterized by&#xD;
      non-invasive, transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerves in different&#xD;
      locations on the upper limb, both when stimulating single channel per at time, or several&#xD;
      channels simultaneously. This session will allow to identify the electrical stimulation&#xD;
      optimal parameters (amplitude, frequency and pulse-width) to induce sensations on the hand&#xD;
      and how to modulate these sensations, close to natural pattern. A protocol to be integrated&#xD;
      in a close-loop (bidirectional control) system of artificial hand will be developed. If all&#xD;
      criteria for participation are fulfilled, the participation of the subject will be decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 to week 12. Experiments with the superficial stimulation and hand prosthesis control&#xD;
      (sEH) will then be performed three days per week for up to 3 hours per day according to the&#xD;
      daily experiment aims and the compliance of the subject. The duration of the experiments will&#xD;
      be 3 months. sEH will be divided in two different phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. intensive (from 1st to 6th week) ; during this period the experiments will be carried&#xD;
           out three days per week;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. semi-intensive (from 7th to 12th week); during this period the experiments will be&#xD;
           carried out one to two consecutive days per week;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stimulation protocol will be composed of different programs (Exp):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program 1 (Exp1) of the experiment will be performed in order to characterize the best&#xD;
      positions and parameters for the stimulation. The subjects will provide his/her feedback by&#xD;
      means of a dedicated psychophysical platform specially designed for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program 2 (Exp2) will be performed with the aim of trying different combination of&#xD;
      channels and to identify the best pattern to deliver the most natural and useful sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each stimulus is delivered with the different combination of electrodes, the&#xD;
      participant will provide his/her feedback on the type, strength and location of the sensation&#xD;
      (if any) through the psychophysical testing platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEH programs (Exp 3) The investigators will test the possibility to drive the stimulation&#xD;
      produced by electrical stimulator with the transformed signals from sensors in (or over) the&#xD;
      robotic hand, which is voluntary controlled by the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If everything works, the investigators will then proceed with the therapeutic use of the&#xD;
      robotic hand prosthesis. More specifically, they will ask the participant to perform several&#xD;
      tasks (depending on capacity, availability and motivation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) execution of different force levels ii) Identification of objects physical properties iii)&#xD;
      Embodiment tests (ownership) iv) Functional improvement tests (activities of daily living):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, side effects and disadvantages Surface stimulation may cause muscle-contractions.&#xD;
      Attachment of the surface electrodes may cause the skin to become red or irritated for some&#xD;
      hours following the experiment. The type of electrical stimulation used in this experiment is&#xD;
      not associated with any known risks or side effects. When the sensory threshold is determined&#xD;
      (i.e., the lowest strength of the electrical stimulation that the participant can feel), it&#xD;
      may feel unpleasant or painful for a short period of time, but the unpleasantness or pain&#xD;
      will disappear as soon as the electrical stimulation stops. The electrical stimulation&#xD;
      applied during the intervention period will be adjusted such that is it not painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the brain signals using the functional magnetic resonance imaging technique&#xD;
      (fMRI) is safe, and there are no known risks or side effects of this procedure. The&#xD;
      participant may, however, find that being placed inside the scanner is unpleasant.&#xD;
      Measurement of the brain signals with surface electrodes is also considered safe, and there&#xD;
      are no known risks or side effects of this procedure. There may be risks associated with the&#xD;
      experiment that are unknown to the investigators. Therefore, the participant are asked to&#xD;
      inform the investigators if the participant experiences any health problems during the&#xD;
      experiment. If any side effects are discovered by the investigators, the participant will be&#xD;
      informed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of the experiment There will be no benefits for the subject by participation in the&#xD;
      study. However, the participant may find that his/her phantom limb pain is alleviated during&#xD;
      the experiment as a result of the electrical stimulation. However, it is not possible for the&#xD;
      investigators to predict if the electrical stimulation will affect the phantom limb pain,&#xD;
      when the effect will start, how large the effect will be, or how long the effect will last.&#xD;
      It is not possible to offer the participants a permanent or lasting solution after&#xD;
      termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion from and suspension of the experiment If the participant, according to the&#xD;
      assessment of the investigator, react unexpectedly on the procedures or in any other way are&#xD;
      not suitable for continuing in the experiment, the participation in the experiment can be&#xD;
      terminated at any time. In general, the experiment will be terminated if it turns out that&#xD;
      the subjects in general cannot tolerate the procedures of the project or find the experiment&#xD;
      too exhausting.&#xD;
