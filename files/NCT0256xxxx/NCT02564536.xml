  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the first 28 day cycle, all patients will be treated with single agent pacritinib at 200&#xD;
      mg twice daily. The investigators chose this starting dose based on the previous three phase&#xD;
      I studies of pacritinib as a single agent which showed that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      to be 500 mg, and subsequently, the dose of 400 mg daily was recommended for the phase II&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the results of the phase III PERSIST-1 trial comparing pacritinib to best available&#xD;
      therapy (BAT) in patients with MF was reported at the 2015 American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. Pacritinib was found to be significantly more effective than&#xD;
      BAT at reducing spleen volume at 24 weeks of therapy and improving constitutional symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose decitabine has demonstrated depletion of DNMT1 in normal hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
      (HSC) without cytotoxicity and subcutaneous (SC) instead of intravenous (IV) administration&#xD;
      may avoid high peak levels that can cause apoptosis. Furthermore, the low toxicity associated&#xD;
      with low dose decitabine would allow for more frequent (1 to 3 times weekly) administration&#xD;
      of the drug which would catch more cells in S-phase via greater exposure time. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, a starting dose of decitabine 5 mg/m2 SC twice weekly should be well tolerated and&#xD;
      effective in patients with MF and MPN/MDS syndromes when combined with pacritinib 400 mg&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
