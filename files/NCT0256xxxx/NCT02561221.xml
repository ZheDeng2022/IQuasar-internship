      The primary aim of this trial is to develop and test the effectiveness of a 24 month,&#xD;
      patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable obesity treatment program delivered within primary&#xD;
      care, inclusive of an underserved population. Half of the clinics received a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention delivered in a primary care setting and half of the clinics received usual care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cluster-randomized, two-arm controlled trial in primary care settings. A&#xD;
      total of 18 primary care clinics inclusive of low income populations with a high percentage&#xD;
      of African Americans from urban and rural areas across Louisiana were randomized to either 1)&#xD;
      intervention or 2) usual care. The sample includes 803 patients with obesity (BMI 30-50&#xD;
      kg/m2) (18 clinics, median of 40.5 patients / clinic). The primary aim of this trial is to&#xD;
      develop and test the effectiveness of a 24 month, patient-centered, pragmatic and scalable&#xD;
      obesity treatment program delivered within primary care, inclusive of an underserved&#xD;
      population. Patients in the intervention arm attended weekly (16 in-person) sessions in the&#xD;
      first six months, followed by monthly sessions for the remaining 18 months. The behavioral&#xD;
      intervention was delivered by a trained health coach embedded in the primary care clinic.&#xD;
      Primary Care Practitioners in the intervention arm received a series of webinars on obesity&#xD;
      science to help them manage and treat obese patients. Patients assigned to the usual care arm&#xD;
      will continue to interact with their Primary Care Practitioner according to their usual&#xD;
      schedule, and will receive a series of newsletters on topics of interest, including&#xD;
      importance of sleep for health, brain and memory health, goal setting, smoking cessation,&#xD;
      etc. Primary Care Practitioners in the usual care arm received a webinar describing the&#xD;
      current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approach to reimbursing for obesity&#xD;
      treatment, and a reminder informational brochure will be sent to the Primary Care&#xD;
      Practitioners each year. Patients in both arms were assessed on primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures at baseline, and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The PROMIS-29 physical function sub-scale includes 4 questions and scores range from 4 to 20 (higher values represent a better outcome). Transformed scores were used in analysis. Norm-based scores were calculated so that a score of 50 represents the mean or average of the reference population. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A positive change score indicates improvement while a negative change score indicates worsening from baseline.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Eighteen primary care clinics were randomized equally to either the Intensive Lifestyle Intervention or Usual Care. Patients received the intervention to which their clinic was assigned. Study enrollment occurred from April 2016 to September 2017. Patients completed a pre-screener and attended a screening visit which included the consent process and measurement to determine height and weight for BMI among other eligibility criteria. Patients were enrolled upon baseline visit completion.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Patients in the Lifestyle Counseling Arm attended weekly (16 in-person) sessions in the first six months, followed by monthly sessions for the remaining 18 months. The behavioral intervention was delivered by a trained health coach embedded in the primary care clinic. Primary Care Practitioners in the experimental arm received a series of webinars on obesity science to help them manage and treat patients with obesity.&#xD;
Trained health coaches delivered the active intervention - a comprehensive, &quot;high-intensity&quot; program, as recommended first-line therapy by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/The Obesity Society Guidelines.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS-29 physical function sub-scale includes 4 questions and scores range from 4 to 20 (higher values represent a better outcome). Transformed scores were used in analysis. Norm-based scores were calculated so that a score of 50 represents the mean or average of the reference population. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A positive change score indicates improvement while a negative change score indicates worsening from baseline.</description>

        <description>The PROMIS-29 sleep disturbance sub-scale includes 4 questions and scores ranges from 4 to 20 (higher values represent a worse outcome). Transformed scores were used in analysis. Norm-based scores were calculated so that a score of 50 represents the mean or average of the reference population. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. A negative change score indicates improvement while a positive change score indicates worsening from baseline.</description>
