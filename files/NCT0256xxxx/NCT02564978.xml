    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main reason older people lose their vision. It&#xD;
      affects the macula, the center of the retina needed for sharp, clear vision. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if an antibiotic can help people with an advanced form of AMD, Geographic Atrophy&#xD;
      (GA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if minocycline is safe for people with GA and if it helps preserve their vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 55 and older who have GA in at least one eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with physical exam, medical history, blood tests, and eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take minocycline. They will take 1 pill twice a day for at least 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a minimum of 11 study visits. (But they are not every 3 months.). At&#xD;
      each visit, participants will have a medical history. They may have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam. Vision, eye pressure, and eye movements will be checked. The pupils may be dilated.&#xD;
      The inside of the eyes may be photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their thyroid gland felt while they swallow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microperimetry. They will sit in front of a computer and press a button when they see a light&#xD;
      on the screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiography. An intravenous line (IV) will be placed in an arm vein. A dye called&#xD;
      fluorescein will be placed in the IV and travel through the veins to the blood vessels in the&#xD;
      eyes. A camera will take pictures of the dye as it flows through the eye blood vessels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Objective: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people&#xD;
      over age 65 in the United States, is a heterogeneous clinical entity in which retinal&#xD;
      degeneration occurs predominantly in the macula in the context of aging and leads to&#xD;
      impairment of central visual acuity (VA). AMD occurs in two general forms, one of which&#xD;
      involves choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with subsequent formation of a disciform scar.&#xD;
      This is often referred to as the neovascular or wet form. A second form, the subject of this&#xD;
      study, is termed dry /atrophic macular degeneration or otherwise geographic atrophy (GA) and&#xD;
      involves a slow progressive atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and&#xD;
      photoreceptors in the macula, also resulting in central vision loss. GA is estimated to&#xD;
      affect up to one million persons in the U.S. and there is no current treatment that can&#xD;
      prevent its onset or retard its progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the etiology of GA is not completely understood, inflammatory processes involving the&#xD;
      activation of resident immune cells of the retina called microglia is likely to contribute.&#xD;
      Minocycline inhibits the activation of microglia which produce inflammatory factors&#xD;
      implicated in GA development. The objective of this study is to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      possible efficacy of oral minocycline in patients with GA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Forty-five participants with unilateral or bilateral GA associated with AMD&#xD;
      will be enrolled. However, up to an additional 15 participants may be enrolled to replace&#xD;
      participants who may withdraw from the study prior to reaching the Month 33 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, Phase II study to evaluate&#xD;
      minocycline as a potential treatment to decrease the rate of worsening of GA associated with&#xD;
      AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a nine-month run-in phase prior to receiving investigational&#xD;
      product (IP). During this run-in phase, participants will have a total of four pre-treatment&#xD;
      visits. Following the run-in phase, beginning at Month 9, participants will receive an oral&#xD;
      dose of 100 mg of minocycline twice daily for 36 months. There will be a common termination&#xD;
      date, which will take place when the last recruited participant has received 36 months of&#xD;
      treatment. Participants who were recruited in the earlier part of the study will continue&#xD;
      treatment and be followed every six months until the common termination date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of change in area of GA based on grading by&#xD;
      an external Reading Center of fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images in the assigned study eye.&#xD;
      The primary outcome will compare the rates of GA area expansion as determined on FAF images&#xD;
      before and following the initiation of IP until 24 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will compare differences in rates of change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),&#xD;
      low-luminance VA, area of GA based on FAF (using a different statistical approach compared to&#xD;
      primary outcome) and fundus photography, and macular sensitivity as measured using&#xD;
      microperimetry between the run-in and treatment phases. Safety outcomes will include the&#xD;
      number and severity of adverse events (AEs). Ocular safety outcomes will be indicated by&#xD;
      changes in VA, ocular surface changes, intraocular inflammation and any other ocular changes&#xD;
      not consistent with the natural progression of GA.&#xD;

    <description>Adult participants will be instructed to take their prescribed IP orally two times a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart. The capsules will be dispensed to the participant in a tight, light-resistant container as defined in the USP in three month supply aliquots. Starting at Month 9 and continuing at Month 12, a three-month supply will be dispensed to the participant during the study visit or mailed to the participant. Participants will be given an instruction sheet for taking the prescribed IP. Starting at Month 15 participants will receive two bottles for a six-month supply. The IP should be stored between 15-30(degree)C (or 59-86(degree)F). They should be protected from light, moisture, and excessive heat. Participants will be required to bring their bottles of IP to each appropriate visit for capsule counts for compliance monitoring.</description>

        exclusion criteria listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye must have at least (Omega) disc area (approximately 1 mm(2)) of GA&#xD;
             compatible with dry AMD. GA is defined as one or more well-defined and often circular&#xD;
             patches of partial or complete depigmentation of the RPE, typically with exposure of&#xD;
             underlying choroidal blood vessels. Even if much of the RPE appears to be preserved&#xD;
             and large choroidal vessels are not visible, a round patch of RPE partial&#xD;
             depigmentation may be classified as early GA. The GA in the study eye must be able to&#xD;
             be photographed in their entirety, and it must not be contiguous with any areas of&#xD;
             peripapillary atrophy, which can complicate area measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The total area of GA lesions combined should be less than 7.0 MPS disc areas (DA)&#xD;
             (17.78 mm(2)) as evident on FAF imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The VA of the study eye should be greater than or equal to19 E-ETDRS letters (i.e.,&#xD;
             20/400 or better).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The study eye must have clarity of ocular media and degree of pupil dilation&#xD;
             sufficient to permit adequate fundus photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as determined by the treating&#xD;
             physician or a history of treatments for CNV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of retinal atrophy due to causes other than atrophic AMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current evidence or history of ocular disorders in the study eye that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator confounds study outcome measures, including (but not limited to):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy involving 10 or more hemorrhages or&#xD;
                  microaneurysms, or active proliferative diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
