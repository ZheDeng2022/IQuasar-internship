  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been convincingly demonstrated that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) works better and&#xD;
      sooner than antidepressants in the treatment of certain subtypes of depression. Given this&#xD;
      effectiveness, it would be unfortunate not to give ECT to patients with good response chances&#xD;
      as this could substantially shorten the length of a severe depressive episode. Instead of&#xD;
      going through all possible psychopharmacological treatment steps, ECT could be proposed much&#xD;
      earlier as a treatment option for those patients who might have good response chances. This&#xD;
      would be a great advantage for the severely depressed patient, with a decreased&#xD;
      disease-burden and hospitalization duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, up to now, objective and reliable predictive factors for good ECT response have not&#xD;
      yet been established. Clinical characteristics such as psychomotor retardation, psychotic&#xD;
      features and age have often been used to predict the outcome of ECT, but there is too little&#xD;
      evidence to consider these as strong predictive factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project is designed to allow better prediction of ECT-response. The investgators&#xD;
      base their selection of predictors on clinical impression and previous research results. The&#xD;
      predictive capacity of psychomotor functioning, psychotic symptoms and several biomarkers&#xD;
      will be investigated. With these clinical and biological patient and depression&#xD;
      characteristics, the investigators aim to develop a decision making tool that will allow a&#xD;
      more accurate indication of ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also investigate ways to predict whether or not a patient will have a good&#xD;
      response when treatment has already started, based on an early improvement of psychomotor&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another subject of great importance is predicting and preventing side-effects. When patients&#xD;
      at risk for lasting cognitive side-effects can be identified early in the treatment course,&#xD;
      treatment can be adjusted to prevent persistence of memory problems. Therefore, the second&#xD;
      part of the study focuses on identifying people at risk for cognitive side effects early in&#xD;
      the treatment course.&#xD;

        The investigators include a severely depressed patient population that has to be evaluated&#xD;
        regularly. For that reason, the investigators choose residential patients. They are&#xD;
        recruited at the psychiatric hospital in Duffel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Treating psychiatrists consider a candidate eligible for ECT and start pre-ECT&#xD;
        investigations. The investigators screen all depressive ECT patients for inclusion in the&#xD;
        study and ask for their informed consent (IC). The treating psychiatrist decides when ECT&#xD;
        is stopped considering clinical evolution and side effects.&#xD;
