  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab with&#xD;
      brain radiation therapy can help treat this type of breast cancer that has spread to the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;

      A Simon 2-stage single-arm design (n=17) will be employed to evaluate for preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy. A maximum of 17 subjects will be accrued to the efficacy arm. After the first 3&#xD;
      patients are enrolled in the efficacy arm, a 6 week enrollment hold will be conducted in&#xD;
      order to ensure safety before additional patients are enrolled. An interim assessment will&#xD;
      then occur after the first 9 subjects have enrolled, and the accrual to this arm will proceed&#xD;
      only if a pre-specified futility threshold is met. Patients not requiring continuation of&#xD;
      HER2 directed therapy, such as trastuzumab, will be enrolled in this arm.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will get either whole brain radiation treatment (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), as per standard of care, with tremelimumab administered every 28 days. Patients, for whom concurrent HER2 directed therapy trastuzumab is indicated, as determined by the treating investigator, will be enrolled in a parallel HER2 directed therapy trastuzumab safety cohort. Protocol Expansion: Dose 1 of tremelimumab &amp; durvalumab (75 mg &amp; 1500 mg, respectively) will ideally be administered 2 days prior to initiation of brain radiotherapy (or between 5 days prior &amp; 3 days after initiation of radiotherapy). Subjects will get either WBRT or SRS, depending on the number &amp; size of their brain metastases. Following the 1st dose, tremelimumab &amp; duvralumab will be administered q28 days from the date of 1st tremelimumab &amp; durvalumab administration, plus or minus 1 week, for 4 cycles. After the 4th cycle, durvalumab will be administered alone until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
