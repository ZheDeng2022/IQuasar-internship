  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not uncommon that patients requiring dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) also need to be&#xD;
      treated with oral anticoagulant therapy, such as those with atrial fibrillation (AF).&#xD;
      Warfarin and clopidogrel are still the most widely utilized oral anticoagulant and P2Y12&#xD;
      receptor inhibitor, respectively. However, over the past years, several non-vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonist oral anticoagulants, including edoxaban, have been studied in the setting of AF&#xD;
      showing encouraging safety and efficacy profiles as compared with warfarin. However, the&#xD;
      effects of edoxaban in combination with DAPT in the setting of patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease (CAD) are unexplored. Moreover, the role of edoxaban as part of a dual antithrombotic&#xD;
      treatment strategy, including clopidogrel and stopping aspirin, represents another important&#xD;
      area of clinical interest. This investigation is a prospective, randomized, parallel-design,&#xD;
      open label, pharmacodynamic study conducted in patients with CAD on DAPT with aspirin and&#xD;
      clopidogrel testing two different edoxaban dosing regimens in addition to DAPT with aspirin&#xD;
      and clopidogrel, as well as in combination with clopidogrel only (after stopping aspirin).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist is pivotal for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) and in patents following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Importantly, it&#xD;
      is not uncommon that patients requiring DAPT also need to be treated with oral anticoagulant&#xD;
      therapy, such as those with atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin and clopidogrel are still the&#xD;
      most widely utilized oral anticoagulant and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, respectively. However,&#xD;
      this treatment regimen has shown to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding, as well&#xD;
      as ischemic complications. Over the past years, several non-vitamin K antagonist oral&#xD;
      anticoagulants (NOACs), including edoxaban, have been studied in the setting of AF showing&#xD;
      encouraging safety and efficacy profiles as compared with warfarin. In the phase III ENGAGE&#xD;
      AF-TIMI 48 trial, edoxaban (60mg or 30mg once/daily) was non-inferior to warfarin with&#xD;
      respect to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism and was associated with&#xD;
      significantly lower rates of bleeding and death from cardiovascular causes, in patients with&#xD;
      AF. However, the effects of edoxaban in combination with DAPT in the setting of patients with&#xD;
      CAD are unexplored. This may indeed represent a limitation for the uptake of edoxaban in&#xD;
      modern day clinical practice where ~10% of patients with AF also have CAD requiring PCI and&#xD;
      thus may require triple antithrombotic therapy. Moreover, the role of edoxaban as part of a&#xD;
      dual antithrombotic treatment strategy, including clopidogrel and stopping aspirin,&#xD;
      represents another important area of clinical interest as it has the potential reduce the&#xD;
      risk of bleeding while preserving protection from ischemic events. This investigation is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, parallel-design, open label, pharmacodynamic study conducted in&#xD;
      patients with CAD on DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel testing two different edoxaban dosing&#xD;
      regimens (60mg or 30mg once/daily) in addition to DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well&#xD;
      as in combination with clopidogrel only (after stopping aspirin).&#xD;
