    <textblock>
      The incidence of HIV/AIDS among African American men who have sex with men (MSM) is alarming,&#xD;
      and the public health response to this urgent situation has been hampered by a lack of sexual&#xD;
      risk reduction interventions with solid evidence of efficacy in this population. Accordingly,&#xD;
      the broad, long-term objective of the proposed research is to identify interventions to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) among African American MSM. This&#xD;
      application seeks funds to develop and test the efficacy of a theory-based, contextually&#xD;
      appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce sexual risk behavior among African American&#xD;
      MSM. Intervention development will be guided by social cognitive theory, the theory of&#xD;
      planned behavior, qualitative information from focus groups, and findings from a longitudinal&#xD;
      survey of men from the study population. A one-on-one intervention will be utilized to&#xD;
      address the specific prevention needs of each man and to allay participants' concerns about&#xD;
      revealing their sexual involvement with men by virtue of participating in a group or workshop&#xD;
      intervention. The study will utilize a randomized controlled trial design, with baseline,&#xD;
      immediate post intervention, and 6 and 12 months post intervention assessments. The&#xD;
      participants will be African American MSM who will be randomized to a one-on-one sexual risk&#xD;
      reduction intervention or a one-on-one health promotion intervention that will serve as the&#xD;
      control condition. The primary outcome is consistent condom use during anal and vaginal&#xD;
      intercourse. The study will test whether the intervention increases the consistent use of&#xD;
      condoms during anal intercourse, the primary outcome, whether it decreases other sexual risk&#xD;
      behaviors, and whether social cognitive theory variables mediate the effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on consistent condom use. This study will provide an urgently needed&#xD;
      intervention to reduce the risk of HIV and other STIs in one of the highest risk populations&#xD;
      in the United States.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV/AIDS has had a devastating impact on African American MSM. Although African Americans&#xD;
      represent only 13% of the US population, 49% of AIDS diagnoses in 2004 were in African&#xD;
      Americans. That HIV/AIDS has taken an increasing toll on African American injection drug&#xD;
      users and heterosexuals during the last decade is well documented. Nevertheless, MSM continue&#xD;
      to account for the largest number of African Americans with HIV/AIDS. Through 2004, the MSM&#xD;
      exposure category accounted for 37% of the cumulative AIDS cases in African American men,&#xD;
      whereas injection drug use accounted for 31% and heterosexual transmission accounted for 10%.&#xD;
      Consonant with these figures on HIV/AIDS cases, the HIV infection rates in several studies&#xD;
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted on African American MSM have&#xD;
      rivaled those found in many sub-Saharan African nations. For instance, a CDC 5-city study&#xD;
      found that of the African American MSM who were tested for HIV, two-thirds were unaware of&#xD;
      their status and 46% were HIV positive. Similarly, the 7-city CDC Young Men's Survey found an&#xD;
      HIV prevalence rate of 32% in African American MSM. Interestingly, although African American&#xD;
      MSM have relatively high HIV infection rates, evidence does not suggest that they engage in&#xD;
      riskier sexual practices than do other MSM. This may mean that African American MSM are&#xD;
      drawing their sexual partners from pools of people where HIV prevalence is relatively high,&#xD;
      which underscores the urgency of targeting interventions to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quite apart from risk of HIV, African American MSM are at high risk for other STIs. The CDC&#xD;
      MSM Prevalence Monitoring Project conducted in 9 US cities, in 1999 through 2004 found that&#xD;
      the rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia were high in MSM, but especially high in African&#xD;
      American MSM. In 2004, urethral gonorrhea positivity was 16% in African Americans, as&#xD;
      compared with 11% in Whites, and 9% in Hispanics. The median urethral chlamydia positivity&#xD;
      was 6% overall, but 9% in African Americans. To curb the HIV epidemic and the high rates of&#xD;
      other STIs in African American MSM now, prevention efforts must be urgently undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several researchers have stressed the need for culturally appropriate prevention&#xD;
      interventions targeting African American MSM, scant progress has been made toward the&#xD;
      identification of such interventions. Ample evidence indicates that theory-based&#xD;
      interventions can decrease sexual risk behavior among MSM. A meta-analysis 40 controlled&#xD;
      studies of HIV prevention behavioral interventions for MSM found that the interventions&#xD;
      reduced the amount of reported unprotected sex by as much as 27%, but revealed that the MSM&#xD;
      populations at the highest risk, including African American MSM, have been underserved by&#xD;
      intervention research. Consider, for example, Project EXPLORE, a large-scale multi-site&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) that enrolled over 4,200 MSM and followed them for up to 4 years.&#xD;
      Fewer than 7% of participants were African American, eligible African Americans were less&#xD;
      likely to enroll in the trial than were eligible Whites, and African Americans were more&#xD;
      likely to drop out. Another meta-analysis found that, of 33 HIV sexual risk reduction&#xD;
      intervention trials on MSM, only 6 employed a sample that was at least a 10% African&#xD;
      American. The insufficient number of rigorous intervention trials directed at African&#xD;
      American MSM has hindered the ability to make definitive conclusions about how to combat&#xD;
      men's attitudes and beliefs concerning sexual risk behavior and ultimately determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of HIV prevention strategies targeting African American MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reaching African American MSM may be particularly challenging because many African American&#xD;
      MSM do not use traditional resources and organizations that serve gay men because they do not&#xD;
      identify with White gay culture. In addition, African American MSM may also be difficult to&#xD;
      reach within African American communities because they are often closeted and isolated due to&#xD;
      real and perceived homophobia. That isolation, in turn, contributes to internalized&#xD;
      repression of gay sexual identity, which may further isolate them from resources available to&#xD;
      gay men. The investigators' approach to addressing the problem of reaching African American&#xD;
      MSM is to develop an intervention that can be used by community-based organizations (CBOs)&#xD;
      that already serve African American MSM. The investigators will create a Community Advisory&#xD;
      Board that includes representatives of CBOs that serve African American MSM and&#xD;
      representatives of the study population to advise them on the intervention design and other&#xD;
      aspects of the trial. In addition, the investigators have held a focus group with&#xD;
      representatives of CBOs that serve African Americans and have frequently consulted with them&#xD;
      regarding their approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of the literature have suggested that there have been 3 basic approaches to the&#xD;
      design of HIV/STI risk reduction programs aimed at MSM. One approach is to seek to reduce&#xD;
      risk through the implementation of small group or workshop interventions. The second approach&#xD;
      is through the use of community-level interventions. A third approach is the individual&#xD;
      one-on-one intervention. All three approaches have merit and have reduced risk behavior among&#xD;
      men in controlled trials. An advantage of the one-on-one is that it avoids the problem of men&#xD;
      having to risk revealing that they have sex with other men in order to participate in the&#xD;
      prevention program. There are added benefits of the one-on-one approach. It permits tailoring&#xD;
      the intervention to the specific needs of the man. A recent meta-analysis has identified&#xD;
      characteristics of effective HIV behavioral interventions for MSM. Efficacy was associated&#xD;
      with interventions having more than one session, duration of 4 or more hours, and a time span&#xD;
      of at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proposed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the efficacy of the Being Responsible for Ourselves (BRO) HIV Risk&#xD;
      Reduction Intervention in increasing condom use and reducing other sexual risk behaviors&#xD;
      among African American MSM in Philadelphia, where African Americans account for 70% of the&#xD;
      reported cases of AIDS through June 2005. The study will use a RCT design, which is the most&#xD;
      scientifically sound method for assessing the causal impact of interventions. An&#xD;
      attention-matched control group, the Health Promotion Intervention, will provide controls for&#xD;
      Hawthorne effects and special attention. Computer-generated random number sequences will be&#xD;
      used to randomly assign participants to the intervention arms using concealment of allocation&#xD;
      techniques designed to minimize bias in assignment. The biostatistician will generate the&#xD;
      random assignments; the project director will implement the assignments. The study will also&#xD;
      examine theoretical variables the intervention is designed to affect, which will permit&#xD;
      mediation analyses addressing why the intervention is efficacious or not efficacious. This&#xD;
      study, then, will provide an urgently needed intervention to help curb the alarmingly high&#xD;
      incidence of HIV in urban, African American communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRO HIV Risk Reduction Intervention and the Health Promotion Intervention were developed&#xD;
      based on social cognitive theory and the reasoned action approach, integrated with extensive&#xD;
      formative research, including focus groups and pilot testing. Most relevant here are the&#xD;
      social-cognitive-theory constructs of &quot;outcome expectancy,&quot; beliefs about the consequences of&#xD;
      a specific behavior, and &quot;self-efficacy,&quot; people's confidence that they can execute a&#xD;
      specific behavior; its emphasis on behavioral skills; and its methods for increasing skills,&#xD;
      particularly practice with performance feedback (e.g., role-playing). The reasoned action&#xD;
      approach is an extension of the theory of planned behavior, which itself is an extension of&#xD;
      the theory of reasoned action. Most relevant here are the reasoned action approach's emphasis&#xD;
      on the importance of salient beliefs, its notion that such beliefs may vary from population&#xD;
      to population and from behavior to behavior, and its methods to identify such&#xD;
      population-specific beliefs: namely, the use of qualitative research, including focus groups.&#xD;
      By identifying and targeting a population's salient beliefs, an intervention can change those&#xD;
      beliefs resulting in changes in the targeted behavior. The investigators utilized one-on-one&#xD;
      interventions to allay concerns some African American MSM might have about revealing their&#xD;
      sexual behavior with other men by virtue of participating in a group-based intervention, a&#xD;
      concern expressed in the focus groups with African American MSM and with representatives of&#xD;
      CBOs serving African American MSM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistent with the reasoned action approach, the investigators conducted qualitative&#xD;
      research, including 7 focus groups with African American MSM and 1 with representatives of&#xD;
      CBOs that serve African American MSM, to ensure the intervention was tailored to the&#xD;
      population. In addition, the investigators conducted 3 pilot tests of the interventions. The&#xD;
      BRO HIV/STI risk-reduction intervention was designed to strengthen outcome expectancies&#xD;
      expressed in focus groups with African American MSM, outcome expectancies that have been&#xD;
      observed in other populations, including the hedonistic outcome expectancy that using condoms&#xD;
      would not interfere with sexual enjoyment, the prevention outcome expectancy that using&#xD;
      condoms prevents STIs, including HIV, and the self-evaluative outcome expectancy that using&#xD;
      condoms would make the man feel good about himself. The intervention was designed to address&#xD;
      aspects of self-efficacy identified in the focus groups, including technical-skill&#xD;
      self-efficacy to use condoms correctly without interfering with sexual enjoyment,&#xD;
      impulse-control self-efficacy to exercise the necessary control to use condoms even when&#xD;
      sexually excited, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or in the presence of other&#xD;
      triggers for unsafe sex, and skills and self-efficacy to negotiate condom use with sexual&#xD;
      partners. In addition, it was designed to increase knowledge regarding the risk of acquiring&#xD;
      or transmitting HIV and other STIs, and perceived vulnerability to HIV infection or&#xD;
      re-infection with a different strain of HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. The&#xD;
      prevalence of HIV infection among African American MSM is alarmingly high, paralleling rates&#xD;
      observed in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. For condoms to prevent the transmission of&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS, they must be used correctly and consistently. Behavioral interventions have been&#xD;
      found to be effective in reducing rates of sexual risk behaviors, but few have been conducted&#xD;
      with African American MSM. This research seeks to answer the call for culturally appropriate&#xD;
      interventions for high-risk subgroups of MSM. The primary hypothesis is that the BRO HIV Risk&#xD;
      Reduction Intervention will increase the consistent use of condoms and decrease other sexual&#xD;
      risk behaviors compared with the control group and that the intervention's effects on condom&#xD;
      use with be mediated by variables from the social cognitive theory and the reasoned action&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
