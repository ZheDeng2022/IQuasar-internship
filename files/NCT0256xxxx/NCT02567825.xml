  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) compared with nonsurgical management&#xD;
      will meaningfully improve children's acute otitis media (AOM) experience over the succeeding&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tympanostomy tube placement (TTP) for recurrent acute otitis media (rAOM) is frequently&#xD;
      performed in children under 3 years of age; however, a critical need exists to establish its&#xD;
      risk/benefit ratio. Seventy percent of children experience at least one episode of AOM during&#xD;
      the first year of life; 20% of children have rAOM. The efficacy of TTP for preventing rAOM,&#xD;
      assumedly by maintaining middle-ear ventilation, remains unclear. Benefits of TTP must be&#xD;
      balanced against risks of anesthesia, complications and sequelae of surgery, and cost.&#xD;
      Accordingly, the objective of this proposal is to determine the efficacy of TTP in children&#xD;
      aged 6-35 months, the group in which rAOM is most troublesome. The central hypothesis is that&#xD;
      in children with rAOM, the operation will prove effective over the ensuing 2 years overall,&#xD;
      but the benefit in a more severely affected, and therefore higher-risk subgroup may be&#xD;
      substantially greater than in a less severely affected subgroup, in whom benefits may not&#xD;
      outweigh risks. The rationale for this research is based on a belief that the limited nature&#xD;
      of the benefit of TTP found in earlier clinical trials may have been the result of enrolling&#xD;
      children whose illnesses had not been diagnosed using stringent criteria and/or whose&#xD;
      ascertainment of episodes had relied on undocumented histories. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      determine the extent to which TTP reduces the overall rate of recurrences in children with&#xD;
      rAOM over a 2-year period. In a randomized, clinical trial, children aged 6-35 months who are&#xD;
      at risk for rAOM will be followed prospectively and examined promptly with new respiratory&#xD;
      illnesses to accurately document episodes of AOM. A total of 240 children who meet stringent&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for rAOM will be eligible to undergo randomization within strata (age and&#xD;
      exposure to other children) to receive TTP or nonsurgical management. Children will be&#xD;
      followed for 2 years; the average number of episodes of AOM will be documented and compared&#xD;
      between groups. The secondary objective is to determine changes following TTP in&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization with resistant bacteria. At the time of randomization and 3&#xD;
      times a year for 2 years, NP specimens will be obtained and cultured. Susceptibility testing&#xD;
      and serotyping will be performed, and the proportions of children colonized with resistant&#xD;
      bacteria compared between treatment groups. The tertiary objective is to determine&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of TTP. The investigators will calculate both direct medical and&#xD;
      nonmedical costs and correlate this with the number of days that each child has AOM symptoms,&#xD;
      otorrhea, and any adverse events or complications. The proposed research is innovative, as&#xD;
      the investigators will document AOM episodes prospectively using stringent diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria and obtain digital tympanic membrane images otoendoscopically to enhance accuracy of&#xD;
      observations. Findings of the proposed study will provide clinicians and parents with&#xD;
      dependable evidence concerning the overall effects of TTP compared with nonsurgical&#xD;
      management in children with rAOM of varying degrees of severity, enabling evidence-based&#xD;
      decisions regarding an important component of the children's healthcare.&#xD;
