  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study of the safety and tolerability of PBI-4050&#xD;
      800 mg daily oral administration in type 2 diabetes patients with metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 12 patients will initially be enrolled for study participation. A Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will continuously review data obtained from the 12 patients. When the&#xD;
      12 patients have completed at least one month of study treatment, the DSMB will meet and&#xD;
      determine whether additional patients may be enrolled or the study should be stopped. If the&#xD;
      safety is deemed acceptable to continue with the study, the study will enroll a maximum of 36&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      This Phase 2 study will be performed by 1 site in Canada. The total duration of study&#xD;
      participation for each patient is at least 18 weeks and comprises 6 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who choose to participate in the extension study will be in the study for a total of&#xD;
      up to 32 weeks.&#xD;
