    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and blinatumomab&#xD;
      when given together in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a&#xD;
      period of improvement (relapsed). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances&#xD;
      made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways&#xD;
      and stop cancer cells from growing. Blinatumomab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide when given in combination&#xD;
      with blinatumomab in the proposed regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity anti-tumor response (complete response [CR] and&#xD;
      partial response [PR] as per International workshop lymphoma response criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the immune response to blinatumomab alone and in combination with&#xD;
      lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To document the infection rate with a 96-hour bag change schedule for blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-56 and&#xD;
      lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 29-49 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response including stable disease receive blinatumomab IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-7 and lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days&#xD;
      for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receiving response including stable disease after completion of&#xD;
      Consolidation receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2&#xD;
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to lenalidomide and blinatumomab or other agents used in study&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with lenalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known active hepatitis, type B or C; patients on suppressive therapy with a negative&#xD;
