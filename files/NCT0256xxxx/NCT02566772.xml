  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of TAS3681, to find&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose of TAS3681 (Escalation Phase) and to&#xD;
      further evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of TAS3681 at the MTD/recommended dose&#xD;
      (Expansion Phase).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, multinational, Phase 1, open-label study of TAS3681 evaluating&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) for which there is&#xD;
      no standard therapy. Eligible participants will be enrolled to evaluate safety and determine&#xD;
      the MTD/recommended dose for TAS3681, including a preliminary evaluation of food effect and&#xD;
      antitumor activity. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, Dose Escalation (Enrollment&#xD;
      closed) and Expansion (Enrollment open), and will enroll up to approximately 200 patients.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive TAS3681 in 28-day cycles. The Escalation phase includes participants who have progressed after abiraterone, enzalutamide and chemotherapy. Eleven dose escalation cohorts are planned, one of which includes a preliminary assessment of food effect. The MTD/recommended dose for further development will be used for participants in the Expansion Phase. The Expansion Phase will enroll participants who have progressed after abiraterone or enzalutamide with chemotherapy consisting of no more than 2 prior taxane-based therapies (Group A) or without any chemotherapy (Group B). Participants receive TAS3681 until discontinuation criteria are met.</description>
