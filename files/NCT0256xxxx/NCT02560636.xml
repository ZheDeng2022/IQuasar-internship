    <textblock>
      PLUMMB is an phase I trial to investigate the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of an&#xD;
      immunotherapy drug called Pembrolizumab used in combination with radiotherapy. The study will&#xD;
      also investigate two different doses of pembrolizumab, starting at 100mg (through an&#xD;
      intravenous drip) and increasing to 200mg for the next cohort of patients, if the first dose&#xD;
      is well tolerated. The patients suitable for this study will be: Group A those with locally&#xD;
      advanced bladder cancer or Group B patients whose cancer has spread from the bladder&#xD;
      (metastatic bladder cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment in the PLUMMB trial will start with a pembrolizumab 2 weeks prior to starting a&#xD;
      course of 4 - 6 weeks radiotherapy. Treatment with pembrolizumab will then be given every&#xD;
      three weeks. Patients in Group A will then continue to take pembrolizumab for up to a year&#xD;
      unless they have disease progression or unacceptable side effects in the meantime. Patients&#xD;
      in Group B will continue taking pembrolizumab for as long as needed until they have disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be seen every 3 weeks during treatment and every 3-6 months thereafter. CT&#xD;
      scans will be done every 3 months during treatment and as per usual care (usually 6 monthly)&#xD;
      after the treatment has finished. Patients in Group A will also have a cystoscopy (camera&#xD;
      test) to look into the bladder 3 months after they finish radiotherapy. This is standard care&#xD;
      and would be the same for patients not on a research study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      1. Risk and burden for patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients in this study have cancer that often proves hard to control with standard care.&#xD;
           The early phase nature of this study means that the intervention may not have any&#xD;
           benefit for patients who take part in the study. However, they will still receive the&#xD;
           standard treatment of radiotherapy. Throughout the study, any patients who have&#xD;
           significant side effects from the trial drug will be withdrawn from the trial and will&#xD;
           still be eligible to receive standard care. The study itself carries a number of&#xD;
           potential burdens:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Experimental nature of the study drug. The drug stimulates the immune system to&#xD;
                produce more proteins that will attack the tumour cells. It is thought that this&#xD;
                will be selective for tumour cells; however it is possible that effects on normal&#xD;
                tissues may cause side effects. These risks will be managed as much as possible by&#xD;
                regular (3 weekly) clinical assessments as a hospital outpatient, by experienced&#xD;
                clinicians while having the study treatment. Comprehensive assessments for safety&#xD;
                will be carried out including more intensive monitoring with blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Burden of frequent hospital visits and tests. Participants in this study must&#xD;
                attend hospital frequently for safety reasons to check for any toxicity of the&#xD;
                study treatment. Blood tests (more than usual), clinical examination and urine&#xD;
                tests are part of the safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional investigations may be carried out as part of the study, for research&#xD;
                purposes for which consent will be sought form the patient, such as additional&#xD;
                blood samples and additional scans (CT thorax, abdomen and pelvis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 1 trial of Pembrolizumab: Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity&#xD;
           throughout the trial. A phase I trial has already been conducted to determine the&#xD;
           maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pembrolizumab in bladder cancer. To date no MTD has been&#xD;
           defined and the maximum dose tested showed acceptable toxicity and positive effects on&#xD;
           reducing tumour size. This study will assess two dose levels of pembrolizumab: 100mg and&#xD;
           200mg and differing radiotherapy doses (24-30Gy in 4-6f). Dose escalation will only&#xD;
           occur if the current cohort have shown no signs of unacceptable toxicity at 6 weeks&#xD;
           after completing radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be offered information about this study by their clinical teams if&#xD;
           they are considered to meet the entry criteria and express interest in taking part in an&#xD;
           experimental study. It will be made clear that the study is experimental in nature and&#xD;
           that there will not necessarily be a therapeutic benefit from taking part in the study.&#xD;
           It will also be made clear that, should patients decide not to take part their future&#xD;
           care will not be affected. Patients will be given sufficient time and information to&#xD;
           make an informed decision about entering the trial, and not less than 24 hours; all&#xD;
           patients entering the trial will give written informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
           criteria for this study are standard for a phase 1 trial of a new oncology drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be linked to a unique identifier the code for which will be held on a&#xD;
           password protected database held only by the study team. Blood samples, tumour sample&#xD;
           processing and other data analysis will take place at the laboratories of Royal Marsden&#xD;
           and Institute of Cancer Research in London or Sutton. Sample processing will take place&#xD;
           using the study number only. No other patient identifiable information will be available&#xD;
           on study samples. Investigators will have access to patient identifiable information on&#xD;
           password protected NHS hospital notes and databases only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Conflict of Interest&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients may be recruited to the study by those involved in their prior clinical care.&#xD;
           The investigators do not expect conflict of interest between research and healthcare&#xD;
           duties for a number of reasons: patients must give their full informed consent before&#xD;
           entering the study, specifically regarding the unknown efficacy of the study drug and&#xD;
           the intensive nature of the study. Those patients who do not continue in the study will&#xD;
           maintain a relationship with the clinical team if required for symptom control. At the&#xD;
           end of the study, patients will be able to access the results if they wish, through the&#xD;
           Royal Marsden Website or contact the study team directly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Use of tissue samples in future research&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants give their consent, any leftover blood or tissue samples which are not&#xD;
      required for this study will be stored for future unspecified research in line with the human&#xD;
      tissue act regulations. Access and use of samples for research purposes will require&#xD;
      appropriate ethical approval. Future researchers will not be able to identify individual&#xD;
      patients from their biobank data, demographic and clinical information will be available.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
