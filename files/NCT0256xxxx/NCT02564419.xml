  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators will show proof-of-concept that brain signals can be used in&#xD;
      real-time, closed-loop mode to trigger stimulation for hand function. Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      surgery to implant a unilateral subdural strip electrode (Resume II, Model 3587A) over the&#xD;
      motor cortex. These electrodes implanted in the brain will enable bioelectrical data&#xD;
      recording (sensing) from the brain to the implanted Activa PC+S. The cortical sensing data&#xD;
      will be&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. either processed in the Activa PC+S; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. off-loaded via the Nexus D communication device (Medtronic) to a computer.&#xD;

    <description>Objective of this pilot phase early feasibility study is to assess the safety and feasibility of Medtronic Activa PC+S implant (device) by;&#xD;
Evaluating the ability of the Activa PC+S system to sense ECoG signals in subjects living with quadriplegia (C5 or C6 level).&#xD;
Assessing the feasibility of activating fundamental upper extremity muscles to reproduce hand grasp.&#xD;
These are important first steps towards creating and designing a device that can enhance or assist in performing activities of daily living (ADL) in the life of these subjects. Attachment 15.3</description>

    <description>Upon consent, the good candidates will undergo surgical screening that includes a full neurological workup and baseline functional assessment. Subjects that demonstrate feasibility for control will undergo surgery for unilateral implantation of the Activa PC+S as well as the implantation of unilateral subdural strip electrodes (Resume II, model 3587A) over the motor cortex. After 24 hour observation in the hospital, subjects will participate in 24 distinct sessions or visits of testing over a 3-6 month period. During these visits, the sensing, decoding of the implanted device (Activa PC+S) as well as the external stimulation components (Bioness H200) and parameters will be tested and benchmarked. Subjects will participate for 24 sessions and continue to participate in the study until the end of life of the device, at which point the subject may elect to undergo an explant at that time.</description>
