    <textblock>
      About 70% of hemiplegic patients suffer from hemiplegic shoulder pain after stroke. This&#xD;
      common occurrence is a cause for concern in the rehabilitation setting as it leads to&#xD;
      impairment of functional outcomes induced by discomfort and delays in rehabilitation,&#xD;
      important psycho-emotional repercussions as there is a correlation between upper arm pain and&#xD;
      depression, a longer hospital stay. Poor management of hemiplegic shoulder pain can&#xD;
      ultimately give rise to type 1 &quot;complex regional pain syndrome&quot; (CRPS I). There is no&#xD;
      consensus on treatment, care pathways or useful devices for positioning acute stroke patients&#xD;
      in the literature. Our objective is to compare the effectiveness of a new positioning&#xD;
      procedure of the hemiplegic arm with conventional positioning (pillow and&#xD;
      &quot;shoulder-immobilisation&quot; sling) in acute stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's actions are focus in 4 points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positioning in bed, wheelchair and standing with specific materials (holds, sling in&#xD;
           external rotation and abduction)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be careful of shoulder's coaptation in care and functional activities (toilet, dressing,&#xD;
           transfers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A training of the patient and members of family on pathology, risk, use of material&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily passive mobilisation of the upper member by a therapist.&#xD;

      Shoulder pain is one of the four most frequently encountered after stroke complications. The&#xD;
      importance of prevention isn't more to justify but it is not consensus on common conduct to&#xD;
      follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propose: a paramedical research protocol to improve the positioning of the hemiplegic&#xD;
      shoulder in stroke unit and prevent shoulder pain acute stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: show the superiority of an approach to prevention of shoulder pain of patients&#xD;
      post-stroke, in stroke unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical trial, a comparative of superiority, monocentric, in two parallel groups is in&#xD;
      included phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are initiating a study on new positioning devices providing optimal positioning&#xD;
      of the hemiplegic shoulder according to the criteria given in the literature: elbow flexed at&#xD;
      40°, hand semi-prone, fingers abducted and in extension, and thumb in abduction. The medical&#xD;
      devices under study are the SYSTAM'® positioning device for the upper-arm (spine position)&#xD;
      and Ultrasling ER 15° DONJOY® (sitting or standing-up position). The study will include 30&#xD;
      acute stroke patients (ischemic or haemorrhagic) with no alertness problems and with a&#xD;
      shoulder motor function score between 0 and 2 on the Held-scale. A visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      will be used, thus excluding patients with aphasia and dementia. The new positioning will be&#xD;
      maintained for a maximum of 1 month or until the Held-scale score reaches 3. The primary&#xD;
      end-point is pain (VAS) on Day 2, Day 7 and at 1 month. The secondary end-point is the&#xD;
      National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) at these times. Other variables are time&#xD;
      (in hours) between patient arrival on the stroke ward and positioning, protocol compliance by&#xD;
      staff and patients, and the percentage of patients with a diastasis on arrival and on&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
