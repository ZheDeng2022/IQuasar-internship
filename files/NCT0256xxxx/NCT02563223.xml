  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators propose to study the jump in different reduced gravity fields&#xD;
      obtained during parabolic flights profiles but also during increased gravity fields obtained&#xD;
      during turns of the airplane or during the pull-up phase of the parabola. By means of a&#xD;
      pneumatic device, an additional pull-down force will be added to the vertical force caused by&#xD;
      the gravity field. By combining different levels of gravity to different levels of the added&#xD;
      pull-down force it will be possible to dissociate the respective contribution of the&#xD;
      otolithic and proprioceptive systems to the anticipatory landing response. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, only one study has modified the gravity field during a jump.&#xD;
      However, these authors did not add a pull-down force and only analyzed the vertical ground&#xD;
      reaction force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better knowledge of the sensory-motor control of the landing phase of a jump will also&#xD;
      increase the investigators' understanding of the physiopathology of joint instability.&#xD;
      Indeed, similarities could be found between the evolution of the motor response due to the&#xD;
      absence gravity during long-duration space flights and the pathological process of chronic&#xD;
      ankle and knee instability. The knowledge generated by this study will thus provide&#xD;
      invaluable information in the context of human performance and rehabilitation.&#xD;

      Investigations description ----------------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the experiments, subjects will jump in different gravity fields while submitted to an&#xD;
      additional pull-down force equal to 0-100% of their body weight on Earth. During the takeoff&#xD;
      and landing phases of the jumps, the ground reaction force will be recorded by a&#xD;
      force-platform, the movements of the limb segments will be recorded by means of a high-speed&#xD;
      camera and the electrical activity (EMG) of the main lower limb muscles will be recorded by&#xD;
      means of surface electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Force platform and Subject Loading System We have developed a device that combines a force&#xD;
      platform on which the subject jumps and a Subject Loading System (SLS) that pulls the subject&#xD;
      downwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The force platform is a 60 cm x 40 cm aluminum plate equipped with four force-transducers&#xD;
      that measure the three components of the force exerted by the subject's feet on the ground.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SLS consists in two pneumatic pistons, which are attached to a harness on one end and to&#xD;
      the aluminum plate on the other. The SLS can be set to generate a force equal to 20-100% of&#xD;
      the subject's body weight on Earth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A security handrail (not shown on the picture) is attached to the aluminum plate, around the&#xD;
      force-platform in case of unbalance of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EMG EMG will be recorded with a MyoSystem 1400L using surface electrodes. The skin will be&#xD;
      shaved (if necessary) and the electrodes will be attached with double sided tape and plaster.&#xD;
      The electrodes will be placed at the level of the lateral gastrocnemius, medial&#xD;
      gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and peroneus longus, and on the thigh at the level of the&#xD;
      vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and lateral hamstrings and medial hamstrings. There will be&#xD;
      2 electrodes per muscle (fixed one against the other) and one reference electrode placed at&#xD;
      the level of the C7 vertebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufacturer: Noraxon. Conformity certificate: CE 344&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video Movements of the subject will be recorded by means of a high-speed digital camera&#xD;
      (Basler). In order to facilitate video analysis, 7 reflective markers (hemisphere with a 12&#xD;
      mm diameter) will delimit body segments: 3 will be glued on one shoe, 3 will be fixed on the&#xD;
      skin (with the same method used for EMG electrodes) at the level of the ankle, knee, hip of&#xD;
      one limb and the last one will be fixed on the neck.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      ----------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before flight subjects will be familiarized with the setup and the protocol. For each flight&#xD;
      day, one subject will be studied. The procedure will be the following on all 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment day starts at 7.30 a.m. with the test subject equipped with EMG electrodes and&#xD;
      video markers. After take-off and after work is permitted, the subject goes to the&#xD;
      experimental area where it is equipped with the SLS harness. Before each parabola, the&#xD;
      subject stands beside the platform to adjust the zero level of the sensor (about 3 second).&#xD;
      Then the subject steps on the platform to record his weight (about 3 second).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hypergravity initial part in of the parabola, the subject is standing with is two&#xD;
      feet on each side of the platform. The traction system is loose (5 kg traction). During the&#xD;
      injection, the traction system starts to progressively pull downwards on the subject. The&#xD;
      traction force is tuned between 20% and 100% of body weight on Earth. The traction force is&#xD;
      constant during each parabola. During the 20 second of weightlessness or partial gravity, the&#xD;
      subject jumps several times. At the end of the parabola, the subject puts his feet at the&#xD;
      side of the platform and the traction system stops to pull downwards before the pull out&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment will also be performed during periods of increased gravity obtained during&#xD;
      turns of the airplane. Three turns per flight should be performed at 3 levels of gravity:&#xD;
      1.2, 1.4 g and 1.6 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each parabola or turn, one experimenter is taking care of the control of the traction&#xD;
      system and of the collection of the data, a second one takes care of the image acquisition,&#xD;
      and a third one takes care of the modification of the configuration of the harness between&#xD;
      the parabolas and of the safety of the subject in case of unbalance during the parabolas or&#xD;
      during the turn.&#xD;
