    <textblock>
      This is a phase I multi-center dose escalation study of the histone deacetylase inhibitor&#xD;
      (HDACi) HBI-8000 when given in combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in women with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dose levels of HBI-8000 (15 mg, 20 mg, and 25 mg) will be tested using a standard 3+3&#xD;
      escalation plan with an expanded cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to enroll a&#xD;
      minimum of 10 patients evaluable for safety to fulfill the requirements for moving the&#xD;
      combination forward to I-SPY 2 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be considered evaluable for safety, the patient must receive at least 75% of their&#xD;
      prescribed regimen per cycle for 4 consecutive cycles with a cycle of therapy defined as 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who progress at&#xD;
      9 weeks evaluation or later but before completing 4 cycles and who have only experienced&#xD;
      Grade ≤ 1 toxicities (excluding alopecia) will also be considered evaluable for safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will remain on their assigned dose level until unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      disease progression occurs. During dose escalation phase, if more than 34% of the evaluable&#xD;
      patients at a dose level experience dose limiting toxicities (DLT), this dose level will be&#xD;
      considered having exceeded MTD. Once MTD is identified during dose escalation phase, the MTD&#xD;
      dose level will be expanded in the expansion phase to enroll additional patients to ensure&#xD;
      that at least 10 patients are evaluable for safety at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel and trastuzumab are administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
      and 22 of a 28-day cycle. HBI-8000 will be taken by mouth twice weekly at the assigned dose&#xD;
      on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 25 of a 28-day cycle. Treatment continues until disease&#xD;
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal/non-compliance is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral HBI-8000 bi-weekly in combination&#xD;
      with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab and if successful, determine an optimal dose to move&#xD;
      into phase II testing of this combination in the I-SPY 2 trial in a neo-adjuvant breast&#xD;
      cancer population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the MTD of HBI-8000 twice weekly in combination with weekly paclitaxel and&#xD;
      trastuzumab in women with HER2+ breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the adverse event rate of twice weekly HBI-8000 in combination with weekly&#xD;
           paclitaxel and trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the tolerability of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered with weekly&#xD;
           paclitaxel and trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore efficacy of twice weekly HBI-8000 in combination with weekly paclitaxel and&#xD;
           trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain pharmacokinetics of twice weekly HBI-8000 when administered in combination&#xD;
           with weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the on-target effect of HBI-8000 by measuring protein acetylation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the treatment effects on immune cells in blood and/or tumor tissue as&#xD;
           appropriate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will take HBI-8000 at the assigned dose twice weekly while receiving weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel and trastuzumab for a minimum of 8 weeks (2 treatment cycles). On the day of&#xD;
      paclitaxel infusion, HBI-8000 is taken at least one hour before paclitaxel infusion. HBI-8000&#xD;
      should be taken within 30 minutes after a meal. The interval between HBI-8000 administrations&#xD;
      is 3-4 days in the absence of dose delay or interruptions due to adverse events. For example,&#xD;
      three days should elapse between the 1st and 2nd dose of HBI-8000 of the week, such as&#xD;
      Monday/Thursday; Tuesday/Friday.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disease re-evaluation will be scheduled every 8 weeks. Based on the Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST1.1), response to treatment will be determined. Patients&#xD;
      with stable disease (SD), partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) may continue&#xD;
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable side effects, or patient&#xD;
      refusal/non-compliance occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored in clinic every 4 weeks while receiving study treatment. The end&#xD;
      of treatment (EOT) visit will occur at 4 weeks after the last dose of HBI-8000, or before the&#xD;
      start of a new anti-cancer therapy, whichever is earlier. At EOT, patients will be evaluated&#xD;
      for resolution of treatment related toxicities. Toxicity related to HBI-8000, if not yet&#xD;
      resolved to Grade ≤ 1, will be followed until resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or considered chronic.&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up to 1 year from study enrollment for best objective response,&#xD;
      duration of response, time to PD, and survival.&#xD;
