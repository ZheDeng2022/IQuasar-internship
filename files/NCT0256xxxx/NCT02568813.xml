  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a multifaceted disorder and a major public health problem. In addition to&#xD;
      recurrent and unpredictable seizures, abnormalities in psychiatric status, cognition and&#xD;
      social-adaptive behaviors are potential major sources of disability in children and adults&#xD;
      with epilepsy disorders. Recent studies have unequivocally documented raised psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidities in children with epilepsy, particularly emotional regulation disorders such as&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, as compared to both the general population and the children with&#xD;
      other medical disorders, neurological and non-neurological. A prevalence of 12% to 35% has&#xD;
      been reported, compared to 3-8% in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major advances have begun to uncover the potential mediators of emotional regulation&#xD;
      disorders and social comorbidities in epilepsy, but important gaps remain in the early&#xD;
      detection, treatment and prevention of these disorders. A very small number of investigations&#xD;
      have examined children with epilepsy at or near the time of diagnosis. This is a time during&#xD;
      which the effects of chronic epilepsy, potential averse social effects of epilepsy, and other&#xD;
      complicating aetiological effects are minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epilepsy syndromes provide a useful framework for considering the risk and type of emotional&#xD;
      dysregulation comorbidities. But variability within and across syndromes needs to be taken&#xD;
      into account thus requiring a strict phenotyping by specialists in the filed of pediatric&#xD;
      epileptology. Retrospective studies, usually including patients with chronic epilepsies and&#xD;
      suffering from a mixed spectrum of epilepsy syndromes introduce biases leading to rather&#xD;
      disparate findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are such disorders the result of common physiopathological mechanisms, which precede the&#xD;
      development of the epilepsy? The link between an underlying brain disorder and psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidities has emerged in recent literature, with evidence based on studies in adults,&#xD;
      suggesting bidirectional relations between epilepsy and neurobehavioural comorbidities.&#xD;
      Emotional regulation disorders can follow the onset of epilepsy, but they can also precede&#xD;
      it, thus serving as a possible risk factor. The clinical implication of such a bidirectional&#xD;
      association is that neurobehavioural comorbidities might be present at diagnosis and even&#xD;
      before epilepsy onset. There is a need for greater understanding of the causes of these&#xD;
      conditions in younger people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree to which specific epilepsy syndromes are associated with the relative risk of&#xD;
      emotional dysregulation disorders in children with new- or recent-onset (within six months&#xD;
      prior to enrolment) has rarely been comprehensively examined and represents the focus of the&#xD;
      current investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study will be based on a prospectively recruited cohort of 280&#xD;
      children/adolescents with recently diagnosed epilepsy. All participating centres dispose of&#xD;
      the necessary competences for a precise diagnosis of the epilepsy syndromes and the tools for&#xD;
      a per case appropriate aetiology screening. Following a first seizure children are usually&#xD;
      first examined at hospital based emergency departments. Prompt referral to the epilepsy teams&#xD;
      participating at the present study will significantly reduce the population biases and&#xD;
      shortcuts encountered in studies that recruited patients with chronic epilepsy followed in&#xD;
      tertiary care epilepsy units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect their results to provide a greater understanding of both the shared&#xD;
      and the unique features of emotional regulation disorders, in relation to specific epilepsy&#xD;
      categories defined on the basis of the underlying physiopathological mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such knowledge will also assist clinicians and families in the planning of both diagnosis and&#xD;
      management resources.&#xD;
