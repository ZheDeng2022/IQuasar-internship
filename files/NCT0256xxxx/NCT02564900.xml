    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Following Treatment With DS-8201a in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phases)</measure>
    <time_frame>From 6 months postdose of last participant up to 3 years 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland (8 participants), breast with HER2-mutation (2 participants), endometrial (2 participants), esophageal (2 participants), Paget's disease (2 participants), cholangiocarcinoma (1 participant), extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma (1 participant), gallbladder (1 participant), pancreatic (1 participant), small intestine (1 participant), uterine cervix (1 participant) and HER2-low gastric/GEJ (1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg) cancer.</description>

    <description>Duration of response (DoR) by independent central review was defined as the time between the date of the first complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause.

    <description>Time to response (TTR) by independent central review was defined as the time interval between the date of registration until the date at which the criteria were first met for complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Only participants who achieved CR or PR were included in the TTR analysis.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 292 participants who met all inclusion and no exclusion criteria were enrolled at 8 centers in the US and 6 centers in Japan. A total of 27 participants started the Dose Escalation phase and a total of 265 participants in the Dose Expansion phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Dose Escalation was intended to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of DS-8201a with at least 3 participants evaluable for assessment of dose-limiting toxicity per dose level. Since the MTD was not reached, doses of 5.4 mg/kg and 6.4 mg/kg were chosen for evaluation in the Dose Expansion phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Following Treatment With DS-8201a in Participants With Advanced Solid Malignant Tumors (Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Phases)</title>
        <description>Objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review was defined as the proportion of participants who achieve either complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions and PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland (8 participants), breast with HER2-mutation (2 participants), endometrial (2 participants), esophageal (2 participants), Paget's disease (2 participants), cholangiocarcinoma (1 participant), extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma (1 participant), gallbladder (1 participant), pancreatic (1 participant), small intestine (1 participant), uterine cervix (1 participant) and HER2-low gastric/GEJ (1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg) cancer.</description>

        <description>Disease control rate (DCR) by independent central review was calculated as the proportion of participants demonstrating complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 6 weeks (±1week) from the first dosing date. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included 8 participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland, 2 breast with HER2-mutation, 2 endometrial, 2 esophageal, 2 Paget's disease, 1 cholangiocarcinoma, 1 extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma, 1 gallbladder, 1 pancreatic, 1 small intestine, 1 uterine cervix, and 1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg with HER2-low gastric/GEJ cancer.</description>

          <description>Disease control rate (DCR) by independent central review was calculated as the proportion of participants demonstrating complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) for a minimum of 6 weeks (±1week) from the first dosing date. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD; at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included 8 participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland, 2 breast with HER2-mutation, 2 endometrial, 2 esophageal, 2 Paget's disease, 1 cholangiocarcinoma, 1 extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma, 1 gallbladder, 1 pancreatic, 1 small intestine, 1 uterine cervix, and 1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg with HER2-low gastric/GEJ cancer.</description>

        <description>Duration of response (DoR) by independent central review was defined as the time between the date of the first complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) until the date of the first documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause. CR was defined as a disappearance of all target lesions, PR as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, and PD as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. HER2-positive other solid tumors included participants with salivary/submandibular/parotid gland (8 participants), breast with HER2-mutation (2 participants), endometrial (2 participants), esophageal (2 participants), Paget's disease (2 participants), cholangiocarcinoma (1 participant), extraskeletal myxoide chondrosarcoma (1 participant), gallbladder (1 participant), pancreatic (1 participant), small intestine (1 participant), uterine cervix (1 participant) and HER2-low gastric/GEJ (1 participant who received 5.4 mg/kg) cancer.</description>

          <population>Safety events were assessed in the Safety Analysis Set.

For the safety overview, TEAEs for HER2-expressing NSCLC, Colorectal, and Other Solid Tumors (excluding 1 HER2-low gastric cancer subject who received 5.4 mg/kg) were combined and reported together.</population>

      <time_frame>Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) data were collected from baseline up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug, up to 3 years 5 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>TEAEs were AEs that occur, having been absent before the first dose of study drug, or has worsened in severity or seriousness after the first dose until 28 days after the last dose. Serious adverse events with an onset or worsening ≥29 days after the last dose, if related to the study treatment, are also TEAEs. TEAEs from other HER2-expressing solid tumors other than breast or gastric were combined as prespecified in the protocol (excluding 1 patient with gastric cancer who received 5.4 mg/kg).</desc>
