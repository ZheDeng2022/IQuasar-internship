    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually-transmitted virus which causes infections&#xD;
      that usually last only a few months, but sometimes can last a long time and cause cancers of&#xD;
      the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or oropharynx over many years among adults. This phase IIA&#xD;
      trial studies how well does the nonavalent HPV vaccine (which can prevent nine different&#xD;
      types of HPV) work when given in an alternative dosing schedule to heathy young research&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic geometric mean titer (GMT) of HPV&#xD;
      16/18 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the prime dose and prior to the administration&#xD;
      of the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the persistence and stability of serologic GMT of HPV types&#xD;
      6/11/31/33/45/52/58 between 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after prime dose and prior to the&#xD;
      administration of the second dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess safety and reactogenicity to each vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly (IM)&#xD;
      at baseline (priming injection) and at 24 and 30 months (booster injections).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, participants are followed up for 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>A one-sided paired t test will be performed to compare the difference in the mean of the log-transformed antibody levels between 6 and 12 months, between 12 and 18 months, and between 18 and 24 months, respectively, to evaluate whether the GMT at 12/18/24 months, respectively, is not inferior to the GMT at 6/12/18 months. Percentage of participants whose type-specific antibody levels decrease, increase, or remain stable between the 6 and 12 month study visits, between the 12 and 18 month study visits, and between the18 month and 24 month study visits will be reported along with the associated 95% confidence interval.</description>
