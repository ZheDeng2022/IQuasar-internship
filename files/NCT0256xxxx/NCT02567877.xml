      Patients taking thyroid hormone replacement after thyroid removal surgery often report&#xD;
      feeling differently than they did prior to taking thyroid hormone. The symptoms can include&#xD;
      fatigue, worsening mood or subjective &quot;brain fog&quot; where the patient feels like their thinking&#xD;
      is just not as sharp as it was previously. Multiple studies have found that patients taking&#xD;
      thyroid hormone replacement have a diminished quality of life compared to matched controls.&#xD;
      Previous studies have suggested that the type of deiodinase (DIO) polymorphism a patient has,&#xD;
      which is responsible for converting the thyroid hormone T4 into the more biologically active&#xD;
      T3, may contribute to their overall cognition and sense of well-being. The Investigators aim&#xD;
      to determine if the type of deiodinase polymorphism a patient has contributes to the&#xD;
      patient's cognition and overall sense of well-being after surgery and thyroid hormone&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Determine if patients with the deiodinase type 2 CC polymorphism have objective&#xD;
      differences in working memory (N-back test is primary endpoint), cognitive function and sense&#xD;
      of well-being after thyroidectomy when placed on standard thyroid hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: (1) Patients with the deiodinase type 2 CC polymorphism will have worse working&#xD;
      memory (N-back test is primary endpoint), cognitive function and sense of well-being on&#xD;
      standard thyroid hormone replacement therapy after thyroidectomy compared with before&#xD;
      thyroidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2) Patients with the deiodinase type 2 TT or TC polymorphism will have no differences in&#xD;
      working memory, cognitive function or sense of well-being on standard thyroid hormone&#xD;
      replacement before and after thyroidectomy.&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Many patients undergo thyroidectomy for nodular thyroid disease. They have&#xD;
      normal thyroid function prior to surgery and are immediately placed on standard thyroid&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy (levothyroxine, LT4) after surgery. The levothyroxine dose is&#xD;
      titrated every 6-8 weeks to normalize the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to study this population before surgery when the patients still have&#xD;
      endogenous thyroid function and after surgery once their TSH has been normalized to&#xD;
      pre-surgery levels. Using a weight based dosing strategy (1.6mcg/kg), most patients will&#xD;
      remain euthyroid throughout this process. This experimental design eliminates many of the&#xD;
      confounding variables that have plagued previous thyroid replacement trials. One of the most&#xD;
      difficult aspects of conducting these types of studies is testing a uniform patient&#xD;
      population. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's&#xD;
      thyroiditis) and previous studies have largely focused on these patients. The difficulty in&#xD;
      testing patients with autoimmune thyroid failure is that even though they have a common&#xD;
      illness, the disease course is extremely variable. Each patient may have different degrees of&#xD;
      thyroid failure and may still be making different amounts of endogenous thyroid hormone. The&#xD;
      presence of thyroid autoantibodies has also been reported to have systemic effects, and may&#xD;
      influence perception of overall health and sense of well-being. This study will focus on a&#xD;
      more homogenous population without the potential cofounders inherent to patients with&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid disease. Each patient will serve as their own control and also avoid any&#xD;
      cognitive or somatic effects that temporary hypothyroidism may induce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has ever evaluated a patient's symptoms before and after replacement with thyroid&#xD;
      hormone when the patient is euthyroid before thyroid hormone therapy. The assumption has been&#xD;
      made that if serum TSH is normalized, thyroid hormone levels are adequate and that symptoms&#xD;
      of hypothyroidism have been relieved. The investigators know from large community based&#xD;
      studies that symptoms of hypothyroidism persist despite what the investigators believe is&#xD;
      &quot;adequate&quot; thyroid hormone replacement in as many as 10% of patients. Our study will be the&#xD;
      first to test the same patient, before and after thyroidectomy so the investigators can&#xD;
      directly compare normal endogenous thyroid function with levothyroxine (LT4) therapy&#xD;
      resulting in the same serum TSH. Thyroidectomies are often performed for large nodules or&#xD;
      nodules that show indeterminate or suspicious cytology after fine needle aspiration biopsy,&#xD;
      but turn out to be benign at final histological diagnosis. The current standard of care is to&#xD;
      replace thyroid hormone with LT4 to normalize the serum TSH. Our approach uses the same&#xD;
      patient as their own control and eliminates numerous variables that cannot be controlled for&#xD;
      in other studies including: variable onset of hypothyroidism, degree of endogenous thyroid&#xD;
      function and underlying cause of hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to and after surgery, the investigators will measure each patient's thyroid levels&#xD;
      (TSH, free T4, total T4, total T3, thyroxine binding globulin, sex hormone binding globulin,&#xD;
      lipid panel, and iron), and parathyroid/calcium function (parathyroid hormone, calcium,&#xD;
      albumin, vitamin D25), and deiodinase type 2 polymorphism status will be determined on&#xD;
      pre-surgery bloodwork. Thyronamine levels will also be measured before and after surgery.&#xD;
      Thyronamines are thyronergic metabolites of thyroid hormones that can decrease metabolism and&#xD;
      induce behavioral inactivity in mouse models. A recently developed sensitive chemiluminescent&#xD;
      antibody assay for 3-Iodothyronamine has been developed and patients on levothyroxine therapy&#xD;
      after thyroidectomy had higher thyronamine levels compared with euthyroid controls. Based on&#xD;
      these studies, the investigators hypothesize, as a secondary measure that patients with a&#xD;
      higher thyronamine level after surgery, or greater pre- vs post-surgery thyronamine level&#xD;
      will have worse outcomes, defined by the questionnaires. Patients will complete a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires (SF-36 measure of overall health, Billewicz measure of thyroid health, HADS&#xD;
      measure of anxiety and depression) as well as undergo working memory testing using the N-back&#xD;
      and cognitive function testing using the Sustained Attention to Response Test (SART). Lab&#xD;
      analysis will also be performed before surgery to look at targets of thyroid hormone action&#xD;
      including low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).&#xD;
      Following surgery, only patients benign results or low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer not&#xD;
      requiring radioiodine therapy or TSH suppression will continue on the study. The patients&#xD;
      continuing in the study will have their dose of levothyroxine titrated with the goal of&#xD;
      matching their pre-surgery TSH +/- 1 milli-international units per liter (mIU/L). 6 months&#xD;
      following surgery, lab testing, questionnaires and cognitive testing will be repeated. Timing&#xD;
      the second set of testing 6 months will allow adequate time to match the post-surgery TSH to&#xD;
      the pre-surgery level and give adequate time for any cognitive effects resulting from the&#xD;
      surgery itself to dissipate. The primary endpoint will compare changes in scores on the&#xD;
      N-back test before and after surgery from those in the deiodinase CC polymorphism group to&#xD;
      those in the deiodinase type 2 TC and TT groups. Secondary endpoints will include scores on&#xD;
      the SART and well-being questionnaires before and after surgery to correlate with deiodinase&#xD;
      polymorphisms as well as correlation of these outcome measures with serum thyronamine levels&#xD;
      before and after surgery as an exploratory measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional sub-study is being made available to research subjects to compare the stool&#xD;
      microbiota longitudinally, with the initial stool sample at the start of the study in the&#xD;
      presence of normal systemic thyroid hormone levels and then again after thyroidectomy while&#xD;
      taking oral levothyroxine. Comparisons of any microbiota compositional changes from before&#xD;
      and after surgery will be made to any changes in symptoms, cognition/memory testing and&#xD;
      overall quality of life. Any exposure to antibiotics, probiotics or other updates to medical&#xD;
      history will be documented at each visit. Any exposure to systemic antibiotics in the&#xD;
      previous 60 days of the first study collection or between collections will be excluded.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 3-day lead-in dietary log prior to each stool collection,&#xD;
      summarizing meal compositions on 3 consecutive days before the stool sample is collected and&#xD;
      submitted. Participants will be given their own dietary log again and encouraged to follow a&#xD;
      similar diet prior to the second stool collection.&#xD;
