  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib in treating patients&#xD;
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or&#xD;
      controlled with treatment (advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic)&#xD;
      and cannot be removed by surgery and liver or kidney dysfunction. Talazoparib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of talazoparib in&#xD;
      patients with varying degrees of hepatic and renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe preliminary antitumor activity of talazoparib in patients with cancers that&#xD;
      commonly harbor defects in homologous recombination repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of talazoparib in patients with varying&#xD;
      degrees of hepatic and renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of talazoparib. IV. To evaluate biomarkers&#xD;
      associated with response or resistance to talazoparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 cohorts based on&#xD;
      the degree of hepatic or renal dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
