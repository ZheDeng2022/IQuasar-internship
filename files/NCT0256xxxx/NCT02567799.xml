      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of BIO 300 Oral&#xD;
      Suspension when used in combination with standard dose radiation therapy and chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Based on preclinical data the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that BIO 300 Oral Suspension will reduce the incidence of radiation-induced&#xD;
      pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, ascending dose Phase I/II study of BIO 300 Oral Suspension&#xD;
      given in combination with paclitaxel/carboplatin and radiotherapy in subjects with stage II,&#xD;
      III, or IV NSCLC who are candidates for combined chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 6 subjects will be accrued sequentially at each dose level of BIO 300. BIO 300&#xD;
      will be administered daily for the entire course of concurrent chemoradiotherapy, a minimum&#xD;
      of 6 weeks; in combination with standard paclitaxel / carboplatin chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of BIO 300 will be administered on Day 1, Visit 2 in which safety data&#xD;
      (adverse events, electrocardiograms (ECGs), results of safety laboratory determinations),&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data will be collected. PK data will be&#xD;
      collected from a minimum of six (6) study subjects from each cohort. PD data will be&#xD;
      collected from all subjects in each study cohort. Day 1 of chemotherapy will be scheduled at&#xD;
      the discretion of the investigator provided the subject has completed a minimum of 1 day of&#xD;
      BIO 300 dosing. BIO 300 will be administered in combination with the chemotherapy components&#xD;
      of the protocol (paclitaxel and carboplatin). During the first or second chemotherapy&#xD;
      infusion, additional safety, PK and PD data will be collected. Day 1 of radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT) may be scheduled at the discretion of the investigator provided the subject has&#xD;
      completed a minimum of 2 days of BIO 300 dosing. BIO 300 will continue to be administered&#xD;
      daily; paclitaxel and carboplatin will be administered weekly and radiotherapy will be&#xD;
      administered daily until a total dose of 60-70 Gy has been administered. During the period of&#xD;
      combined BIO 300 and chemoradiotherapy (6-7 weeks), additional safety, PK and PD data will be&#xD;
      collected weekly. An interim data analysis will be completed once the highest dose cohort&#xD;
      concludes chemoradiation therapy, in an effort to determine the optimal biological dose.&#xD;
      Following analysis, there will be an option to enroll up to an additional 12 subjects at the&#xD;
      optimal biological dose. At the conclusion of the study, primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will be evaluated. Data will be analyzed from all cohorts to determine the oncologic&#xD;
      response, safety of BIO 300, and a recommended BIO 300 dose.&#xD;
