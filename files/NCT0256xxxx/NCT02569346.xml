    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor which is marketed as a single tablet (Tivicay速)&#xD;
      and in a fixed dose combination tablet with abacavir and lamivudine (Triumeq速, referred to as&#xD;
      TRI). For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be&#xD;
      problematic and tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no information about crushing TRI tablets. Therefore this study will be&#xD;
      conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended TRI and crushed and suspended TRI with&#xD;
      drip feed are bioequivalent to taking TRI as a whole.&#xD;

      Dolutegravir is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor which is marketed as a single tablet (Tivicay速)&#xD;
      and in a fixed dose combination tablet with abacavir and lamivudine (Triumeq速, referred to as&#xD;
      TRI). For patients with swallowing difficulties, administration of whole tablets can be&#xD;
      problematic and tablets are cut or crushed to ease administration. In addition, if HIV&#xD;
      patients develop opportunistic infections, patients can become severely ill and may end up on&#xD;
      the intensive care. Patients at the intensive care might not be able to swallow medication.&#xD;
      Therefore it is useful to know if it is possible to administer TRI through a different route,&#xD;
      like a feeding tube. If TRI can be crushed or dissolved and given through a catheter it is&#xD;
      also useful to know if it can be given with drip feed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no information about crushing TRI tablets. Depending on the&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical characteristics of a drug formulation, crushing tablets can lead to altered&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of drugs. This has been shown for some of the antiretroviral drugs, such as&#xD;
      ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz and tenofovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to know whether pharmacokinetics are influenced by crushing of tablets as low&#xD;
      concentrations are associated with virologic failure. Therefore higher doses or switching to&#xD;
      other HIV-drugs might be needed. In addition, higher Cmax and/or exposure can lead to&#xD;
      toxicity. As a result therapeutic drug monitoring is advised, or crushing the drug is a&#xD;
      contra-indication based on the available data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that DTG plasma concentration is influenced by food, with higher AUC en&#xD;
      Cmax after a high-fat meal compared to administration in a fasted state. During clinical&#xD;
      development, however, dolutegravir intake was studied without regard to food intake.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is recommended that dolutegravir can be taken with or without food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it has been shown that simultaneous oral ingestion of antacids and dolutegravir&#xD;
      gives a decrease in Cmax and AUC of dolutegravir. This interaction is not shown for&#xD;
      co-ingestion with omeprazole, which makes it unlikely that this interaction is caused by a&#xD;
      pH-lowering effect influencing the absorption of dolutegravir. It is probably a local&#xD;
      gastrointestinal complexation phenomenon, similar to what has been observed with other HIV&#xD;
      integrase inhibitors. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between dolutegravir and&#xD;
      complexation formers may be expected. Especially considering the active binding sites of&#xD;
      dolutegravir which bind magnesium metal ion cofactors. It is currently unclear if certain&#xD;
      foods or liquids containing high amounts of magnesium or other cations, like drip feed, can&#xD;
      cause this same interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will be conducted to investigate whether crushed and suspended TRI and&#xD;
      crushed and suspended TRI with drip feed are bioequivalent to taking TRI as a whole.&#xD;
