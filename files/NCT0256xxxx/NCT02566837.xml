    <textblock>
      Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin are currently the best focal treatment of&#xD;
      spasticity, with clearly defined indications and role. French and European recommendations&#xD;
      focus on the toxin's mode of administration, which must be as precise as possible. The&#xD;
      toxin's specific action on motor endplates (blocking the release of acetylcholine) shows the&#xD;
      importance of targeted injections within the muscle belly. The pain caused by these&#xD;
      injections is due partly the number of injections (up to 30 in a single session), and partly&#xD;
      to the use of electrical stimulation guidance. Prevention and alleviation of the pain caused&#xD;
      by these injections have become a regulatory obligation since the law of 4 March 2002&#xD;
      relating to the rights of patients and the quality of the health system (&quot; Any person has the&#xD;
      right to receive relief from pain, which must, under all circumstances, be prevented,&#xD;
      evaluated, taken into account and treated … &quot;).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation guidance is generally used nowadays, and is recommended over the use&#xD;
      of palpation and anatomical landmarks. However, electrical stimulation has its limits. It is&#xD;
      sometimes poorly tolerated by patients as it causes pain, which is greater in muscles less&#xD;
      responsive to such stimulation and requiring a stronger electrical current. The pain also&#xD;
      increases with the number of injections performed in a single session. Electrical stimulation&#xD;
      does not guarantee for certain that the needle is placed within the muscle, as a stimulation&#xD;
      of the aponeurosis may cause the muscle to contract through the excitation of motor branches&#xD;
      entering the muscle. The injection of botulinum toxin in the aponeurosis does not provide a&#xD;
      satisfactory effect and may render the injection ineffective. In some patients, the muscle to&#xD;
      inject may present some degree of retraction with fat degeneration, which reduces its&#xD;
      sensitivity to electrical stimulation. Individual patients may also respond poorly or not at&#xD;
      all to electrical stimulation, which causes technical and treatment problems. Finally,&#xD;
      certain muscles are difficult to locate by electrical stimulation because their contraction&#xD;
      produces only weak mechanical effects (e.g. short muscles such as the interossei muscles).&#xD;
      All these factors explain why ultrasound imaging provides an interesting alternative guidance&#xD;
      technique for botulinum toxin injections. In most cases, it can replace electrical&#xD;
      stimulation altogether, and thus avoid the pain it causes. Ultrasound guidance is already&#xD;
      recommended in pediatric patients to improve their comfort during the injections. In our&#xD;
      study, the patient's comfort during the injection was chosen as the main endpoint because it&#xD;
      has already been demonstrated in children and because the investigators feel it is an&#xD;
      essential aspect of our routine practice. Moreover, ultrasound imaging helps locate&#xD;
      accurately the muscle to be injected. Once the tip of the needle has been located, it can be&#xD;
      tracked during the injection, and guided to the muscle belly. Previous studies have already&#xD;
      shown that this technique improves the efficacy of the injections. Ultrasound imaging is also&#xD;
      interesting when the muscles to be injected are located in a deep plane or close to vital&#xD;
      structures, such as nerves, arteries, or veins (e.g. piriformis or psoas). All these&#xD;
      considerations have been studied in children and should be validated in adult spastic&#xD;
      patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators will compare ultrasound guidance to electrical stimulation&#xD;
      guidance in routine clinical practice. This study will be carried out in adult spastic&#xD;
      patients who may receive botulinum toxin injections in the Service of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation of University Teaching Hospital. The aim is to analyse the advantages of this&#xD;
      injection technique under current practice conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluating physician (blinded) will conduct a clinical examination of the patients before&#xD;
      the injections, and 6 to 8 weeks after the injection of botulinum toxin. The pain associated&#xD;
      with the toxin injections will be evaluated after the injections and during the follow-up&#xD;
      visit, using the vertical indexed VAS and the Face Pain Scale. The spasticity will be&#xD;
      evaluated on the Tardieu scale before the injections and during the follow-up visit. The&#xD;
      duration of the botulinum toxin injections will be measured. Finally, functional objectives&#xD;
      will be determined prior to the injections. The GAS (Goal Attainment Scaling) methodology&#xD;
      will be used during the follow-up visit to determine whether these objectives have been met&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
