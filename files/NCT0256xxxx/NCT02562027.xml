  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A principle objective of the study is to create a validated risk model for treatment&#xD;
      selection. This will greatly enhance the ability to counsel patients regarding their specific&#xD;
      risks/benefit ratio for surgery or SBRT. This will improve informed decision making on the&#xD;
      part of the patient, and remove much of the subjectivity of treatment selection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of SBRT for treatment of stage I NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) inspired&#xD;
      the collaboration between thoracic surgery and radiation oncology and has prompted the&#xD;
      investigators to work closely together to evaluate the relative role of SBRT and surgery.&#xD;
      Comparative studies of these modalities have been limited in number and are often difficult&#xD;
      to interpret due to variability in methodological issues. The productive collaboration has&#xD;
      resulted in publication of several studies comparing SBRT and surgery utilizing propensity&#xD;
      score based analyses to match patients from each group. However, matching on limited numbers&#xD;
      of variables between patients ultimately selected for therapy based largely on their real or&#xD;
      perceived comorbidity leads to significant reporting bias, and therefore methods to&#xD;
      comprehensively assess comorbidity are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As extension of above, a very real ongoing challenge that the investigators have evaluated&#xD;
      within clinical practice is that current guidelines defining the high risk patient are&#xD;
      subjective and prone to physician bias. A recent secondary analysis of clinical trial&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for SBRT underscored this bias by demonstrating that many patients that&#xD;
      were considered inoperable were perhaps reasonable surgical candidates. Based on standard&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests the inoperable SBRT patients had a diffusion capacity 33% higher&#xD;
      than the high risk surgical patients in ACOSOG Z4032. Conversely, stratification of high risk&#xD;
      surgical patients within ACOSOG Z4032 trial identified an extremely high risk subset (median&#xD;
      DLCO% 30%, FEV1% 39%) with a 90-day 3+ adverse event rate of 48% compared to the lowest risk&#xD;
      subset (DLCO% 69%, FEV1% 56%) with a 90-day 3+ adverse event rate of only 24%. In the absence&#xD;
      of a clinical trial or a prospective database, there is currently no objective algorithm to&#xD;
      guide the assignment of surgery versus SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to objectively stratify risk within the surgical population have been challenging.&#xD;
      Risk models based on the European Thoracic Database and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons&#xD;
      Database are not yet robust enough to guide decision-making regarding treatment assignment or&#xD;
      classification of the very high risk surgical patient where alternative therapies may be&#xD;
      preferable. Unfortunately, one of the current limitations to stratifying these high risk&#xD;
      patients is that these patients are followed by physicians in independent specialties. The&#xD;
      STS Thoracic Surgical Database does not include patients that undergo SBRT therefore it is&#xD;
      difficult to create an inclusive algorithm for operable and inoperable patients. A principle&#xD;
      objective of the study is to create a validated risk model for treatment selection. This will&#xD;
      greatly enhance the ability to counsel patients regarding their specific risks/benefit ratio&#xD;
      for surgery or SBRT. This will improve informed decision making on the part of the patient,&#xD;
      and remove much of the subjectivity of treatment selection. Inclusion of unique metrics such&#xD;
      as HRQOL data will further bolster the benefit to the patient by making it more&#xD;
      patient-centric, rather than focusing on cancer outcomes alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the implementation of the Affordable HealthCare Act (AHCA) continues, physicians will&#xD;
      experience additional pressure to cut costs while maintaining or improving the quality of&#xD;
      care provided. The current fee-for-service system is often criticized for being&#xD;
      compartmentalized and fragmented without well-defined incentives for quality improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiatives of the AHCA have included efforts to test care models to reduce hospital&#xD;
      associated conditions, bundled payment plans for care improvement, and shared savings&#xD;
      programs for accountable care organizations whereby participating providers who meet certain&#xD;
      quality standards share in any savings achieved for the Medicare program. These are just some&#xD;
      of the efforts designed to rein in the cost of medical care while improving the transparency&#xD;
      and quality of care. Pilot efforts involving bundling of payments for coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grafting resulted in Medicare savings of $40 million with simultaneous reduced in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality. These types of initiatives are likely to become more commonplace in the United&#xD;
      States as efforts to create new models of care to constrain cost are introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the stimulus of these initiatives for novel systems of healthcare delivery the&#xD;
      investigators recognized that a model of bundled payment for treatment of stage I NSCLC may&#xD;
      not only reduce overall costs associated with treatment of stage I lung cancer but&#xD;
      potentially improve the quality of care provided. At Washington University the investigators&#xD;
      have taken a preemptive measure to create an accountable care organization (ACO) between the&#xD;
      Department of Radiation Oncology and the Department of Thoracic Surgery with a focused&#xD;
      approach on the treatment of stage I NSCLC. Important components of this collaborative effort&#xD;
      include a bundled payment system for episodes of care involving the treatment selection,&#xD;
      implementation, and follow up care of patients with stage I lung cancer as well as&#xD;
      prospective assessment of quality of care measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impetus for the development of this unique collaboration between radiation oncology and&#xD;
      thoracic surgery stems from the ongoing interest in improving the quality of care for&#xD;
      patients with early stage NSCLC. The clinical research focus has been on determining the best&#xD;
      treatment strategies for the significant number of patients with stage I lung cancer&#xD;
      considered medically inoperable or high risk surgical candidates. In the aging population,&#xD;
      pulmonary insufficiency, cardiac disease, as well as other comorbidities may preclude surgery&#xD;
      or place patients at significant risk for complications after surgery. The evolution of&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the medically inoperable population has resulted in&#xD;
      relatively low local recurrence rates ranging from 3-20% with favorable overall and&#xD;
      disease-free survival in inoperable patients with Stage I NSCLC.&#xD;

All of the comorbidity indices grade comorbidities from mild to severe. The investigators will use the data obtained from cumulative collected indices to determine the severity of patient comorbidities.&#xD;

    <description>For determination of frailty, Fried's frailty criteria, a validated measurement tool which includes assessment of weight loss, exhaustion, activity level, grip strength, and walk speed. Fraility is classified using a validated score of 0-5 with patients scoring 4-5 considered frail, 2-3 considered intermediately frail, and 0-1 nonfrail.&#xD;
Activities of daily living (Katz Activities of Daily Living) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) will be assessed. Both the ADL and IADL look at independence. The ADL has 6 questions/the IADL has 8 questions and the patient will receive a point for each question if he or she is considered independent. A score of 0 means the person if very dependent and very frail. A score of 6 (ADL) or 8 (IADL) means a person if very independent and not frail.&#xD;
