    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is the greatest cause of ill health and early mortality, and smoking is the main&#xD;
      contributor to around 75,000 deaths a year in England. The aim of the present research is to&#xD;
      test the effect of helping people to reward themselves when they have successfully abstained&#xD;
      from smoking and the impact this will have on subsequent smoking cessation. Each participant&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions. The trial requires 159 participants to&#xD;
      perform an fully powered statistical analysis. The four conditions include: (1) a control&#xD;
      condition (asked to form a plan to quit smoking), (2) an implementation intention condition&#xD;
      (asked to form a more specific 'if-then' plan), (3) baseline which include: (1) a control&#xD;
      condition (asked to form a plan to quit smoking), (2) a volitional help sheet condition&#xD;
      (asked to link temptations with appropriate behavioural responses), (3) a weekly&#xD;
      self-incentivising condition (asked to reward themselves at the end of each week that they&#xD;
      have successfully abstained from smoking), or (4) a monthly self-incentivising condition&#xD;
      (asked to reward themselves at the end of each month that they have successfully abstained&#xD;
      from smoking). The main outcome measure will be smoking quit status, which will be verified&#xD;
      biochemically at the end of the stop smoking programme, and at six-months post quit date.&#xD;

      The research aims to test the role of self-incentivising implementation intentions in smoking&#xD;
      cessation among prisoners aged 18 and over, enrolling on a stop smoking programme provided by&#xD;
      Livewire within Risley Prison. The effectiveness of self-incentives has been successfully&#xD;
      seen previously within health behaviour change, but not within smoking cessation (ongoing&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial in alongside community stop smoking services, and local&#xD;
      workplaces). This research will build on this by testing the effectiveness of self-incentives&#xD;
      in prisoners' stop smoking attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised controlled trial with the between participants factor of condition&#xD;
      which has four levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Control (plan) 2 Self-generated implementation intention (if-then plan) 3. Weekly&#xD;
      self-incentivising implementation intention 4. Monthly self-incentivising implementation&#xD;
      intention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The within participants' factor will be time which has three levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline (T1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up (T2) (end of stop smoking programme)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up (T3) (six months post quit date)&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethical concern is that participants in the control condition may struggle more to quit&#xD;
      smoking as they will not have the additional benefits of being within an experimental&#xD;
      condition which uses self-incentives to aid their quit attempt. A control condition is needed&#xD;
      to monitor if quitting smoking is due to the use of self-incentives or another behaviour&#xD;
      change technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment process will involve the researcher (Emma Brown) administering study packs to&#xD;
      the potential participants. The participant information sheet will be read to each&#xD;
      participant and time will be provided to ask any questions. If the participant agrees to take&#xD;
      part in the research and complete the questionnaire, then this will be completed with the&#xD;
      help of the researcher (Emma Brown) if required. Questionnaires will be placed in a sealed&#xD;
      envelope and returned to the University of Manchester by the researcher (Emma Brown).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who are able to provide informed consent and are over the age of 18 years&#xD;
      old are eligible to take part in the study. Unfortunately, the study does not cater for&#xD;
      people who cannot understand English at the present time, although this will be monitored for&#xD;
      amendments in future studies. The study will use a paper format as not to exclude those&#xD;
      participants who have limited or no access to the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant information sheet included within the study pack alongside the questionnaire&#xD;
      includes details about the study, costs and benefits of taking part in the study, and the&#xD;
      right to consent and withdraw at any point throughout the study. There are no risks involved&#xD;
      in taking part in the study. There is a minimal burden in time taken to complete the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire to take no longer than 15 minutes and the further two follow-up questionnaires&#xD;
      to take no longer than 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of confidentiality, participants are asked to form a personal identification code to&#xD;
      match baseline and follow-up questionnaires once completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no conflicts of interest. Results will be fed back to all participating services&#xD;
      and participants involved in the study, should they indicate for a summary of the results.&#xD;
