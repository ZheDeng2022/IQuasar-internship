  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this case-control intervention study, therefore, was to explore the effect&#xD;
      of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on the GCF levels of vaspin and omentin in patients with&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis in order to determine the usefulness of vaspin and omentin as a&#xD;
      diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of periodontal disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All individuals underwent a full-mouth periodontal examination, which included probing pocket&#xD;
      depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI),&#xD;
      bleeding on probing (BOP). BMI and WHR were used for assessing obesity. In addition, HbA1c&#xD;
      and fasting plasma glucose levels were used for elimination of diabetes mellitus. Based on&#xD;
      the periodontal and anthropometric measurements, individuals (n=76) were divided into four&#xD;
      groups: the periodontal-healthy group (n=19), chronic periodontitis group (n=19),&#xD;
      periodontal-healthy with obesity group (n=19) and chronic periodontitis with obesity group&#xD;
      (n=19). Periodontitis patients received nonsurgical periodontal therapy. GCF sampling and&#xD;
      clinical periodontal parameters were assessed before and 6 weeks after therapy. Vaspin,&#xD;
      omentin, and TNF-α levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&#xD;
