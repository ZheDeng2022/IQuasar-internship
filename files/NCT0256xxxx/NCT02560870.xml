      Aim: To compare the efficacy of Aloe Vera and non-alcoholic chlorhexidine mouthwash in the&#xD;
      treatment of Periodontal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods &amp;Material: 32 patients were selected, the following periodontal parameters were&#xD;
      recorded at baseline, and after recording all the parameters at the baseline, Scaling, root&#xD;
      planning, and polishing are done for all the patients participating in the study. Oral&#xD;
      hygiene instructions were given that included brushing twice a day with a soft brush, After 2&#xD;
      weeks, patients in the study, were randomly (Balanced Block Randomization) equal divided into&#xD;
      2 groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: mouthwash aloe Vera (Alodent Co. UK) for each patient, Group B: Non-alcoholic&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine (Perio-Kin, Livar CO. Spain) 10 ml by patients routinely washed two times in&#xD;
      one day for about 30 seconds and lasts for 15 days, then every 7 days periodontal parameters,&#xD;
      and at the end of 2 weeks (days 0, 7, 15) clinical changes are evaluated.&#xD;

      Eligible participants were 32 adult patients treated for chronic periodontitis and&#xD;
      participating in a supportive periodontal therapy program at the Department of Periodontology&#xD;
      of the Dental Clinic of the Islamic Azad University, Dental Branch of Tehran were included in&#xD;
      the current study; Recruitment of participants started july 2014 and ended may 2015. The&#xD;
      study met the criteria of the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, revised in 2008. The survey plan&#xD;
      was reviewed and sanctioned, approved by the ethics commission of the Institutional Ethical&#xD;
      Committee and Review Board of the Deputy of Research, School of Dentistry. All subjects&#xD;
      received the oral and written explanation of the intent of the survey and signed an informed&#xD;
      consent after receiving detailed information about the purpose, the benefits, and the&#xD;
      possible risks associated with the trial. Individuals satisfying the following entry criteria&#xD;
      were recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed suffering from initial (early) to moderate chronic periodontitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients, more than 28 years old with at least 20 remaining teeth and at least&#xD;
           three teeth in each quadrant;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of at least two residual sites with a probing pocket depth (PPD&gt;4 mm in two&#xD;
           opposite quadrants, which showed bleeding upon probing, radiographically comparable&#xD;
           amount of periodontal breakdown and good matching in tooth type, also clinical and&#xD;
           minimal radiographic signs of initial (early) to moderate (clinical attachment level of&#xD;
           1 to 3mm.&#xD;
