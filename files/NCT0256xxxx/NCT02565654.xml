  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disease and the pathogenesis of this disease&#xD;
      includes central and peripheral mechanisms. In recent years, there were many studies&#xD;
      suggesting that microbiota in the intestine may play an important role in the IBS.What's&#xD;
      more, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may be an important pathogenic factor for&#xD;
      IBS and the use of antibiotics may be beneficial. Therefore, the investigators intend to&#xD;
      explore the efficacy of rifaximin for IBS-D in Chinese population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests that a shift in the host-gut microbial relationship as seen in small&#xD;
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBS.Overgrowth&#xD;
      of microbiota in the small intestine can cause excessive gas production and malabsorption&#xD;
      with a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as diarrhea, gas bloating, abdominal pain and&#xD;
      constipation.Glucose (GBT) and lactulose (LBT) breath test have been proposed as simple,&#xD;
      inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tools for detecting SIBO with respect to the gold&#xD;
      standard (the culture of intestinal aspirates). Many antibiotics have been proposed in the&#xD;
      last years for SIBO eradication.Rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative with antibacterial&#xD;
      activity caused by inhibition of bacterial synthesis of RNA and which is effective against&#xD;
      both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including aerobes and anaerobes.As &lt;0.1% of its&#xD;
      oral dose is absorbed, rifaximin administration is associated to a very low side-effect&#xD;
      incidence. However,there are still no effective and reliable treatment for IBS,so we intend&#xD;
      to explore the prevalence of SIBO in IBS-D patients and evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin&#xD;
      for IBS-D in Chinese population.&#xD;

        A total of 40 cases of LHBT positive and 20 cases of LHBT negative IBS-D patients will be&#xD;
        included in this study. The estimate of the LHBT positive rate was 40%, so we need to&#xD;
        screen about 100 IBS-D patients. We are going to recruit 120 IBS-D patients in our center&#xD;
        with respect to patients lost to follow up.&#xD;
