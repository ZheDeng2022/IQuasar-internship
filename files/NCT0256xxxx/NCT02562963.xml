    <textblock>
      Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that present a mixed T-NK&#xD;
      phenotype. Our hypothesis is that Natural killer T cells may decrease the tumor burden and&#xD;
      improve overall survival. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Natural killer T&#xD;
      (NKT) cells are effective and safe in the treatment of patients with unresectable advanced&#xD;
      solid tumor.&#xD;

      According to the Annual Report of Cancer Registration in China 2014, lung cancer, gastric&#xD;
      cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer have become the top 4 solid tumors with the&#xD;
      highest morbidity and mortality rates. So far, the main treatment modalities for these tumors&#xD;
      have been surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, the effect of conventional therapy&#xD;
      on advanced cancer is limited, tumor metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer. With the development of oncology and immunology in recent years,&#xD;
      immunotherapy represents a novel path to obtain a durable and long-lasting response in cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of lymphocytes that present a mixed T-NK&#xD;
      phenotype. NKT cells are expanded conventionally from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by&#xD;
      addition of a variety of cytokines in vitro culture. Our previous studies demonstrated that&#xD;
      the expansion of NKT cells in a clinical usage scale from peripheral blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      is feasible. Those expanded NKT cells exhibit antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo (tumor&#xD;
      -bearing nude mice) against a variety of tumor cells. Furthermore, intravenous infusion of a&#xD;
      single dose of 4X10^9 NKT cells in mice has been proved safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKT cells in patients&#xD;
      with unresectable advanced solid tumor.&#xD;
