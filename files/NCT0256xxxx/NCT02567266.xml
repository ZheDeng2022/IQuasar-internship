    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female adolescents between the ages of 12-18 years at the time of enrollment&#xD;
             with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety or depression at baseline. Evidence of&#xD;
             clinically significant symptoms will be defined as a Clinical Severity Rating (CSR)&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 4 on any DSM-5 defined anxiety disorder (e.g., generalized&#xD;
             anxiety disorder, social phobia, selective mutism, separation anxiety disorder) or&#xD;
             depressive disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder),&#xD;
             or an adjustment disorder with depressed mood, anxiety, or mixed anxiety and depressed&#xD;
             mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The adolescent is determined by the community mental health center to be eligible for&#xD;
             outpatient psychosocial services at the clinic and determined by the study IE to be&#xD;
             appropriate for outpatient psychosocial intervention (e.g., no major cognitive&#xD;
             impairment or active suicidality) based on clinical interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The adolescent lives (for at least 50% time) with legal guardian and this guardian is&#xD;
             willing to attend treatment sessions and participate in study assessments (every&#xD;
             effort will be made to encourage the same caregiver to participate in all&#xD;
             assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adolescent and parent/guardian are able to complete all study procedures in English or&#xD;
             Spanish.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adolescents will be excluded if they are receiving concurrent psychotherapy, family&#xD;
             therapy or similar psychosocial interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Consistent with the prior RCT of the UP-A, the use of psychopharmacologic treatments&#xD;
             for anxiety or depression is allowable; but the adolescent must be on a stable dosage&#xD;
             for 2 months for SSRI or 1 month for benzodiazepine prior to consenting to the study.&#xD;
             The type, dosage and frequency of medication will be monitored at all major study&#xD;
             assessment points, but subsequent changes will not incur exclusion from the&#xD;
             investigation. Adolescents on stable doses of a stimulant for ADHD for at least one&#xD;
             month or on a SNRI (e.g., Strattera) for ADHD for at least two months can also be&#xD;
             included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Adolescents who are currently suicidal or who have engaged in suicidal behaviors&#xD;
             within the past 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate clinical&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adolescents with a current substance abuse disorder as determined using the&#xD;
             ADIS-5-C/P, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Consistent with prior trials of the UP-A, youth with primary conditions not specified&#xD;
             for exclusion (e.g., eating disorders, schizophrenia) will be screened. As long as&#xD;
             study staff concur that an emotional disorder treatment focus is appropriate, these&#xD;
             youth will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adolescents with a reported history of intellectual disability or for whom there is&#xD;
             substantial evidence (e.g., multiple learning disorders, extensive school-based&#xD;
             accommodations for learning) that the cognitive level of the UP-A would make it&#xD;
             inappropriate as an individual therapy modality, as determined via Family Background&#xD;
             Questionnaire and/or based on PI judgement, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Given additional complexities obtaining informed consent, adolescents who are&#xD;
             currently placed in the foster care system will be excluded.&#xD;

            <description>Participants will be treated with the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescence (UP-A). Their clinicians will also receive feedback using the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire feedback system, consisting of youth and caregiver progress measures.&#xD;
The UP-A is an emotion-focused, transdiagnostic approach for adolescents (ages 12-18) with a primary emotional disorder. Clinicians present all skills in the context of the emotions most salient to presenting concerns and adolescent/caregiver conceptualizations of treatment needs, thereby personalizing treatment. The UP-A is delivered in 8-21 weekly sessions, with clinician flexibility regarding the sequencing and depth with which various sections are presented to clients and caregivers, as well as the emotions targeted during the course of the intervention.</description>

            <description>Participants will be treated by clinicians who receive feedback using the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire, but who otherwise use Treatment as Usual&#xD;
Youth Outcomes Questionnaire: The YOQ consists of parent- and youth-report measures of symptoms and alliance administered weekly on a tablet computer. The YOQ online system then generates reports to provide clinicians with systematic feedback about client progress, flagging &quot;critical items&quot; that have been endorsed (e.g., suicidality, hallucinations), presenting graphs of ratings over time, and providing empirically-derived &quot;alerts&quot; when clients are failing to progress or showing deterioration. Clinicians will be trained to use this feedback to modify treatment as needed, share it with families as appropriate, and use it to enhance use of supervision.&#xD;
Treatment as Usual: Clinicians assigned to the TAU condition will be instructed to use whatever treatment methods and outcome monitoring strategies they typically use with adolescents with internalizing disorders.</description>

            <description>Participants will be treated with the Unified Protocol for the Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescence (UP-A). Their clinicians will also receive feedback using the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire feedback system, consisting of youth and caregiver progress measures.&#xD;
The UP-A is an emotion-focused, transdiagnostic approach for adolescents (ages 12-18) with a primary emotional disorder. Clinicians present all skills in the context of the emotions most salient to presenting concerns and adolescent/caregiver conceptualizations of treatment needs, thereby personalizing treatment. The UP-A is delivered in 8-21 weekly sessions, with clinician flexibility regarding the sequencing and depth with which various sections are presented to clients and caregivers, as well as the emotions targeted during the course of the intervention.</description>

            <description>Participants will be treated by clinicians who receive feedback using the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire, but who otherwise use Treatment as Usual&#xD;
Youth Outcomes Questionnaire: The YOQ consists of parent- and youth-report measures of symptoms and alliance administered weekly on a tablet computer. The YOQ online system then generates reports to provide clinicians with systematic feedback about client progress, flagging &quot;critical items&quot; that have been endorsed (e.g., suicidality, hallucinations), presenting graphs of ratings over time, and providing empirically-derived &quot;alerts&quot; when clients are failing to progress or showing deterioration. Clinicians will be trained to use this feedback to modify treatment as needed, share it with families as appropriate, and use it to enhance use of supervision.&#xD;
Treatment as Usual: Clinicians assigned to the TAU condition will be instructed to use whatever treatment methods and outcome monitoring strategies they typically use with adolescents with internalizing disorders.</description>
