      The primary goal is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of T-DM1&#xD;
      and non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients previously&#xD;
      treated with taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pharmacokinetic data on the combination of T-DM1 and lyposomal doxorubicin will&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;

      Subjects: Age ≥ 18 years with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that have relapsed or&#xD;
      progressed on or after taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy. Subjects must have histologic&#xD;
      or cytologic confirmation of the HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Evidence of&#xD;
      measurable or evaluable metastatic disease is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of T-DM1 and&#xD;
           non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients&#xD;
           previously treated with taxanes and trastuzumab-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin, defined by the overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR),&#xD;
           number of progressions and number and reasons for deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin, defined by all toxicities reported during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cardiac safety of the combination of T-DM1 and non-pegylated liposomal&#xD;
           doxorubicin measured by LVEF as assessed by echocardiography, cardiac troponin I and&#xD;
           B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the potential role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the&#xD;
           predisposition for developing cardiotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To analyze the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of T-DM1 and its metabolites and&#xD;
           non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: This is a prospective dose-finding, multicenter and open-label phase I&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) will be administered at a fixed dose of 3.6 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      on Day 1 every 3 weeks and three cohorts of patients with three different dose levels of&#xD;
      conventional non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (45 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2 and 60 mg/m2) IV on Day&#xD;
      1 in cycles of 21 days each are planned.&#xD;
