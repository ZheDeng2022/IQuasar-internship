      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to explore why acute pain turns, in some patients, into chronic pain,&#xD;
      and to develop tools for prediction of this transition. Based on the clinical and&#xD;
      psychological assessment along with psychophysical and neurophysiological assessment of pain&#xD;
      perception, with the analysis of connectivity between several brain centers relevant for pain&#xD;
      processing, together with pain genetics, we expect to develop a tool, that will predict, for&#xD;
      the individual patient with acute pain inflicted by a whiplash injury, what are the chances&#xD;
      for him/her to go into chronic pain situation. Further, by knowing the dysfunctions of pain&#xD;
      processing that a patient has, it will be possible to offer the treatment of highest chances&#xD;
      to succeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are to evaluate, in the setup of acute whiplash injury, the risk of&#xD;
      transition to chronic pain based on each of the following testing domains: (i) Psychophysical&#xD;
      and neurophysiological data describing facilitatory and inhibitory modulation capacity of the&#xD;
      patient. (ii) Psychological data describing patient's behavior such as catastrophyzing, fear&#xD;
      of pain, post-traumatic stress and depressed mood. (iii) Structural and functional&#xD;
      neuro-imaging data describing brain anatomy and function, where we assess resting state MRI&#xD;
      activity, grey matter properties using T1 weighted imaging, and white matter properties using&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging. (iv) Genetic data describing the genetic epidemiology of every&#xD;
      patient for the examination of genetic variants associated with transition to chronic pain,&#xD;
      and (v) individual case data related to age, gender, education, socioeconomic parameters and&#xD;
      personal medical history, as well as features of the specific injury. Overall, we aim to&#xD;
      construct a composite scoring system, based on the most relevant of the above mentioned&#xD;
      parameters, yielding the highest relative predictive value in identifying acute pain patients&#xD;
      who have higher risk for chronification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects One hundred and twenty healthy subjects (range 20-79; 20 subjects per age decade, 10&#xD;
      M and 10 F) will participate in the first phase of the study aimed to collect normative data&#xD;
      from healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven hundred and fifty acute whiplash-injury based mild TBI will participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Phase I - Normative data collection for the inhibitory and excitatory pain&#xD;
      modulation responses, a study on healthy subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II - Multi-modal assessment of acute mild TBI whiplash patients and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial experimental assessment, will consist, in most cases, of two sessions, one&#xD;
           during the ER visit, and the next within 72 hrs of injury, pending on team and device&#xD;
           availability, such that all tests will be completed, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Physical examination with a full neurological exam, and assessment of neck&#xD;
                movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Psychophysical pain measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Pain thresholds. ii. Suprathreshold pain magnitude estimation; iii. Mechanical TS and&#xD;
           electrical TS iv. CPM - as described for the phase I protocol. It is noted that similar&#xD;
           protocols of pain measurement are commonly performed in many labs worldwide in many&#xD;
           acute and chronic pain setups, and are considered safe, with no damaging effect on the&#xD;
           disease state.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Psychological examination via filling questionnaires for evaluation the following&#xD;
           variables: i. Pain Catastrophizing ii. Depression iii. Post-traumatic Diagnostic Scale&#xD;
           (PDS) iv. Fear of pain v. The perceived stress of the subjects is assessed by the&#xD;
           validated Hebrew version Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           vi. Five factor model (FFM)&#xD;
&#xD;
           d.Blood collection for genetics. Whole blood sample (10cc) will be collected from each&#xD;
           subject and placed in EDTA-coated tubes. Genomic DNA will be isolated using DNA&#xD;
           Extraction Kit . Quality and quantity of the DNA sample will be measured using a&#xD;
           NanoDrop Machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. MRI/fMRI examination in a 3T scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           f. Neurophysiological assessment of pain modulation with 64-channel EEG recording (Brain&#xD;
           Products GmbH, Munich, Germany) of CPM and TS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i.Neurophysiological assessment of CPM ii.Neurophysiololgical assessment of TS will be&#xD;
           based on electrical evoked potentials obtained with a constant current stimulator&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow up Patients will self-report their pain levels and use of analgesics once in two&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 and 12 month visits patients will be invited to repeat the psychophysical and&#xD;
      neurophysiological pain assessments and psychological questionnaires. Selected patients will&#xD;
      undergo a second MRI assessment.&#xD;
