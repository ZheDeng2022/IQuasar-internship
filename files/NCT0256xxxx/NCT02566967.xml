    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the optimal dose of tofacitinib needed to achieve low disease&#xD;
      activity (LDA) or clinical remission as measured by the CDAI score. Once LDA or clinical&#xD;
      remission has been achieved, the structural benefit in reducing erosions, synovitis and bone&#xD;
      edema as measured by low field MRI will be determined at the same time period by the use of&#xD;
      the OMERACT/RAMRIS scoring system&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the optimal dose of tofacitinib needed to achieve low disease&#xD;
      activity (LDA) or clinical remission as measured by the CDAI score. Once LDA or clinical&#xD;
      remission has been achieved, the structural benefit in reducing erosions, synovitis and bone&#xD;
      edema as measured by low field MRI will be determined at the same time period by the use of&#xD;
      the OMERACT/RAMRIS scoring system and correlated to the clinical findings. The target for&#xD;
      each patient will be determined at the time of study entry depending on the degree of disease&#xD;
      activity of the individual patient. This is based on the understanding that LDA is an&#xD;
      acceptable goal in certain patients with long standing disease or high disease activity. If&#xD;
      the patient reaches LDA while taking tofacitinib at a 5 mg b.i.d. dose, the patient will be&#xD;
      given the opportunity to have the dose increased to 10 mg b.i.d. in the hopes of reaching&#xD;
      clinical remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two treat to target goals: Clinical Remission as defined by a CDAI score of &lt;2.8&#xD;
      for those patients who entered the study with a CDAI score of &lt;22 and Low Disease Activity&#xD;
      (LDA) as defined by a CDAI score of &lt;10 for those who entered the study with a CDAI score of&#xD;
      &gt; 22.&#xD;
