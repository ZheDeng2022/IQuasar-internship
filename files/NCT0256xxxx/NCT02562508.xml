    <textblock>
      This is a bridging trial of the recombinant HPV 16/18 bivalent vaccine manufactured by Xiamen&#xD;
      Innovax Biotech CO., LTD.The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity (type specific IgG antibody) and safety of the tested vaccine administered in&#xD;
      girls aged 9-17 years is non-inferior to young healthy adults of 18-26 years according to the&#xD;
      standard 3-dose schedule (0,1,6 months). Meanwhile, this study tries to compare the&#xD;
      difference of safety and immunogenicity among different schedules (0-6m vs 0-1-6m).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Totally 750 healthy girls of 9-17 years and 225 healthy young women of 18-26 years were&#xD;
      enrolled. The subjects of 9-14 years will be stratified into 2 subset. Subjects in each&#xD;
      subsets will be randomly assigned into the standard 0-1-6m schedule group or an alternative&#xD;
      0-6m group. All subjects of 15-26 years of age will receive the standard 0-1-6m schedule.&#xD;
      Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for 1 month after each injection.&#xD;
      Severe adverse events during the trial were followed up. Serum samples from all the subjects&#xD;
      would be collected on day 0, 6m, 7m to evaluate the immunogenicity.&#xD;
