      The primary goal of this study is to determine experimentally the relationship between&#xD;
      affective response to exercise and future exercise behavior. A secondary goal is to examine&#xD;
      potential mediators and moderators of this relationship, specifically four variables&#xD;
      considered to contribute to the volitional control of exercise behavior - planning,&#xD;
      attention, resource commitment, and affect regulation. An additional goal is to examine how&#xD;
      symptoms of depression might influence the affective response to exercise, and the&#xD;
      relationship between affective response to exercise and exercise behavior.&#xD;

      The specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. The first aim is to determine the effectiveness of an experimental manipulation of&#xD;
      individuals' affective response to a laboratory-supervised bout of exercise corresponding to&#xD;
      a vigorous intensity (just below the ventilatory threshold), compared to a control condition&#xD;
      that simply measures individuals' natural affective response to exercise. The investigators&#xD;
      will specifically determine the effect of this manipulation on anticipated, experienced and&#xD;
      remembered affective response to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. The second aim is to examine individuals' adherence to an exercise prescription over&#xD;
      the course of one week that asks them to exercise daily on their own for twenty minutes at&#xD;
      the same intensity (as indicated by a heart rate monitor) as the laboratory-supervised&#xD;
      exercise session, and to determine whether adherence to this prescription is greater for&#xD;
      those who expect exercise to lead to positive affect than those who expect exercise to lead&#xD;
      to negative affect, as compared to a control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. The third aim is to examine potential mediators and moderators of the relationship&#xD;
      between anticipated affect and subsequent exercise behavior, including volitional control of&#xD;
      exercise, affect regulation ability, and symptoms of depression.&#xD;
