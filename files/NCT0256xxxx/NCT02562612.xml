      The purpose of this study is to collect response and pharmacokinetic data on the oral&#xD;
      administration of a cocktail combination of 4 drugs being developed for the indication of&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to assess the response rate and PFS in&#xD;
      previously treated breast cancer patients. Additional objectives include the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of multiple ascending doses of SM-88, a cocktail combination of 4 drugs being developed for&#xD;
      the indication of metastatic breast cancer. Secondary objectives of this study include an&#xD;
      assessment of safety and tolerability of ascending doses of orally administered SM-88.&#xD;
      Additional response data will also be collected.&#xD;
