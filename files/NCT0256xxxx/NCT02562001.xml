  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The spinal cord injury is identified as the major cause of permanent disability worldwide,&#xD;
      with the loss of ability to walk being the largest and most devastating of them for these&#xD;
      patients. Our goal is to analyze the effects of electrical transcranial direct-current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) combined with gait training with partial body weight support aided by&#xD;
      robotic device (Lokomat, Hocoma) in the gait of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI). In this stratified randomized double-blind study, the participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into one of both groups, outpatients (GA) or inpatients (GI), and will receive&#xD;
      active or placebo tDCS followed by gait training with Lokomat (GA: 3 sessions/week x 10 weeks&#xD;
      = 30 sessions; GI: 5 sessions/week x 6 weeks = 30 sessions). The functional assessments&#xD;
      (through clinical and functional scales, assess gait, muscle strength, spasticity, balance&#xD;
      and pain) and neurophysiological (cortical excitability measured by transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation, electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy) will be held&#xD;
      before and after the training period. The functional assessments will be also held after 15&#xD;
      sessions (intermediate) and after 3 months follow up. The expected result is that patients&#xD;
      that received the active tDCS presents an improvement over the ground gait after the Lokomat&#xD;
      training period significantly greater than the placebo group, with relations between&#xD;
      neurophysiologic, kinematics and functional measurements.&#xD;

      The spinal cord injury is identified as the major cause of permanent disability worldwide,&#xD;
      with the loss of ability to walk being the largest and most devastating of them for these&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, our goal is to analyze the effects of the treatment with electrical&#xD;
      transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) associated with gait training with partial&#xD;
      body weight support aided by robotic device (Lokomat, Hocoma) in the gait of patients with&#xD;
      incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) classified as AIS C and D. In this stratified randomized&#xD;
      double-blind study, the participants will be randomly allocated into one of both groups,&#xD;
      outpatients (GA) or inpatients (GI), and will receive active or placebo tDCS followed by gait&#xD;
      training with Lokomat (GA: 3 sessions/week x 10 weeks = 30 sessions; GI: 5 sessions/week x 6&#xD;
      weeks = 30 sessions). The functional assessments (through clinical and functional scales,&#xD;
      assess gait, muscle strength, spasticity, balance and pain) and neurophysiological (cortical&#xD;
      excitability measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation, electroencephalography and&#xD;
      functional near-infrared spectroscopy) will be held before and after the training period. The&#xD;
      functional assessments will be also held after 15 sessions (intermediate) and after 3 months&#xD;
      follow up. The expected result is that patients that received the active (tDCS) presents an&#xD;
      improvement over the ground gait after the Lokomat training period, significantly greater&#xD;
      than the placebo group, with positive correlation between neurophysiologic, kinematics and&#xD;
      functional measurements.&#xD;
