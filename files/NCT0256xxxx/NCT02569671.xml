  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, controlled, multi-center study is to assess the clinical and&#xD;
      radiographic outcomes of using a Straumann® Bone Level Tapered implant for immediate&#xD;
      implantation following extraction of a tooth in the pre-molar and anterior region of the&#xD;
      maxilla and mandible (test) compared to the outcomes of placing this implant in healed sites&#xD;
      (control).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that the change in mean peri-implant marginal bone&#xD;
      level changes (mesial and distal) from loading to 12 months post-loading of the test&#xD;
      treatment will not be worse than the control treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess differences in clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      outcomes between the test and control treatments at 12 months post-loading by looking at&#xD;
      implant success and survival, buccal bone dimensional changes, implant stability, soft tissue&#xD;
      changes, subject satisfaction, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional objective is to assess long-term differences in clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      outcomes, as measured in the primary and secondary objectives, over the span of two, three,&#xD;
      four, and five years.&#xD;
