  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, controlled, outpatient two-period, two-treatment crossover&#xD;
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amifampridine phosphate in patients&#xD;
      (ages 2 and above) diagnosed with certain genetic subtypes of CMS and demonstrated open label&#xD;
      (amifampridine phosphate) or history of sustained amifampridine benefit from treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will participate in an open-label unblinded drug escalation/treatment run-in&#xD;
      phase for up to 4 weeks until stable dose and frequency of amifampridine phosphate is&#xD;
      achieved for 7 days. After this phase, blinded treatment effect will be assessed in a&#xD;
      randomized fashion of continuation or cessation of drug (Placebo) starting with Period I&#xD;
      (duration 7 days). Following experimental Period 1, patients will be returned to the stable&#xD;
      dose administered at the end of the open-label run-in period for approximately 2 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by cross over treatment in Period 2 dosing for 7 days. After completion of Period 2,&#xD;
      patients will be eligible for expanded access with restoration of open-label amifampridine&#xD;
      phosphate at the same dose and frequency as established in the run in phase of the study.&#xD;

    <description>Subject Global Impression (SGI) rates the subject's impression of the effects of the study medication during the preceding week with max score =7 (most satisfied) and min score =1 (least satisfied). It will be completed at D0 (baseline for Study Period 1), D8, D21 (baseline for Study Period 2), and D29. Change from baseline (CFB) will be assessed for Study Period 1 (difference in SGI score from D0 to D8), Study Period 2 (difference in SGI score from D21 to D29) and the change in CFB from Study Period 1 to Study Period 2 (difference between CFB during Study Period 1 and CFB during Study Period 2). A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for equality of the CFB results in the two treatments in Period 1 and for the equality of the CFB results in the two treatment sequences will be conducted. A mixed effects liner model will be fit with the SGI raw scores as a response and study arm, treatment, period, age group and mutation type as fixed effect terms and patient as a random effect.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Screening ensured patients met I/E criteria. Patients naÃ¯ve to amifampridine began open-label titration until a stable dose and frequency was achieved for 7 days. Demonstrated efficacy (assessed by improvement on the MFM) was required to participate in the randomized portion of the study. Patients already on a stable dose with hostory of meaningful improvement were eligible immediately and transitioned to an equivalent dose of amifampridine phosphate for 7 days prior to randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

Dosing will be between 20 - 80 mg per day and frequency will be between 2-4 times per day.&#xD;
Amifampridine Phosphate: Amifampridine phosphate tablets 10 mg will be provided in round, white-scored tablets, and containing amifampridine phosphate formulated to be the equivalent of 10 mg amifampridine base per tablet.&#xD;
Placebo: A placebo equivalent will be provided as tablets indistinguishable from the amifampridine phosphate tablets. The placebo will be administered consistent with the dose regimen of amifampridine phosphate.</description>

        <description>Subject Global Impression (SGI) rates the subject's impression of the effects of the study medication during the preceding week with max score =7 (most satisfied) and min score =1 (least satisfied). It will be completed at D0 (baseline for Study Period 1), D8, D21 (baseline for Study Period 2), and D29. Change from baseline (CFB) will be assessed for Study Period 1 (difference in SGI score from D0 to D8), Study Period 2 (difference in SGI score from D21 to D29) and the change in CFB from Study Period 1 to Study Period 2 (difference between CFB during Study Period 1 and CFB during Study Period 2). A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for equality of the CFB results in the two treatments in Period 1 and for the equality of the CFB results in the two treatment sequences will be conducted. A mixed effects liner model will be fit with the SGI raw scores as a response and study arm, treatment, period, age group and mutation type as fixed effect terms and patient as a random effect.</description>

        <description>Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) evaluates the severity and progression of motor function in patients 7 years of age or older with max total score = 96 (best score) and min total score =0 (worst score). It will be completed at D0 (baseline for Study Period 1), D8, D21 (baseline for Study Period 2) and D29. CFB will be assessed for Study Period 1 (difference in MFM-32 from D0 to D8), Study Period 2 (difference in MFM-32 from D21 to D28) and the change in CFB from Study Period 1 to Study Period 2 (difference between CFB during Study Period 1 and CFB during Study Period 2). A Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for equality of CFB results in the two treatments in Period 1 and for the equality of the CFB results in the two treatment sequences will be conducted. A mixed effects linear model will be fit to the overall MFM-32 score as the response variable and fixed effect terms for treatment, period, age group, genetic mutation type, and sequence*period and a random effect for patient.</description>
