  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether diet and the gut microbiome play a role in&#xD;
      spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), namely delivery of the fetus prior to 37 weeks gestation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While dietary guidelines about intake of specific nutrients in pregnant women are&#xD;
      well-established, surprisingly little is known about dietary eating patterns or nutritional&#xD;
      risk factors for SPTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In data from two large nationally-representative European studies, SPTB was predicted by a&#xD;
      western diet, a finding confirmed by a smaller cohort in Australia. In a small cohort in&#xD;
      Poland, intake of short- and medium-chain fatty acids was lower in women who had SPTB, and&#xD;
      the placental-fetal transport of fatty acids was significantly different in SPTB cases.&#xD;
      Furthermore, more than a single serving daily of either artificially-sweetened or&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages was also linked to SPTB. Low blood biomarker levels of antioxidant&#xD;
      nutrients (ascorbic, vitamin E)7 and nutrients with an established anti-inflammatory role in&#xD;
      health (omega 3 fatty acids,8 vitamin D9-11) have been suggested as potential nutrient&#xD;
      modulators of SPTB. While these are very interesting findings, they do not explain whether&#xD;
      these food patterns prevail in an urban U.S. population or why SPTB occurs. Furthermore, none&#xD;
      of these potentially modifiable diet associations has been examined in the context of the&#xD;
      entire series of physiological systems operating during pregnancy, namely diet, the gut&#xD;
      microbiome, maternal plasma metabolome, placenta, and cord blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is biological rationale to assume that dietary components could modify the gut&#xD;
      microbiome and the maternal plasma metabolome during pregnancy. Artificial sweeteners induce&#xD;
      glucose intolerance through an alternation in the gut microbiota. Chronic ingestion of&#xD;
      sugar-sweetened beverages also results in similar plasma metabolic abnormalities (gut&#xD;
      microbiome measures were not reported). In animal models of high fat diet feeding (similar to&#xD;
      western diet), addition of N3FA ameliorated the gut dysbiosis and reduced endotoxin&#xD;
      production. Furthermore, in healthy volunteers, the investigators have recently linked&#xD;
      typical dietary intake patterns with the gut microbiome. Dietary patterns of high protein and&#xD;
      animal fat intake were predominantly associated with Bacteroides enterotypes, while&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake was associated with Prevotella. While the microbiome composition changes&#xD;
      rapidly after change in diet, the enterotype identity is resilient over time. The&#xD;
      investigators followed these findings with another study comparing the extreme diets of&#xD;
      vegans (no animal products) to the more typical mixed western diet pattern of omnivores, and&#xD;
      extended the analytical approaches to include assessment of the plasma metabolome. By&#xD;
      observing the microbiome and metabolome, the investigators were clearly able to distinguish&#xD;
      with 91% accuracy whether a subject was vegan or omnivore. Furthermore, the investigators&#xD;
      could determine metabolomic characteristics that were contributed by gut bacterial&#xD;
      metabolism, but only in subjects with high plant food intake. These findings in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers raise the possibility that gut microbial populations could interact with maternal&#xD;
      tissues or plasma to produce an inflammatory state that might result in preterm parturition.&#xD;
      Indeed, the alteration of the gut microbiota observed in the third trimester of pregnancy and&#xD;
      its effects on host metabolism are supportive of this notion.&#xD;

        Pregnant women will be recruited from three locations: Penn ObGyn Associates, Helen O.&#xD;
        Dickens Clinic, and Maternal Fetal Medicine at 2000 Courtyard. Potential subjects will be&#xD;
        identified from clinical schedules and will be pre-screened in EPIC for eligibility. They&#xD;
        may be approached during a clinical visit, or the research team may call them prior to or&#xD;
        after a scheduled visit to introduce the study. Women can be enrolled anytime between the&#xD;
        confirmation of pregnancy and 24 weeks/0 days gestation. For convenience, research visits&#xD;
        can be conducted at the time of a scheduled clinical visit, or at a separate time.&#xD;
