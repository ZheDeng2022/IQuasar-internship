      Among Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) the rupture of the Achilles tendon is the most common.&#xD;
      Up today, the mechanical and elastic properties of the Achilles tendon are still unknown, and&#xD;
      that both in healthy subjects in pathology. The viscoelastic properties or dynamic mechanical&#xD;
      properties are directly related to the tendon of the health status and its elongation&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory UMR Inserm U930 - CNRS ERL 3106 in Tours has developed a non-invasive&#xD;
      ultrasonic device, named Achillus, which, via an ultrasonic probe, allowing to access the&#xD;
      viscoelastic properties of the tendon during the contraction of the sural triceps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is what we want to do in this first protocol: in vivo observation of the normal values&#xD;
      and variations, looking for changes related to hyper solicitation and finally trying to&#xD;
      highlight a tendon fragility parameter for patients who have experienced of a Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are among the main causes of pain and disability in adults.&#xD;
      Tendon disorders are an important part of MSD. Among them, the rupture of the Achilles tendon&#xD;
      is the most common, with a prevalence of about 18 to 100000. The disorder mostly affects men&#xD;
      between 30 and 50 years. Up today, the mechanical and elastic properties of the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon are still unknown, and that both in healthy subjects in pathology. The viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties or dynamic mechanical properties are directly related to the tendon of the health&#xD;
      status and its elongation capacity. Additional tests that we have to explore the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon are ultrasound and MRI. They bring mainly morphological information but can not&#xD;
      demonstrate the mechanical properties of the tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the laboratory UMR Inserm U930 - CNRS ERL 3106 in Tours has developed a&#xD;
      non-invasive ultrasonic device, named Achillus, which, via an ultrasonic probe, allowing to&#xD;
      access the viscoelastic properties of the tendon during the contraction of the sural triceps.&#xD;
      It is therefore important in the exploratory work we propose to have a proven method of&#xD;
      calibration of forces applied to the tendon, which is why an ergometer laboratory&#xD;
      biomechanics and bioengineering at UT Compiègne is associated with our experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No human study has yet been conducted to evaluate this method in medically relevant&#xD;
      situations such as hyper solicitation and incorporated rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is what we want to do in this first protocol: in vivo observation of the normal values&#xD;
      and variations, looking for changes related to hyper solicitation and finally trying to&#xD;
      highlight a tendon fragility parameter for patients who have experienced of a Achilles tendon&#xD;
      rupture.&#xD;
