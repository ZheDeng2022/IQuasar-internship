    <textblock>
      Platelets are increasingly recognized as a potent and ubiquitously present source of&#xD;
      inflammatory activation. Importantly, antiplatelet therapy has been shown to significantly&#xD;
      reduce major adverse events such as renal injury in cardiac surgery patients. However, in&#xD;
      current practice, concerns of excessive bleeding-not platelet activation and thrombosis-shape&#xD;
      clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have recently seen, that a significant drop in platelet numbers following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is associated with increased mortality and risk of acute kidney injury. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that such thrombocytopenia is a result of excessive perioperative&#xD;
      platelet activation and resultant release of inflammatory and tissue injurious signals by&#xD;
      activated platelets. Platelet activation will be characterized during and after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and examine its correlation with inflammatory responses and perioperative end-organ&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distant organ injury is a frequent consequence of cardiovascular surgery involving&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary bypass. Acute kidney injury (AKI), the most common complication, occurs in&#xD;
      30%-40% of cardiac surgery patients and, even with moderate damage, significantly increases&#xD;
      mortality and healthcare costs. Although organ injury has been linked to inflammation, the&#xD;
      mechanisms that initiate and propagate these events remain poorly defined. As the median age&#xD;
      and medical complexity of cardiac patients increases, the challenge - and opportunity - to&#xD;
      improve organ protection lies in identifying modifiable targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators preliminary work provides primary evidence that activated platelets play a&#xD;
      novel role in the initiation of tissue injurious and inflammatory responses at the&#xD;
      microvascular interface. As such, platelets aggregate in close proximity to perivascular mast&#xD;
      cells, a cell type that can rapidly launch powerful inflammatory responses through release of&#xD;
      preformed effectors. Platelet activation alone is sufficient to stimulate these mast cells in&#xD;
      vitro while, conversely, pharmacological inhibition of platelets reduce mast cell-dependent&#xD;
      inflammation and end organ injury after rat circulatory arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on compelling experimental data and evidence of human relevance, the investigators have&#xD;
      formed our central hypothesis that platelet activation is an important trigger of&#xD;
      inflammatory and tissue injurious responses after cardiopulmonary bypass through stimulation&#xD;
      of perivascular mast cells. The objective is to define the pathophysiologic relevance of the&#xD;
      platelet/mast cell interaction to end organ injury, and to identify targets for novel&#xD;
      strategies of organ protection in cardiac surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: Define platelet activation as a risk factor for end organ injury in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators preliminary data strongly suggest that thrombocytopenia after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery is linked to AKI and increased mortality. In a prospective study of 100 patients&#xD;
      undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CAGB) surgery, the investigators will define&#xD;
      platelet activation and consumption as the likely cause of this thrombocytopenia, and&#xD;
      establish the association between platelet activation in general with markers of mast cell&#xD;
      activation, systemic inflammation, and AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this aim is to investigate the link between perioperative platelet&#xD;
      activation, systemic inflammatory responses, and adverse end organ outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a prospective observational study of 100 patients to&#xD;
      investigate the link between perioperative platelet activation, systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      responses, and end organ injury following cardiac surgery. Patient inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      this study will be based on the results from our retrospective study of 4201 patients&#xD;
      undergoing CABG surgery on CPB. Here, the investigators identified a significant incidence of&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and an association between thrombocytopenia and increased risk for&#xD;
      developing postoperative AKI. Consequently, the proposed study is designed to determine&#xD;
      whether postoperative platelet activation contributes to a systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      and, hence, has a causative effect on end organ injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and processing: 15 mL of venous blood will be drawn into ACD buffer before&#xD;
      incision and at 10 minutes, and 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after separation from cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: The investigators will analyze serum platelet markers by enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the characteristic changes in membrane protein expression by&#xD;
      multicolor Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Corresponding platelet counts will be&#xD;
      determined at each time point. Aspirin medication is given until the day of surgery and again&#xD;
      starting on postoperative day 2 as standard of care. Because aspirin resistance may influence&#xD;
      our outcomes, the investigators will measure 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 urine levels. Ensuing&#xD;
      subgroup analysis will establish the relevance of aspirin resistance to our observations.&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation will be examined by determining the plasma cytokine levels by ELISA. As&#xD;
      an additional arm of investigation the investigators will collect patient DNA and platelet&#xD;
      RNA to further examine the genomic characteristics and platelet gene expression profiles&#xD;
      associated with an enhanced platelet activation during surgery. This data will inform further&#xD;
      studies in personalized identification of risk factors for patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: AKI is a clinically relevant manifestation of end organ injury and will&#xD;
      serve as our primary outcome. With an incidence of 30%-40% following cardiac surgery, the&#xD;
      investigators expect to observe a sufficient number of cases of AKI to allow adequate&#xD;
      statistical analysis. The investigators will define AKI according to Kidney Disease:&#xD;
      Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria and record AKI using both the proposed stages and&#xD;
      the change in serum creatinine values from 3 days before to 10 days after the surgery date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: The investigators will measure cytokine expression and platelet&#xD;
      activation as secondary outcomes. Further, the investigators will also collect established&#xD;
      measures of clinical outcome such as hospital length of stay, ICU length of stay, duration of&#xD;
      postoperative mechanical ventilation, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as&#xD;
      all-cause mortality, emergent revascularization, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and non-fatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient characteristics and numbers, power-analysis, and patient Data collection: Variables&#xD;
      will be recorded from patient files: 1) preoperatively: age, gender, race, Society of&#xD;
      Thoracic Surgery risk factors, EUROScore, date of consent, and preoperative drugs; 2)&#xD;
      intraoperatively: number of coronary artery bypass grafts, duration of cardio-pulmonary&#xD;
      bypass, duration of aortic cross clamp, cumulative dose of heparin administered, blood&#xD;
      products, and cumulative dose of sympathomimetic and vasopressor drugs; 3) postoperatively:&#xD;
      timing of complications, cause and timing of death, hospital and ICU length of stay, duration&#xD;
      of postoperative mechanical ventilation, dose of inotropic or vasoactive support. Plate-let&#xD;
      count and creatinine levels, as well as anti-platelet therapy will be recorded from 3 days&#xD;
      be-fore to 10 days after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes. In this Aim, the investigators expect to provide new insights into the&#xD;
      origins of systemic inflammation and end organ injury following cardiac surgery. Our&#xD;
      preliminary data indicate that postoperative thrombopenia is associated with AKI and&#xD;
      mortality. The investigators expect to demonstrate that such thrombocytopenia occurs in a&#xD;
      setting of ongoing platelet activation and is associated with systemic inflammation and,&#xD;
      ultimately, end organ injury. Together, these investigations will lay the foundation for&#xD;
      novel organ protection strategies in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. Descriptive comparisons will be made by using Kruskal-Wallis test or&#xD;
      chi-square test, as appropriate. Univariable and multivariable linear or logistic regression&#xD;
      analyses will be applied, as appropriate, to evaluate the association between the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes and pre-, intra-, and postoperative variables. R2 for linear regression&#xD;
      analyses, odds ratios, and the corresponding 95% confidence limits for logistic regression&#xD;
      analyses will be re-ported.&#xD;
