  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of riociguat at age-, sex- and body-weight-adjusted doses of 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg,&#xD;
      1.5 mg, 2.0 mg and 2.5 mg TID in children from ≥6 to less than 18 years with pulmonary&#xD;
      arterial hypertension (PAH) group 1. The study design consisted of a main study part followed&#xD;
      by an optional long-term extension part. The main treatment period consisted of two phases:&#xD;
      titration phase up to 8 weeks and a maintenance phase up to 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE), including AE in relation to a medical device (i.e. Raumedic dosing pipette), is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose is resulting in death, is lifethreatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. AEs occurring between start of study drug and up to 2 days after the last dose were defined as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs).</description>

&#xD;
        Regardless of the type of PAH, the following findings are not exclusionary:&#xD;
&#xD;

        hemodynamic alterations indicative of significant shunt, e.g. Qp/Qs ratio less &lt;1.5:1 are&#xD;
        not exclusionary&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PAH diagnosed by right heart catheterization (RHC) at any time prior to enrolment (for&#xD;
             patients with closed shunts - RHC no less than 4 months after surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PAH confirmed by a RHC at any time prior to start of study, with mean pulmonary artery&#xD;

The RA area index is a reflection of RA volume at end-diastole. The change in the index should not be understood solely but associated with other conditions of the participants.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE), including AE in relation to a medical device (i.e. Raumedic dosing pipette), is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose is resulting in death, is lifethreatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. AEs occurring between start of study drug and up to 2 days after the last dose were defined as treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs).</description>

        <description>SF-10 is a parent-completed health survey for children that contains 10 questions adapted from the Child Health Questionnaire. It is scored using nom-based scoring to produce physical and psychosocial health summary measures. The possible range for the physical measure is -10.9 to 57.2 scores and the possible range for the psychosocial measure is 8.8 to 62.3 scores. Higher scores indicate more favorable functioning.</description>

Responses of the questions are transformed to a 0-100 scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>

        <title>Taste and Texture (Question 7) of the Oral Suspension of Riociguat in Mouth at Week 0</title>
        <description>To assess the taste and texture of oral suspension of Riociguat, a questionnaire including 7 questions was used. Number of participants per responses to Questions 7 &quot;Did you like the taste after swallowing&quot; is reported in this endpoint. Question 7 was only asked to participants who answered &quot;No&quot; to Question 3 &quot;Did you like the drink&quot; or Question 4 &quot;Would you like to drink this again&quot;. Participants were asked to respond as &quot;yes&quot; (= positive answer), &quot;I do not know/unsure&quot;(= indifferent answer) or &quot;No&quot; (= negative answer).</description>
