      The primary aims of the SOCQER-2 study are to describe any impact on short (6 weeks), medium&#xD;
      term (6, 12 months) and long term (18 months, 24 months) PRO/quality of life using validated&#xD;
      questionnaires in patients undergoing standard or extensive surgery for suspected or&#xD;
      confirmed Stage III/IV ovarian cancer and to describe progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cornerstones of treatment for advanced ovarian cancer are surgical cytoreduction and&#xD;
      systemic therapy. The aim of surgery is the maximal cytoreduction of all visible disease,&#xD;
      ideally reaching a total macroscopic tumour clearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst most gynaecological oncologists accept that surgical procedures needed to achieve&#xD;
      complete cytoreduction are on a continuum, a Cochrane review summarises types of ovarian&#xD;
      cancer surgery as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  standard surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radical surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  supra-[ultra-] radical surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several observational studies and two systematic reviews of non-randomised studies have shown&#xD;
      an association between the amount of residual disease following surgery and survival,&#xD;
      controlling for various confounding factors. However, the systematic reviews identified no&#xD;
      randomised control trials directly comparing standard surgery versus extensive surgery. A&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Interventional Procedures Overview&#xD;
      found a number of retrospective observational studies comparing extensive with standard&#xD;
      surgery, and found that women who underwent extensive surgery had better survival to those&#xD;
      undergoing standard surgery, thus suggesting that the utilisation of surgical procedures to&#xD;
      achieve complete cytoreduction may overcome disease aggressiveness. Incidence of serious&#xD;
      complications, however, was higher in patients undergoing extensive surgery. However, there&#xD;
      were several confounding factors e.g patients with good performance status are more likely to&#xD;
      be selected to undergo extensive surgery. Equally, patients with lesser disease burden can&#xD;
      have complete removal of tumour by standard surgery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane review comparing outcomes from ultra-radical surgery versus standard concluded it&#xD;
      was unclear whether there were differences in progression free survival, quality of life and&#xD;
      morbidity, and that a randomised control trial with sufficient statistical power or&#xD;
      well-designed non-randomised studies were needed. Equally important are outcomes other than&#xD;
      survival that are valued by and very pertinent to patients and their carers. To date, there&#xD;
      have been no methodologically robust studies evaluating Quality of life (Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes) in patients undergoing extensive surgery to achieve tumour clearance. Patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes are multidimensional health related quality of life measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will builds upon a single site pilot study, evaluating short and medium term&#xD;
      Patient reported Outcomes (PRO) at the Pan Birmingham gynaecological cancer centre. SOCQER-1&#xD;
      compared PRO Outcomes in 64 women with ovarian cancer, of whom 24 had extensive surgery;&#xD;
      SOCQER-1 found no statistically significant difference in PRO in women undergoing standard or&#xD;
      extensive surgery for ovarian cancer by 9 months postoperative period - however the&#xD;
      limitations of a small sample size and a single centre study should be noted. SOCQER-2 will&#xD;
      provide longer term PRO Outcomes and survival on a larger cohort undergoing extensive surgery&#xD;
      and will capture variation in practice by centres. SOCQER-2 will provide good quality&#xD;
      prospective evidence on the impact of extensive surgery on Quality of life and survival in&#xD;
      patients with ovarian cancer in large, multiple UK gynaecological cancer centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Patients will be identified at MDT/at clinic and approached during subsequent&#xD;
      contact. A team member from the participating centres will provide an information leaflet,&#xD;
      explain and obtain informed consent. Sites have the option of sending patient information&#xD;
      sheets by post and patients also have the option of consenting by post. This study is&#xD;
      intended to be an exploratory study. The underlying hypothesis being tested is whether&#xD;
      patients undergoing extensive surgery have a 13% reduction (considered clinically significant&#xD;
      difference) in Quality of life as compared to patients with a similar cancer burden at 6&#xD;
      months postoperative timepoint that is balanced by a 4 month survival gain in patients in the&#xD;
      extensive surgery group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, multicentre observational cohort study. Clinical data will be&#xD;
      captured prospectively using CRFs at baseline, surgery, postoperative and 18 months outcome.&#xD;
      Patients will complete QoL questionnaires at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24&#xD;
      months postsurgery. For patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, they will also complete&#xD;
      a prechemo questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE As this study is intended to be 'exploratory', the investigators have aimed to&#xD;
      calculate a minimal sample size, with an assumption of 2:1 recruitment in extensive surgery:&#xD;
      standard surgery groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of randomised control trials found that even quality of life was a primary endpoint,&#xD;
      sample size was not always reported and that there was no consistent basis for these&#xD;
      calculations. Analysis of repeated measures quality of life data should take account of&#xD;
      missing data using an appropriate method for multiple imputation of missing items and an&#xD;
      analysis that does not assume that data are Missing Completely at Random has been&#xD;
      recommended. Therefore a mixed model is proposed for analysis of repeated measures data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding sample size for repeated measures quality of life data, common practice is to pick&#xD;
      a single time point and calculate sample based on a single difference in group means,&#xD;
      inflating sample size for dropout. This gives a conservative estimate of sample size in most&#xD;
      cases. This is the approach adopted here, as although sample size calculations based on&#xD;
      repeated measures models can be more accurate, in this case this approach is unlikely to&#xD;
      provide more accuracy, given uncertainties as to the final group sizes for this observational&#xD;
      study. The investigators assume that there will be maximal quality of life difference at 6&#xD;
      months and expect on the basis of clinical estimates that the ratio of group sizes for very&#xD;
      extensive v standard surgery of 2:1. The investigators have assumed p&lt;.05 and power of 80%.&#xD;
      It has been suggested that an evidence based medium difference in the EORTC QLC 30 is 13&#xD;
      points. The mean score in stage II-IV ovarian cancer patients at baseline in the EORTC&#xD;
      scoring manual is 56.3 (SD 24.5), while six month follow-up scores in a trial of neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      versus primary de-bulking surgery was 73.1 (SD3.0) at six months in the primary surgery arm&#xD;
      (n=201). The difference in Standard deviations may reflect the tight inclusion criteria for a&#xD;
      randomised trial, and it might be assumed that in this observational study of surgical&#xD;
      candidates would fall somewhere between the two figures. Assuming that QLC 30 at six months&#xD;
      may be lower than this average those undergoing very extensive surgery at 66, but that the&#xD;
      standard deviation is as reported in the scoring manual at 24 (likely to be a conservative&#xD;
      assumption) and that a 13 point difference would be of clinical importance, a sample size of&#xD;
      123 (group 1=41 and group 2=82) would be required, with additional allowance for dropout or a&#xD;
      comparable SD to that reported in the scoring manual (10 to 20 patients) (calculations made&#xD;
      in Stata 13.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the single centre SOCQER study, baseline EORTC QLC30 mean scores were 58.33 (SD 21.6) in&#xD;
      the standard surgery group (n=32) and 63.1 (SD 25.6) in the extensive surgery group, figures&#xD;
      broadly in line with the EORTC manual. The maximum difference between groups was 6 points in&#xD;
      favour of the extensive surgery group 6 weeks postsurgery with smaller differences in favour&#xD;
      of the standard surgery group at 3, 6 and 9 months. Although these differences did not at any&#xD;
      point reach the suggested level for an evidence based medium sized difference in quality of&#xD;
      life, given this is a single centre study which may incur selection bias between groups and&#xD;
      there were some differences in stage and residual disease between groups, a study powered&#xD;
      detection of a medium sized, rather than a small difference remains appropriate. Standard&#xD;
      deviations are higher in this study than in the Greimal trial which in part may result from&#xD;
      sample variation. Symptom scores however did show some differences which did not reach&#xD;
      statistical significance in a mixed model, with a score (higher =poorer outcome) of 35.0 (SD&#xD;
      17.0) in the extensive surgery group and 25.0 (SD 17) in the standard surgery group. While&#xD;
      symptom score should be considered secondary to quality of life, a sample size of 129 on the&#xD;
      same assumptions as above would be adequate to demonstrate this difference plus additional&#xD;
      allowance for dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although one approach to sample size calculations for subscales in RCTs involving quality of&#xD;
      life outcomes is to adjust the alpha value to allow for multiple testing, in this&#xD;
      observational study no further sample size calculations have been made as the investigators&#xD;
      acknowledge that the purpose of analysis of subscale outcomes will be hypothesis generating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this sample size does not allow for subgroup analysis, known confounders, loss to&#xD;
      follow-up, the additional heterogeneity from different patient populations and treatment&#xD;
      policies in the multiple centres in the study and, in the case of propensity score analysis,&#xD;
      loss of observations that cannot be matched during the propensity score matching stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore represents a minimum target not a maximum ceiling, and recruitment will continue&#xD;
      for the full 12 month period. Recruitment of patients will take place over the course of 12&#xD;
      months. The high volume centres (&gt;40 ovarian cancer surgeries per year) conduct an average of&#xD;
      62 surgeries per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS All statistical analysis will be conducted in Stata 13. Differences between the&#xD;
      &quot;extensive&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; groups for baseline variables will be compared using descriptive&#xD;
      statistics and statistical tests appropriate for the level of measurement and sample&#xD;
      distribution will be used. Outcome variables (composite quality of life and survival) for&#xD;
      each of the groups will also be summarised using means or percentages as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For outcome- As this is an observational study, residual confounding cannot be ruled out, and&#xD;
      reporting of results will acknowledge this. For the outcome variables measured at multiple&#xD;
      time points (specifically patient-reported quality of life), measures at each time point will&#xD;
      be described, and repeated measures models will be used to reduce the probability of type I&#xD;
      errors. Imputation techniques will be used where data on quality of life or other outcome&#xD;
      variables is missing. Propensity score analyses will also be considered if informative scores&#xD;
      and adequate matching can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will provide information on current practice and outcomes that are&#xD;
      likely to be used in national guidance, to inform future research and to provide information&#xD;
      about previous patients experience to women undergoing ovarian cancer surgery; descriptive&#xD;
      and exploratory analyses will be carried out to provide maximal information to inform policy&#xD;
      and design future research. The investigators anticipate comparing QoL and other outcomes in&#xD;
      three groups - women treated with standard surgery with no residual disease (less cancer&#xD;
      load), those treated with standard surgery with residual disease (greater cancer load) and&#xD;
      those with extensive surgery and no residual disease with greater cancer load and use of&#xD;
      surgery with the aim of overcoming this).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive analyses may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify centres performing extensive surgery and the extent of surgery performed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  associations of specific components of ovarian cancer surgery with different aspects of&#xD;
           quality of life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characteristics of patients undergoing &quot;extensive&quot; and &quot;standard&quot; therapy including&#xD;
           performance status;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  descriptions of postoperative quality of life which might indicate opportunities for&#xD;
           intervention around specific morbidities or in supportive care with the potential to&#xD;
           improve patient's quality of life.&#xD;
