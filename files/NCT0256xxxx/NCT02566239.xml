  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to maintain health and independence for&#xD;
      seniors by developing tools that collect data constantly from their home. Caregivers can then&#xD;
      use this information to make decisions about their health care, such as when an individual&#xD;
      may not be able to live independently any longer. Specific Aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To identify trends in our data that predict health decline. To serve this aim, we&#xD;
           want to test a number of tools that we have developed, such as in-home sensors, to&#xD;
           determine which ones are best at measuring health risks in seniors. After collecting&#xD;
           information for one year, we will look at which tools could be most useful to provide&#xD;
           feedback to seniors and their communities about the process of aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To develop a system for analyzing the data we collect and presenting a summary of&#xD;
           the data to care teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To validate our data and the computer-based tool in senior community settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has the potential to transform current research and clinical practice&#xD;
      paradigms of prediction and decision making about independent living. This is accomplished by&#xD;
      shifting from reliance on episodic, self-reported or crisis event provoked data to the use of&#xD;
      ecologically valid multidimensional and continuous physiological, activity, and behavioral&#xD;
      data. This approach has great potential to substantially improve care need and transition&#xD;
      decisions. In achieving this goal several innovations beyond available systems and ongoing&#xD;
      research are notable. First, grounded by prior studies associating static clinical measures&#xD;
      to future placement outcomes, we now contemporaneously and continuously will acquire&#xD;
      fundamental physiological measures (weight and walking speed), activity and behavioral&#xD;
      measures, thereby improving our ability to proactively discriminate important health and&#xD;
      functional change in real time. Using existing in-home activity data collected longitudinally&#xD;
      in an aging population combined with simulated data from additional new sensed measures&#xD;
      (phone use, medication taking, body composition) we will generate derived novel metrics -&#xD;
      AIMs - to provide objective dynamic measures of activity and behaviors that are essential to&#xD;
      maintaining independence. These metrics will be used to develop prediction algorithms based&#xD;
      on documented transition outcomes from the original data set to be used by care teams (Aim&#xD;
      1). Working care transition professionals will be iteratively queried for the refinement of&#xD;
      these objective measures (Aim 2). These care providers' expertise and understanding of key&#xD;
      changes that impact independence is invaluable to identification of ambient independence&#xD;
      measures that matter, and lead to meaningful care implementation pathways. The efficacy of&#xD;
      the final set of measures chosen and built into a user friendly interface for the care team&#xD;
      to use (Aim 2) will then be tested (Aim 3) by comparing independently living seniors in one&#xD;
      of three comparison groups: 1) installed technology, from which AIMs data will be extracted&#xD;
      and provided to the care transition team to aid in transition decisions; 2) installed&#xD;
      technology, from which AIMs data will be extracted but will not be available to the&#xD;
      transition team; and 3) no technology. We may have insufficient power to recognize&#xD;
      significant change between the validation group and the control group. However, this&#xD;
      primarily study is intended to test the feasibility of the approach, and to identify those&#xD;
      types of AIMs data that are most useful for making transition decisions, which will be used&#xD;
      to inform larger, more definitive studies in the future.&#xD;
