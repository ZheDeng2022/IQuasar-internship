  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation, also known as AF or Afib, is an abnormal and irregular heart rhythm in&#xD;
      which electrical signals are generated chaotically throughout the upper chambers (atria) of&#xD;
      the heart. According to the NICE clinical guidelines, a patient who experiences recurrent&#xD;
      (two or more) AF episodes that terminate spontaneously without any treatment in less than&#xD;
      seven days, and usually within 48 hours is classified as having paroxysmal AF. It has been&#xD;
      shown that paroxysmal AF comprises approximately between 25% and 62% of cases of AF, and it&#xD;
      is estimated that both its incidence and prevalence are likely to rise as the worldwide&#xD;
      population ages dramatically over the next twenty years. Interestingly, hospitalizations due&#xD;
      to AF have increased sharply in the US during the last decade, posing thereby a heavy&#xD;
      economic burden on the health care system and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likewise, hypertension (HTN) also constitutes a major public health problem globally, and its&#xD;
      prevalence is set to increase owing to widespread population ageing. This epidemiological&#xD;
      trend is especially prevalent in rapidly developing countries where early routine screening&#xD;
      at any point of health care is underutilized among risk subjects, due to several perceived&#xD;
      barriers. Moreover, HTN awareness is critical for optimal BP control since under-diagnosis,&#xD;
      under-treatment and/or un-treatment of high BP levels can have deleterious effects on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. In addition, HTN is the single most important risk factor for&#xD;
      cerebrovascular stroke, and it has been clearly demonstrated that it is also associated with&#xD;
      structural and functional changes in the myocardium that favor the development of AF, further&#xD;
      increasing the risk of thromboembolism. Among those alterations, left ventricular hypertrophy&#xD;
      (LVH), impaired ventricular filling, left atrial enlargement and slowing of atrial conduction&#xD;
      velocity have been identified as important heralds of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      More specifically, since HTN and AF are two conditions that often co-exist, especially in&#xD;
      patients with advanced age, the risk for considerable morbidity and mortality is increased&#xD;
      even more, which points towards the significance that optimal BP control holds in the&#xD;
      prevention of cardiovascular events. To our knowledge, in the Framingham Heart Study, after&#xD;
      controlling for age and other predisposing conditions, HTN and diabetes emerged as the only&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors predicting AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been suggested that nocturnal HTN and non-dipping of BP during sleep are distinct&#xD;
      entities that often occur together and are regarded as important harbingers of poor&#xD;
      cardiovascular prognosis. Recently, Pierdomenico et al., showed that non-dipper sustained&#xD;
      hypertensives have a two-fold greater risk of developing AF than dipper ones. This may be due&#xD;
      to the fact that nighttime HTN may be a powerful determinant of long-standing left&#xD;
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which subsequently increases atrial stretch. Furthermore,&#xD;
      it has been observed that nighttime hemodynamics, are associated with higher sympathetic and&#xD;
      reduced vagal activity, which may trigger AF. Additionally, sympathetic activation is&#xD;
      associated with the stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (RAAA), which leads&#xD;
      to increased left ventricular diastolic preload, both atrial and ventricular fibrosis,&#xD;
      exerting thus direct cellular electrophysiological effects. Besides, scientists suggested&#xD;
      that nighttime HTN is better associated with cardiovascular target organ damage (TOD) as&#xD;
      compared with the non-dipping pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the most recent guidelines of the ESH, the presence of microalbuminuria,&#xD;
      increased pulse wave velocity, LVH on echocardiogram and carotid plaques detected during&#xD;
      carotid ultrasonography, constitute markers of asymptomatic organ damage and it has been&#xD;
      clearly demonstrated from multiple studies that they can predict CV mortality independently&#xD;
      of SCORE stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we will try to investigate whether abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of BP&#xD;
      (such as extreme dipping or non-dipping pattern, and/or morning surge) in hypertensive&#xD;
      subjects with or without TOD are associated with the development of new-onset paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      24-hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) along with the 24-hour blood pressure monitors with AF&#xD;
      detector will help us to examine the incidence of AF in extremely dippers or non-dippers,&#xD;
      and/or patients exhibiting a morning surge in BP, with or without TOD. Some of the questions&#xD;
      that we aim to answer while conducting this study are whether an asymptomatic AF episode is&#xD;
      more commonly detected in extreme dippers, non-dippers, or morning surgers, during daytime or&#xD;
      during nighttime, or whether TOD is associated with asymptomatic AF episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, Iqbal et al, demonstrated that there is an association between AF and nighttime&#xD;
      DBP. On top of that, during the past decade, a research study conducted in 546 hypertensive&#xD;
      subjects aged &lt; 60 years of age and who were followed-up for 9.2 years, showed that DBP,&#xD;
      whether 24-hr mean, daytime mean, or nighttime mean, provided the most incremental value for&#xD;
      the prediction of morbid events. Thereby, we want to examine if AF episodes have any&#xD;
      association with the 24hr systolic and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels. It would&#xD;
      also be interesting to observe for any associations between AF occurrence and the mean 24-hr&#xD;
      ABPM and office heart rate (HR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, it has been showed that pulse pressure (PP) determines left atrial enlargement in&#xD;
      non-dipper patients with never-treated essential HTN. Thus, in our study, we will also&#xD;
      examine whether a wide PP is associated with silent AF episodes in treated hypertensive&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarizing, the goals of our study are to determine a).the association between abnormal&#xD;
      circadian BP and the development of paroxysmal AF in hypertensive patients, b).at which level&#xD;
      of TOD, paroxysmal AF episodes are detected in hypertensive subjects, c).if there is any&#xD;
      association between systolic and/or diastolic BP levels with AF occurrence, d).whether the&#xD;
      mean heart rate during a 24-hr interval is associated with the development of paroxysmal AF,&#xD;
      and finally e).examine the relationship between a wide PP and asymptomatic AF episodes in&#xD;
      patients with HTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population We will evaluate all adult patients referred by their family physicians to&#xD;
      the &quot;Hypertension and Cardiovascular Prevention&quot; Outpatient Clinic at Evangelismos General&#xD;
      Hospital in Athens, from June 2015 to present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with an average office systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or an average diastolic BP ≥90&#xD;
      mmHg on three consecutive visits are considered as having essential HTN. Furthermore,&#xD;
      individuals under treatment with one or more antihypertensive drug are also enrolled in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To investigate whether nighttime BP patterns (extreme dipping, normal dipping or reduced&#xD;
      dipping and non-dipping including risers) or early morning surge are associated with the&#xD;
      detection of paroxysmal AF in hypertensive subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further definitions Normal diurnal systolic and diastolic BP pattern: arterial BP has a daily&#xD;
      variation characterized by substantial reductions during sleep, a rapid rise upon awakening,&#xD;
      and increased variability during the awake period in ambulant normal subjects and&#xD;
      hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced diurnal systolic and diastolic BP pattern: nocturnal systolic and/or DBP fall from 1&#xD;
      to 10% of daytime values or night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio &lt;1 and &gt;0.9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nocturnal HTN: increased absolute level of night time systolic and/or diastolic BP (≥120/70&#xD;
      mmHg).19 Dipping pattern is defined as daytime-nighttime BP/daytime BP reduction - based on&#xD;
      either ABP or home BP (HBP) monitoring- greater than 10% for systolic and/or diastolic BP.&#xD;
      Nighttime HTN is defined as nighttime ABP or HBP ≥125/75 mmHg (systolic and/or diastolic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-dipping and rising: no reduction or increase in nocturnal systolic and/or diastolic BP or&#xD;
      night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio ≥1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extreme dipping: marked nocturnal systolic and/or diastolic BP fall&gt;20% of daytime systolic&#xD;
      and/or diastolic values or night/day systolic and/or diastolic BP ratio &lt;0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morning surge: excessive systolic and/or diastolic BP elevation rising in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect asymptomatic and intermittent AF using a 24h ABPM with atrial fibrillation&#xD;
           detector device and to compare its accuracy with Holter monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the agreement in the detection of paroxysmal AF using simultaneously the&#xD;
           24h-ABP with AF detection device and loop recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe at which level of TOD, asymptomatic AF episodes are more commonly detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study if there is any relationship between systolic and/or diastolic BP levels with&#xD;
           AF occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether office HR or mean HR using ABPM is associated with the development of&#xD;
           silent AF episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine whether a wide PP in ABPM is associated with the development of silent AF&#xD;
           episodes.&#xD;
