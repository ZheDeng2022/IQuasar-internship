    <textblock>
      During a space mission the crew has to perform a wide variety of tasks under different&#xD;
      acceleration conditions. For handling of displays and control items during a mission, the&#xD;
      astronaut's performance is strong depended on an intuitive usability. Currently investigators&#xD;
      are exploring and developing different Augmented Reality interfaces for the International&#xD;
      Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) Biolab that is installed in the International Space Station&#xD;
      (ISS) module Columbus. Augmented reality (AR) is a live, direct or indirect, view of a&#xD;
      physical, real-world environment whose elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory&#xD;
      input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. Using AR technologies provides&#xD;
      user-oriented support for working procedures in development, production, and operating of&#xD;
      complex technical products and systems. It is conceivable that in future manned missions such&#xD;
      interfaces will be applied to space operations, where the astronaut will handle virtual&#xD;
      information that enriches the physical reality. To improve the support for the operational&#xD;
      ground team and the space crew by performing service and maintenance tasks at the Columbus&#xD;
      space laboratory Biolab, investigators explore innovative tridimensional (3D) interaction&#xD;
      techniques that allow an intuitive way to interact with the virtual content. The developed AR&#xD;
      interfaces for the ISPR Biolab ought to offer support while handling standardize service and&#xD;
      maintenance procedures. This research is primarily focused on supporting the ground team&#xD;
      during their work at the engineering model of Biolab that is located in Cologne at the&#xD;
      Institute of Aerospace Medicine. Applying these interfaces subsequently to space operations&#xD;
      requires previous exploration regarding the influence of different acceleration conditions&#xD;
      that ought to be considered at the investigators' current stage of designing and development.&#xD;
      Thereby one important aspect is focused on the correct placement of virtual user interfaces&#xD;
      while interacting with it. To explore human adaption of handling and controlling virtual AR&#xD;
      interfaces, this experiment denotes a usability study that will supply findings about human&#xD;
      mental workload and sensorimotor coordination while performing the experimentation task under&#xD;
      different accelerations of gravity. The proposed experiment will supply essential information&#xD;
      about understanding the adequate quality characteristics concerning placement of virtual&#xD;
      interfaces in physical reality and identify disturbing factors while applying in hyper-g and&#xD;
      micro-g conditions.&#xD;

      Investigations description --------------------------------- Augmented Reality 2 different&#xD;
      Head-Mounted-Displays (ARVision3D from Trivisio; dataGlass/2A from Shimadzu), controlled by 2&#xD;
      PC will be used. The first HMD is a monocular optical see-through (OST) HMD: it is equipped&#xD;
      with a semi-transparent LCD display for one eye. The user can directly see the physical world&#xD;
      without limitations regarding the peripheral field of view. The second HMD is a binocular&#xD;
      video see-through (VST) HMD: it is equipped with two LCD displays and a stereo camera system&#xD;
      that records the physical environment and replays the video onto the displays in real-time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---------------------------- Before flight subjects will be familiarized with the setup and&#xD;
      the protocol. For each flight day, 2 subjects will be studied one for each AR device. Halfway&#xD;
      during the flight, the 2 subjects will swap places. The procedure will be the following on&#xD;
      all 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment day will start at 7.30 a.m. with the test subjects equipped with heart rate&#xD;
      recording device. After take-off and after work will be permitted, the 2 subjects will go to&#xD;
      the experimental area where they will be seated. They will be equipped with one of the HMD&#xD;
      (optical- or video-see through HM). During a parabola the subjects perform the&#xD;
      experimentation task: symbolic input of five letters onto virtual keyboard depending on the&#xD;
      experimental task during a parabola.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To point towards the virtual keyboard the subject wears a thimble on his forefinger. The&#xD;
      body-alignment scenario requires an additional panel on subject's non-dominant hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a parabola two subjects perform the tasks - one is using HMD type 1 in hyper-g and the&#xD;
      other subject is using HMD type 2 in micro-g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 8 minute rest period between parabolas 15 and 16, the 2 test subjects will switch&#xD;
      places. Switching place will be a straightforward process as each member of our team has&#xD;
      expertise in manning the test equipment.&#xD;
