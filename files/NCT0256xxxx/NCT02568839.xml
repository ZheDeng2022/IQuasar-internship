      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and toxicity of either the combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel, trastuzumab sc and pertuzumab (arm A) or trastuzumab emtansin (arm B). Switch of&#xD;
      therapy to the opposite treatment alternative is applicable in case of lack of response after&#xD;
      two courses of treatment, or for medical reasons under exceptional circumstances (drug&#xD;
      reaction, other medical conditions) at any point. After termination of the primary treatment&#xD;
      follow-up for five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A translational subprotocol is a mandatory part of the study protocol, with exception for the&#xD;
      use of PET-CT evaluations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with HER2-positive tumors &gt;20 mm or verfied regional lymph node metastases are&#xD;
      randomized to either arm A, the combination of docetaxel, trastuzumab sc (Herceptin SC®) and&#xD;
      pertuzumab (Perjeta®) or arm B, trastuzumab emtansin (Kadcyla®). Switch to the opposite&#xD;
      treatment is performed in case of lack of response after evaluations with mammography and&#xD;
      ultrasound, alternatively MRI breast after the 2nd, 4th and 6th course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative treatment, trastuzumab, radiotherapy, eventual endocrine treatment) according&#xD;
      to standard guidelines. Structured follow-up visits yearly for five years, including&#xD;
      reporting of persistent treatment-related toxicity, HRQoL, recurrence and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial contains also a translational subprotocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PET-CT using FDG, confined to the chest, is performed before start, and after the 2nd&#xD;
           and 6th course (functional imaging, optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Core biopsies from the tumor are collected before start and after the 2nd course of&#xD;
           treatment. If residual tissue is available, samples are collected from the surgical&#xD;
           sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood samples are collected repeatedly during the ongoing treatment and yearly follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. FNAs from metastases in case of recurrence during follow-up&#xD;
