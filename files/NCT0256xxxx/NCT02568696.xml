    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate local activation of the coagulation system in the&#xD;
      kidney graft during organ preservation and during early reperfusion in adult kidney&#xD;
      transplantation. Generation of thrombin and fibrin as well as activation and inhibition of&#xD;
      fibrinolysis will be investigated. Influence of these events on delayed graft function (DGF)&#xD;
      and acute cell-mediated rejection will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical kidney transplantation organ retrieval, cold-preservation of the graft as well as&#xD;
      restoration of the blood flow to the transplant cause tissue damage (ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      injury). Clinically these events can manifest themselves as delayed graft function (DGF),&#xD;
      which is usually defined as the need for dialysis during first week after transplantation.&#xD;
      DGF increases the risk of developing chronic rejection and subsequently loss of the&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischaemia/reperfusion injury is biologically characterized by local profound inflammatory&#xD;
      response, activation of the coagulation system and endothelial dysfunction in the&#xD;
      transplanted organ. After reperfusion activated neutrophils cause tissue damage in the graft&#xD;
      by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of proteolytic enzymes, which lead&#xD;
      to plugging of the capillaries by accumulation of thrombocytes and fibrin. Blood flow is&#xD;
      further diminished by increased blood viscosity and local vasoconstriction and swelling of&#xD;
      the endothelial cells. Disorders of the microcirculation lead to &quot;no-reflow&quot; phenomenon&#xD;
      whereby locally tissues remain ischemic, despite of good blood flow in the organ artery and&#xD;
      vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coagulation is activated in the renal transplant during reperfusion, when circulating factor&#xD;
      VIIa (FVIIa) comes into contact with the tissue factor (TF), which is expressed on the&#xD;
      endothelium due to ischaemia. FVII-TF complex activates factor X (FX) and activated FX (FXa)&#xD;
      cleaves thrombin (FII) from prothrombin. Thrombin activates thrombocytes, cleaves fibrin from&#xD;
      fibrinogen and activates factor XIII( FXIII), which stabilizes fibrin clot. Fibrin has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to accumulate in the kidney graft during reperfusion. Fibrin accumulation is&#xD;
      aggravated by inhibition of fibrinolysis due to reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators conducting this current research project, have previously&#xD;
      gained indirect evidence in a small cohort study, that accumulation of fibrin occurs even&#xD;
      before reperfusion, during donor care and organ retrieval. Most importantly, specifically&#xD;
      this pre-reperfusion fibrin deposition was related to DGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were several limitations in investigators previous study concerning intra-graft&#xD;
      coagulation events in DGF. It was conducted as a part of a larger trial in renal&#xD;
      transplantation and included only 30 patients in two study arms with different&#xD;
      immunosuppressant regimens (peri-operative basiliximab and conventional triple therapy).&#xD;
      Therefore, a new study, with larger sample size and standardized immunosuppression is&#xD;
      warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this current prospective observational study surgical technique, anaesthesia&#xD;
      and hemodynamic management, immunosuppressive medications are strictly standardized. Sample&#xD;
      size is increased to 100. The investigators prospectively screen all adult patients receiving&#xD;
      their first kidney transplant from cadaveric donor. Only patients scheduled to receive local&#xD;
      standard triple immunosuppressant therapy with cyclosporine A, mycophenolate mofetil and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples and prospective data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for assessment of intra-graft coagulation events (generation of thrombin and&#xD;
      fibrin, activation and inhibition of fibrinolysis) are drawn peri-operatively. Predefined&#xD;
      clinical and demographical data are collected preoperatively and prospectively during 3&#xD;
      months after kidney transplantation to assess the influence of these coagulation events on&#xD;
      delayed graft function according to Halloran criteria (8) (primary outcome) and acute cell&#xD;
      mediated graft rejection (primary outcome).&#xD;
