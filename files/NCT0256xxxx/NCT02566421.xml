  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies patients' genomic sequencing in determining specific&#xD;
      treatments, also called Precision Medicine, in patients with cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      parts of the body (metastatic) and/or cannot be removed by surgery. Examining the genetic&#xD;
      code of a patient's tumor, a mutation (a change in the deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] sequence&#xD;
      of a cell or gene) may be identified and matched with available treatment that targets the&#xD;
      mutated gene or an alternative treatment that may provide benefit for the patient with the&#xD;
      mutation identified. Precision medicine may impacts patient's response to treatment by&#xD;
      targeting specific mutations and may increase survival and improve quality of life.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing a Precision Oncology protocol in the treatment&#xD;
      of patients who undergo genomic sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine treatment response rates in patients who receive targeted treatment versus&#xD;
      those who do not receive targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess survival in patients who receive targeted treatment versus those who do not&#xD;
      receive targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess changes in patient-reported outcomes in patients who receive targeted&#xD;
      treatment versus those who do not receive targeted treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To perform exploratory statistical genetic and bioinformatics analyses using the data&#xD;
      derived from the genomic sequencing to catalogue additional important variants and determine&#xD;
      whether there are any patterns or associations among patient level risk factors, their&#xD;
      outcomes and genomic information that was not identified by the original genomic sequencing&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive treatment based on the results of their genomic sequencing analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
