      Objective of the registry is to assess the use of antithrombotic therapies and adherence to&#xD;
      guidelines in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers a substantial risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke&#xD;
      and thromboembolism, and this common cardiac arrhythmia represents a major healthcare burden&#xD;
      in Europe. Stroke prevention is central to the management of AF patients, with oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation (OAC) using well-controlled adjusted dose vitamin K antagonists or novel OACs&#xD;
      being recommended for patients with AF with ≥1 stroke risk factors. Also, the 2012 focused&#xD;
      update of the ESC guidelines strongly advocates a clinical practice shift so that the initial&#xD;
      decision step now is the identification of 'truly low risk' patients, essentially those&#xD;
      age&lt;65 without any stroke risk factors (both male and female), who do not need any&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy. The ESC guidelines only recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score for&#xD;
      stroke risk assessment, and the 'low risk' patients are defined as those with a CHA2DS2-VASc&#xD;
      score=0 (males) or score=1 (females). Subsequent to this initial step of identifying the low&#xD;
      risk patients, effective stroke prevention (which is essentially OAC) can then be offered to&#xD;
      AF patients with ≥1 stroke risk factors, with treatment decisions made in consultation with&#xD;
      patients and incorporating their preferences. Despite these recommendations, a substantial&#xD;
      number of patients with AF is not treated with OAC. On the other hand, patients with AF and&#xD;
      low risk are being &quot;overtreated&quot;, receiving OAC despite a CHADS-VASc score of 0. Therefore,&#xD;
      this registry will determine, if patients with non-valvular AF are treated ac-cording to&#xD;
      current guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apixaban is an oral factor Xa inhibitor, which has been tested in a number of indications. In&#xD;
      the AVERROES study in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation deemed not suitable for&#xD;
      treatment with a vitamin-K antagonist apixaban compared to aspirin reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      stroke and systemic embolism without increasing bleeding complications. In the large&#xD;
      ARISTOTELE study apixaban was superior to warfarin, it re-duced the primary endpoint of&#xD;
      stroke and systemic embolism caused less bleeding and reduced all-cause mortality.&#xD;
      Subsequently apixaban has been approved by the European health authorities for the use in&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation. It is therefore of interest to determine use of apixaban&#xD;
      in real life with respect to patient selection, adherence to therapy and midterm efficacy and&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
