    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nintedanib works in treating patients with malignant&#xD;
      pleural mesothelioma that has come back. Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with recurrent,&#xD;
      unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma (MAM) treated with nintedanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial responses) and&#xD;
      disease control rate (response or stable disease) in the subset of patients with measurable&#xD;
      disease by both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) 1.1 criteria and&#xD;
      Modified RECIST criteria for pleural tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To collect tissue samples for future correlative studies related to overall study&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
