  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NAPs have been previously shown to clear serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) both&#xD;
      preclinically (in duck HBV infected ducks) and in human patients. REP 2139-Ca mediated HBsAg&#xD;
      clearance acts synergistically with immunotherapeutic agent pegylated interferon-alpha 2a to&#xD;
      restore host immunological control of HBV infection. REP 2165 is a version of REP 2139 which&#xD;
      has been shown preclinically to retain antiviral activity with lower accumulation in the&#xD;
      liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both REP 2139 and REP 2165 used in this protocol are formulated as magnesium chelate&#xD;
      complexes, which improve their administration tolerability. This open label, randomized and&#xD;
      controlled study will examine the safety and efficacy of REP 2139-Mg and REP 2165-Mg therapy&#xD;
      in patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B when used in combination with tenofovir&#xD;
      disoproxil fumarate and pegylated interferon alpha-2a.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs) utilize the sequence independent properties of phosphorothioated&#xD;
      oligonucleotides to target apolipoprotein interactions involved in the formation of HBV&#xD;
      subviral particles (SVPs) which are comprised mainly of the hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
      protein (HBsAg). The effect of NAPs is to block the formation of SVPs inside infected&#xD;
      hepatocytes which prevents their secretion. As SVPs account for &gt; 99.99% of HBsAg in the&#xD;
      blood, NAPs are an effective approach for clearing HBsAg from the serum of HBV infected&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with the NAP REP 2139 (REP 2139-Ca)&#xD;
      results in the rapid and effective clearance ofHBsAg from the blood. This HBsAg removal has&#xD;
      the immediate effect of unmasking the underlying, pre-existing anti-HBsAg (anti-HBs)&#xD;
      response, allowing clearance of HBV virus from the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although REP 2139-Ca has been shown to be safe in human patients, it shares the same class&#xD;
      effect as other phosphorothioate oligonucleotides in that it accumulates in the liver with&#xD;
      repeated dosing. REP 2165 is a version of REP 2139 which is designed to have an increased&#xD;
      rate of degradation to slow down liver accumulation while keeping its antiviral activity&#xD;
      intact. The antiviral efficacy of REP 2165 has been shown to be comparable to REP 2139 in a&#xD;
      pre-clinical model of HBV infection with significantly less accumulation in the liver. As&#xD;
      such, REP 2165 is expected to have comparable antiviral efficacy in human patients with&#xD;
      reduced liver accumulation during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBsAg has important immunosuppressive effects in HBV infection which have been shown to block&#xD;
      both adaptive and innate immune processes. Removal of HBsAg from the blood of patients&#xD;
      removes this immunosuppressive effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, an important additional effect of removal of HBsAg from the blood is to greatly enhance&#xD;
      the effect of pegylated interferon alpha 2a. It is expected that elimination of serum HBsAg&#xD;
      with REP 2139-Mg or REP 2165-Mg will lead to creation of a favourable immunological&#xD;
      activation in the absence of HBsAg, appearance of free anti-HBs, clearance of HBV virions in&#xD;
      the blood and synergistic immunostimulation with conventional dosing of pegylated interferon&#xD;
      alpha-2a and improved control of HBV infection in the presence of tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate (TDF). All patients will receive 24 weeks of monotherapy with TDF prior to entry&#xD;
      into experimental or active comparator arms.&#xD;
