  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of liver insults lead to pathological changes in liver architecture that culminate&#xD;
      in cirrhosis. While invasive liver biopsy was required to detect cirrhosis, the development&#xD;
      of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has revolutionized our ability to detect liver&#xD;
      fibrosis through non-invasive means that involve measurement of liver stiffness. However, a&#xD;
      number of pathological findings occur in liver in response to various insults that precede&#xD;
      cirrhosis and are clinically important to identify such as steatosis associated with NASH,&#xD;
      inflammation associated with viral hepatitis, and congestion associated with cardiac&#xD;
      hepatopathy. Detection of such entities provides essential diagnostic, prognostic, and&#xD;
      treatment information but yet is not available non-invasively. Recent murine studies from&#xD;
      this group of investigators has identified that MRE technology can be adapted to&#xD;
      non-invasively detect these conditions. Implementing this into the practice will transform it&#xD;
      by obviating the need for invasive liver biopsies in patients suspected of having such forms&#xD;
      of suspected liver disease. This will differentiate Mayo from other institutions where such&#xD;
      technology is not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional aim of this study is to examine the impact of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), both common comorbidities of&#xD;
      obesity. Recent evidence indicates a potential link between OSA and severity of NASH and&#xD;
      fibrosis, but the mechanisms of OSA- associated hypoxia on liver disease progression in NAFLD&#xD;
      is unclear. This study offers the unique opportunity to analyze this association, as the&#xD;
      study population will undergo routine evaluation for OSA, as part as the preoperative work-up&#xD;
      prior to bariatric surgery.&#xD;

    <description>120 participants evaluated at Mayo clinic with a diagnoses of NAFLD who are at risk to have NASH. All subjects will undergo an MRE and outpatient liver biopsy.The liver tissue will be assessed for fat, inflammation, and fibrosis by pathology.

    <description>Clinical Cohort: NAFLD COHORT RECRUITED FROM THE LIVER CLINIC: 120 adult subjects evaluated at Mayo Clinic with a diagnosis of NAFLD who are at risk to have NASH will be recruited from our outpatient Liver Disease Clinic. Metabolic syndrome is a strong predictor of NASH and will be used to best identify subjects with a clinical indication for liver biopsy according to AASLD guidelines. The proposed sample size for this experiment will be calculated based on sensitivity and specificity of MRE for differentiating various stages of fibrosis.</description>
