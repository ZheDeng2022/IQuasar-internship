  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing vascular surgery are at a significantly high risk of perioperative&#xD;
      cardiovascular, cerebral and renal events compared to those undergoing non-vascular surgery.&#xD;
      This could be because of co-morbidities that are common in this patient group. Additionally,&#xD;
      smoking, which is common in this population, may be a contributing factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen therapy has been used for decades in order to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and stroke in patients undergoing vascular surgery and pre-existing co-morbidities in the&#xD;
      belief that increased inspired oxygen increases oxygen delivery to tissues, thereby reducing&#xD;
      the risk for hypoxia and cell death. However, several studies published recently have&#xD;
      questioned the routine use of high inspired oxygen concentration (hyperoxia) to improve&#xD;
      oxygen delivery, specifically in the neonatal period but possibly even following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. This could be explained by the fact that increasing inspired concentrations of&#xD;
      oxygen cause vasoconstriction in cerebral and coronary arteries, thereby reducing blood flow.&#xD;
      Additionally, increased oxygen causes excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),&#xD;
      and repercussion injury from oxidative stress. The latter can lead to apoptosis (cell death)&#xD;
      in myocardial or cerebral neurons. Despite the high risks of administering oxygen when not&#xD;
      needed, it is routinely used in hospitals all over the world without a doctors prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess peri-operative complications up to 1 year following vascular&#xD;
      surgery in patients randomised to receive high inspired oxygen concentration (endpoint: SpO2&#xD;
      98 - 100%) or minimal inspired O2 concentration (endpoint: SpO2 &gt; 90%).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen is probably one of the commonest &quot;non-prescription&quot; drug used in the hospital and its&#xD;
      advantage in several situations including carbon monoxide poisoning, central hypoxia and&#xD;
      prior to planned intubation in an acute situation are today well-established and commonly&#xD;
      used. Oxygen has been frowned upon in the resuscitation of newborn babies because of the risk&#xD;
      of retrolental hypoplasia, now well accepted and adopted in clinical practice. Oxygen has&#xD;
      also been traditionally used to increase oxygen carrying capacity in patients presenting with&#xD;
      an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), to reduce surgical site infections (SSI), to ensure&#xD;
      adequate oxygen delivery to tissues in unconscious patients, during cardiac surgery and for&#xD;
      postoperative management, specifically after major surgery. Thus, deliberate use of high&#xD;
      inspiratory oxygen concentrations (e.g., 80% or above) is recommended in the treatment of&#xD;
      specific intoxications, such as with carbon monoxide or cyanide, wherein hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
      should also be considered. In addition, a high oxygen fraction has been suggested to prevent&#xD;
      adverse outcomes after surgery and anesthesia, including a reduction in wound infections and&#xD;
      postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). In critically ill patients, oxygen delivery to the&#xD;
      tissues is often compromised, and supplemental oxygen (e.g., face mask with 10 L oxygen per&#xD;
      min) is commonly administered to patients with pneumonia, sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, or&#xD;
      stroke - in fact, it is estimated that oxygen is given during transport in approximately&#xD;
      one-third of all ambulance journeys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reports published recently have questioned many of the &quot;routine&quot; uses of oxygen and&#xD;
      some evidence even seems to point towards negative outcomes in some of these conditions.&#xD;
      Specifically, excessive oxygen is likely to do more harm than good in the neonatal period,&#xD;
      following cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and likely following acute myocardial infarction.&#xD;
      Prospective, randomised studies on this important use of oxygen in the preoperative string&#xD;
      are, however, lacking in the literature and in view of theoretical risks for hyperoxemia to&#xD;
      several organs, the routine use of high oxygen fractions during the peri-operative phase can&#xD;
      be questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess peri-operative complications up to 1 year following vascular&#xD;
      surgery in patients randomised to receive high inspired oxygen concentration (endpoint: SpO2&#xD;
      98 - 100%) or minimal inspired O2 concentration (endpoint: SpO2 &gt; 90%).&#xD;
