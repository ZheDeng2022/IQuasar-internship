    <textblock>
      Knee arthroscopy is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure worldwide, with,&#xD;
      according to the American Society for Sports Medicine, over 4 million procedures performed&#xD;
      each year. The risk of venous thrombosis following this procedure is considerable with rates&#xD;
      of symptomatic events varying between 0.9% and 4.6%. It is currently unknown how this high&#xD;
      risk comes about considering its short duration and minimal tissue damage caused by the&#xD;
      procedure. A factor that may play a role is the use of a tourniquet. A large majority of&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons prefer to operate within a 'dry field', which is obtained by the use of&#xD;
      a tourniquet. Tourniquet applied surgery is not without risks. Although its use during&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery is widely accepted and a standard procedure, tourniquet use can lead to&#xD;
      loss of muscle functional strength and contractile speed, vessel wall damage and nerve&#xD;
      injury, next to the possibly increased risk of venous thrombosis. In the proposed study the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate the effect of a tourniquet on local and systemic markers of&#xD;
      hypoxia, inflammation, involvement of endothelium, and coagulation activation. A finding of&#xD;
      more prominent activation of the coagulation system with tourniquet use than with non-use&#xD;
      will create an important opportunity to prevent thromboembolic events in these patients, as&#xD;
      it has been shown that knee arthroscopy can be performed adequately without the use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet. Furthermore, it will increase the understanding of the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      thrombosis.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee arthroscopy is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure worldwide, with,&#xD;
      according to the American Society for Sports Medicine, over 4 million procedures performed&#xD;
      each year. The risk of venous thrombosis following this procedure is considerable with rates&#xD;
      of symptomatic events varying between 0.9% and 4.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is currently unknown how this high risk comes about considering its short duration and&#xD;
      minimal tissue damage caused by the procedure. A factor that may play a role is the use of a&#xD;
      tourniquet. A large majority of orthopaedic surgeons prefer to operate within a 'dry field',&#xD;
      which is obtained by the use of a tourniquet. In the proposed study the investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the effect of a tourniquet on local and systemic markers of hypoxia,&#xD;
      inflammation, involvement of endothelium, and coagulation activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effect of tourniquet application on the coagulation system in patients&#xD;
      undergoing a knee arthroscopy. A finding of more prominent activation of the coagulation&#xD;
      system with tourniquet use than with non-use will create an important opportunity to prevent&#xD;
      thromboembolic events in these patients, as it has been shown that knee arthroscopy can be&#xD;
      performed adequately without the use of a tourniquet. Furthermore, it will increase the&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized, controlled clinical study the investigators will compare local and systemic&#xD;
      coagulation and inflammation markers before and after knee arthroscopy between two groups: 25&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to arthroscopy with tourniquet (Group I) and 25 patients to&#xD;
      arthroscopy without tourniquet (Group II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited from one hospital in Gouda over a 6 months inclusion period.&#xD;
      All patients over 18 years, scheduled for a meniscectomy, diagnostic arthroscopy or removal&#xD;
      of corpora libera will be eligible for inclusion. Patients will be excluded when they suffer&#xD;
      from any kind of coagulation disorder, use of hormonal anticonception, in case of pregnancy&#xD;
      or puerperium, when they have a history of venous thrombosis, had major surgery or&#xD;
      cast-immobilisation of the lower extremity in the past two months, have a neoplasm or&#xD;
      inflammatory disease, have a BMI&gt;30, or when they use anticoagulant therapy. Patients will&#xD;
      generally receive spinal anaesthesia. Patients who are nevertheless exposed to any other type&#xD;
      of anaesthesia will be excluded as well, to keep the effect of anaesthesia equal for all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to knee arthroscopy without tourniquet use and to knee&#xD;
      arthroscopy with tourniquet use. In patients randomized to arthroscopy with tourniquet use,&#xD;
      exsanguination in the leg in which the knee arthroscopy will be performed will be&#xD;
      accomplished by raising the leg vertically for one minute. The tourniquet will be inflated to&#xD;
      100-150 mmHg above systolic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on duration of surgery and duration of tourniquet use will be collected. Blood collected&#xD;
      from the cubital vein and the great saphenous vein during arthroscopy of the knee will be&#xD;
      analyzed on outcome parameters that reflect a hypoxic state, an inflammatory reaction,&#xD;
      involvement of the endothelium, a procoagulant state and thrombin formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study endpoints (primary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in parameters between timepoints; Before surgery (blood drawn approximately 1 hour&#xD;
      before surgery), directly after surgery (blood drawn within 5 minutes), 1 hour after surgery&#xD;
      will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different patterns will be analyzed to explore the effect of tourniquet application on the&#xD;
      coagulation system by possible biological mechanism. A change (increase or decrease) of&#xD;
      markers within one pattern, compared to baseline measurements (before surgery), is considered&#xD;
      as a relevant shift of that pattern, thereby suggesting the involvement of that specific&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Thrombomodulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  E-selectin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome parameters that reflect a procoagulant state and thrombin formation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prothrombin fragments 1+2&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Plasmin Activator Inhibitor 1 (PAI 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Factor VIII&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombin and Antithrombin complexes (TAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plasmin and antiplasmin complexes (PAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
