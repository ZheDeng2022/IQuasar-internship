    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine mean or median of fractional exhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
      (FeNO) in Thai atopic asthmatic children that divided into subgroups due to asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation according to the global initiative for asthma guideline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      From many previous studies, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has many benefits such as&#xD;
      non-invasive, easily to perform, less time consume, has direct association with severity of&#xD;
      inflammation of bronchial trees and sputum eosinophils, has benefit for diagnosis and&#xD;
      monitoring the treatment in asthmatic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Thailand, this field of study is less extend, especially in children population. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that patients with asthma exacerbation may have high level of&#xD;
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) than non exacerbation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore desirable to examine the association between fractional exhaled nitric oxide&#xD;
      (FeNO) and asthma exacerbation among atopic asthmatic Thai children and will be the main&#xD;
      objective of this research.&#xD;
