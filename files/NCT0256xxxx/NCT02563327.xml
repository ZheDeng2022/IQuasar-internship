    <textblock>
      The Tuberculosis Trials Consortium (TBTC) phase 3 treatment trial, Study 31, will investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of daily rifapentine (1200 mg daily) with or without moxifloxacin as&#xD;
      part of multidrug treatment regimens for drug-sensitive pulmonary TB. The proposed study&#xD;
      (Study 31 PK/PD) will examine the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of&#xD;
      high-dose daily rifapentine with and without moxifloxacin given for 17 weeks. Two different&#xD;
      PK sampling procedures are required for the population PK/PD assessments involving&#xD;
      rifapentine and moxifloxacin: (1) intensive sampling of 6 samples/participant on one occasion&#xD;
      plus subsequent sparse sampling for a subset of Study 31 participants who are invited to&#xD;
      co-enroll in Study 31 PK/PD; and (2) sparse sampling of 2-3 samples/participant for all other&#xD;
      Study 31 trial participants (these data will be collected as part of the Study 31 treatment&#xD;
      protocol). Herein, we describe the PK sampling to be conducted among those Study 31&#xD;
      participants who are co-enrolled to Study 31 PK/PD (n=60). Intensive PK sampling is needed in&#xD;
      some participants to estimate the population PK model parameters with no bias and&#xD;
      satisfactory precision (relative standard error &lt; 20%). PK and outcomes data from all&#xD;
      participants in Study 31 will be merged to build the population PK/PD models to evaluate&#xD;
      PK/PD parameters. Details regarding these planned analyses are also provided in this Study 31&#xD;
      PK/PD protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the population pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25-desacetyl&#xD;
           rifapentine, using sparse PK data from Study 31 and intensive PK data from Study 31&#xD;
           PK/PD. Using the population PK model, determine post-hoc Bayesian estimates of&#xD;
           individual-level PK parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examine the relationship between rifapentine PK parameters of interest and treatment&#xD;
           efficacy. PK parameters will include area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24),&#xD;
           peak concentration (Cmax), time above the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC), and&#xD;
           AUC/MIC. The treatment outcome of interest will be time to culture conversion and time&#xD;
           to treatment failure or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Among the Study 31 participants in the lowest 10% for rifapentine AUC0-24, examine the&#xD;
           PK/PD effect on culture conversion of sputa after completion of 4 months of daily&#xD;
           rifapentine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the relationship between safety outcomes (Grade 3 or higher adverse events) and&#xD;
           rifapentine PK parameters (AUC0-24, Cmax, AUC0-24/MIC and time above MIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterize the population PK of moxifloxacin, and then estimate moxifloxacin AUC0-24&#xD;
           and Cmax when moxifloxacin is administered with rifapentine given at a daily dose of&#xD;
           1200 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Examine the relationships between moxifloxacin PK and treatment outcomes (as described&#xD;
           in objective 2 for rifapentine) and moxifloxacin PK and safety (as described in&#xD;
           objective 4 for rifapentine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Study 31 PK/PD, among 60 participants with tuberculosis enrolled in a rifapentine-based&#xD;
      treatment arm of Study 31, PK data will be collected on two occasions. At TBTC sites that&#xD;
      have the capacity to perform this activity, participants will have 6 scheduled PK samples per&#xD;
      participant collected to measure rifapentine (with or without moxifloxacin) concentrations&#xD;
      over approximately 24 hours. In addition among these 60 participants, 2 to 3 scheduled PK&#xD;
      samples will be obtained on a second &quot;late&quot; sampling at &gt; 14 days after the first PK&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;

      RIFAPENTINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifapentine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treatment of&#xD;
      drug-susceptible pulmonary TB based on an open-label prospective randomized phase 3 study of&#xD;
      722 participants with pulmonary TB. Rifapentine has a longer half-life than rifampin, but&#xD;
      both drugs inhibit bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the β-subunit of DNA-dependent RNA&#xD;
      polymerase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifapentine Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      With once-weekly treatment in participants with pulmonary TB, mean plasma AUC0-inf was 296,&#xD;
      410, and 477 μg*h/mL after 600, 900, and 1200 mg doses administered without food, and Cmax&#xD;
      was 12, 15, and 19 μg/mL. The bioavailability of rifapentine was 70% in healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers who were given a single 600-mg dose. Food (total, 850 calories 33 g protein, 55 g&#xD;
      fat, and 58 g carbohydrate) increases AUC0-inf by 43% and Cmax by 44% compared with fasting&#xD;
      conditions. Rifapentine and its 25-desacetyl metabolite are 98% and 93% protein-bound in&#xD;
      serum, primarily to albumin. Rifapentine is metabolized to 25-desacetyl rifapentine by an&#xD;
      esterase enzyme present in the liver and blood. The half-life of rifapentine is 14 to 17&#xD;
      hours and the half-life of 25-desacetyl rifapentine is 13 hours. Rifapentine is excreted in&#xD;
      bile and eliminated in feces, and &lt; 10% rifapentine is excreted unchanged in urine. The&#xD;
      microbiologically active metabolite contributes 40% of the overall activity of the drug. The&#xD;
      MIC of rifapentine against M. tuberculosis is 0.05 μg/mL (0.25 μg/mL for 25-desacetyl&#xD;
      rifapentine). Single-dose rifapentine PK parameters are similar in healthy females and males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Trials of Rifapentine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TBTC performed phase 2 studies to assess the antimicrobial safety and efficacy of daily&#xD;
      rifapentine administered with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for pulmonary TB&#xD;
      treatment. In Study 29, adults (n = 531) who had sputum-smear-positive pulmonary TB were&#xD;
      randomized to receive rifapentine 10 mg/kg/dose or rifampin 10 mg/kg/dose without food, 5&#xD;
      days per week for 8 weeks, with isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This study showed no&#xD;
      significant difference in antimicrobial activity between regimens, based on the surrogate&#xD;
      marker of culture status at completion of the intensive phase (culture conversion on solid&#xD;
      media: rifampin group, 83%; rifapentine group, 86%) (culture conversion in liquid media:&#xD;
      rifampin group, 65%; rifapentine group, 68%). The rifapentine regimen was well tolerated, and&#xD;
      similar proportions of participants between groups discontinued the assigned treatment&#xD;
      overall (rifampin group, 16%; rifapentine group, 15%) or because of toxicity (rifampin group,&#xD;
      1.2%; rifapentine group, 1.5%). There were no differences in proportions of participants&#xD;
      between treatment groups who had a serious adverse event related to study treatment (rifampin&#xD;
      group, 0.4%; rifapentine group, 1.1%) or type or severity of adverse events between groups.&#xD;
      The investigators concluded that the rifapentine regimen given on an empty stomach 5&#xD;
      days/week for 8 weeks was safe and well tolerated but not significantly more active than&#xD;
      rifampin-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent dose-ranging study to determine the optimal dose of daily rifapentine during the&#xD;
      first 8 weeks of TB treatment was performed by the TBTC. In Study 29X, adults (n = 331) with&#xD;
      sputum-smear-positive pulmonary TB were randomized and received or rifampin (10 mg/kg/dose)&#xD;
      or rifapentine (10, 15, or 20 mg/kg/dose; maximum dose, 1500 mg) given with a high fat meal&#xD;
      daily (7 days per week) for 8 weeks, in addition to isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.&#xD;
      At completion of the intensive phase, negative cultures on solid media were noted in 52 of 64&#xD;
      subjects in the rifampin group (81%); 62 of 67 subjects in the rifapentine 10 mg/kg group&#xD;
      (93%; not significant); 59 of 66 subjects in the rifapentine 15 mg/kg group (89%; not&#xD;
      significant); and 54 of 57 subjects in the rifapentine 20 mg/kg group (95%; P ≤ .05).&#xD;
      Negative cultures in liquid media in the modified intention-to-treat analysis group occurred&#xD;
      in 36 of 64 subjects in the rifampin group (56%); 50 of 67 subjects in the rifapentine 10&#xD;
      mg/kg group (75%; P ≤ .04); 46 of 66 subjects in the rifapentine 15 mg/kg group (70%; not&#xD;
      significant); and 47 of 57 subjects in the rifapentine 20 mg/kg group (83%; P ≤ .01).&#xD;
      High-dose daily rifapentine in combination with standard anti-TB drugs was well tolerated and&#xD;
      highly active in surrogate bacteriologic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment trials 29 and 29X, the population PK properties of rifapentine were&#xD;
      characterized in 415 participants. Rifapentine oral clearance did not significantly change&#xD;
      with weight. Rifapentine bioavailability decreased with greater rifapentine doses and the&#xD;
      increase in exposure was less than dose-proportional. Median exposures at steady state of&#xD;
      rifapentine AUC0-24 were 292, 474, and 579 μg*h/mL, respectively, for 600, 900, and 1200 mg&#xD;
      daily doses. Because rifapentine clearance was not weight-dependent, a level rifapentine&#xD;
      treatment dose (that is, a mg rather than a mg/kg dose) is recommended for adults.&#xD;
      Rifapentine 1200 mg daily is incorporated into the Study 31 treatment trial protocol. Because&#xD;
      food taken with rifapentine study doses significantly increased rifapentine exposure, it is&#xD;
      recommended in Study 31 that a meal be taken prior to rifapentine study doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important knowledge gap in TB clinical trials is how to efficiently and economically&#xD;
      assess new drug efficacy, as biomarkers now commonly used in phase 2 trials have had varying&#xD;
      success in predicting drug efficacy in phase 3 trials. However, optimal use of a drug can be&#xD;
      achieved through population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies that combine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic properties of a drug and efficacy outcomes of treatment. In TBTC Study 29-29X&#xD;
      PK/PD, the relation between rifapentine exposure and response by time to conversion in sputum&#xD;
      cultures was established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these analyses, the efficacy of rifapentine was exposure-dependent. Using maximum&#xD;
      inhibitory effect (Emax) in a time-to-event model, a highly significant rifapentine&#xD;
      exposure-response relationship was observed. With rifapentine AUC0-24 &gt; 350 μg*h/mL, the&#xD;
      percentage of participants with culture conversion of sputa from positive to negative in&#xD;
      liquid media at 2 months of rifapentine treatment was modeled to be 74% and with rifapentine&#xD;
      AUC0-24 &lt; 300 μg*h/mL (&quot;low rifapentine AUC) to be 55%. In summary, adequately high&#xD;
      rifapentine exposure resulted in better responses, and large cavity size in poorer responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TBTC Study 31 is a phase 3, multicenter, international, randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      open-label, 3-arm, non-inferiority trial that will enroll newly diagnosed, previously&#xD;
      untreated participants with pulmonary TB. Two investigational regimens will be evaluated to&#xD;
      determine if the duration of treatment for drug-susceptible pulmonary TB can be reduced&#xD;
      compared to a standard rifampin-containing six month treatment regimen. In one&#xD;
      investigational arm, the efficacy of the single substitution of rifapentine for rifampin for&#xD;
      the 17 week regimen will be assessed. The second investigational arm will evaluate a&#xD;
      rifapentine-containing regimen that also substitutes moxifloxacin for ethambutol and&#xD;
      continues moxifloxacin for 17 weeks. The Study 31 primary efficacy endpoint is TB&#xD;
      disease-free survival at 12 months after study treatment assignment. In addition, time to&#xD;
      culture conversion will be assessed. The primary safety endpoint is the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with grade 3 or higher adverse events during study drug treatment. This PK/PD&#xD;
      Study is a component of TBTC Study 31.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MOXIFLOXACIN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that has potent activity against M. tuberculosis.&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin is well absorbed and has 90% bioavailability. The PK parameters are linear from&#xD;
      50 to 800 mg (single dose) and ≤ 600 mg (once daily dosing) over 10 days). Steady state is&#xD;
      reached within 3 days. The mean ± SD Cmax and AUC0-24 values at steady state with a 400-mg&#xD;
      once-daily dosage regimen are 4.5 ± 0.5 μg/mL and 48 ± 3 μg*h/mL. Trough plasma concentration&#xD;
      at steady state (400 mg once daily) is 1.0 ± 0.1 μg/L. The time of Cmax (Tmax) is 1 to 3&#xD;
      hours. The mean plasma half-life is 12 ± 3 hours. Coadministration with food may slightly&#xD;
      prolong Tmax and reduce Cmax by 16%, but these effects are not clinically important.&#xD;
      Administration with yogurt or a high fat meal did not significantly affect the AUC. However,&#xD;
      coadministered with aluminum-, magnesium-, or calcium-containing antacids markedly reduced&#xD;
      oral bioavailability of fluoroquinolones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin is 50% bound to plasma proteins. It is widely distributed, with some tissue&#xD;
      concentrations in excess of plasma levels. Moxifloxacin is metabolized by glucuronide and&#xD;
      sulfate conjugation. The sulfate conjugate (M1) accounts for 38% oral dose and is excreted in&#xD;
      feces; 14% of an oral dose is converted to the glucuronide conjugate (M2) and is excreted in&#xD;
      urine. Peak plasma levels of M1 are &lt; 10% and M2 are 40% parent drug levels. Much (45%) of an&#xD;
      oral dose is excreted as the parent drug and 51% as known metabolites. Based on population PK&#xD;
      modeling, moxifloxacin AUC0-24 in participants who have TB can be predicted with acceptable&#xD;
      accuracy using limited sampling strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rifampin induces the activity of the phase 2 enzymes glucuronosyltransferase and&#xD;
      sulfotransferase. In a PK drug interaction between rifampin and moxifloxacin, the&#xD;
      moxifloxacin AUC0-24 decreased 27% (ratio of geometric mean, 73 [90% CI, 64 to 84]) with&#xD;
      coadministration of rifampin at a dose of 600 mg daily. In a PK interaction study of 19&#xD;
      participants who had tuberculosis, moxifloxacin AUC0-24 and Cmax decreased when moxifloxacin&#xD;
      was administered daily with rifampin and isoniazid compared with moxifloxacin alone (ratio of&#xD;
      geometric mean AUC0-24, 0.69 [90% CI, 0.65 to 0.74]; Cmax, 0.68 [90% CI, 0.64 to 0.73]). With&#xD;
      rifapentine dosing 3 times per week in a PK interaction study in healthy volunteers,&#xD;
      moxifloxacin AUC0-inf was decreased 17%. In the RIFAQUIN PK study with 28 adults who had&#xD;
      pulmonary tuberculosis treated with a continuation-phase regimen of 400 mg moxifloxacin and&#xD;
      900 mg rifapentine twice weekly, or 400 mg moxifloxacin and 1200 mg rifapentine once weekly,&#xD;
      median moxifloxacin AUC0-inf with rifapentine treatment once weekly was decreased 9% or twice&#xD;
      weekly was decreased 11%. These PK drug interaction studies indicate that moxifloxacin&#xD;
      AUC0-inf is decreased with increased frequency of rifamycin dosing (from once weekly up to&#xD;
      daily dosing). The magnitude of reduction in moxifloxacin concentrations when it is given&#xD;
      with rifapentine at a dose of 1200 mg daily is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moxifloxacin for Tuberculosis Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phase 2 TB clinical trials that have shown that substitution of moxifloxacin for&#xD;
      ethambutol during the intensive phase of pulmonary TB treatment increases the bactericidal&#xD;
      activity with multi-drug, intensive-phase regimen, as assessed by sputum culture conversions&#xD;
      to negative after 2 month of treatment. In another study, treatment with a weekly regimen of&#xD;
      rifapentine and moxifloxacin during the continuation phase of therapy (for a total TB&#xD;
      treatment for 6 months) was not inferior to daily isoniazid plus rifampin; the efficacy of&#xD;
      rifapentine plus moxifloxacin in this trial was important because once-weekly rifapentine&#xD;
      with isoniazid (instead of moxifloxacin) was associated with a higher frequency of relapse&#xD;
      and treatment failure. In the REMox phase 3 trial, randomized double-blind trial to test&#xD;
      non-inferiority of a seventeen weeks of isoniazid, rifampicin and moxifloxacin supplemented&#xD;
      by pyrazinamide for the first eight weeks (INH-arm) compared to standard 6 months of rifampin&#xD;
      based regimen for tuberculosis, the number of participants classified as favorable in the&#xD;
      control regimen per protocol was 467 (92%) and in the INH-arm 436 (85%) a difference of 6.1%&#xD;
      (97.5% CI 1.7-10.5). In this trial, the moxifloxacin containing regimen was more bactericidal&#xD;
      than the control regimen, but there was insufficient activity to permit a&#xD;
      rifampin-moxifloxacin regimen to be shortened to 4 months. The relationship between&#xD;
      moxifloxacin concentrations and TB treatment outcomes when moxifloxacin is given as part of&#xD;
      high-dose rifapentine-based multidrug treatment for drug-sensitive TB is unknown. Further,&#xD;
      the target exposure of moxifloxacin for treatment of TB has not been defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Intensive and &quot;Late&quot; PK Samplings for Rifapentine at Two Different Occasions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autoinduction has been described previously with daily dosing of rifamycins, including&#xD;
      rifampin and rifapentine. With autoinduction of metabolizing enzymes or transporters, both&#xD;
      bioavailability and clearance can theoretically be affected. In a population PK model from&#xD;
      healthy volunteers, rifapentine clearance appeared to be time-dependent, whereas time had a&#xD;
      less significant effect on bioavailability. In addition, there was no clear relationship&#xD;
      between dose and clearance, or dose and the effects of time on clearance. Further in this&#xD;
      prior study, the time to maximal autoinduction with daily dosing could not be estimated as&#xD;
      increases in clearance were seen up until the final PK sampling day after 14 days of dosing.&#xD;
      PK sampling over longer dosing intervals is required to determine the time course of&#xD;
      autoinduction and the change in exposures over time with repeated dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from this PK study is needed to fill this knowledge gap, and to model the&#xD;
      population PK model parameters without bias and with satisfactory precision (relative&#xD;
      standard error &lt; 20%). Reiterated simulations and re-estimations (&quot;sse&quot;) of rifapentine data&#xD;
      in Study 29-29X were performed to assess the optimal Study 31 PK/PD design for: (1)&#xD;
      between-subject variability (BSV) and precision of the population PK parameters, and (2) the&#xD;
      longitudinal component of rifapentine clearance by autoinduction. Uncertainty in parameter&#xD;
      estimates (RSE) of &lt;10% was considered acceptable for the population PK parameters and &lt; 20%&#xD;
      for the parameter describing autoinduction. These simulations indicated that for the&#xD;
      parameter describing rifapentine auto-induction, it is important that multiple PK samplings&#xD;
      are obtained, and that PK sampling occasions be time-balanced. If this is not performed, the&#xD;
      uncertainty of the longitudinal change in clearance substantially increases, i.e. a protocol&#xD;
      design with only one initial PK sampling is not able to identify longitudinal change in&#xD;
      clearance with satisfactory precision, and leads to high uncertainty in parameter estimates.&#xD;
      A parsimonious design that efficiently assesses longitudinal changes in clearance with&#xD;
      adequate certainty and limited costs, will include the following features: (i) a minimum of&#xD;
      60 participants; (ii) intensive PK sampling (6 optimal samples/participant (times = 0.5, 3,&#xD;
      6, 9, 12, 24 hours) on at least one occasion; and (iii) late sampling with 2 to 3 PK samples&#xD;
      at another, later occasion separated by a minimum of 14 days. In summary, this PK/PD Study is&#xD;
      valuable because, it will allow a robust development of population PK model parameters for&#xD;
      rifapentine and for moxifloxacin in presence of high-dose rifapentine, and evaluate the PK/PD&#xD;
      relationships of study drugs with efficacy outcomes.&#xD;
