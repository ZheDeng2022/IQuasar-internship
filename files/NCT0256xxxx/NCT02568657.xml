  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is responsible for around 25% of maternal mortality worldwide&#xD;
      reaching as high as 60% in some countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as loss of 500 mL or more in a vaginal delivery and 1 Litre&#xD;
      or more in a cesarean delivery.Also any blood loss that cause hemodynamic instability should&#xD;
      be considered a PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, WHO updated the guidelines for the management of PPH and retained placenta to&#xD;
      include: &quot;The use of intrauterine balloon tamponade is recommended for the treatment of PPH&#xD;
      due to uterine atony. This recommendation is now stronger than the previous guidelines. It&#xD;
      can be used for women who do not respond to uterotonics or if uterotonics are not available.&#xD;
      This procedure potentially can avoid surgery and is appropriate while awaiting transfer to a&#xD;
      higher-level facility&quot;.Furthermore, FIGO included Uterine balloon tamponade as a recommended&#xD;
      second-line intervention for the treatment of PPH in their updated guidelines issued in 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2006, the ACOG Practice Bulletin, published by the American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists, made mention of the Bakri postpartum balloon for its specifically tailored&#xD;
      design that enables conservative management of uterine bleeding in cases of uterine atony and&#xD;
      other causes of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reports demonstrated that balloon tamponade is helpful in managing PPH secondary to a&#xD;
      wide variety of causes in resource-poor settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the new methods that could be used to control PPH is Uterine packing with&#xD;
      chitosan-covered gauze or Celox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celox Haemostats are dressings with natural material called chitosan to control major&#xD;
      haemorrhage including life-threatening bleeding . They are simple and effective, stopping&#xD;
      major bleeding.It was first used by military forces to stop sever bleeding in the scene with&#xD;
      no other options to stop bleeding. Celox™ granules are actually very high surface area&#xD;
      flakes. When they come in contact with blood, Celox™ swells, gels, and sticks together to&#xD;
      make a gel like clot, without generating any heat. Celox™ does not set off the normal&#xD;
      clotting cascade, it only clots the blood it comes directly into contact with. Celox works on&#xD;
      casualties using anticoagulants and anti-platelet therapy such as aspirin .&#xD;

&#xD;
      We will be having two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Celox group:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Celox placement is very simpe . During cesarean section celox is loaded in the lower&#xD;
           uterine segment and part of it is passed through the cervix to the vagina. If PPH occurs&#xD;
           after vaginal delivery the celox is inserted through the cervix to pack the lower&#xD;
           uterine segment. Removal of Celox after 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Bakri balloon group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before insertion the balloon, ensure that the bladder is empty by placing a Foley catheter.&#xD;
      Grasp the cervix with ring forceps. Insert the balloon into the cavity of the uterus under&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance; making sure that the entire portion of the balloon passes the cervical&#xD;
      canal above the internal cervical os. Once the correct placement is confirmed, inflate the&#xD;
      balloon with sterile saline using the enclosed syringe.&#xD;
