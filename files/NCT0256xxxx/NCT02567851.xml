  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An early phase II, single arm, two stage study, to investigate the level of activity,&#xD;
      duration of response and tolerability of brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35), as a single agent,&#xD;
      utilising a response adapted approach, in older, frailer or co-morbid patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opened Feb 2014 and will recruit over 18 months. Duration of treatment will be dependent on&#xD;
      the patients' response (see schema below) with a maximum of 16 cycles over 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of treatment patients will be assessed clinically at 3 months intervals and by CT&#xD;
      scan at 15, 18, 24 and 36 months. For those still alive and disease free after 2 years,&#xD;
      follow-up will be according to local practice.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 will recruit 20 patients. If at least patients 8 respond after the initial 4 cycles&#xD;
      of SGN-35 a further 10 patients will be recruited to stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases brentuximab vedotin will be administered at an initial dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3&#xD;
      weeks as a 30-minute outpatient i.v. infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline staging (including PET and CT scans (PET0 + CT0), performed on PET scanners&#xD;
      approved for the purpose by The PET Imaging Centre at St Thomas'/Guy's), all eligible and&#xD;
      consenting patients will receive an initial 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin following which&#xD;
      response and continuation of brentuximab vedotin will be assessed by PET (PET4) in the first&#xD;
      instance. Patients achieving CMR (Deauville score 1-3) will continue treatment. Patients&#xD;
      achieving PMR (Deauville score 4,5 with uptake less than baseline) will also continue&#xD;
      treatment. Patients achieving NMR (Deauville score 4,5 with no change in uptake from&#xD;
      baseline) or PMD (Deauville score 4,5 with increased intensity of uptake compared to baseline&#xD;
      and/or new lesions consistent with lymphoma) will stop brentuximab vedotin and be considered&#xD;
      for alternative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT4 will be performed for future comparison with CT8, CT12 and CT 16 (to exclude Progressive&#xD;
      Disease (PD) and to correlate metabolic and radiological responses) and to inform continued&#xD;
      treatment. Patients not achieving Deauville score 1-3 at PET 4 will also have a PET scan at&#xD;
      completion of treatment (after 16 cycles or earlier if brentuximab vedotin discontinued for&#xD;
      reasons other than PD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition an exploratory PET scan will be performed after 2 cycles of brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      (PET2); investigators will be blinded to the results of PET2 which will not influence patient&#xD;
      management in any way. All PET scans will be centrally reviewed for QA purposes by The PET&#xD;
      Imaging Centre at St Thomas'/Guy's, under the supervision of Sally Barrington and Mike&#xD;
      O'Doherty, using the framework developed for the recently completed RAPID and RATHL trials.&#xD;
      CT scans after 4 cycles and at the end of treatment may also be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin, subsequent treatment will be response&#xD;
      adapted according to PET scan result the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those with a Complete Metabolic Response (CMR, Deauville Score 1, 2 or 3) at PET 4 will&#xD;
           receive up to 12 additional cycles of brentuximab vedotin (maximum of 16 cycles)&#xD;
           depending on no evidence of PD by a CT scan performed after each group of 4 cycles of&#xD;
           brentuximab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with a Partial Metabolic Response (PMR) at PET4 will receive up to 12&#xD;
           additional cycles of brentuximab vedotin (maximum of 16 cycles) depending on no evidence&#xD;
           of PD on a CT scan performed after each group of 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with No Metabolic Response (NMR) will stop brentuximab vedotin and be&#xD;
           considered for alternative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with progressive disease at any time as determined by either CT or PET scan&#xD;
           performed after each group of 4 cycles of brentuximab vedotin or in response to clinical&#xD;
           concerns will stop study treatment and receive subsequent therapy at investigator&#xD;
           discretion. Clinical concerns over PD should be confirmed by either a CT or PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who come off treatment with brentuximab vedotin for any other reason (toxicity,&#xD;
           patient decision, investigator advice) should have a CT scan performed for response&#xD;
           assessment. In addition patients with Partial Metabolic Response at PET 4 should also&#xD;
           have a PET scan performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have not progressed irrespective of how many cycles of brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      received will be clinically assessed every 3 months and have a CT scan at months 3, 6, 9, 12.&#xD;
      These scan may take place during therapy. During follow-up CT scans will be performed 15, 18,&#xD;
      24 and 36 months from the start of treatment. For those still alive and disease-free after 3&#xD;
      years following start of treatment, follow-up will be according to local practice but data&#xD;
      recorded must include date of progressive disease, type of any subsequent therapies, date and&#xD;
      cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who progress at any time, follow-up will be according to local practice but data&#xD;
      must be recorded for 5 years form the start of treatment and must include date of progressive&#xD;
      disease, type of any subsequent therapies, date and cause of death.&#xD;
