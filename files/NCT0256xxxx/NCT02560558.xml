  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to transition patients who have been stable on Belatacept for&#xD;
      one year after kidney transplant from standard 4-week to an investigational 8-week belatacept&#xD;
      dosing schedule. The investigators hypothesize that renal function and acute rejection rates&#xD;
      will be non-inferior with 8-week belatacept dosing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current dosing protocol for patients who have undergone a kidney transplant requires that&#xD;
      Belatacept be given as an infusion every 4 weeks. The investigator wants to assess if the&#xD;
      patients who have been stable for one year after transplant can be safely transitioned to an&#xD;
      8-week Belatacept infusion schedule. Renal function and any episodes of acute rejection will&#xD;
      be closely monitored.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) at 12 Months From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mean estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) will be calculated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation using serum creatinine measurements and the patient's age, gender, and race. An eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 indicates lower renal function.</description>
