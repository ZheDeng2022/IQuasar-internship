      This study is aimed at assessing the safety of candidate Hepatitis C (Hep C) vaccines&#xD;
      AdCh3NSmut1 and MVA-NSmut when administered to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#xD;
      seropositive individuals. This study also aims to assess the cellular immune response&#xD;
      generated by these vaccines when administered as mentioned above.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C (Hep C) is a common infection. Worldwide, over 180 million people are infected.&#xD;
      Hep C is a blood borne viral infection spread through direct contact with the blood of an&#xD;
      infected person. People with Hep C frequently have no symptoms and infection can lead to&#xD;
      fibrosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure and cancer. Infection with the Hep C virus&#xD;
      (HCV) progresses more rapidly to liver damage in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel candidate vaccine against HCV&#xD;
      ('NSmut'). This vaccine has been inserted into the carrier viruses Chimpanzee Adenovirus 3&#xD;
      (AdCh3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both of which have excellent safety records&#xD;
      and have been previously tested in people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the objective of this study is to use exploratory immunological assays to assess&#xD;
      whether vaccines for Hep C can induce immune responses in HIV positive individuals that are&#xD;
      similar in strength to those in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
