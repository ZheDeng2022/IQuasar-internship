      Data on transgenerational effects following nuclear accidents are important for understanding&#xD;
      fully the consequences of parental exposure to ionizing radiation. Few studies to date have&#xD;
      had adequate statistical power to detect effects of the magnitude expected based on animal&#xD;
      data, and most have not been of low-dose, protracted exposures associated with nuclear&#xD;
      accidents and their aftermath. Although, to date, scant use has been made of the new genomic&#xD;
      technologies, in Chernobyl-exposed areas of Ukraine and Belarus, excess minisatellite&#xD;
      mutations have been seen in children born after the accident. We propose a study of&#xD;
      parent-child trios in which at least one parent was exposed to Chernobyl radiation as a&#xD;
      clean-up worker (mean dose &gt;=100 mGy) and/or evacuee from a contaminated area (mean &gt;=&#xD;
      50mGy). The specific aims are to investigate the transgenerational and de novo mutation rates&#xD;
      of the spectrum of genetic variants in trios, in particular looking at effects in children&#xD;
      and mapping them to possible parental origin of the chromsome. Together with long-term&#xD;
      collaborators at the Research Center for Radiation Medicine (RCRM) in Kiev, epidemiologic&#xD;
      data will be collected for up to 450 trios of parents with preconceptional doses and their&#xD;
      unexposed offspring. We will use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to characterize the&#xD;
      landscape of the genomes of the trios to determine whether parental radiation exposure is&#xD;
      associated with genetic mutations transmitted to the offspring, by examining de novo mutation&#xD;
      rates, minisatellite mutations, copy number alterations, and variations in telomere length.&#xD;
      The analysis will be conducted in peripheral blood and/or buccal samples (when blood is not&#xD;
      available) from complete father-mother-child trios. Doses to the gonads from the time of the&#xD;
      accident to the time of conception will be reconstructed for all parents using existing&#xD;
      records supplemented by interview data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trio subjects will be selected from representative populations exposed to radiation from&#xD;
      Chernobyl who are under active follow-up in the Clinico-Epidemiologic Registry at RCRM. To&#xD;
      help identify specific effects of paternal and maternal radiation exposure, we will initially&#xD;
      select sets of trio subjects in five categories: (1) exposed father, unexposed mother; (2)&#xD;
      unexposed father, exposed mother; (3) both parents exposed; (4) both parents unexposed; and&#xD;
      (5) a group of high dose emergency workers with acute radiation syndrome. All trio members&#xD;
      will be invited to the RCRM outpatient clinic for collection of a 20 ml blood sample (or&#xD;
      buccal cells for those who refuse phlebotomy). Both parents will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      general questionnaire to obtain demographic and lifestyle data. Then one or both will&#xD;
      complete detailed dosimetry questionnaires, based on forms used in previous collaborations&#xD;
      with RCRM and administered by specially trained interviewers. Once 50 trios have been&#xD;
      recruited (10 from each of the 5 exposure categories), we will conduct an interim evaluation&#xD;
      of participation rates, sample collection and quality, and dose reconstruction in order to&#xD;
      modify the protocol as needed. The analytical approach will be to correlate the extent,&#xD;
      especially for de novo events of genetic alterations in the offspring with parental&#xD;
      preconceptional radiation dose overall and by parental origin. The statistical power in&#xD;
      relation to de novo mutations is very high, in excess of 90%, but somewhat lower for trends&#xD;
      in minisatellite mutations. Study findings will contribute importantly to knowledge of the&#xD;
      heritable effects of moderate- and low-dose radiation exposure in humans and to radiation&#xD;
      risk projection. Eventually data from the Trio Study may be shared with the international&#xD;
      community through dbGap.&#xD;

        The Clinical-Epidemiological Registry (CER) of the RCRM will serve as the fundamental&#xD;
        information source for the identification of potential trio subjects. The CER was&#xD;
        established in 1992 for long-term extended active follow-up of representative populations&#xD;
        exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (ChNPP)accident,&#xD;
        drawn from those listed in the State Chernobyl Registry. The study will include all&#xD;
        parent-offspring trios/quartets selected from the group of approximately 450 trios with&#xD;
        offspring born 42 or more weeks after the last significant parental Chernobyl-related&#xD;
        exposure.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  all parent-offspring trios/quartets selected from the group of approximately 450 trios&#xD;
             with offspring born 42 or more weeks after the last significant parental&#xD;
             Chernobyl-related exposure. ---The offspring can be of either sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be an adult&#xD;
&#xD;
        (age (Bullet) 18 years at interview);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If more than one child is born to a given set of parents, the first and last such&#xD;
             eligible siblings will be selected for participation, in the interests of maximizing&#xD;
             the variation of time from last exposure to conception, also to maximize the signal&#xD;
             (by including offspring closest in time to the exposure, with less likelihood of&#xD;
             removal of damaged sperm/oocytes, and by including offspring furthest in time from the&#xD;
             exposure, with less likelihood of direct exposure of the child, and maximizing&#xD;
             cumulative parental preconception gonadal dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Twins will be especially informative given the comparable exposures in utero and in&#xD;
             early life. A high proportion of the trios/quartets currently reside in Kyiv. The&#xD;
             majority of these trios/quartets have undergone regular medical examinations as a&#xD;
             result of follow-up by the CER. Most of them are expected to be alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who cannot be located&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with offspring born within 42 weeks of the last significant Chernobyl-related&#xD;
             exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those parents or offspring found to have cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who refuse to participate in the study, or who do not provide informed consent.&#xD;
