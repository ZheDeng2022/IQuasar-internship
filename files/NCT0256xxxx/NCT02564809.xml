    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 8-week proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial to&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of efficacy of Fit Brains (Rosetta Stone Canada) training -- a&#xD;
      mobile cognitive training program -- on cognitive and brain plasticity in older adults. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore whether Fit Brains training paired with a brief bout of&#xD;
      exercise would enhance the potential cognitive benefits of Fit Brains. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the long-term effects of cognitive training by performing a 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up measurement (i.e., 1-year after study completion).&#xD;

      This study will look at the effect of FBT on cognitive function in older adults.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators aim to explore whether a single bout of aerobic exercise&#xD;
      prior to Fit Brains training would magnify the training effect on both cognitive and brain&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To compare the effect of Fit Brains training (FBT) and the effect of a single bout of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise prior to FBT (Ex-FBT) with a Balanced And Tone (BAT; control) program on&#xD;
      cognitive performance in both older adults; 2) To explore the effect of FBT and Ex-FBT with&#xD;
      BAT on brain structure and function i; 3) To explore whether the intervention effects (i.e.,&#xD;
      FBT and Ex-FBT) are moderated by cognitive status (i.e., MCI or not); 4) To explore whether&#xD;
      Ex-FBT has additional benefits compared with FBT; and 5) To explore whether potential&#xD;
      benefits are maintained at 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct an 8-week proof-of-concept, assessor single-blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) with 120 older adults (i.e., 40 in each experimental group). A subset&#xD;
      of participants will perform MRI scans at baseline and 8-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce bias, all assessors will be blinded to group allocation of participants.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups (i.e., FBT, Ex-FBT, or&#xD;
      SCT). Participants in the FBT group will be required to attend 3 formal training sessions per&#xD;
      week, for 8 weeks, at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health or the Centre for Hip&#xD;
      Health and Mobility. Each session will be for 60 minutes. Additionally, the participants will&#xD;
      be asked to complete 3 additional one-hour training sessions at home per week. Thus, the&#xD;
      participants will complete a total of 48 hours of cognitive training over 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomized to Ex-FBT will be required to attend 3 formal training&#xD;
      sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health or Centre&#xD;
      for Hip Health and Mobility. Each session will be for 1 hour. The participants will start the&#xD;
      training with a 15-minute walk outside. The 15-minute walk is followed by a 45-minute FBT&#xD;
      session (FBT program). Additionally, participants will be asked to complete 3 additional&#xD;
      1-hour training sessions at home (i.e., 15-minute walk followed by 45-minutes of FBT&#xD;
      training). Thus, the participants will complete a total of 48 hours of cognitive + walking&#xD;
      training over 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are randomly assigned to the BAT group will be required to attend 3 formal&#xD;
      training sessions per week, for 8 weeks, at both the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain&#xD;
      Health and/or the Centre for Hip Health and Mobility. Specifically, the participants will&#xD;
      complete a total of 8 hours of sham cognitive training, 8 hours of sham exercise training&#xD;
      (Centre for Hip Health and Mobility) and 8 hours of education over the 8 weeks. Thus, the&#xD;
      participants will complete a total of 24 hours of sham training over 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>These hourly classes will consist of cognitive brain training (Fit Brains by Rosetta Stone) on a mobile device (tablet/iPad). Fit Brains offers 60+ different training games, each targeting one of five cognitive domains - executive functions, memory, concentration/attention, visual-spatial ability, and processing speed. Each game lasts exactly 60 seconds during which individuals aim to answer as many questions correctly. The difficulty of the game increases after each correct answer. Each game has three level of difficulty: 1) novice; 2) intermediate; and 3) advanced.</description>
