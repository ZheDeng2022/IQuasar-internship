  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this trial is to determine whether lymphadenectomy, used to restrict&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy (other than vaginal brachytherapy) to node positive women, results in a&#xD;
      non-inferior survival as compared to adjuvant therapy given to all women with high risk&#xD;
      apparent stage 1 endometrial cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results from this trial have the potential to change practice whatever the results: either&#xD;
      lymphadenectomy will become recommended practice if a non-inferior outcome is obtained;&#xD;
      otherwise the procedure can be safely abandoned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease-free, endometrial cancer-event free and endometrial cancer-specific survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distribution of pelvic and extra-pelvic relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also two sub-studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of life - all patients i. Describe the trajectory of key patient reported&#xD;
           outcomes (PROs) from baseline up to 5 years post-surgery ii. Compare the specific PRO&#xD;
           domains between the trial arms at several specific time points iii. Determine the&#xD;
           proportion of women in each trial arm reporting long-term symptoms after treatment as&#xD;
           measured by the symptom-specific subscales of the measures (gastrointestinal symptoms,&#xD;
           urological symptoms, attitude to disease and treatment, vaginal symptoms, lymphoedema)&#xD;
           iv. Determine the correlation between physician rating (CTCAE v4.03) and patient-report&#xD;
           (corresponding PRO subscale) for various symptoms reported by both physicians and&#xD;
           patients v. Assess the correlation between self-assessed lymphoedema (Self-report&#xD;
           lower-extremity lymphoedema screening questionnaire) and the lymphoedema subscale of the&#xD;
           Quality of Life Questionnaire-Endometrial Cancer Module (QLQ-EN24)&#xD;
&#xD;
           We hypothesise that quality of life will be better in patients in the lymphadenectomy&#xD;
           arm because a considerable proportion will be spared systemic adjuvant treatment, from&#xD;
           which they may not benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) - optional for Arm 1 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this sub-study is to assess SLN status in comparison with the overall lymph node&#xD;
      status after full lymph node dissection (LND), and so determine whether SLN is as accurate as&#xD;
      systematic node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. We aim to determine the diagnostic performance of the SLN procedure compared to the gold&#xD;
      standard of LND ii. To evaluate whether SLN status is a prognostic marker of survival iii. To&#xD;
      model patient relapse and survival based on low volume micro-metastatic (LVM) and individual&#xD;
      tumour cell (ITC) status&#xD;
