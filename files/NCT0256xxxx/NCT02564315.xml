      Relapse after a serious quit attempt occurs in 70-90% of smokers who try to quit smoking.&#xD;
      This study utilizes a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design - - an&#xD;
      innovative multi-phase approach - - to test post-relapse treatments designed to assist&#xD;
      smokers to make a new, successful quit attempt. This study will test Relapse Recovery (RR)&#xD;
      treatments that are applied at two stages following relapse: 1) RR Preparation Phase&#xD;
      treatments for smokers who relapse after an initial quit attempt, and 2) RR Cessation Phase&#xD;
      treatments for relapsed smokers who decide to make a new quit attempt. Smokers motivated to&#xD;
      quit smoking will make an initial quit attempt in the Quit Phase (cessation medication +&#xD;
      counseling). Participants who relapse will be randomized to one of three RR Preparation Phase&#xD;
      treatments (Behavioral [Smoking] Reduction Counseling + the Nicotine Mini-Lozenge; Recycling&#xD;
      Counseling that encourages participants to quit again as soon as possible; and Preparation&#xD;
      Phase Control). RR Preparation Phase participants (other than controls) who elect to try a&#xD;
      new quit attempt will be randomized to one of four RR Cessation Phase treatments based on a&#xD;
      2X2 fully-crossed factorial design testing two factors: Supportive Counseling (vs. Brief&#xD;
      Information) and Skill Training (vs. Brief Information). All RR Cessation Phase participants&#xD;
      will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch + nicotine&#xD;
      mini-lozenge). The investigators hypothesize that RR Preparation Phase Reduction treatment&#xD;
      will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates relative to the Preparation Phase&#xD;
      Control condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify effective Relapse Recovery (RR) treatments to assist smokers who&#xD;
      relapse after an initial quit attempt. The study will use a sequential, multiple assignment,&#xD;
      randomized trial (SMART) design with three phases. In a SMART design, randomization occurs at&#xD;
      more than one stage, with randomization at a later stage based on response to treatment at an&#xD;
      earlier stage. The three phases in this SMART study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1 consists of the Quit Phase in which all participants (smokers motivated to quit&#xD;
           smoking) will be offered evidence-based cessation treatment (cessation medication plus&#xD;
           counseling). Participants who relapse will be eligible to proceed to the next phase&#xD;
           which involves Relapse Recovery (RR) Preparation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2 consists of RR Preparation Phase treatments in which relapsed participants from&#xD;
           the Quit Phase will be randomized to three arms: (a) Recycling Counseling (where&#xD;
           participants are encouraged to quit again as soon as possible); (b) Behavioral Reduction&#xD;
           Counseling + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge (which targets smoking reduction and preparation for&#xD;
           a new quit attempt); and (c) Preparation Phase Control (continuation of Quit Phase&#xD;
           treatment plus advice to seek additional help from the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line or&#xD;
           their clinic care provider).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3 consists of RR Cessation Phase treatments in which non-control (i.e. Recycling&#xD;
           or Behavioral Reduction) Preparation Phase participants who elect to make a new quit&#xD;
           attempt will be randomized to one of four treatment conditions in a 2X2 fully-crossed&#xD;
           factorial design: (a) Supportive Counseling + Skill Training; (b) Supportive Counseling&#xD;
           + Brief Information; (c) Skill Training + Brief Information; and (d) Brief Information&#xD;
           Only. All participants will receive 8 weeks of combination nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
           (Nicotine Patch + Nicotine Mini-Lozenge). Brief Information will consist of generic&#xD;
           information about the importance of taking the medication and how to use it, information&#xD;
           about side effects/safety and what to do in case of problems, and participants will also&#xD;
           be given encouragement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking status will be assessed 14 months after randomization to RR Preparation Phase&#xD;
      treatment. The investigators hypothesize that 7-day point point-prevalence abstinence rates&#xD;
      will be 15% for the Preparation Phase Control condition, 25% for the Recycling condition, and&#xD;
      35% for the Behavioral Reduction condition. The investigators propose that any increase in&#xD;
      abstinence of 15% or higher would be clinically significant. The investigators did not power&#xD;
      the study to demonstrate a significant difference between the two active RR Preparation Phase&#xD;
      treatments. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that only the RR Behavioral Reduction&#xD;
      treatment will significantly increase long-term abstinence rates (primary outcome:&#xD;
      Biochemically-confirmed 7-Day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 14 Months post-randomization to&#xD;
      Phase 2 Preparation treatment) over those produced by the Preparation Phase Control&#xD;
      condition. Because of limitations in statistical power, analyses of RR Cessation Phase&#xD;
      treatments will be exploratory only (secondary outcome: Self-Reported 7-Day Point Prevalence&#xD;
      Abstinence at 26 Weeks post-randomization to Phase 3 Cessation treatment).&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to receive this treatment receive manual-based counseling calls and visits over the course of 11 months. The ultimate goal will be smoking that is reduced in amount and location. Case managers and participants will collaboratively identify a set of steps to progressively reduce smoking. The primary vehicles for change are to encourage substitution of the nicotine mini-lozenge for cigarettes and to reduce the contexts in which smoking occurs. Counseling will counter post-lapse demoralization by emphasizing participants' progress, the value of smoking reduction as a transitional goal, and the critical value of ongoing treatment engagement. Evidence of progress in reduction of smoking, and smoking contexts will be used to build self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Skill training Counseling will: 1) carefully assess smoking cue contexts and opportunities to smoke, to identify problems encountered in the prior quit attempt; 2) develop specific plans for avoiding such contexts and identify skills for coping with them; 3) develop plans for negotiating with others who smoke; 4) develop lifestyle changes to reduce future smoking opportunities and contexts; and 5) assign homework and assess execution of assigned skills. Participants will receive coping menus that provide personalized coping/avoidance options and &quot;coping reports&quot; that assess coping execution over time and troublesome contexts and cues around which counseling will be focused. There will be praise for any progress and a collaborative determination of barriers to skill execution.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive 8-weeks of combination NRT (nicotine patch + nicotine mini-lozenge). Nicotine patch dosing will be based on current cigarettes smoked per day, per package insert: for those who currently smoke &gt;10 cigs/day=4 weeks of 21 mg, 2 weeks of 14 mg, and 2 weeks of 7 mg nicotine patches, along with nicotine mini-lozenges; for those who currently smoke &lt;=10 cigs/day=6 weeks of 14 mg and 2 weeks of 7 mg nicotine patches along with mini-lozenges. Mini-lozenge dosing will be based on how soon participants currently smoke after waking before their initial quit attempt and will be consistent with the package insert (4 mg for participants who smoke within 30 minutes of waking and 2 mg for participants smoke more than 30 minutes after waking).</description>
