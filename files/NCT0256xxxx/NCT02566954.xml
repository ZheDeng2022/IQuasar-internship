      The study will be in 3 parts: first one will be to address the key question of the lower limb&#xD;
      frontal alignment based on both three-dimensional measurements of low-dose bi-planar X-rays&#xD;
      and foot morphology assessment. Indeed, a major issue in the management of lower limb&#xD;
      disorders is the ability to correctly assess abnormal development and decide on the most&#xD;
      adapted treatment option. In particular, the link between lower limb disorders and foot&#xD;
      morphology remain unclear. Recently, quantitative 3D measurement of the lower limb in&#xD;
      children has been successfully assessed using low-dose biplanar X-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second part will be to assess the reproducibility of the 3dimensional reconstructions whether&#xD;
      they are made by a radiology technician, or by a so-called expert through collecting datas&#xD;
      from 3 centers of pediatric surgery where EOS Imaging system is daily used to get spine or&#xD;
      lower limb X-Rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last part will be to work on the recently developed weight-bearing foot 3D reconstruction&#xD;
      method for clinical use using the Parametric Personalized Modelling approach (PPM). This will&#xD;
      allow having a better understanding and evaluation of foot's anatomy and patho-anatomy.&#xD;

      The study will be in 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First one will be to address the key question of the lower limb frontal alignment based on&#xD;
      both three-dimensional measurements of low-dose bi-planar X-rays and foot morphology&#xD;
      assessment. Indeed, a major issue in the management of lower limb disorders is the ability to&#xD;
      correctly assess abnormal development and decide on the most adapted treatment option. In&#xD;
      particular, the link between lower limb disorders and foot morphology remain unclear.&#xD;
      Recently, quantitative 3D measurement of the lower limb in children has been successfully&#xD;
      assessed using low-dose biplanar X-rays. The population studied will be 133 patients, aged 6&#xD;
      to 16 years old, for whom a lower limb standing X-ray is required for a medical reason not&#xD;
      interfering with torsional or longitudinal axis of the limb (such as, for example, patients&#xD;
      consulting for non-specific lower limb pain). All patients will have low-dose biplanar X-rays&#xD;
      using the EOS® system (EOS® Imaging, France). From the EOS® bi-planar images, a 3D&#xD;
      patient-specific parametric model of the lower limbs will be obtained. The clinical indices&#xD;
      (i.e. mechanical femoral (MFA) and mechanical tibial (MTA) angles, Hip Knee Shaft angle (HKS)&#xD;
      and femoro tibial angle (FTA)) will then be automatically computed. For each clinical&#xD;
      parameter, the mean value and standard deviation will be calculated, depending on the age&#xD;
      group, gender, and on foot morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second part is to assess the reproducibility of the 3dimensional reconstructions whether they&#xD;
      are made by a radiology technician, or by a so-called expert through collecting datas from 3&#xD;
      centers of pediatric surgery where EOS Imaging system is daily used to get spine or lower&#xD;
      limb X-Rays. The investigators will include 20 children, divided as follow: six typically&#xD;
      developing ones (control X-Rays or lower limb standing X-ray required for a medical reason&#xD;
      not interfering with torsional or longitudinal axis of the limb), 6 non-typically developing&#xD;
      (by example children who underwent a lower limb fracture), 6 cerebral palsy ones, and 2&#xD;
      children with extreme lower limb deformities. Reconstructions will be done twice in each&#xD;
      center: once by a qualified operator, senior orthopedic surgeon, who followed a practical&#xD;
      course, and once by a radiology technician, also used to the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First step will be to calculate the reproducibility for all parameters, depending on each&#xD;
      subgroup of patient. Then, for each parameter, outliers' values will be analyzed and&#xD;
      explained. They will be then suppressed from the datas to re-calculate the reproducibility.&#xD;
      Finally, reproducibility of the obtained parameters will be compared to the one published in&#xD;
      literature&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last part will be to work on the recently developed weight-bearing foot 3D reconstruction&#xD;
      method for clinical use using the Parametric Personalized Modelling approach (PPM). This will&#xD;
      allow having a better understanding and evaluation of foot's anatomy and patho-anatomy.&#xD;
