    <textblock>
      ADHD is associated with cognitive deficit. Therefore, cognitive training is often proposed as&#xD;
      an intervention for ADHD that targets cognitive deficits, with specific exercises through&#xD;
      intensive training sessions. This intervention is based on principles of brain plasticity and&#xD;
      cerebral functional reorganizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Working memory deficits constitute a key impairment in ADHD. That is why, Cogmed working&#xD;
      memory training is the most commonly used and studied cognitive training program in clinical&#xD;
      practice and research. It is clear from most studies that Cogmed training program increases&#xD;
      working memory in ADHD. However, transfer of learning is not demonstrated on: other cognitive&#xD;
      functions that are not targeted by the program, on ADHD symptoms, nor on academic&#xD;
      achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to this type of intervention multi-factorial program targeting different&#xD;
      cognitive function as Presco also exist but have been less studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these challenges, this study will follow a randomized and controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of cognitive training in comparison&#xD;
      with a control waiting-list group among children with ADHD on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ADHD symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cognitive functioning,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. attentional capacities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. academic achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to compare two types of cognitive training a unifactorial program&#xD;
      Cogmed targeting working memory and a multifactorial Presco focusing on different cognitive&#xD;
      functions affected by ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term effects are examined six months after training. Participants (n=90) will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the two experimental group (Cogmed or Presco) or to the control group&#xD;
      waiting list. Participants will be evaluated three time (time 1) just before the&#xD;
      intervention, (time 2) six weeks after the first evaluation, immediately after the&#xD;
      intervention and (time 3) six months after the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a chronic developmental disorder&#xD;
      characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that do not&#xD;
      correspond to the child's developmental level (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). For a&#xD;
      diagnosis to be confirmed, symptoms must be present before age 12 and must be observed in at&#xD;
      least to two domains of functioning, such as school, work, social interactions and family&#xD;
      life (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorder with a prevalence estimated at about&#xD;
      5-7% for school-age children (Psychiatric Association, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHD alters family, social and academic functioning as well as one's professional life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from studies indicated that working memory and inhibition are often altered in ADHD&#xD;
      in childhood and persist into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatments of ADHD mostly include psychostimulants (Amphetamine and&#xD;
      Methylphenidate) and non-stimulants (Atomoxetine, Clonidine, Guanfacine). Stimulants and&#xD;
      no-stimulants are effective in managing ADHD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these treatments present some limitation. For instance, comorbid disorders reduce&#xD;
      stimulants efficacy in ADHD. Further, long-term effects over the year of stimulant are not&#xD;
      yet known. Stimulants may cause side effects on sleep, hunger and growth. That is why some&#xD;
      parents are reluctant to let their children take stimulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, clinical guidelines recommend non-pharmacological interventions in conjunction&#xD;
      with medication for the treatment of ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned limitations to the use of medication stress the importance of developing&#xD;
      non-pharmacological approaches. Cognitive training is one type of non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention used in ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention consists in improving cognitive deficits through specific exercises during&#xD;
      intensive training session. A growing number of studies examined the impact of cognitive&#xD;
      training in ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive training is based on principles of brain plasticity with the aim to train cognitive&#xD;
      function and to improve cognitive deficits in ADHD. According to these authors, during&#xD;
      training changes occur in neural connection associated to ADHD. This modification allows far&#xD;
      transfers to cognitive function not targeted by the program, to ADHD symptoms and academic&#xD;
      performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from a meta-analysis indicated that 68% of 25 studies examining ADHD and cognitive&#xD;
      training focus on working memory. These authors specify that Cogmed Working Memory Training&#xD;
      is currently the most used and studied program. Indeed, this program is available in 25&#xD;
      countries and used by 150 clinical practitioners (http://www.cogmed.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, one meta-analysis including seven studies examines Cogmed Working Memory Training&#xD;
      program effects in ADHD. Results indicated that the impact of Cogmed on cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, ADHD symptoms and academic performance remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cogmed is an unifactorial program targeting working memory. In addition to this type of&#xD;
      intervention multi-factorial program targeting different cognitive function as Presco also&#xD;
      exist but has been less studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To address these challenges, this study will follow a randomized and controlled&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of cognitive training in comparison&#xD;
      with a control group among children with ADHD on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ADHD symptoms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cognitive functioning,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. attentional capacities&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. academic achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second objective is to compare two types of cognitive training a unifactorial program&#xD;
      Cogmed targeting working memory and a multifactorial Presco focusing on different cognitive&#xD;
      functions affected by ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term effects are examined six months after training. Procedure Participants (n=90) will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cogmed® : working memory training (unifactorial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presco® : different cognitive function are trained (multifactorial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control ( waiting list) Participants will be evaluated three time (time 1) just before&#xD;
           the intervention, (time 2) six weeks after the first evaluation, immediately after the&#xD;
           intervention and (time 3) six months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cogmed and Presco participants will train the same time. Before beginning the program an&#xD;
      appointment of one hour will be organized to present the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will train at home during 25 sessions (about 30-45 minutes each) over a maximum&#xD;
      of 5-6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A coach will call the participant one a week to verify program adherence. The coach will&#xD;
      verify participant results on internet before calling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cogmed working memory training CogMed® (RoboMemo,Cognitive Medical Systems AB, Stockholm)&#xD;
      version for children will be used in this program. Twelve exercises target verbal and&#xD;
      visio-spatial working memory. Difficulty is adjusted depending on participant performance's&#xD;
      The program PRESCO® (Program in Cognitive Stimulation and rehabilitation ) comprises 40&#xD;
      exercises targeting: verbal and visio spatial working memory, attention capacities,&#xD;
      reasoning, executive functioning , language and mental imagery. Only exercises targeting&#xD;
      verbal, visual spatial working memory, and attentional capacities altered in ADHD are used in&#xD;
      this present study. Difficulty is adjusted depending on the participant performances.&#xD;
