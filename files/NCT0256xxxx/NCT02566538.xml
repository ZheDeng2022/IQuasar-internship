  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is a long term process, starting early in life, and progressively affecting various&#xD;
      functions and organs. Cardiovascular diseases and cognitive impairment are two conditions&#xD;
      related to advancing age and sharing common risk factors. The Mona Lisa- PREDOR study is a&#xD;
      population-based prospective cohort study carried out to develop risk prediction algorithms&#xD;
      aimed at identifying people who are the most likely to develop impaired psychometric and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning and impaired cardiovascular risk, in the coming years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at identifying predictors of impaired changes in psychometric and&#xD;
      cognitive performances and level of cardiovascular risk, over a seven-year period, and to&#xD;
      develop risk prediction algorithms. Main secondary objectives are to study response to&#xD;
      psychometric and cognitive tests according to age, and to estimate the prevalence of the&#xD;
      frailty syndrome according to age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is a prospective cohort study carried out among 1500 men and women from the&#xD;
      general population, aged 42-89 years, and living in South-western France. Except for&#xD;
      participants aged 80-89 years, all participants have been previously assessed in 2005-2007,&#xD;
      as regard to their psychometric and cognitive performances and level of cardiovascular risk,&#xD;
      as part of the Mona Lisa study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes a detailed questionnaire on previous medical history, drug intake,&#xD;
      education level, and life habits; a standardised clinical examination; psychometric tests&#xD;
      (word list learning test, digit symbol substitution test, word fluency test and Stroop test),&#xD;
      and a fasting blood sample. Level of cardiovascular risk and frailty syndrome were assessed.&#xD;
