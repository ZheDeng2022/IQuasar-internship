  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a single-blind randomized clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      efficacy of a computerized cognitive remediation intervention program on improving locomotion&#xD;
      in sedentary seniors, a group at an especially high risk for disability. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that executive functions will respond to the cognitive remediation program and in turn&#xD;
      enhance locomotion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence indicates that Executive Functions play an important role in maintaining&#xD;
      locomotion in aging and preventing mobility disabilities. However, use of cognitive training&#xD;
      programs to improve executive functions as a strategy to increase mobility has not been&#xD;
      explored. Exciting results from the preliminary study support the efficacy and feasibility of&#xD;
      the cognitive remediation approach to improve locomotion in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premise of this clinical trial is that disability among seniors is a potentially&#xD;
      preventable chronic condition rather than an irreversible consequence of aging and disease.&#xD;
      The investigators proposed novel approach to locomotion has the potential to shift treatment&#xD;
      paradigms in the field of disability by introducing cognitive approaches to mobility that can&#xD;
      be applied to prevention and rehabilitation in diverse settings. Through this 'proof of&#xD;
      concept' secondary prevention trial the investigators will fill an important gap in knowledge&#xD;
      for practicing evidence-based medicine and developing effective interventions for a major&#xD;
      health outcome affecting a substantial proportion of the U.S. aging population.&#xD;

        <title>Gait Domains.</title>
        <description>Between group difference in change per arm in gait domains (summary measures reported as standard deviation units) derived from factor analysis of quantitative gait variables collected on an instrumented walkway during normal walking and walking while talking. Based on previous findings of gait patterns, pace, rhythm and variation factors are defined (using z-scores based on mean and standard deviation at baseline). Higher values are indicative of better performance for pace and rhythm factors and indicative of worse performance for variation factors.</description>

          <description>Between group difference in change per arm in gait domains (summary measures reported as standard deviation units) derived from factor analysis of quantitative gait variables collected on an instrumented walkway during normal walking and walking while talking. Based on previous findings of gait patterns, pace, rhythm and variation factors are defined (using z-scores based on mean and standard deviation at baseline). Higher values are indicative of better performance for pace and rhythm factors and indicative of worse performance for variation factors.</description>
