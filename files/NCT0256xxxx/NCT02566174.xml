      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer causes changes in the lives of patients and in the lives of their caregivers. Patients&#xD;
      and caregivers feel stress and they affect each other as they deal with these changes. They&#xD;
      each cope with cancer diagnosis and treatment on their own. They also cope together.&#xD;
      Researchers want to explore this shared change of roles and responsibilities. They will do&#xD;
      this by gaining insight into the social experience of cancer caregiving. They also want to&#xD;
      better understand the ways caregiver/patient teams manage the cancer diagnosis and&#xD;
      experience. This can help find new ways to support caregivers and their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the shared change of roles and responsibilities of patients and caregivers by&#xD;
      studying the social experience of cancer caregiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English speakers ages 18 and older who are one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cancer patients at the NIH Clinical Center (CC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A caregiver of a CC cancer patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have been screened by the CC.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Family caregiving is recognized as a significant public health problem, with approximately 66&#xD;
      million adult family caregivers in the United States providing services valued at an&#xD;
      estimated $450 billion per year. These individuals are considered informal caregivers, in&#xD;
      contrast to formal, paid caregivers such as nurses. Family caregivers suffer role strain and&#xD;
      burden of caring that increases their risk for morbidity and mortality, which is the reason&#xD;
      why they have been the focus of much caregiver research in recent decades. Improving health&#xD;
      outcomes for family caregivers of cancer patients has involved developing approaches to&#xD;
      reduce stress by boosting caregiver preparedness, mastery, and self-efficacy; however, in&#xD;
      recent years there has been a progressive shift in the way the cancer caregiving experience&#xD;
      has been characterized. This characterization has moved away from a focus on the individual&#xD;
      to a focus on the caregiver-patient dyad. This shift has occurred, in part, because research&#xD;
      has shown that each person in the dyad impacts the way in which the other person adjusts to&#xD;
      his/her new role and responsibilities. Thus, the way this occurs is important since these&#xD;
      adjustments not only influence the health of the dyadic relationship but also impact the&#xD;
      couple s overall well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current focus on mutual or dyadic coping with cancer diagnosis and treatment stems from the&#xD;
      understanding that caregivers and patients work individually, but also together to manage&#xD;
      their shared stress and to make meaning out of their mutual experience. Because of this,&#xD;
      mutuality and interdependence in dyadic coping extend beyond social support. Dyads&#xD;
      collaborate, negotiate, and problem-solve to jointly manage stress and make decisions related&#xD;
      to a diagnosis such as cancer. However, there has been little systematic inquiry into the&#xD;
      dynamics of shared role adjustment in the cancer family caregiving dyad even though the&#xD;
      stress of chronic illness appears to affect both the patient and the caregiver s well-being.&#xD;
      The social experience of managing an illness such as cancer and the adjustments made to&#xD;
      accommodate the new life situation are the first steps in what is often a prolonged disease&#xD;
      trajectory that will require many other changes and transitions along the way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective for this study conducted in phase one is to explore family&#xD;
      caregiver and care recipient mutual negotiation of roles and responsibilities by gaining&#xD;
      insight into the social experience of cancer family caregiving that will have application to&#xD;
      practice and guide further study. Phase two is contingent upon sample size, with the goal to&#xD;
      further explore quantitative measures of individual caregiver and patient as well as dyadic&#xD;
      well-being with regard to role adjustment and mutuality. A particular focus will be on dyads&#xD;
      who are flourishing and those who are collaborating, to determine what they are doing&#xD;
      differently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convergent parallel mixed methods study will be conducted using a grounded theory approach&#xD;
      to data collection and analysis. A purposive sample of cancer patient participants and their&#xD;
      designated family caregiver will be recruited from the National Institutes of Health Clinical&#xD;
      Center. Final sample size will depend on conceptual and theoretical saturation, with an&#xD;
      anticipated sample to include approximately 20 caregiver-patient dyads. A focused interview&#xD;
      guide with open ended questions and probes will be used. During data collection and analysis,&#xD;
      data will be compared to previous interviews and to the literature so that gaps in the&#xD;
      developing framework can be identified and questions for subsequent interviews adjusted. To&#xD;
      capture the experiences and perceptions of the interviewee, interviews with caregivers and&#xD;
      care recipient participants will be conducted separately and by the same researcher. During&#xD;
      analysis, both interviews will be analyzed on the level of the patient, of the family&#xD;
      caregiver, and of the dyadic interaction (e.g. of categories and themes) between the two.&#xD;
      Participants will also complete a socio-demographic questionnaire, Neuro QoL Ability to&#xD;
      Participate in Social Roles and Activities, and Satisfaction with Social Roles and&#xD;
      Activities-Short Forms, the Family Caregiving Inventory for Mutuality Scale, and the Mental&#xD;
      Health Continuum-Short Form. This quantitative data will be triangulated and merged with&#xD;
      conceptual categories from the caregiver and the care recipient interviews and will be used&#xD;
      to compare subgroups to further illuminate qualitative findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacrifices caregivers make can lead to burden and stress, or to positive adjustment and&#xD;
      growth. Through a better understanding of role adjustment and dyadic mutuality, we believe it&#xD;
      will be possible to identify novel ways to support caregivers and their patients as they cope&#xD;
      day to day and look toward the future.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient participants will be recruited if they are at least 18 years of age, have a cancer&#xD;
        diagnosis and are a patient at the NIH Clinical Center. They must be at least 6 weeks from&#xD;
        the end of active treatment, be in a cancer caregiving situation with a spouse, partner&#xD;
        (including non-traditional partner), significant other, family member or friend, be able to&#xD;
        read and write English, and participate in a verbal interview (either face to face or by&#xD;
        phone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caregiver Participants will be identified by the patient as the most involved in caregiving&#xD;
        and therefore most likely the designated caregiver. The dyadic relationship will be&#xD;
        co-defined and co-confirmed by both parties based on the researcher s understanding of&#xD;
        dyadic dynamics. Caregiver participants will also be at least 18 years of age, be a spouse&#xD;
        or partner (including non-traditional partner), significant other, family member or friend,&#xD;
        be involved in the cancer caregiving situation with the care recipient for at least 6&#xD;
        months, be able to read and write English, and be able to participate in a verbal interview&#xD;
        (either face to face or by phone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient participants will be excluded if under age 18, are not fully aware of diagnosis and&#xD;
        treatment, if they are not a spouse or partner , (including non-traditional partner),&#xD;
        significant other, family member or friend, if they are unable to participate in a verbal&#xD;
        interview (either face to face or by phone) or are unable to read&#xD;
&#xD;
        or write English. A patient who has enrolled with one caregiver cannot enroll with another&#xD;
        caregiver. A single caregiver must be identified for the duration of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caregiver Participants will be excluded if they are under age 18, are not the designated&#xD;
        person identified by the care recipient as being most involved in their care, and if they&#xD;
        are not a spouse or partner , (including non-traditional partner), significant other,&#xD;
        family member or friend, if they are unable to participate in a verbal interview (either by&#xD;
        face to face or by phone), or are unable to read or write English.&#xD;
