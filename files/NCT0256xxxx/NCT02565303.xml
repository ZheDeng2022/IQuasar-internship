  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ropivacaine is one of commonly used anesthetics for spinal anesthesia. Usually L2-3 or L3-4&#xD;
      intervertebral space is chosen for spinal anesthesia. The efficacy of ropivacaine injected&#xD;
      into subarachnoid space depends on the given dose and the chosen intervertebral space.&#xD;
      Appropriate dose could satisfy the requirement of operation and reduce incidence of the&#xD;
      adverse reaction. But it is not certain about the minimum effective dose of ropivacaine in&#xD;
      cesarean section through the two intervertebral spaces, respectively. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted to find the minimum effective doses for L2-3 and L3-4 spinal anesthesia in cesarean&#xD;
      section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some unexpected adverse reactions such as respiratory depression, vomiting, especially supine&#xD;
      hypotensive syndrome could caused by a high dose of anesthetic in cesarean section. The&#xD;
      investigators assumed that there be a minimum effective dose that will be associated with the&#xD;
      best possible performance of ropivacaine for different intervertebral spaces(L2-3 and L3-4 in&#xD;
      usual). That maybe enhance the comfort of parturient and safety of fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted as a prospective, randomized, up-down sequential dose of isobaric&#xD;
      ropivacaine in 3 mL that will provide effective analgesia for 50% of parturients in cesarean&#xD;
      section. The investigators use the combined spinal-epidural anesthesia(CSEA) technique in the&#xD;
      study. The initial dose of ropivacaine is chosen as 12 mg in L2-3 group and 15 mg in L3-4&#xD;
      group, and the testing interval is 0.5 mg with subsequent doses being determined by the&#xD;
      outcome of the previous injection in the same group. If the previous response is ineffective,&#xD;
      the next patient will receive 0.5 mg more than the last patient. If the response of the&#xD;
      previous patient is effective, the next patient decrease 0.5mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to rate the pain, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the&#xD;
      worst pain imaginable. Criteria for evaluation:(1) effective: after spinal anesthesia finish,&#xD;
      a dose that provide adequate sensory dermatomal anesthesia to pinprick to T6 or higher within&#xD;
      10 minutes, and the VAS is lower than or equal to 3 within 60minutes after skin incision; (2)&#xD;
      ineffective: if the initial plane of sensory dermatomal anesthesia is lower than T6 or VAS is&#xD;
      greater than 3 within 60 minutes after skin incision, the dose of ropivacaine is considered&#xD;
      inadequate and additional lidocaine is given through epidural catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor assessments are performed at the start of operation. Motor block in the lower limb is&#xD;
      assessed by a modified Bromage scale (0=no paralysis, 1=unable to raise extended leg,&#xD;
      2=unable to flex knee,3=unable to flex ankle). All of the assessments are made by an&#xD;
      anesthetist who is blinded to the group assignment as well as to the dose injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the investigators will compare the incidence of adverse reaction between&#xD;
      the L2-3 and L3-4 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method study design, 60 patients scheduled for&#xD;
      elective cesarean section will be included in the study, 30 for each group.&#xD;

    <description>Sensory block assessment will be evaluated with VAS and sensory dermatomal anesthesia. Criteria for evaluation of anesthetic efficacy:(1) effective: within 10 minutes after intrathecal injection, a dose that provides adequate sensory dermatomal anesthesia to pinprick to T6 or higher, and the VAS is lower than or equal to 3 within 60minutes after skin incision; (2) ineffective: the initial plane of sensory dermatomal anesthesia is lower than T6 or VAS is higher than 3 within 60 minutes after skin incision. VAS is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points, where 0 was no pain and 10 was the worst. A dermatome is an area of skin that is mainly supplied by a single spinal nerve.Usually the upper sensory dermatomal anesthesia is used to assess the effect of intrathecal anesthesia.</description>
