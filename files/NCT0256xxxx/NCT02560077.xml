  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cashew or Anacardium occidentale L. is a plant in a family of Anacardiaceae. The fruit of&#xD;
      cashew or cashew apple may be consumed fresh, but contains high quantities of tannins&#xD;
      yielding a bitter taste and dry mouth feel. Therefore, it is more often prepared as beverage.&#xD;
      It is rich in carbohydrate and vitamin C. It is also claimed for numerous ailments including&#xD;
      antitumor, antimicrobial, urease inhibitory and lipoxygenase activity. In addition, cashew&#xD;
      apple juice also has excellent anti-oxidant potential. The preclinical data also demonstrated&#xD;
      that cognitive deficit rats induced by cholinotoxin which received A.occidentale or cashew&#xD;
      fruit juice for 2 weeks showed the neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing effects.Therefore,&#xD;
      the potential benefit of Cashew apple juice on physical fitness and psychological fitness of&#xD;
      the middle aged and elderly is focused.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the age-related health problems are increasing their importance markedly due to&#xD;
      the increased elderly population. These problems produce the great socio-economic burdens of&#xD;
      country. In addition, the quality of both the elderly and their families are also decreased.&#xD;
      Therefore, the anti-aging strategy for the elderly has gained much attention. Based on the&#xD;
      role of oxidative stresses and free radicals on the age-related pathology, the development of&#xD;
      anti-aging health products from substances possessing antioxidant effect has been focused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cashew or Anacardium occidentale Linn, one of the economic plants in Thailand, is originated&#xD;
      from Latin America and possesses antioxidant effect. In Latin America, this plant is used as&#xD;
      anti-aging and memory enhancer. Data obtained from animal study also showed that cashew apple&#xD;
      juice could enhance memory and increased muscle performance and induced fatigue resistance.&#xD;
      Therefore, cashew apple has the potential to be developed as the physical and psychological&#xD;
      fitness enhancer heath product for the elderly. However, no scientific data are available&#xD;
      until now. Therefore, this study aimed to develop the cashew apple juice based functional&#xD;
      drink and to determine the effect of 12- week consumption of cashew apple juice on physical&#xD;
      and psychological fitness of the middle aged and elderly volunteers. The consumption safety&#xD;
      of the developed drink was also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The developed cashew apple juice based functional drink showed antioxidant and&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase suppression activities. Therefore, it was used for the investigation the&#xD;
      effect of 12- week consumption of cashew apple juice on physical and psychological fitness of&#xD;
      the middle aged and elderly volunteers. In this study, the healthy middle aged and elderly&#xD;
      volunteers who were recruited to participate in this study were divided in to various groups&#xD;
      consisting of placebo and the Cashew drink treated groups at doses of 120 and 240 mg/day. All&#xD;
      subjects had to consume the assigned drinks for 12 weeks. They were determined the parameters&#xD;
      related to physical and psychological fitness before treatment and every 4 weeks throughout&#xD;
      the study period. The assessments were also performed at 4 week after the cessation of cashew&#xD;
      apple juice based drink consumption. The physical fitness assessment was performed via the&#xD;
      battery test consisting of various tests including 30-second chair stand test which measured&#xD;
      the muscle strength of the lower extremities, hand grip strength test which measured the&#xD;
      muscle strength of hand, 6-minute walk test which measured cardio-pulmonary endurance and&#xD;
      Tandem test which measured postural balance. The alteration of oxidative stress markers&#xD;
      including the malondialdehyde level and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),&#xD;
      catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in blood was also motored. The results&#xD;
      showed that the volunteers who consumed cashew apple juice based drink at dose of 240 mg/day&#xD;
      improved the performance in 30-second chair stand test and 6-minute walk test at 12 weeks of&#xD;
      consumption period. The enhanced GSH-Px activity and the decreased MDA level were also&#xD;
      observed. Therefore, the data obtained from this study demonstrated the increased muscle&#xD;
      strength of the lower extremities and the cardio-pulmonary endurance of the middle-aged and&#xD;
      elderly volunteers. The possible underlying mechanism might occur partly via the improved&#xD;
      oxidative stress status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the psychological fitness, the working memory was assessed using&#xD;
      computerized battery test while the attention and cognitive processing were assessed via&#xD;
      event related potential. Emotion was assessed via Bond-LÃ¤der test whereas psychological&#xD;
      symptoms were evaluated by symptoms checklist-90 (SCL-90). In addition, the functions of&#xD;
      cholinergic and monoaminergic system especially dopamine were also evaluated using the&#xD;
      activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO B) as indices respectively.&#xD;
      The assessments were performed at the same time schedules as the physical assessment. The&#xD;
      results showed that the subjects who consumed cashew apple juice based drink at dose of 240&#xD;
      mg/day showed the following changes; 1) working memory was improves in all domains including&#xD;
      the increased power of attention, the increase continuity of attention, the speed of memory&#xD;
      and the quality of memory 2) the decreased latency but increased amplitude of N100 and P300&#xD;
      3) the suppression of AChE and MAO-B. Therefore, the current data revealed that the&#xD;
      volunteers who consumed the cashew apple juice based drink at dose of 240 mg/day enhance&#xD;
      attention and cognitive processing ability giving rise to the improved working memory. The&#xD;
      possible underlying mechanism might occur partly via the improved cholinergic and&#xD;
      dopaminergic functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the quality of life was determined by using Quest quality questionnaire which modified&#xD;
      from SF-36 at the end of study, the results showed that volunteers who consumed cashew apple&#xD;
      juice based drink showed the higher quality of life than the volunteer who consumed placebo.&#xD;
      These suggested that the cashew apple juice based drink improved both physical and&#xD;
      psychological fitness and quality of life of the middle-aged and elderly volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assure the consumption safety of the consumers, the assessments of hematological&#xD;
      and chemical changes of the volunteers were also performed. The results showed that no&#xD;
      toxicity was observed throughout the study period. The results obtained from this study&#xD;
      demonstrated that the cashew apple juice based drink improved physical and psychological&#xD;
      fitness together with the quality of life without toxicity. Therefore, the developed cashew&#xD;
      apple juice based drink has the potential to be served as the functional drink in order to&#xD;
      enhance physical and psychological fitness for the middle-aged and elderly.&#xD;
