  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of robotic surgery in the management of gynecologic cancers has increased&#xD;
      exponentially in the United States since the implementation of technology in 2005. In Canada,&#xD;
      access to the system is limited because of a lack of government funding. The government has&#xD;
      been reluctant to fund this technology because robust data, on the true impact to patient&#xD;
      care, is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will prospectively examine outcomes of women, with early stage endometrial&#xD;
      cancer, treated surgically. Open surgery will be compared to minimally invasive surgery (MIS)&#xD;
      which will include conventional laparoscopy and robotic surgery. The data collected will&#xD;
      include detailed assessment of surgical data, peri-operative events, quality of life&#xD;
      analysis, health economic evaluation and evaluation of MIS rates.&#xD;

        New patients in the gynecologic oncology clinic will be offered the surgery that is deemed&#xD;
        appropriate by their individual surgeon based on the patient's medical and surgical&#xD;
        histories, type of malignancy, and the surgeon's expertise in open surgery, laparoscopy&#xD;
        and/or robotic surgery.&#xD;
