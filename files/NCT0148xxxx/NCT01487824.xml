  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether early life exposures such as premature&#xD;
      birth or exposure to preeclampsia before you are born results in long-term alterations in the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system that increase risk of cardiovascular disease development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While the incidence of cardiovascular disease has reduced dramatically, coinciding with&#xD;
      favourable changes in risk factors, cardiovascular disease remains the single largest cause&#xD;
      of mortality and premature mortality in the United Kingdom. Identification of novel&#xD;
      biological pathways that underlie disease susceptibility raises the potential for new early&#xD;
      primary prevention strategies to complement classical management. There is particular&#xD;
      interest in the role of early environment in 'programming' risk of cardiovascular disease in&#xD;
      later life and growing evidence that various early life exposures impact cardiovascular&#xD;
      health in the longer term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have thus designed the Early Vascular Study to investigate the long-term impact of early&#xD;
      life exposures, with a particular focus on the impact of preterm birth, in the presence or&#xD;
      absence of pregnancy-induced hypertension in the mother, on the cardiovascular system in&#xD;
      young adulthood. This study also allows investigation of the long term impact of perinatal&#xD;
      interventions used in this cohort. Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measures&#xD;
      of cardiovascular structure and function allow precise quantification of cardiovascular&#xD;
      phenotype. This is combined with blood sample collection to study changes in molecular and&#xD;
      metabolic markers and pathways.&#xD;

        Preterm-born Cohort: A cohort of preterm-born young adults who were enrolled, at birth,&#xD;
        from five centres in England between 1982 and 1985 into a randomised trial of milk feeding&#xD;
        regimes to study the influence of early diet on later cognitive function and cardiovascular&#xD;
        disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Term-born Cohort: A cohort of controls born at term with normal birthweight now aged&#xD;
        between 20 and 40 years to provide age stratified normal ranges for the outcome measures.&#xD;
