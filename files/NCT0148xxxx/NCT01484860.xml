  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to see how useful study drug AUY922 is in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer who have received or are intolerant to first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUY922 is an intravenous drug that blocks a protein called heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90).&#xD;
      Hsp90 works by keeping a number of other proteins stable and active, including many proteins&#xD;
      that are involved in tumor growth and death. When Hsp90 is blocked from working, it is&#xD;
      believed that many of the other proteins that it stabilizes will also be blocked, which will&#xD;
      cause tumor growth to slow or stop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients will visit the clinic once a week, every 4 week cycles to receive&#xD;
      AUY922 intravenously and to have tests and procedures done. As part of the study, archived&#xD;
      tumor tissue will be collected and patients will be asked to have blood samples taken for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic testing. Patients will be invited to take part in an optional banking of&#xD;
      blood samples for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that AUY922 improves disease control rate compared&#xD;
      with what would be expected from best supportive care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label Phase II clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of AUY922 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who have been previously treated with or are&#xD;
      intolerant to first line chemotherapy. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      this agent by assessing the disease control rate (DCR) (objective response plus prolonged&#xD;
      stable disease (&gt;16 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard therapy for patients who have advanced, metastatic or inoperable&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer previously treated with or intolerant to first line chemotherapy is best&#xD;
      supportive care. New treatment options are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone protein involved in the&#xD;
      stabilization of a number of membrane and intracellular proteins including HER2, BCR-ABL,&#xD;
      C-SRC, EGFR, RAF, VEGFR, AKT, and RAS. Many of these proteins are highly expressed in&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUY922 is a novel isoxazole-based HSP90 inhibitor. AUY922 acts by inhibiting HSP90 ATPase&#xD;
      activity (IC50 of 30 nm) and preventing the formation of a multichaperone complex between&#xD;
      HSP90 and other heat shock proteins. This then prevents HSP90 from performing its functions&#xD;
      on client proteins.&#xD;
