      Introduction: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common cause of nosocomial infection&#xD;
      with a high mortality rate. In the current era of increasing highly resistant pathogens in&#xD;
      nosocomial infections, the empirical treatment of these organisms is becoming more difficult&#xD;
      and only a few novel antimicrobial agents are currently in development with activity against&#xD;
      these highly resistant Gram negative bacilli infections. Imipenem, a carbapenem antibiotic,&#xD;
      is a β-lactam antibacterial agent with a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram&#xD;
      positive and Gram negative bacteria. This agent is still one of the most commonly used&#xD;
      antibiotics for empirical therapy of highly resistant nosocomial infections in VAP. In common&#xD;
      with other β-lactams, imipenem exhibits primarily time dependent killing and increasing the&#xD;
      concentration of this agent does not necessarily increase the rate and extent of bacterial&#xD;
      killing. Therefore, the time that concentrations in serum are above the MIC (T&gt;MIC) is the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index that correlates with efficacy. Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      analysis can be applied to imipenem dosages to increase the likelihood of optimal exposure&#xD;
      and achieve good clinical responses in patients with VAP. Previous studies we performed found&#xD;
      that a 2 h infusion of carbapenem antibiotics gave greater values for T&gt;MIC than a 0.5 h&#xD;
      infusion. Therefore, in an attempt to improve the efficacy of the present β-lactam&#xD;
      antimicrobial agents such as imipenem, a prolonged infusion would be the appropriate mode for&#xD;
      administration to promote the maximal bactericidal effect.PK changes have been found for&#xD;
      several hydrophilic antimicrobial agents in critically ill patients. Drug dispositions are&#xD;
      altered in this patient population when compared with healthy subjects leading to&#xD;
      fluctuations of plasma concentrations. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the PD&#xD;
      of imipenem in VAP patients, comparing administration by 0.5 h infusion or 2 h infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics of three regimen as below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) 0.5-hr infusion of imipenem 0.5 g every 6 hrs ii) 2-hr infusion of imipenem 0.5 g every 6&#xD;
      hrs iii) 2-hr infusion of imipenem 1 g every 6 hrs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug preparation:Imipenem will be reconstituted with 100 ml saline solution according to the&#xD;
      manufacturer's guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is prospective, randomized and crossover design to assess&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patients will receive doripenem in 3 regimens consecutively:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) 0.5-hr infusion of imipenem 0.5 g every 6 hrs ii) 2-hr infusion of imipenem 0.5 g every 6&#xD;
      hrs iii) 2-hr infusion of imipenem 1 g every 6 hrs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine patients will be enrolled in this study. After completion of the imipenem therapy for 3&#xD;
      days in this study, all patients will receive other sensitive antibiotics to eradicate their&#xD;
      bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collections: Blood samples (approximately 3 ml) will be obtained by direct&#xD;
      venepuncture at the following time: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 after 4th dose of imipenem.&#xD;
      All blood samples will be allowed to clot and then centrifuged at 2,000g. The serum obtained&#xD;
      will be stored at-80°C until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imipenem assays by HPLC method e performed at Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory data such as Age,Sex, Body weight, CBC, Electrolyte, Vital signs,&#xD;
      APACHE II score, BUN, Cr, Sample and Blood culture will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: Patients will receive imipenem for 3 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis: Concentration of imipenem in plasma will be&#xD;
      measured by HPLC method and simulated in Monte Carlo technique (Computer model) to get PK/PD&#xD;
      index (40%T&gt;MIC) and reported to % PTA (Probability Target Attainment) and %CFR (Cumulative&#xD;
      Faction Response).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Nine patients with VAP will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
