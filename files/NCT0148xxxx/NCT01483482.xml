  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clavicle fractures are frequent and represent somewhere between 5 and 10% of all fractures&#xD;
      seen in orthopedics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no consensus concerning the best treatment of acute, displaced, midshaft clavicle&#xD;
      fractures. Conservative treatment has, traditionally, been the preferred treatment but recent&#xD;
      studies have shown higher incidences of non-union and symptomatic malunion associated with&#xD;
      conservative treatment. Primary surgery has in several studies been associated with high&#xD;
      success rates and few complications but there is no compelling evidence towards superior&#xD;
      results after primary surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this randomized study is to compare conservative treatment (sling) with&#xD;
      primary surgery (locking plate) of acute, displaced, midshaft clavicle fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conservative treatment has been the preferred treatment for midshaft clavicle fractures,&#xD;
      whether the fracture is displaced or undisplaced. The background for this comes from two&#xD;
      large studies done in the 60s. C. Neer (2235 patients) and C. R Rowe (566 patients) showed&#xD;
      respectively in 1960 and 1968 that patients with a clavicle fracture, even with larger&#xD;
      fracture displacements, had few symptoms when the fracture is healed and that the incidence&#xD;
      of non-union is below 1%. Both studies have been criticized for including children and&#xD;
      adolescents where the healing potential is significantly larger than in adults and that their&#xD;
      results are based purely on surgical and radiologic endpoints and no patient-reported outcome&#xD;
      measurements were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clavicle fractures are frequent and represent somewhere between 5 and 10% of all fractures&#xD;
      seen in orthopedics. The incidence of clavicle fracture is somewhere between 29 and 64 per&#xD;
      100000 per year. Fracture of the clavicle most frequently occurs in young men and the&#xD;
      male-to-female distribution is 2.6:1. Between 70 and 80% of all clavicle fractures are&#xD;
      localized to the middle part of the clavicle and of these, most fractures are displaced.&#xD;
      Midshaft clavicle fracture is defined as a fracture in the middle 3/5 parts of the clavicle&#xD;
      (lateral boundary is a vertical line from the base of processus coracoideus and medial border&#xD;
      is a vertical line from the middle of the first rib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have shown higher incidences of non-union, especially when the fracture is&#xD;
      displaced and a shortening of two cm or more occurs. Malunion, that was previously not&#xD;
      considered clinically important, appears in several resent studies to be associated with&#xD;
      profound symptomatic shoulder problems. One study reported that up to 30% of the displaced&#xD;
      clavicle fractures that healed with malunion results in profound symptoms and discomfort of&#xD;
      the shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery, with plate osteosynthesis of the displaced clavicle fracture, has in several studies&#xD;
      been associated with a high success rate and few complications. To date only one randomized&#xD;
      trial comparing conservative treatment with plate osteosynthesis of the displaced midshaft&#xD;
      fracture has been done. This Canadian multi-center study from 2007, where 132 patients were&#xD;
      randomized (111 patients completing), concludes that there is a small significant improvement&#xD;
      in functional outcome in patients where the fracture has been osteosynthesised compared with&#xD;
      conservative treatment. This study recommends surgery of displaced fractures in active&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently two review articles have questioned the results from the Canadian study because it&#xD;
      is unclear whether the poorer functional outcome in the conservatively treated group is due&#xD;
      to the non-unions in this group (14.2%). They both conclude that there is an estimated risk&#xD;
      of overtreatment as a numbers-needed-to-treat analysis estimates the 9 operations is needed&#xD;
      to prevent 1 non-union.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the evidence for surgical intervention over conservative treatment for displaced&#xD;
      midshaft clavicle fractures still is controversial it seems that more and more patients are&#xD;
      treated with primary operative intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of this tendency there is a need to validate whether operative intervention with a&#xD;
      clavicle plate is superior or not compared to the conservative treatment for displaced&#xD;
      midshaft clavicle fractures.&#xD;
