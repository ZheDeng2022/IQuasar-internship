    <textblock>
      Collection of tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that specific genetic alterations occur in head and neck&#xD;
      cancers that have spread to regional and/or distant sites, and these alterations can be&#xD;
      identified from biopsy specimens to allow more accurate staging of tumor and better treatment&#xD;
      planning.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for the treatment of most squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      is surgical extirpation of the primary tumor and elective neck dissection to remove regional&#xD;
      nodes at risk for spread. Via this treatment regimen, the investigators will be able to&#xD;
      prospectively obtain tissues for analysis from patients undergoing elective neck dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to compare gene expression between head and neck tumors&#xD;
      with and without regional lymph node metastases, and to compare gene expression between head&#xD;
      and neck tumor with and without distant metastases.&#xD;

      Tissue samples from patients undergoing elective neck dissection will be collected. Primary&#xD;
      tumors and adjacent normal tissue from unaffected areas will be collected at the time of&#xD;
      surgery. All tissue dissection and removal are part of the standard of care for this type of&#xD;
      surgical procedure. Remaining resected tissue will be used for research.&#xD;
