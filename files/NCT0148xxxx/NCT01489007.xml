      Few areas are more controversial in pediatric nutrition than the role of a vegetarian diet&#xD;
      for children. Advocates make strong health claims whereas others have expressed safety&#xD;
      concerns, especially regarding iron nutrition. The frequency of vegetarianism among children&#xD;
      is said to be rapidly increasing although clear data are not available. Surveys of children&#xD;
      in the US age 8 to 18 reported in the media find that about 3-5% of children are lacto-ovo&#xD;
      vegetarian, with some fish or chicken products in the diet. This is a substantial proportion&#xD;
      that is very likely to increase over the next few years with essentially no nutrient&#xD;
      metabolism data related to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the principal concerns with a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, as preferred by many&#xD;
      children, is the lack of heme iron in the diet. A key question that can be evaluated in&#xD;
      children is whether iron status is in fact affected by a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, 6th&#xD;
      Edition, 2008), vegetarian diets can provide appropriate nutrition for children. Depending on&#xD;
      the level of dietary restriction, fortified foods or supplements may be necessary during&#xD;
      different life stages. In addition, strict vegetarian children may have slightly higher&#xD;
      protein needs compared to non-vegetarian children due to decreased protein digestibility in&#xD;
      certain plants. The AAP further recommends that children 4-8 years old consume a minimum of&#xD;
      five servings per day of beans/nuts/seeds/eggs and six servings per day of calcium-rich&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate this issue, the investigators will use a stable isotope method to directly assess&#xD;
      iron status. It is increasingly recognized that the ability to absorb iron when given with&#xD;
      vitamin C is a highly accurate measurement of iron status and may be a true gold standard in&#xD;
      this regard. In this planned study, investigators will be able to assess both reference dose&#xD;
      iron absorption and standard biochemical markers of iron status in a group of lacto-ovo&#xD;
      vegetarians and compare them with age- and gender-matched children on a non-vegetarian diet.&#xD;
      These data can be important in determining if iron status is decreased in lacto-ovo&#xD;
      vegetarians and will serve as a basis for future interventions and evaluations if a&#xD;
      difference is found.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Iron absorption studies will be done in 30 healthy vegetarian children 4 to 10 yrs of age and&#xD;
      30 healthy non-vegetarian children who are age and gender matched controls (from another&#xD;
      study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: At the time of enrollment, subjects and their families will be asked to come to the&#xD;
      General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) of Texas Children's Hospital or the Metabolic&#xD;
      Research Unit (MRU) at the Children's Nutrition Research Center for a screening visit. Prior&#xD;
      to this visit, demographics from the parent/guardian will be recorded including the child's&#xD;
      approximate height and weight, and the study dietitian will obtain two 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls from the parent to determine dietary intake for enrollment. During this screening&#xD;
      visit, informed written consent will be obtained and anthropometry and vital signs will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study dietitian will instruct the parent/guardian and child on the use of a food scale to&#xD;
      weigh and record dietary intake for a 3-day period (ie, 3-day weighed diet record). The 3-day&#xD;
      weighed diet record will begin the following day. Upon analysis of their child's intake,&#xD;
      parents will be instructed to maintain a similar nutrient intake throughout the study.&#xD;
      Compliance will be monitored via 3-day weighed home diet records timed with their other study&#xD;
      visits. If analysis shows that the child's intake has significantly changed (Â± 20% of a&#xD;
      nutrient), the parent will be counseled by the study dietitian on readjusting the child's&#xD;
      intake back to the usual level determined at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Subjects will be admitted to the GCRC or MRU as an outpatient after a 2-3h fast and&#xD;
      given a reference dose of 1mg iron-58 sulfate as an aqueous solution with 50mg ascorbic acid.&#xD;
      They will be observed for 2h after this dose and water will be freely available. No food will&#xD;
      be allowed however water is allowed. After 2h subjects will be discharged home and food&#xD;
      allowed. After discharge, subjects will record dietary intake using another 3-day weighed&#xD;
      diet record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Prior to this visit, subjects will receive a food scale and will perform another&#xD;
      3-day weighed diet record to demonstrate consistency of diet throughout the study period. Two&#xD;
      weeks (+/- 3 days) later subjects will be readmitted and 10mL blood (2 tsp) will be drawn for&#xD;
      measurement of iron nutritional parameters (e.g. hepcidin, ferritin, iron, TIBC, transferrin&#xD;
      saturation, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RBC indices) and iron isotope ratio measurement. Labs&#xD;
      for iron nutritional parameters may be sent to the TCH Lab or an outside commercial lab.&#xD;
      Incorporation of iron-58 will be used to measure absorption from the reference dose (a&#xD;
      measure of iron status). Topical numbing cream or spray to minimize pain at the injection&#xD;
      site will be offered to all subjects.&#xD;
