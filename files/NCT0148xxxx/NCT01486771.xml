  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injections of pegaptanib will induce the regression of Proliferative Diabetic&#xD;
      Retinopathy (PDR) and reduce the need for retinal photocoagulation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further establish the efficacy of intravitreal pegaptanib injections in the regression of&#xD;
      retinal neovascularization secondary to high-risk PDR, as compared to standard panretinal&#xD;
      photocoagulation (PRP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with intravitreal pegaptanib&#xD;
      injections administered at 12-week intervals, as compared to standard PRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain the regression of PDR after the induction phase with retinal photocoagulation&#xD;
      applied to areas of ischemia (Selective Laser Photocoagulation), as compared to standard PRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the rate of recurrence of neovascularization after 6 intravitreal pegaptanib&#xD;
      injections&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib will reduce the area and/or volume of concomitant&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema, as assessed by leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA) and/or optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib injections maintain or reduce the loss of&#xD;
      best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;

    <description>To assess the efficacy of intravitreal pegaptanib sodium injections in inducing regression of high risk PDR (as determined by percentage of eyes without treatment failure) using standard panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) as the control arm. Treatment failure is defined as:&#xD;
Development of increased NVD and/or NVE&#xD;
NVD and/or NVE that is not regressed at least 50% compared to the baseline amount within 3 weeks&#xD;
Development of significant vitreous hemorrhage that is sufficient in quantity to obscure visualization of the entire macula, optic disc, and the major temporal arcade vessels</description>

    <description>To determine if intravitreal pegaptanib sodium injections maintain or reduce the loss of best-corrected visual acuity as measured by comparing the percentages of patients that lost 3 or more lines on ETDRS chart in the study arms.</description>
