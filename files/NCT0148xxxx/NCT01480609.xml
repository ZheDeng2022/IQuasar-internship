      This in an open-label, single dose, fixed sequence, two treatment period study enrolling 8&#xD;
      patients (to obtain 6 evaluable) with end stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving haemodialysis.&#xD;
      Patients will remain in the unit during each treatment period from admission to the&#xD;
      collection of the final PK sample. The doses of ezogabine/retigabine in the two treatment&#xD;
      periods will be separated by at least 7 days.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Treatment Period 1: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      performed. On Day 1 subjects will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine&#xD;
      immediate release (IR) and dialysis will start 4 hours post-dose. Pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      samples will be collected up to approximately 68 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of dialysate will be collected in 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 hour (if available)&#xD;
      aliquots, timed from the start of dialysis. The volume of dialysate collected in each aliquot&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four samples of predialyzer (&quot;arterial&quot; line) blood and four samples of postdialyzer&#xD;
      (&quot;venous&quot; line) blood will be obtained during the haemodialysis procedure at approximately&#xD;
      one hour intervals starting immediately prior to the start of the procedure and finishing at&#xD;
      the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2: Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 when baseline assessments will be&#xD;
      performed. On Day 1 following the completion of their scheduled dialysis session subjects&#xD;
      will receive a single dose of 100mg ezogabine/retigabine IR. PK samples will be collected up&#xD;
      to approximately 68 hours post-dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the unit following the collection of the last PK sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both treatment periods, PK blood samples will be obtained pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5,&#xD;
      3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 68 hours (or just prior next dialysis session -&#xD;
      whichever is sooner) post-dose. Subjects will be discharged after the final post-dose draw.&#xD;
