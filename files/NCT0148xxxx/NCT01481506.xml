  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) determines an important risk of disability and&#xD;
      disease-related need of care. Selected interventions were able to reduce the number and the&#xD;
      severity of exacerbations. Telemedicine has also been proposed for this purpose. Current&#xD;
      evidences, however, are scant. The investigators present a randomized, parallel-group trial&#xD;
      of a multiparametric remote monitoring system to test its ability to improve early&#xD;
      exacerbation detection rates and impact on clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients performed a simple spirometry that was carried out using a Stead-Wells bell&#xD;
      spirometer (Biomedin, Padua, Italy). Upon provision of informed consent, patients in the&#xD;
      telemonitoring group were invited to a session during which they were instructed on how to&#xD;
      wear the wristband and to operate the cellular telephone. A study physician was available on&#xD;
      call during office hours to assist patients needing further instructions. A technician was&#xD;
      also available in order to solve ingoing hardware problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants were also clinically evaluated at baseline and received a multi-dimensional&#xD;
      assessment including: Activities of daily living scale (ADL), Instrumental activities of&#xD;
      daily living scale (IADL), Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test. These are well&#xD;
      validated and routinely used tools to screen geriatric patients in order to detect global,&#xD;
      physical and instrumental autonomy and consequent degree of dependence, as well as cognitive&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both groups were followed up for 9 months, during this period they attended the&#xD;
      standard schedule of clinical controls. For patients in the SweetAge group, the parameters&#xD;
      received were evaluated daily by a study physician. In case of abnormal readings, the&#xD;
      physician systematically contacted the patient to verify whether their symptoms had worsened&#xD;
      or new symptoms had arose. In this event, the patient's adherence to her/his therapy was&#xD;
      checked and, if unsatisfactory, individually tailored interventions promoting adherence were&#xD;
      carried up. Otherwise, a diagnosis of exacerbation was made and, on the basis of its&#xD;
      severity, an outpatient clinical assessment (for mild exacerbations) or a hospital admission&#xD;
      was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures of these study were: number of exacerbations (defined as a sustained&#xD;
      worsening of the patient's condition, from the stable state and beyond normal day-to-day&#xD;
      variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medications, and&#xD;
      number of hospital admissions.&#xD;
