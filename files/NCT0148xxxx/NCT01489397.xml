      Magnified intelligence chromoendoscopy (FICE) plus probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy&#xD;
      (pCLE) for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia (GIM) diagnosis: a feasibility trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is confocal endomicroscope feasible to diagnose gastric intestinal metaplasia?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility of confocal endomicroscope in diagnose gastric intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal endomicreosocpe can provide the accurate diagnosis of gastric intestinal metaplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators follow the population in recent study from Imraporn et al.: Validity of&#xD;
      magnify NBI for gastric intestinal metaplasia targeted biopsy (N= 50)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal Barrett's esophagus classification was used to evaluate agreement of confocal&#xD;
      endomicroscopic finding in gastric intestinal metaplasia. The accuracy of new criteria for&#xD;
      GIM by confocal endomicroscope was evaluated in relation to pathological report, a gold&#xD;
      standard for diagnosis, and reported as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value,&#xD;
      negative predictive value and accuracy of these criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Benefit and Application:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of confocal endomicroscopy for diagnosis gastric intestinal metaplasia in&#xD;
      order to improve the quality of GIM/dysplasia/early gastric cancer detection and then&#xD;
      decrease the mortality rate from gastric cancer in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in the world in recently&#xD;
      data. The incidence and mortality rate is predominant in East Asia. Usually, gastric cancer&#xD;
      is asymptomatic in early stage; therefore; most patients is in the advanced stage and&#xD;
      incurable at diagnosis. The pathogenesis of intestinal type gastric cancer is sequential and&#xD;
      multistep pathway. Moreover, the direction of pathway is irreversible beyond dysplasia. The&#xD;
      equipment and/or procedure which can detect gastric dysplasia are very beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent study, Imraporn B et al., showed that narrow-banded imaging with magnification&#xD;
      (NBI-ME) had a better sensitivity for gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) detection than a&#xD;
      standard white light endoscopy (73% VS. 13%) and could detect two early gastric cancer from&#xD;
      tissue pathology in 1-year follow-up cohort study. However, NBI-ME cannot differentiate among&#xD;
      GIM, dysplasia and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal endomicroscope is a powerful instrument for performing high-resolution (x1,000 time)&#xD;
      imaging to enable real-time histology and/or optical biopsy at the time of endoscopic&#xD;
      examination(in vivo histology).Fluorescein, is a slightly acidic and hydrophilic dye, will be&#xD;
      used as staining substance via IV administration. The fluorescein established a stable&#xD;
      distribution throughout surface epithelial cells, which is regular columnar epithelium with&#xD;
      round gland openings and cobblestone pattern; the connective tissue matrix of lamina propria;&#xD;
      blood vessels, which are regular shape visible in the deeper mucosa; and red blood cells.It&#xD;
      is not highly miscible with mucins, hence, mucins in goblet cells, which indicated GIM, will&#xD;
      appear dark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because GIM is characterized by the diminutive lesions or microscopic abnormalities amidst&#xD;
      large fields of diffuse disease, biopsy targeting and adequate sampling can be difficult and&#xD;
      time consuming. Therefore, the instant resection with confocal microendoscope is not&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the patient must be diagnosed GIM via a targeted NBI-ME biopsy first. And then&#xD;
      endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) via confocal endomicrosocpe is possible to be the complete&#xD;
      therapeutic treatment for early gastric cancer within the same session at the suspected area&#xD;
      of gastric dysplasia or neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no study about confocal endomicroscope related early detection of gastric cancer was&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we must apply the endomicroscope's criteria from confocal Barrett's esophagus&#xD;
      classification to indicate gastric dysplasia or neoplasia. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of confocal endomicroscopy to diagnose gastric intestinal&#xD;
      metaplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of related literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal endomicroscope is available in 2005. The difference between white light endoscope&#xD;
      and confocal endomicroscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, a point-scanning fiber-optic fluorescein confocal endomicroscope for evaluate&#xD;
      cellular morphology of the upper- and the lower-GI tract is possible. However, the&#xD;
      improvement of diagnostic yield is evaluated in only Barrett's esophagus, colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      detecting Helicobacter pylori. There is no exactly study about early detection of gastric&#xD;
      cancer with confocal endomicroscope. Investigator use the confocal Barrett's esophagus&#xD;
      classification to predict the area of dysplasia or neoplasia in stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have to undergo a targeted NBI-ME biopsy and never be treated as gastric cancer&#xD;
      before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Words:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confocal endomicroscope Gastric intestinal metaplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastric intestinal metaplasia/dysplasia/neoplasim is base on the updated Sydney&#xD;
      classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and Sample Target and sample population: The patients who were diagnosed gastric&#xD;
      intestinal metaplasia (GIM) in the past 2 years in KCMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation and Measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect the geographic data by interview and review the outpatient record. Evaluate the&#xD;
      tissue pathology by one pathologist&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients had informed the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Take the history, physical examination and then fill in the record form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Set confocal endomicroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  10% Fluorescein sodium 10 ml was injected intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2.5-5 milligrams of intravenous midazolam and 10 milligrams of hyoscine were&#xD;
                injected to sedate and decrease bowel movement for easier and complete&#xD;
                visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Simethicone solution was rinsed to reduce mucous and gas bubble in the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FICE was used to identify the area of suspected GIM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Confocal endomicroscopy was performed and targeted to the suspected area. One&#xD;
                snapshot images was recorded at the area of suspected and record the criteria of&#xD;
                diagnosis GIM. Endoscopic resection was done at the suspected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  DVD was recorded during the endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Record the duration and complication of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Send the tissues to one clinically-blinded GI pathologist&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Compare the pathology report and endoscopic finding&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Report the result&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data are processed and recorded by one physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not a clearly evidence about the serious side effect of fluorescein injection. If&#xD;
      the patients had side effects during the research, the procedure will be terminated and the&#xD;
      patients will be take care from KCMH staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a novel diagnostic tool to analyze living cells during endoscopy, especially for&#xD;
      gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM). There is not a standard criterion about confocal&#xD;
      endomicroscopy finding in GIM. Investigator have to apply from Barrett's esophagus criteria&#xD;
      and learn about criteria in GIM and gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obstacles and strategies to solve the problems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this is the study which base on the population from previous study by Imraporn et&#xD;
      al., maybe some patients will loss follow up. The strategies to solve the problems are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early call back to make an appointment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect new patients from the database of pathology department, KCMH&#xD;
