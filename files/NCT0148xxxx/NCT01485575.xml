      Intravitreal dyes are intended to make the surgical extraction of the Internal limiting&#xD;
      membrane (ILM) safer and more complete. However, the search for an adequate vitaly dye is&#xD;
      ongoing. The most commonly used vital dye is Indocyanine green (ICG), although it is not&#xD;
      approved for intravitreal use and has been associated with ocular toxicity. The reason for&#xD;
      its continued popularity seems to be that it stains the ILM better than the approved and less&#xD;
      toxic alternative substances Brilliant Blue G (BBG) and Trypan blue (TB). According to&#xD;
      anecdotal reports from surgeons, another reason for ICGs popularity may be the fact that it&#xD;
      seems to make ILM removal easier. Ultimately, the intention of the investigators research is&#xD;
      to identify possible modifications to existing dyes to reach improved intraoperative dye&#xD;
      utility combined with a favorable safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol was amended and approved concerning additional use of basal membrane of deceased&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;

      The human retina is a light-sensitive tissue lining the inner surface of the posterior&#xD;
      segment of the eye. It is a complex, layered structure containing the photoreceptors and&#xD;
      several layers of neurons. Proper retinal function requires a smooth interface between the&#xD;
      retina and the adjoining vitreous body (vitreous), a gelatinous and transparent substance&#xD;
      occupying the cavity of the posterior ocular segment. The innermost of the retinal layers, a&#xD;
      basement membrane called Inner limiting membrane (ILM), represents the boundary between the&#xD;
      retina and the vitreous. Excessive contact between the ILM and the vitreous leads to&#xD;
      vitreoretinal traction and represents a common cause of ocular pathology: The vitreous&#xD;
      adheres to the ILM and shearing forces are conveyed to the retina. Vitreoretinal traction&#xD;
      concentrates around the Macula lutea, the small area in the center of the retina which is&#xD;
      responsible for central vision. It may be associated with significant visual disturbance as&#xD;
      it creates retinal folds, provokes retinal edema and epiretinal metaplastic membranes through&#xD;
      the liberation of inflammatory messenger substances and may ultimately result in the&#xD;
      formation of macular holes. Macular holes tend to lead to sudden and often complete loss of&#xD;
      central vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of the vitreous (vitrectomy) may improve vitreoretinal traction, but a complete&#xD;
      relief of traction is only achieved if the ILM is removed from the retina in the area around&#xD;
      the macula: At the end of vitrectomy, the surgeon grasps the ILM with a fine forceps and&#xD;
      carefully peels it off the underlying retinal layers. This procedure is extremely delicate,&#xD;
      as the ILM is transparent, extremely thin and in direct contact with highly vulnerable&#xD;
      retinal structures. Vital dyes have been employed to make the ILM more visible and because&#xD;
      some dyes have been described to improve &quot;grip&quot; of the ILM during its extraction. The most&#xD;
      commonly used dye, Indocyanine green (ICG) is not approved for intravitreal use and a&#xD;
      discussion on possible toxic side effects is ongoing. The approved alternative substance&#xD;
      Brilliant blue G is employed only by a minority of vitreoretinal surgeons. It is our&#xD;
      hypothesis, that the popularity of ICG is due to superior staining capacity and a stiffening&#xD;
      effect which may make ILM removal easier for the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first goal of this interdisciplinary and translational project, integrating Medical&#xD;
      physics, Biomedical engineering, Nanosciences, Biochemistry, Neurobiology, Medical Image&#xD;
      analysis and Clinical ophthalmology is to assess and quantify the helpfulness of existing&#xD;
      dyes in terms of staining behavior and their influence on ILM &quot;grip&quot;. In a second step, the&#xD;
      project will analyze how new application protocols and the introduction of novel components&#xD;
      to the molecular structure of vital dyes can improve staining as well as &quot;ILM-grip&quot; while&#xD;
      guaranteeing favorable toxicity profiles Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A novel &quot;Heavy BBG&quot; (BBG D2O) stains the ILM better than conventional BBG. A replacement&#xD;
           of part of the water molecules with Deuterium Oxide (D20) in the BBG solvent increases&#xD;
           the dye's specific gravity. After injection into the vitreous, this new preparation (BBG&#xD;
           D2O) would collect on the retinal surface, increasing local concentration and retinal&#xD;
           exposure. We hypothesize that this alteration of the BBG molecular structure could&#xD;
           improve staining properties without compromising its favorable toxicity profile. This&#xD;
           new BBG has already been introduced by the manufacturer, but its intraoperative&#xD;
           usefulness has not been objectively examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of intraoperative light filters improves the recognizability of the contrasts&#xD;
           generated by vital dyes. Most endoillumination lighting systems are equipped with light&#xD;
           filters, originally intended to reduce intraoperative light toxicity. Anecdotal reports&#xD;
           by numerous surgeons indicate, however, that the use of some filters improves the&#xD;
           recognizability of the stained ILM. The green filter is regarded as particularly useful&#xD;
           for this purpose. A systematic analysis of the effects of light filters on the&#xD;
           usefulness of intravitreal dyes has not been undertaken to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ICG and TB's photochemical properties improve &quot;ILM grip&quot; through an ILM cross-linking&#xD;
           effect resulting in an alteration of ILM material properties. We expect increased&#xD;
           intra-operative ILM compressive and tensile stiffness and reduced ILM thickness in&#xD;
           Atomic force microscopy examinations, explaining why many surgeons describe facilitated&#xD;
           intraoperative manipulation and extraction of the ILM. BBG is not known to dispose of&#xD;
           photochemical properties and should not influence ILM material properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Novel Modified ICG preparation stains equally well but is less toxic An alteration of&#xD;
           the molecular structure in a way such that photochemical properties of the substance&#xD;
           would be largely eliminated would strongly reduce oxidative stress and retinal toxicity.&#xD;
           Synthetization of such a preparation is being prepared by our group. Staining properties&#xD;
           are different from the original preparation in that the absorption maximum is shifted&#xD;
           towards shorter wavelengths and the staining effect is bluish rather than green. The&#xD;
           substance's affinity to the ILM its staining strength and its toxicity have not been&#xD;
           studied, to date.&#xD;
