      As endovascular procedures become more complex, there is a growing need for 3D image overlay&#xD;
      to assist with device guidance and placement. Currently, a 3D image is typically created&#xD;
      intra-operatively using 3D rotational angiography (3D-RA) or cone-beam CT (XperCT). This 3D&#xD;
      image may then be overlaid on live fluoroscopy to provide 3D guidance information (Dynamic 3D&#xD;
      Roadmapping). Philips Healthcare multimodality overlay products allows registration of a&#xD;
      pre-acquired MR/CT or 3D rotational image to live fluoroscopy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment is performed under the guidance of an X-ray angiography system.&#xD;
      Fluoroscopy and conventional 2D digital subtraction angiography (DSA) are used to navigate&#xD;
      the interventional device (and implant) across the lesion to achieve a correct bridging of&#xD;
      the diseased region of the vessel, while excluding the involvement of patent vessels.&#xD;
      Drawbacks of these peripheral interventions include the radiation dose, use of contrast, and&#xD;
      need for a clinician with excellent wire-handling skills. The use of 2D imaging alone may not&#xD;
      be enough to describe the three-dimensional(3D) relationship between interventional devices&#xD;
      (and implants) and the complex vascular anatomy, often making positioning, deployment and&#xD;
      evaluation suboptimal. In addition, the endovascular approach can lead to complications such&#xD;
      as in-stent thrombosis and type II endoleak (in the case of aortic aneurysms) for which 2D&#xD;
      imaging along is again sub-optimal for re-intervention planning and guidance.&#xD;
