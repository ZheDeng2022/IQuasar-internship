      Depression and anxiety are common in primary care practice and are associated with&#xD;
      substantial reductions in health-related quality of life. This Project will test the&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of two on-line treatments for these conditions provided through the&#xD;
      context of a Collaborative Care program: (1) moderated access to a proven-effective&#xD;
      computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT) program; versus (2) moderated access to CCBT&#xD;
      plus an Internet support group (CCBT+ISG). The Project will also compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      these treatments to PCPs' &quot;usual care&quot; for these conditions, and evaluate the adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance of CCBT+ISG by practices following the conclusion of the trial to provide a&#xD;
      greater understanding of how to best scale the delivery of these interventions into a variety&#xD;
      of primary care settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are prevalent in primary care practice, associated with substantial&#xD;
      reductions in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and generate a significant excess of&#xD;
      morbidity. In response, dozens of trials have demonstrated the greater effectiveness of&#xD;
      &quot;Collaborative Care&quot; for these conditions vs. primary care physicians' usual care. Yet for a&#xD;
      variety of reasons, these models have not been widely implemented. Therefore, an urgent need&#xD;
      remains to develop and test more scalable, powerful, and innovative versions of Collaborative&#xD;
      Care while simultaneously developing a greater understanding of how best to provide these&#xD;
      interventions through primary care where the majority of depressed and anxious patients seek&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thousands of web sites provide medical information and the number of Internet support groups&#xD;
      (ISG) where the public can exchange information about treatments is proliferating. Still,&#xD;
      clinical trials have not established the benefits of utilizing the Internet in this manner.&#xD;
      Concurrent with these developments, several computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (CCBT)&#xD;
      programs have been proven effective at treating patients with mood and anxiety disorders and&#xD;
      used by hundreds of thousands of patients outside the U.S. Yet CCBT remains little utilized&#xD;
      inside the U.S., and no trials have incorporated CCBT into a Collaborative Care intervention&#xD;
      or examined the effectiveness of combining CCBT with an ISG for these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a 4-year comparative effectiveness trial that will randomize 700 primary care&#xD;
      patients aged 18-75 who have at least a moderate level of mood and/or anxiety symptoms and&#xD;
      reliable access to both the Internet and e-mail to either: (1) guided patient access to&#xD;
      Beating the Blues, a proven-effective on-line CCBT program (CCBT-alone; N=300); (2) guided&#xD;
      patient access to Beating the Blues plus access to a moderated ISG (CCBT+ISG; N=300); or (3)&#xD;
      their PCP's &quot;usual care&quot; (N=100). Our primary hypothesis is that patients in our CCBT+ISG arm&#xD;
      will report a clinically meaningful 0.30 effect size (ES) or greater improvement in HRQoL on&#xD;
      the SF-12 MCS compared to patients in our CCBT-alone arm at 6-months follow-up, and we will&#xD;
      monitor patients for an additional 6 months to evaluate the durability of our interventions.&#xD;
      Our secondary hypothesis is that CCBT-alone patients will report a 0.50 ES or greater&#xD;
      improvement in HRQoL on the SF-12 MCS versus &quot;usual care&quot; at 6-months follow-up. To better&#xD;
      understand how online mental health treatments are best provided through primary care, we&#xD;
      will also evaluate: (a) their effectiveness across and within age strata; (b) their&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness; (c) how patients utilize the components of our interventions; (d) patient&#xD;
      subgroups for whom our interventions may be particularly effective; and (e) the adoption and&#xD;
      maintenance of our interventions by practices following the Intervention Phase of the&#xD;
      Project. Study findings are likely to have profound implications for transforming the way&#xD;
      mental health conditions are treated in primary care and focus further attention to the&#xD;
      emerging field of e-mental health by other U.S. investigators.&#xD;
