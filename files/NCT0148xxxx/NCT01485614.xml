  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety of the addition of sitagliptin, and its&#xD;
      effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in pediatric participants 10-17 years of age with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycemic control. The primary hypothesis for this&#xD;
      study is that sitagliptin reduces A1C more than placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is of approximately 56 weeks in duration, including a screening period of up to 1&#xD;
      week, a 1-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a 20-week placebo-controlled, double blind&#xD;
      treatment period [Phase A] and a 34-week double-blind active controlled treatment period&#xD;
      [Phase B] during which participants randomized to the placebo arm who have not initiated&#xD;
      glycemic rescue therapy with metformin during Phase A will receive metformin (in a blinded&#xD;
      manner). A telephone contact will be performed 14 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      medication to assess for any serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in the metformin and placebo/sitagliptin arms prior to implementation&#xD;
      of Protocol Amendment 05 completed the study on their original treatment assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUPASS4468 is a follow-up, non-interventional, observational assessment of safety of&#xD;
      participants who participated in the MK-0431-083 study for up to 5 years.&#xD;

        <description>The number of participants experiencing ≥1 adverse event during Weeks 0-56 was reported. An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a person administered a pharmaceutical product and does not have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. The SAP did not specify for the Metformin arm to be included in statistical comparisons, so results for this arm are provided separately.</description>

        <population>The analysis population includes all randomized participants who received ≥1 dose of study medication. Participants (n=5) from the Placebo/Sitagliptin arm were excluded because sitagliptin received during Week 0-54 was an inappropriate control for the Sitagliptin arm which received sitagliptin during both study treatment phases.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With A1C at Goal (&lt;7.0%) at Week 20 (Analysis of Selected Arms: Sitagliptin and Placebo (Pooled))</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with A1C at goal (&lt;7.0%) at Week 20 was presented. The analysis table includes the observed values for each treatment arm (Missing = Not at Goal) and the estimated treatment difference (Missing = Multiple Imputation). The current outcome measure focused on comparing results from participants randomized to sitagliptin or placebo. The Placebo arm in this comparison was a pooling of the Placebo/Metformin and Placebo/Sitagliptin arms. The SAP did not specify for the Metformin arm to be included in statistical comparisons, so results for this arm are provided separately.</description>

        <description>Blood glucose was measured on a fasting basis. Change in plasma glucose levels was FPG at Week 20 minus FPG at baseline and was estimated from a longitudinal data analysis model. The current outcome measure focused on results from participants randomized to sitagliptin or placebo. The Week 20 treatment comparison of Sitagliptin vs Placebo included all participants treated with Sitagliptin or Placebo. The Placebo arm in this comparison was a pooling of the Placebo/Metformin and Placebo/Sitagliptin arms. The SAP did not specify for the Metformin arm to be included in statistical comparisons, so results for this arm are provided separately.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Tanner Staging for Genitalia at Week 54 - Males</title>
          <description>Participant's stage of sexual maturation was assessed using the Tanner staging measure for determining pubertal development in male participants. Tanner staging includes an assessment of genital development (males) with a score of range 1 to 5 where 1=no development and 5=adult genitals. This change from baseline was Week 54 Tanner Staging for Genitalia minus the Week 0 Tanner Staging for Genitalia. All participants in the Metformin arm were missing baseline or Week 54 measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tanner Stage for Pubic Hair at Week 20 - Males</title>
        <description>Participant's stage of sexual maturation was assessed using the Tanner staging measure for determining pubertal development in male participants. Tanner staging includes an assessment of pubic hair development (males). Tanner stage (pubic hair) is a score of range 1 to 5 where 1=no development and 5=adult pubic hair. This change from baseline was Week 20 Tanner Staging for Pubic Hair minus the Week 0 Tanner Staging for Pubic Hair.</description>

        <population>The analysis population included all male randomized participants who received ≥1 dose of study medication and had data for the analysis endpoint at both baseline and Week 20.</population>
