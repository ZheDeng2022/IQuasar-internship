      The project will test the implementation of a specific methodology for education of type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients that will be set up using patients involved (peer educators) and 3 guides&#xD;
      developed specifically for the therapeutic education of type 2 diabetic patients. This&#xD;
      project will take place in 1 sites in mali : the capital Bamako. 75 diabetic patients will be&#xD;
      subjected to intervention with this methodology and 75 other diabetic patients will be the&#xD;
      control group. At various stages of the project, the investigators will analyze the impact on&#xD;
      biological, anthropological constants, etc ... of the group undergoing the intervention&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;

      Title of project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized trial of an intensive education intervention using a network of involved&#xD;
      diabetic patients (peer educators) to improve glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question (s)/hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of the research: compare the improvement of HbA1c 1 year after an intervention&#xD;
      led by peer educators, versus a conventional care in health centre&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study the evolution of bio clinical parameters: fasting glucose, weight, BMI, blood pressure,&#xD;
      waist size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method (s) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team that brings together high level&#xD;
      skills in research projects and in peer education projects. It will be conducted in one site&#xD;
      in one country Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This site was chosen because they meet a functional care, access to medicines and a dynamic&#xD;
      association of diabetic patients. Peer educators and persons targeted by the project will be&#xD;
      recruited through the local association of patients. This association will be a social&#xD;
      support that provides on going prevention counseling, education and support services to&#xD;
      people who have diabetes. It represents an important link between patients, educators and&#xD;
      general medical services. The procedure will start by the training of peer educators who were&#xD;
      identified and recruited to facilitate the sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the 4 educational sessions: control of cardiovascular risk (blood pressure, waist&#xD;
      circumference, smoking, cholesterol, glycaemia), control of Food (balance, fat,&#xD;
      carbohydrates), physical activity management, insulin management, will be carried out and&#xD;
      patients will be able to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze knowledge that appears in various forms, including forms adapted to illiterate&#xD;
           patients (colour codes, presence of photos)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Act on knowledge: the patient observes, makes hypothesis, he experiments, compares,&#xD;
           deduces, analyzes, makes relations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work in interaction with other learners, which gives education a social dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Decide on the implementation of actions taking into account individual, cultural,&#xD;
           social, economic context&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each situation, a day of training will be conducted by trained peer educators with&#xD;
      theoretical contributions on the issue, practical scenarios, analyzes of the issues out of&#xD;
      frame and put in &quot;educational security &quot;. These training days will be implemented with 8-10&#xD;
      patients (1Hour and an half) and the 4 sessions will take place over a period of two months&#xD;
      starting from the inclusion of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 groups of 75 persons will be formed. One group will have specific education using&#xD;
      methodology of learning nests. The other group will be a control group not subject to this&#xD;
      specific education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate, we propose a classical randomized controlled experimental (RCT) design, with&#xD;
      randomization at the person-level. For outcome measures, we propose change in HbA1c, increase&#xD;
      of social and emotional support and increase of linkage to clinical care. In addition to&#xD;
      HbA1c, we propose measuring changes in systolic, diastolic blood pressure, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Public health significance (state how the project applies to your community and it potential&#xD;
      impact(s))&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is very important to find an education methodology adapted to the African context. This&#xD;
      line of diabetes management is essential to improve the management of African diabetic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustainability plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the evaluation of this methodology is conclusive, the Malian state will implement the&#xD;
      methodology in the 22 diabetes units of the country.&#xD;

    <description>The main judgement criteria on which the analysis will be done to comply with the superiority of the contribution of a group educational approach by the peer will be the evolution of the HbA1c from the inclusion to 1 year.&#xD;
In practice the main measure is the measurement of glycated hemoglobin of patients expressed in %. We want to show that in the protocol by increasing the education of patients we're going to lower their HbA1c%</description>

    <description>the purpose of this methodology is to set up coordinated training and education activities targeting populations with diabetes based on a pragmatic approach (the learning nests methodology) of appropriation and construction of knowledge that takes into account the individual, social, economic, cultural context. This work is being implemented on the basis of group modules specifically designed in their running: are studied the concrete elements of knowledge to mobilize, patients' actions, the role of health the educator, indicators of progress and monitoring during sessions and on the long term. Each patient is gotten to consider the elements involved in his/her disease, and the actions that can be achieved taking into account the feasibility in his/her own context. The education monitoring is envisaged through a data compendium present in the individual booklets that are given to patients at the end of each education session.</description>
