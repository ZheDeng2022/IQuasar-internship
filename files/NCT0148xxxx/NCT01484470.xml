      While cord blood transplants have been performed safely in elderly patients, many still&#xD;
      relapse. The investigators propose to intensify the preparative regimen for this patient&#xD;
      group in an attempt to decrease relapses, and combine this with an ex vivo expanded Umbilical&#xD;
      Cord Blood (UCB) unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a life saving procedure in selected high-risk or&#xD;
      recurrent hematologic malignancies and marrow failure syndromes. However its wide application&#xD;
      is limited by availability of suitably HLA matched adult donors. Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB)&#xD;
      has been increasingly used as an alternative hematopoietic stem cell source for these&#xD;
      patients. To date, over 10,000 UCB transplants have been performed in both children32-38 and&#xD;
      adults.35,39-44 Its advantages include easier procurement, decreased risk to donors, reduced&#xD;
      risk of transmitting infections, the immediate availability of cryopreserved units, and&#xD;
      acceptable HLA mismatches. The transplantation of UCB allows a greater degree of HLA&#xD;
      mismatching without an unacceptably high incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). Adult&#xD;
      patients receiving myeloablative cord blood transplants have a 90% chance of engraftment, but&#xD;
      carry a 50% rate of transplant related mortality.&#xD;

    <time_frame>100 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is to demonstrate the efficacy of StemEx® vs. unmanipulated UCB transplantation in the elderly population (&gt;55years of age) following RIC regimen by demonstrating engraftment with full donor chimerism (&gt;98%) by Day 100 of more than 60% of the patients who received transplants expanded by the StemEx method.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>The day of neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first day of 3 consecutive days of an ANC greater than 500/microliter. The platelet recovery is the first of 3 consecutive measurements tested on different days of a platelet count greater than or equal to 20,000 without requiring platelet transfusions in the previous 7 days. Patients will be monitored for donor cell engraftment as evidenced by neutrophil recovery and donor chimerism in the marrow and/or peripheral blood at serial time points post transplant.</description>

    <description>StemEx is a stem/progenitor cell-based product of ex-vivo expanded allogeneic UCB, which is administered to the subject in combination with the non-manipulated portion of the same cord blood unit (CBU). The CBU must be cryopreserved in two portions of which the larger (or equal) CBU portion contains at least 1.5 x 107 total nucleated cells (TNC)/Kg. This portion remains unmanipulated and is transplanted on Day 0. StemEx is derived from the smaller (or equal) CBU portion, which is expanded ex vivo for 21 days starting pre-transplant in the presence of cytokines TPO, IL-6, Flt-3L and SCF at a concentration of 50ng/ml and 5μM tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)</description>
