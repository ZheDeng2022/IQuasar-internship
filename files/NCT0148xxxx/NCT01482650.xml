  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have performed a number of studies on novel airway devices, including an&#xD;
      observational study on the performance of a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask. In this&#xD;
      new proposed study the investigators would like to compare directly,in a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, this device with the device the investigators routinely use - the single use laryngeal&#xD;
      mask airway - LMA, in female patients undergoing general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine which device performs best, as measured by key parameters&#xD;
      (insertion success rate, seal pressures, time to and ease of insertion, failure rate,&#xD;
      complications etc) as regarding the performance and safety profile of the Baska mask and the&#xD;
      LMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have two study hypotheses, namely (1) non-inferiority of first placement&#xD;
      attempt success rate of Baska vs LMA; and (2) greater seal pressure of the Baska mask vs LMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of secondary endpoints will be monitored and analyzed (time to and ease of&#xD;
      insertion, failure rate, complications etc).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Airway management is essential component of the safe and efficient provision of general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Supraglottic airway devices have established place in the airway management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Baska mask is a new supraglottic airway device. It bears many of the features of the&#xD;
      industry standard - the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), with few potential improvements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cuff is not pressurized thus reducing the risk of oropharyngeal tissue damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved cuff seal during the inspiratory phase of positive pressure ventilation which&#xD;
           may reduce leak and make ventilation more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An improved system for drainage of oropharyngeal contents intended to reduce the rate of&#xD;
           lung aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Baska mask is inserted in neutral head position thus reducing the need for neck&#xD;
           manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is integrated bite-block to reduce the risk of patients biting and blocking the&#xD;
           airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the observational study of the performance of the Baska mask are promising&#xD;
      and the investigators feel a randomized comparative study against the gold standard device,&#xD;
      the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) is justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, single blinded, controlled clinical trial. The participants will&#xD;
      be allocated to two groups, in which the investigators will use either a single use LMA&#xD;
      device or the Baska mask (single use).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Committee approval has been obtained. Suitable participants will be&#xD;
      recruited after written informed consent and screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard anaesthetic preassessment and anaesthesia will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting patients will be randomly allocated to either of the 2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for airway size selection and attempts at placement will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will monitor a number of parameters, including time and ease of insertion,&#xD;
      airway seal pressure, airway leak, complications, haemodynamic and ventilatory parameters,&#xD;
      ease of removal and other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have two primary hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. That the BASKA mask will have an insertion success rate that is no more than 20% less&#xD;
           than that of the single use LMA device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. That the seal pressure with the BASKA mask will be 40% higher than that of the single&#xD;
           use LMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above the investigators will evaluate a number of secondary outcomes.&#xD;
