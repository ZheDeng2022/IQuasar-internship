      A natural sweetener (Stevia Rebaudina Bertoni) reduces blood glucose levels and blood&#xD;
      pressure according to various preclinical and clinical studies conducted worldwide. Since it&#xD;
      is not found many studies in the literature wich compares Stevia Rebaudiana with saccharin,&#xD;
      we've proposed a randomized crossover clinical trial comparing the effects on postprandial&#xD;
      capillary blood glucose and blood pressure in healthy adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: healthy professionals from two health centers in Alava (Kakuabizkarra primary care&#xD;
      center and Txagorritxu hospital). Inclusion criteria: Professionals of two health centers of&#xD;
      Álava (Lakuabizkarra and Txagorritxu) and active employment status at the beginning of the&#xD;
      trial, weighing more than 50kg and age over 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: 200mg capsules of Stevia or 250mgcapsules of saccharin. Measurements: Capillary&#xD;
      blood glucose and blood pressure, fasting and after eating. Evaluation of satiety, hunger and&#xD;
      fullness by questionnaire after intake, and at the end of the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Compare the postprandial capillary glucose levels between 8 am and 1 st&#xD;
      hour, 2nd hour 3rd hour after intake between treatments by ANCOVA. We will also compare blood&#xD;
      pressure before and after intake between treatments. We will also compare by t test or paired&#xD;
      Wilcoxom (depending on the nature of the variable) the results of the questionnaire after&#xD;
      intake between treatments.&#xD;

      State of the art: Excessive intake of calories and sugar diets cause weight gain and impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance in healthy subjects (1). These diets raise postpandrial blood glucose and&#xD;
      insulin levels and cause metabolic and hormonal changes that induce feelings of hunger and&#xD;
      fat deposition. These diets are also associated with diseases such as diabetes,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and cancer (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The origin of the artificial sweeteners dates back to 1879 with the accidental discovery of&#xD;
      saccharin. France in 1902 and the United States in 1912 officially banned its use because of&#xD;
      their lack of nutritional value. But Europe allowed the use of saccharin during sugar&#xD;
      rationing in the world wars (3). In the past three decades has increased the consumption of&#xD;
      these sweeteners as it has allowed many people suffering from obesity and / or diabetes&#xD;
      restore some degree of palatability to foods (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni (Bertoni), common name &quot;sweet herb of Paraguay&quot; is a plant native&#xD;
      to Paraguay and Brazil, known by Indians as Ka'a-he'e (sweet grass). Its leaves were used&#xD;
      since pre-Columbian times for medicinal purposes and as a sweetener because of its sweet&#xD;
      taste (5). Japan and Brazil have more than 20 years using it as a natural sweetener. The main&#xD;
      sweet component of Stevia is the Stevioside, a glycoside 300 times sweeter than sucrose (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of stevia as a dietary supplement in humans are many: it is stable, non-caloric&#xD;
      and offers a good dental health. In addition, no significant adverse effects have occurred&#xD;
      from their use (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several studies that compare the decline in blood glucose and insulin levels&#xD;
      of Stevia versus many sweeteners. It has been administered to healthy and diabetic rats (8),&#xD;
      healthy humans (9,10), obese (10) and diabetic (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another therapeutic properties of Stevia rebaudiana is a reduction in blood pressure,&#xD;
      systolic and diastolic as Chan et al demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial conducted in&#xD;
      China (12,13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity studies in animals (14) and pregnant (15) have concluded that consumption of Stevia&#xD;
      is safe at commonly used doses of sweetener (7). Furthermore, the quality of life did not&#xD;
      deteriorate (12) nor adverse effects have been detected (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available data suggest that stevia has immunostimulatory activity and inflammation&#xD;
      modulating. But these effects have not been demonstrated in a robust in animal models or cell&#xD;
      lines. If confirmed, the used of stevia could cause problems in some subgroups of population&#xD;
      like in people with autoimmune diseases or gastrointestinal tract inflammation (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In USA it is used as a dietary supplement since 1995, but was evaluated as a sweetener by the&#xD;
      European Scientific Committee on Food for 1984, 1989 and 1999 and concluded that it was not&#xD;
      toxicologically acceptable because there were not enough studies (6). However, recently, the&#xD;
      FDA, WHO and FAO have approved Stevia as a &quot;food additive&quot; for use in people of all ages&#xD;
      (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the literature indicates that steviol can be used safely as a sweetener in the&#xD;
      healthy population, and brings significant benefits for controlling blood glucose levels and&#xD;
      blood pressure. However, to date there are few studies comparing Stevia with other common&#xD;
      sweeteners. For this reason, and to compare the effect of saccharin versus Stevioside, we&#xD;
      plan to conduct this randomized crossover clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study justification: Diets high in sucrose promote weight gain, causing alterations in&#xD;
      glucose tolerance in healthy subjects (1) and are associated with metabolic disorders like&#xD;
      diabetes wich is characterized by plasma glucose levels above the normal limits and if it&#xD;
      isn't adequately treated can lead to complications such as neuropathy, retinopathy,&#xD;
      neuropathy, diabetic microangiopathy and atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since diabetic patients should not eat sugar, artificial sweetener use has increased over the&#xD;
      past three decades due to the fact that consumption of these substances has allowed many&#xD;
      people suffering from obesity and /or diabetes to restore some degree of palatability to food&#xD;
      (4). Among them, a natural sweetener, Stevioside also reduces the levels of postprandial&#xD;
      glucose and insulin, and blood pressure. Besides the consumption of Stevia is safe at doses&#xD;
      normally used as a sweetener&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the reviewed literature, Stevioside can be used safely as a sweetener in the&#xD;
      healthy population, providing significant benefits for controlling blood glucose levels and&#xD;
      blood pressure with no serious adverse reactions. In the most of studies from literature,&#xD;
      Stevioside's effect is compared with placebo, however, to date few studies have been&#xD;
      conducted wich compare it with other sweeteners commonly used by people. For this reason, and&#xD;
      to compare the effect and safety of Stevioside versus Saccharin we have planed this&#xD;
      randomized crossover clinical trial.&#xD;
