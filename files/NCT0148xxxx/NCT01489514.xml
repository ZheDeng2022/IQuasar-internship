  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to determine the safety and allergenicity of hypoallergenic&#xD;
      peanut product extract as compared to standard peanut extract in an adult population with&#xD;
      known peanut allergy. This will be assessed by epicutaneous skin prick testing. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that subjects with previously diagnosed peanut allergy will have less&#xD;
      epicutaneous reactions to the hypoallergenic peanut product extract.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergic volunteers will be identified by positive skin prick test to peanut (peanut&#xD;
      extract obtained from Greer laboratories). The peanut extract to be used is FDA approved and&#xD;
      is routinely used in confirming a diagnosis of peanut allergy. Serum Total IgE and&#xD;
      peanut-specific IgE will be measured for assessment of atopy in general and confirmation of&#xD;
      Peanut allergy respectively. Only patients with positive skin test to peanut will enrolled&#xD;
      into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allergic volunteers will be asked to abstain from taking any antihistamines (H1 or H2) during&#xD;
      the 3 days prior to the skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing day&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain medical history, list of current medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Obtain urine pregnancy test if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Perform partial physical exam (PE) to include, ENT, Eyes, Neck, Respiratory, Cardiac and&#xD;
           Skin with focus mainly on lungs to rule out bronchospasm/asthma exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Epicutaneous skin prick testing with histamine and saline control, standard peanut&#xD;
           extract will be done on all subjects (Total skin prick=3). Those subjects who qualify&#xD;
           for the study (test positive to standard peanut extract) will then undergo skin prick&#xD;
           testing with standard histamine control, standard saline control, hypoallergenic&#xD;
           (Trypsin+Chymotrypsin treated) extract, extract from blanched untreated (no enzyme)&#xD;
           peanuts, non-blanched untreated extracts, and peanuts treated with 0.2% inactivated&#xD;
           a-chymotrypsin and trypsin as an enzyme control. A second set of skin testing reagents&#xD;
           may used these reagents have been treated with alcalase. Skin testing will be read at 15&#xD;
           minutes. A positive test is defined as â‰¥ 3mm wheal compared to saline control. DermaPIK&#xD;
           device will be used for this skin prick testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Obtain blood samples One time 20ml collection for determination of total IgE, peanut&#xD;
           specific IgE in peanut allergic individuals only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Exams will be performed by a study physician. Procedures such as skin testing, vital&#xD;
      signs, venipuncture, will be done by a study coordinator, qualified nurse or technical staff.&#xD;
      Clinical labs (Serum IgE and Peanut-specific IgE) will be processed at Labcorp Inc in&#xD;
      Burlington, NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recording of Skin Test results: Skin test reactions will be traced onto clear cellophane tape&#xD;
      from which measurements will be obtained. This tape will be affixed to a subject's visit&#xD;
      record but not their personal medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excess samples remaining after completion of analyses for this study will be stored in the&#xD;
      CEMALB Repository (IRB #05-2528) and all participants will be asked to sign the Repository&#xD;
      consent form. Failure to consent to the repository will not result in exclusion from the main&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Specific allergy to peanut confirmed by positive immediate skin test response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Oxygen saturation of &gt; 94 % at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Blood pressure within the following parameters (Systolic between 140 - 90, Diastolic&#xD;
             between 90-60 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be willing and medically able to withhold antihistamine treatment (both H1 and&#xD;
             H2) for 3 days prior to starting study medication, and for the duration of the&#xD;
             treatment period. Any subject will be told to resume their antihistamine treatment if&#xD;
             symptoms require resuming medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any chronic medical condition including significant cardiovascular disease, diabetes&#xD;
             requiring medication, chronic renal disease, chronic thyroid disease, kidney disease&#xD;
             or coagulation defects. Asthma is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Asthmatic patients must be on a stable regimen of asthma therapy which has not changed&#xD;
             in the past month prior to entrance into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Asthmatic or allergic non-asthmatic patients must not be on leukotriene receptor&#xD;
             antagonists, as this may potentially interfere with epicutaneous skin testing and in&#xD;
             vitro allergen-induced leukotriene production&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnancy or nursing a baby. As this is a phase I study, the potential risk to a fetus&#xD;
             cannot be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Children will not be included in this study as the potential risk to a growing child&#xD;
             cannot be justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Adults age 66 and older are excluded as the potential for concomitant illness in this&#xD;
             population increases the risk for confounding the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known vagal response to venipuncture&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Hypertension, classified as a systolic blood pressure of equal to or greater than 140,&#xD;
             and a diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 90.&#xD;
