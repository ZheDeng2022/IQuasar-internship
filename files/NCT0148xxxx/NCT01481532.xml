  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess whether human subjects can be made tolerant&#xD;
      to intravenously administered Crotoxin and achieve higher and more therapeutically effective&#xD;
      doses levels without the previously reported adverse effects associated with bolus i.m.&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crotoxin has been shown to induce neurotoxic tolerance in animals allowing them to receive&#xD;
      high doses associated with effective anti-tumor activity in the absence of adverse side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to demonstrate this effect in human subjects using two dose escalation&#xD;
      protocols; slow and fast. It is believed that this approach will prevent toxic side effects&#xD;
      to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The route of administration has not been employed clinically and is designed to avoid the&#xD;
      myonecrotic effects of intramuscular injections. The target maximum dose is almost double&#xD;
      that off the previously reported MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The revised protocol incorporates continuous infusion with a mobile pump and includes active&#xD;
      suppression of the allergic reaction by pre-treatment administration of antihistamines.&#xD;

        Subjects will:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors (excluding basal&#xD;
             cell, colon, pancreatic and stomach cancers) who have progressed despite standard&#xD;
             therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists.&#xD;

          3. Have tumor evaluation made within 28 days before study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have completed radiotherapy or chemotherapy or any other anticancer therapy (including&#xD;
             experimental therapy) more than 4 weeks prior to enrolment into the trial and must&#xD;
             have recovered from all acute side effects of these treatments&#xD;
