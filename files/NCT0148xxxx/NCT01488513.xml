      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ABC294640 in treating patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors. ABC294640 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Please note that the FDA OOPD is participating as a&#xD;
      funding source.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicities (DLT) of ABC294640 (sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640) in patients with&#xD;
      solid organ tumors. (Part I) II. To assess the safety and tolerability of ABC294640 at the&#xD;
      MTD in an expanded cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. (Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To establish the dose of ABC294640 recommended for future phase II protocols. (Part I) II.&#xD;
      To describe the pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 in patients with solid organ tumors. (Part I)&#xD;
      III. To describe the effects of ABC294640 on plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in&#xD;
      patients with solid organ tumors. (Part I) IV. To assess antitumor activity of ABC294640 in&#xD;
      patients with solid organ tumors by objective radiographic assessment using Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. (Part I) V. To describe the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ABC294640 in HCC patients. (Part II) VI. To describe the effects of&#xD;
      ABC294640 on plasma levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in HCC patients. (Part II) VII. To&#xD;
      assess antitumor activity of ABC294640 in HCC patients by objective radiographic assessment&#xD;
      using RECIST 1.1 criteria. (Part II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sphingosine kinase-2 inhibitor ABC294640 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year.&#xD;
