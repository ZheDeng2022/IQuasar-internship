  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to gather data regarding the efficacy, safety and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty in the acute fracture group with fractures&#xD;
      less than 6 weeks old. The AVAMAX vertebroplasty kits (Care Fusion) will be used for all&#xD;
      vertebroplasties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary effectiveness analysis will be based on the number of patients whose numeric&#xD;
      rating pain score drops from above 7 out of 10 at baseline to below 4 out of 10 at two weeks&#xD;
      post-intervention. Our hypothesis is that the vertebroplasty group will have a significantly&#xD;
      larger proportion of patients achieving pain reduction than the control group. A secondary&#xD;
      analysis will compare the change in mean pain scores and specific activity related pain&#xD;
      scores between the two groups at 3 days, 14 days and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Another secondary&#xD;
      effectiveness analysis will include the mean change in the back-pain specific limitation in&#xD;
      function as quantified by the Roland Scale at these same data collection time points.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a two arm randomised, blind placebo controlled trial of vertebroplasty for&#xD;
      acute (&lt; 6 weeks) osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Patients with substantial&#xD;
      pain or immobility despite medical therapy will be recruited to the study, randomised to&#xD;
      study treatments and followed for 6 months. The primary effectiveness variable is back-pain&#xD;
      as recorded on a numerical verbal rating scale at two weeks post-procedure. Secondary&#xD;
      effectiveness variable will be the Roland Morris back pain specific disability score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel with the trial an economic analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from patients who are referred for vertebroplasty&#xD;
      evaluations from five clinical sites of the Sydney metropolitan area. The sites will be St&#xD;
      George Private Hospital, Kareena Private Hospital, St George Public Hospital, Sutherland&#xD;
      Hospital and Liverpool Hospital. These sites have the advantage of having robust, established&#xD;
      vertebroplasty programs and high levels of technical operator experience with vertebroplasty&#xD;
      in acute fractures. Potential patients are patients identified with a recent vertebral&#xD;
      fracture that requires assessment for a vertebroplasty. The referring physician will request&#xD;
      an MRI and spinal radiograph as part of routine assessment and standard clinical care.&#xD;
      Potential involvement in the study will be discussed at this point between patient and&#xD;
      referring physician. Patients will be given a consent form to read and consider. The research&#xD;
      team will then contact potential subjects and ask them a series of questions to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. The investigator and the research coordinator will then describe the study to&#xD;
      eligible patients and informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting baseline&#xD;
      evaluations and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Intervention (Vertebroplasty Procedure):&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.1 The procedure is performed under strict aseptic conditions. All personnel wear surgical&#xD;
      masks and caps in addition to gowns and gloves for operators, to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      infection. 1G ceftriaxone will be administered at the commencement of the procedure unless&#xD;
      the patient is allergic. In case of allergy then antibiotics are not mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 The patient is placed prone on the angiographic table and oxygen mask applied.&#xD;
      Conscious sedation will be induced by IV administration of fentanyl and midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.3 Continuously monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.4 Standard fluoroscopy with a dedicated DSA interventional fluoroscope will be used for&#xD;
      localization of the vertebral body to be treated (Levels T4-L5) and needle placement within&#xD;
      the vertebral body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.5 A 25g needle will be used to raise a wheal of 1% lignocaine subcutaneously. A small&#xD;
      skin nick will be made with a scalpel blade. A 25g needle will be placed into the skin at the&#xD;
      site of the wheal and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance to the periosteum over the&#xD;
      pedicle. This periosteum will be infiltrated with 6-7 cc of 1% lignocaine. (Injections will&#xD;
      be made at each fracture level, i.e., 2 separate injections will be performed for patients&#xD;
      with 2 fracture levels.) 5.1.6 A small incision is made on the skin in the vicinity of the&#xD;
      pedicle, and the access needle is positioned for a transpedicular approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.7 13G or 11G vertebroplasty needles will be placed using trans-pedicular or&#xD;
      para-pedicular approach into the anterior one third of the vertebral body. Whether a&#xD;
      unilateral or bilateral approach is used is up to the discretion of the radiologist doing the&#xD;
      procedure, but a bi-pedicular approach is recommended for the T12 vertebral body and all of&#xD;
      the lumbar vertebral bodies (due to their increased size). An effort should be made to fill&#xD;
      both the fractured fragment of the vertebral body and the more normal trabecular component in&#xD;
      order to stop ongoing fracture and volume loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.8 Prepare the AVAMAXâ„¢ injecting system in the approved manner as per system instruction.&#xD;
      Wait for 5 minutes after mixing cement before cement injection to allow for optimal viscosity&#xD;
      prior to commencing injection. Product accountability forms will be completed which include&#xD;
      batch numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.9 Cement injection should be performed using continuous fluoroscopic screening in the&#xD;
      lateral projection. Cement injection should continue until adequate vertebral body filling is&#xD;
      obtained. This ideally means cement filling from the superior to inferior vertebral body&#xD;
      end-plate in at least the anterior three quarters of the vertebral body in lateral&#xD;
      projection. In frontal projection, the cement should reach at least from middle of the&#xD;
      pedicle to middle of the contra-lateral pedicle in a distribution considered adequate (by the&#xD;
      radiologist) to stabilize the acute fracture. Upon completion of injection, the cannula is&#xD;
      removed and haemostasis at the puncture site is achieved by gentle pressure. If adequate fill&#xD;
      was not obtained, place another needle in the contra lateral pedicle and treat in the same&#xD;
      fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.10 Patient should be left in prone position for 3 minutes following cement injection to&#xD;
      allow for cement to harden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.11 Contingency plans should an outpatient have a sudden life threatening event occur in&#xD;
      the radiology suite and require immediate medical or surgical attention: patient will be&#xD;
      examined and appropriate life support measures instituted. In case of suspected spinal cord&#xD;
      compromise, immediate CT scanning and surgical consultation will be made. In the case of&#xD;
      hemodynamic compromise from idiosyncratic reaction, life support will be instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2 Control Intervention: 5.2.1 The procedure is performed under strict aseptic conditions.&#xD;
      All personnel wear surgical masks and caps in addition to gowns and gloves for operators, to&#xD;
      minimize the risk of infection and to simulate a true vertebroplasty. Prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics may be administered by the treating physician according to their usual practice,&#xD;
      but are not mandated by the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.22 The patient is placed prone on the angiographic table and oxygen mask applied. Conscious&#xD;
      sedation will be induced by IV administration of fentanyl, morphine or pethidine and&#xD;
      midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.3 Continuously monitor heart rate and pulse oximetry throughout the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.4 Standard fluoroscopy will be used for localization of the vertebral body to be treated&#xD;
      (Levels T4-L5) and needle placement within the vertebral body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.5 A 25g needle will be used to raise a wheal of 1% lignocaine subcutaneously. A skin&#xD;
      incision measuring approximately 5mm will be made. The 25G needle will then be reintroduced&#xD;
      and 2 cc of 1% lignocaine injected into the subcutaneous tissues.. (These sham injections&#xD;
      will be made at each fracture level, i.e., 2 separate injections will be performed for&#xD;
      patients with 2 fracture levels.) 5.2.6 Verbal clues will be given, including but not limited&#xD;
      to comments that needle placement and/or cement injection is progressing appropriately.&#xD;
      Manual palpation of the area over the fracture will be done to simulate needle placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.8 The procedure will be terminated.(Note: The patient will be unaware as to whether the&#xD;
      control procedure or vertebroplasty had been performed since full sterile preparation,&#xD;
      sedation and simulated injection procedure will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2.9 Contingency plans should an outpatient have a sudden life threatening or limb&#xD;
      threatening event occur in the radiology suite and require immediate medical or surgical&#xD;
      attention: patient will be examined and appropriate life support measures instituted. In case&#xD;
      of suspected spinal cord compromise, immediate CT scanning and surgical consultation will be&#xD;
      made. In the case of hemodynamic compromise from idiosyncratic reaction life support will be&#xD;
      instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 Post Operative Care: 5.3.1 Following the procedure, all patients should be observed in&#xD;
      the supine position for at least one hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.2 Patients may gradually sit up and/or stand over the next hour, as tolerated, under&#xD;
      direct nursing or physician supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.3 Outpatients may be discharged to the care of an adult after 2 hours. 5.3.4 Non-narcotic&#xD;
      pain medication may be taken as needed, but patients are encouraged to limit use of narcotics&#xD;
      so efficacy can be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.5 One hour after the procedure, patients are evaluated for pain, or complications of the&#xD;
      procedure. Vital signs will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.6 If determined to be necessary by the physician, an outpatient may be admitted and&#xD;
      monitored overnight in the hospital. The reason for keeping the patient overnight will be&#xD;
      documented on the post treatment assessment form and the serious adverse event form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.7 Evaluation of any potential complication will be conducted immediately so that&#xD;
      appropriate treatment can be instituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.8 Dressings applied to the injection/incision site may be removed the following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.9 Skin incisions should be kept clean and dry. Patients are to notify physician of any&#xD;
      redness or discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3.10 Inpatients will continue to be managed by attending physician in usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Patient Evaluations &amp; Follow Up Examinations We will administer the following measures of&#xD;
      pain and pain-related disability questionnaires: numeric and visual pain-rating scale, the&#xD;
      Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire, Osteoporosis Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (QUALEFFO), SF-36 and EQ-5D to all subjects in this trial. We will also ask&#xD;
      patients about their use of medications, other health care resources, medical history,&#xD;
      co-morbidities and demographics. A timed up and go test, which is a reliable measure of&#xD;
      function in older people, will be completed during patient clinic visits at baseline, day 14&#xD;
      and month 6 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent during the baseline consultation, patients will be asked&#xD;
      about demographic information and the patient questionnaires will be administered in a&#xD;
      face-to-face interview. The two week and six month interviews will also be asked in person by&#xD;
      research staff during patient visits. The other interviews (Days 3, day 7, weeks 4 and month&#xD;
      3) will be conducted by telephone for all participants at all sites. An exception to this&#xD;
      will be inpatients that remain in hospital at day 3 who may be interviewed at bedside*.&#xD;
