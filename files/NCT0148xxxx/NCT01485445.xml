  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of fluticasone furoate (FF)&#xD;
      inhalation powder (single strip configuration) compared with FF inhalation powder (two strip&#xD;
      configuration) and compared with FF / vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder. Fluticasone furoate&#xD;
      (FF), is being developed both as a monotherapy for the treatment of asthma and in combination&#xD;
      with vilanterol (VI) for the treatment of asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD). Thirty healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled in the study to ensure&#xD;
      twenty-four evaluable subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluticasone furoate (FF; GW685698), a novel corticosteroid, is being developed both as a&#xD;
      monotherapy for the treatment of asthma and in combination with vilanterol (VI; GW642444) for&#xD;
      the treatment of asthma and COPD. The novel dry powder inhaler (NDPI) will be used to deliver&#xD;
      both FF monotherapy and the FF/VI combination. The NDPI can be used with either a single&#xD;
      strip or two strips, the single strip being used for FF monotherapy and two strips being used&#xD;
      to deliver the FF/VI combination. In some previous FF monotherapy studies, including the&#xD;
      phase IIB programme, conducted using the NDPI, the inhaler contained two strips (FF in the&#xD;
      first strip and matched VI placebo in the second strip). This two strip configuration has&#xD;
      been used for the majority of FF monotherapy treatment arms in previous and ongoing studies.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of FF monotherapy (single strip)&#xD;
      compared with FF monotherapy (two strip), and to determine the bioequivalence of FF&#xD;
      monotherapy (single strip) compared with FF/VI, administered via the NDPI. This data will&#xD;
      facilitate the inclusion of FF monotherapy (two strip) data and FF/VI combination data to&#xD;
      support the FF monotherapy product development. This will be a randomised, open-label,&#xD;
      replicate, six-way crossover, single dose study in healthy male and female subjects. Thirty&#xD;
      healthy male and female subjects will be enrolled in this study to ensure twenty-four&#xD;
      evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic samples will be taken over 36 hours. Safety will be assessed by adverse event&#xD;
      (AE) monitoring throughout the study.&#xD;
