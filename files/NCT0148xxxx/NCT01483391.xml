    <textblock>
      Children or teens with mood swings or depression who have a parent with bipolar disorder are&#xD;
      at high risk for developing bipolar disorder themselves. This study will test a family-based&#xD;
      therapy aimed at preventing or reducing the early symptoms of bipolar disorder in high-risk&#xD;
      children (ages 9-17). In a randomized trial, the investigators will compare two kinds of&#xD;
      family-based treatment (one more and one less intensive) on the course of early mood symptoms&#xD;
      and social functioning among high-risk children followed for up to 4 years. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine the effects of family treatment on measures of neural activation using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who are at high risk for developing bipolar disorder (BD) often are showing&#xD;
      significant mood swings or depression well before they develop the full disorder. Often,&#xD;
      these children have one or more parents who have bipolar disorder. In addition to brief&#xD;
      episodes of lethargic depression and mania or hypomania (periods of excessive activity),&#xD;
      children and adolescents at risk for BD often have co-occurring disorders, such as attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse disorders, and anxiety&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early interventions may lead to better mental health by preventing BD from ever fully&#xD;
      expressing itself. This study will test an early intervention for BD called family-focused&#xD;
      treatment (FFT), which has been designed to help children and adolescents who are at risk for&#xD;
      developing BD. FFT will combine education about BD with training in communication strategies&#xD;
      and problem-solving skills. It will focus on the family, because family environmental factors&#xD;
      are related to the course and recurrence of BD. By reducing risk factors and teaching coping&#xD;
      skills, FFT aims to reduce the early symptoms of BD, improve functioning, and delay the onset&#xD;
      or reduce the severity of manic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last up to 4 years, although the majority of the study will&#xD;
      occur in the first year. There are three parts. In the first part, participating children and&#xD;
      their families will complete research interviews and questionnaires about the child's mood,&#xD;
      behavior, beliefs, and problems. Parent participants will provide information on the family&#xD;
      background of mood or anxiety problems. All participants will receive a thorough&#xD;
      medical-psychiatric evaluation and be provided with pharmacotherapy (as needed) from a study&#xD;
      psychiatrist for the first year of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part, participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two treatments:&#xD;
      FFT or enhanced care. Participants receiving FFT will complete 12 therapy sessions in which&#xD;
      parents, children, and siblings learn how to cope with mood disorders, new ways to talk to&#xD;
      each other, and strategies for solving family problems. FFT sessions will occur weekly for&#xD;
      the first 8 weeks and then every other week for the next 8 weeks. Participants receiving&#xD;
      enhanced care will have 3 weekly sessions which will involve the youth and all family&#xD;
      members. In session 1, clinicians summarize the diagnostic assessment, introduce mood&#xD;
      charting, and offer instructional handouts on managing mood swings. In session 2, clinicians&#xD;
      revisit mood charting, discuss medications (if relevant), and help the child and family&#xD;
      develop a mood management plan. In session 3, families rehearse mood regulation strategies&#xD;
      for current family, social or academic problems. Clinicians then meet with the child&#xD;
      individually every month for the next 3 mos. to provide support, assist with problem-solving,&#xD;
      and troubleshoot use of the mood management plan. So, both treatments last 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the third part of the study, participants will complete follow-up assessments every 4&#xD;
      months for 1 year. Assessments will include interviews and questionnaires similar to those&#xD;
      completed in the first part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analyses for this study will examine changes in symptoms and functioning from&#xD;
      the baseline assessment through the 4 month follow-ups in year 1 and the 6 month follow-ups&#xD;
      in years 2-4.&#xD;
