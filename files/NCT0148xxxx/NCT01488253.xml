      Study Design: To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus as a&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, the investigators are going to perform a phase II,&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial after human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched, related peripheral&#xD;
      blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) in patients with hematologic malignancies. Total 116&#xD;
      patients will be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the rates of 100 day Grade II-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment, the incidence&#xD;
      of grade III-IV acute GVHD, non-relapse mortality during 100 days after transplant, mucositis&#xD;
      severity, all infectious complications including cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, vascular&#xD;
      complications (venoocclusive disease of liver; VOD, thrombotic microangiopathy; TMA),&#xD;
      disease-free survival, and overall survival at 1 year after transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are between 20 and 60 years of age, have acute&#xD;
      leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and adequate&#xD;
      organ function. For available sibling donor, a serologic (or higher resolution) 6/6 Class I&#xD;
      HLA-A and B and molecular Class II DRB1 must be matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Description: Conditioning regimens will vary by center and donor will donate&#xD;
      peripheral blood stem cells according to local institutional practices. Peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cells will not be manipulated or T-depleted prior to infusion. Tacrolimus will be&#xD;
      administered at 0.05 mg/kg/day intravenously by continuous infusion beginning on day -1 with&#xD;
      a target serum concentration of 5 to 10 ng/mL. Sirolimus will be administered as a 6 mg oral&#xD;
      loading dose on day -1, followed by a 3 mg/day single dose, with a target serum concentration&#xD;
      of 3 to 12 ng/mL. Levels will be monitored weekly during hospitalization and then as&#xD;
      clinically indicated. Intravenous tacrolimus will be converted to an oral equivalent dose&#xD;
      prior to discharge and both immunosuppressives will be tapered beginning at day +100 after&#xD;
      transplantation and eliminated by day +180 when clinically feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is three years. Patients will be followed for&#xD;
      100 days post transplantation for evaluation of the primary endpoint, with additional&#xD;
      follow-up to two years after transplantation for evaluation of secondary endpoints.&#xD;

      Rationale: Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      after allogeneic HSCT. The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate has been&#xD;
      the standard GVHD prophylactic regimen for the past 20 years. However, the incidence of acute&#xD;
      GVHD remains high, with reported cumulative incidence of grade II-IV up to 60%. Serious acute&#xD;
      GVHD or chronic GVHD has detrimental consequences in patients including death, disability,&#xD;
      infections, or prolonged hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is the first available inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). And&#xD;
      sirolimus binds uniquely to FK-binding protein (FKBP12) and forms a complex with mTOR. This&#xD;
      complex inhibits several biochemical pathways, resulting in a reduction in DNA transcription,&#xD;
      DNA translation, protein synthesis, and cell cycling, ultimately leading to T-cell&#xD;
      immunosuppression. Sirolimus has been used alone and in combination with calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitors for prevention of allograft rejection after solid organ transplantation. In the&#xD;
      field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the combination of sirolimus and tacrolimus&#xD;
      has also resulted in a low incidence of acute GVHD and reduced transplant-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators demonstrated previously that the combination of tacrolimus and&#xD;
      sirolimus is effective as a GVHD prophylaxis and well tolerated in cases of high risk&#xD;
      transplantation using mismatched related or unrelated donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As discussed above, sirolimus has emerged as one of the most promising immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agents in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, the benefit of GVHD&#xD;
      prophylaxis regimens including sirolimus has not been confirmed consistently and there is&#xD;
      controversy that the incorporation of sirolimus into GVHD prophylaxis results in improved&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy measures: Patients will be followed for 100 days post transplantation for evaluation&#xD;
      of the primary endpoint (the incidence and severity of acute GVHD) and clinical data will be&#xD;
      collected at 100 day after HSCT using case report form. And patients will be recommended&#xD;
      additional follow-up to one year after HSCT for evaluation of secondary endpoints or&#xD;
      parameters including clinical outcomes (disease-free survival and overall at 1 year after&#xD;
      transplant). The investigators will perform the interim analyses at the time when 31 patients&#xD;
      are enrolled during phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute GVHD will be graded according to the consensus grading scale (appendix-1). The broad&#xD;
      category of acute GVHD includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Classic acute GVHD (maculopapular rash, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, profuse diarrhea,&#xD;
           illus, or cholestatic hepatitis) occurring within 100 days after transplantation&#xD;
           (without diagnostic or distinctive signs of chronic GVHD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistent, recurrent, or late acute GVHD: Features of classic acute GVHD without&#xD;
           diagnostic or distinctive manifestations of chronic GVHD occurring beyond 100 days of&#xD;
           transplantation (often seen after withdrawal of immune suppression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety: All the safety analyses will be based on safety population. The assessment of safety&#xD;
      will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory&#xD;
      values that fall outside of predetermined ranges. Adverse events will be summarized by&#xD;
      presenting the number and percentage of patients having any adverse event as well as by&#xD;
      severity to study treatment. In addition the summary of grade 3 and 4 will be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During administration of drugs as a GVHD prophylaxis, toxicities related to drugs will be&#xD;
      graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). Patients&#xD;
      will also be assessed regularly by physical examination and laboratory tests including CBC,&#xD;
      biochemistry including liver function test and chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed to assess patient&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, engraftment, acute GVHD, and non-relapse mortality. Overall&#xD;
      survival and relapse-free survival will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and&#xD;
      estimated using a competing risk of 100-day mortality for cumulative incidence rate of grades&#xD;
      II-IV acute GVHD.&#xD;
