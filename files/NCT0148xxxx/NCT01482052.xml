      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of a new conjugate vaccine,&#xD;
      NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT, compared to the safety of a similar, licensed meningococcal&#xD;
      A/C/Y/W-135-DT conjugate vaccine. The investigators will also evaluate the production of&#xD;
      antibodies to of NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ conjugate vaccine compared to the licensed vaccine,&#xD;
      as a measure of vaccine effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meningococcal disease is a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection. The disease most&#xD;
      commonly is expressed as either meningococcal meningitis, an inflammation of the membranes&#xD;
      surrounding the brain and spinal cord, or meningococcemia, the presence of bacteria in the&#xD;
      blood. The most common symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, confusion,&#xD;
      nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and rash. If not treated the disease can progress rapidly and can&#xD;
      lead to shock and death, often within hours of the onset of symptoms. Neisseria meningitidis&#xD;
      capsular polysaccharides are poor immunogens. However, conjugation of bacterial&#xD;
      polysaccharides to immunogenic carrier proteins generally results in conjugates that induce&#xD;
      strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune responses, creating a&#xD;
      longer-lasting immune response and thus protection against meningococcal infection. This&#xD;
      study compares safety and antibody production induced by one intramuscular injection of&#xD;
      either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT or a licensed meningococcal A/C/Y/W-135-DT conjugate vaccine.&#xD;
      Participants will attend a screening visit up to 4 weeks prior to Day 0, then will attend&#xD;
      study visits for 8 weeks. There will be a study phone call at Days 2-3, then a post-study&#xD;
      telephone call to subjects to assess safety at 26 weeks.&#xD;
