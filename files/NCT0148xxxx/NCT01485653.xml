    <textblock>
      The use of ultrasonography as an adjunct to regional anesthesia has significantly increased&#xD;
      in recent years. Brachial plexus blockade by an axillary approach is amenable to the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance. Real time sonography of nerve structures ensures an optimal distribution&#xD;
      of the block solution. When compared to other methods of nerve localization, sonography&#xD;
      decreases: failure rate procedure time and the onset time for blockade. Furthermore, the use&#xD;
      of ultrasound for peripheral nerve blockade demonstrates decreased procedure related&#xD;
      complications such as nerve injury and unintentional vascular puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional axillary block techniques relying on surface anatomical landmarks require large&#xD;
      volumes of local anesthetic, generally 40mL and greater. Utilizing the increased accuracy&#xD;
      offered by ultrasound, some studies have shown that low volumes of local anesthetic can yield&#xD;
      successful axillary plexus blockade. Therefore, the tradition of using large volumes of local&#xD;
      anesthetic for axillary blocks, even without ultrasound, may not be warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although recent investigations support using a low volume of local anesthetic for brachial&#xD;
      plexus blockade, there is a lack of outcome data from blinded randomised trials. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study was to evaluate 2 different volumes of local anesthetic for axillary&#xD;
      blockade: 1) 20mL or 2) 30 mL. For the 2 different volumes used in this study, a 1.5%&#xD;
      solution of mepivacaine was chosen due to its widespread clinical use in axillary blocks,&#xD;
      which is secondary to: rapid onset of action, intermediate duration of effect, and relative&#xD;
      low cost. The primary outcome was block success rate for outpatients undergoing distal upper&#xD;
      limb surgery. Secondary objectives included comparing the 2 volumes with respect to: time&#xD;
      required to perform the block, and onset of sensory and motor blockade.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study was a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial of 64 patients recruited&#xD;
      from the Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, MI. All patients were scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      upper limb surgery in an outpatient setting. Upon obtaining written informed consent,&#xD;
      patients were randomly assigned to receive either 20mL (n=31) or 30mL (n=33) of a 1.5%&#xD;
      mepivacaine solution for axillary plexus blockade. All anesthetic blocks were placed using&#xD;
      standard medical protocol. Nerve localization was performed using a GE LOGIQe ultrasound&#xD;
      machine (GE Medical systems, Milwaukee, Wis, USA), with a 12L-RS transducer (42mm x 7mm&#xD;
      footprint, 5-13 MHz). Following identification of the axillary neurovascular bundle, a 22G x&#xD;
      50 mm poly medic UPC electric stimulation needle was inserted and advanced along the&#xD;
      longitudinal axis of the ultrasound transducer so that the entire shaft and tip could be&#xD;
      visualized. A peri-arterial injection of 1.5% mepivacaine in the vicinity of the individual&#xD;
      nerve sheaths was performed after negative aspiration. The end point being the&#xD;
      circumferential &quot;donut sign&quot; spread around the artery. Additionally, the musculocutaneous&#xD;
      nerve was identified and 1.5% mepivacaine was injected around the nerve. Depending on the&#xD;
      patient group allocation either 20mL or 30 mL total of 1.5% mepivacaine was infiltrated. For&#xD;
      the group receiving 20mL, 15 of the total 20 mL was spread around the axillary artery and 5mL&#xD;
      spread around the musculocutaneous nerve. For the group receiving 30mL, 20 of the total 30 mL&#xD;
      was spread around the axillary artery and 10mL was spread around the musculocutaneous nerve.&#xD;
      By instituting this injection technique, results could be extrapolated to non ultrasound&#xD;
      guided axillary blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria All subjects recruited into the study were patients undergoing forearm,&#xD;
      wrist, or hand surgery, in an outpatient setting. Other attributes included: ASA I-III, BMI &lt;&#xD;
      35, and age between 18-89 years. All subjects had no history of: CVA, diabetes, anxiety&#xD;
      disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, previous surgery or scarring in the axillary to elbow&#xD;
      area, neurological impairment of either upper extremity, allergies to local anesthesia,&#xD;
      coagulopathy, infection at site of block, chronic opioid therapy for chronic pain, casts or&#xD;
      dressing on the limb that would impair assessment of blocks. Pre-block sedation using &lt;&#xD;

&#xD;
      Onset of Sensory blockade: Examined every 5 minutes following needle extraction using a blunt&#xD;
      needle at 4 specific anatomic locations corresponding to radial, ulnar, median, and&#xD;
      musculocutaneous distributions and compared with contralateral side using same stimulus.&#xD;
      Normal pinprick sharp, 3; pinprick felt but not as sharp, 2; pressure felt but no pinprick&#xD;
      felt, 1; no sensation at all, 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onset of Motor Blockade: Examined every 5 minutes following needle extraction. Wrist flexion:&#xD;
      median nerve; wrist extension: radial nerve; abduction of 5th finger or straight finger&#xD;
      adduction: ulnar nerve; elbow flexion (with forearm supinated): musculocutaneous nerve.&#xD;

      Definitions of successful block Functional successful block: Sensory score of 0-1 in all 4&#xD;
      territories and motor score of 0-1 in 3 of 4 territories within 30 minutes of needle&#xD;
      extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical successful block: no required intraoperative supplemental local anesthetic, light&#xD;
      sedation &lt;25mcg/kg/min propofol and absence of general endotracheal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      An unpaired students-t-test procedure (two-sample assuming equal variances, two-tail&#xD;
      significance p&lt;0.05, 95% confidence interval) was performed to examine mean differences&#xD;
      between the 2 study groups on all continuously scaled variables. A repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      was used to measure differences between both groups over time for motor and sensory nerve&#xD;
      block scores at the 6 measured time points (5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20min, 25 min and 30 min).&#xD;
      Assumptions of normality and/or homogeneity of variance were checked and verified.&#xD;
      Comparisons between study groups on proportional differences were examined using a&#xD;
      non-parametric Fisher's Exact Chi-square test, when applied to 2x2 and 2x3 tables.&#xD;
      Statistical significance was set at a p-value ≤0.05. All continuous data is expressed as mean&#xD;
      with 95% upper and lower confidence intervals.&#xD;
