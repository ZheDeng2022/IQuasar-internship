      The present study proposes the characterization of sleep patterns of healthy young adults,&#xD;
      elderly individuals and individuals above 85 years old, using polysomnographic recordings, in&#xD;
      order to clarify the importance of sleep in longevity. Furthermore, this study intends to&#xD;
      analyze the oxidative stress-related gene expression in peripheral blood of the three studied&#xD;
      groups, using the Superarray - RT2 Profiler&quot; PCR Array System. After the identification of&#xD;
      genes whose expression pattern among groups suggest a more specific role in longevity, the&#xD;
      mechanisms of gene expression regulation, including DNA methylation patterns and microRNA&#xD;
      expression, as well as the possible genomic sources of variation in these genes will be&#xD;
      investigated. In addition, the oldest individual (105 years-old) will have his whole genome&#xD;
      sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology, in order to identify rare variants&#xD;
      associated with longevity. Subsequently, the effect of the polymorphisms and rare variants&#xD;
      identified will be confirmed in an expanded sample constituted of individuals with various&#xD;
      age-ranges. The study will provide a better characterization of molecular and physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms involved in longevity, hoping to contribute to the development of more advanced&#xD;
      clinical tools, capable to offer a better quality of life for the elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last decades, the increase in life expectancy highlights the world population aging as&#xD;
      an irreversible process. The oxidative stress hypothesis of aging suggests that accumulation&#xD;
      of oxidative damage during lifespan may be related to loss of cellular functions, a process&#xD;
      normally associated with senescence. However, it has been proposed that individuals who live&#xD;
      longer in a successful manner tend to be more adapted against aging physiological changes.&#xD;
      Sleep is essential in maintaining health and well-being. Growing evidence suggests&#xD;
      interrelationships between oxidative stress and sleep, while the latter is an important&#xD;
      mechanism involved in redox balance maintenance. Therefore, the present study proposes the&#xD;
      characterization of sleep patterns of healthy young adults, elderly individuals and&#xD;
      individuals above 85 years old, using polysomnographic recordings, in order to clarify the&#xD;
      importance of sleep in longevity. Furthermore, this study intends to analyze the oxidative&#xD;
      stress-related gene expression in peripheral blood of the three studied groups, using the&#xD;
      Superarray - RT2 Profiler&quot; PCR Array System. After the identification of genes whose&#xD;
      expression pattern among groups suggest a more specific role in longevity, the mechanisms of&#xD;
      gene expression regulation, including DNA methylation patterns and microRNA expression, as&#xD;
      well as the possible genomic sources of variation in these genes will be investigated. In&#xD;
      addition, the oldest individual (105 years-old) will have his whole genome sequenced using&#xD;
      next-generation sequencing technology, in order to identify rare variants associated with&#xD;
      longevity. Subsequently, the effect of the polymorphisms and rare variants identified will be&#xD;
      confirmed in an expanded sample constituted of individuals with various age-ranges. The study&#xD;
      will provide a better characterization of molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      longevity, hoping to contribute to the development of more advanced clinical tools, capable&#xD;
      to offer a better quality of life for the elderly.&#xD;
