             therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have a tumour block from their primary or metastatic tumour&#xD;
             available and consent to release the block for correlative analyses.&#xD;
             Centre/pathologist must have agreed to the submission of the specimens in both Stage I&#xD;
             and II of accrual. For patients entered in Stage I of accrual, if no archival tissue&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients entered in Stage II of accrual must have an accessible tumour lesion&#xD;
             (from primary or metastatic disease) for a fresh biopsy, which is formalin fixed and&#xD;
             paraffin embedded. These patients must consent to this biopsy for entry on the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinically and/or radiologically documented disease. At least one site of&#xD;
             disease must be unidimensionally measurable as follows:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Performance Status 2 patients are eligible, if, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator, they are suitable for inclusion in the study and are&#xD;
             likely to be compliant with the study procedures (in particular the recommendations&#xD;
             for supportive care and dose modification).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cytotoxic Chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are eligible after first line cytotoxic chemotherapy has failed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received one, but no more than one, combination chemotherapy&#xD;
             regimen for advanced disease, which must have contained a platinum agent, and&#xD;
             treatment failure must have been documented&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Exchange of one chemotherapy agent for another within a combination chemotherapy&#xD;
             regimen due to toxicity (and not due to progressive disease) is not considered a new&#xD;
             regimen in the following circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin due to nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  One agent in the combination regimen is changed due to hypersensitivity occurring&#xD;
                  in the first cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  28 days must have elapsed since last chemotherapy treatment (at least 6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) and patient must have recovered from toxic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other Anti-Cancer Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Patients may have received other non-cytotoxic investigational therapy; 28 days must have&#xD;
        elapsed since last treatment, such as anti-angiogenic or growth factor antagonists.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may have had prior radiation therapy. A minimum of 28 days must have elapsed&#xD;
        between the end of radiotherapy and registration onto the study. Radiation must have&#xD;
        involved &lt; 30% of functioning bone marrow and there must be measurable disease outside the&#xD;
        previously irradiated area (patients whose sole site of disease is in previously irradiated&#xD;
        area are ineligible) unless there is evidence of progression or new lesions have been&#xD;
        documented, in the irradiated field). [Exceptions may be made however for low dose&#xD;
        palliative radiotherapy].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous Surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Previous major surgery is permitted provided that it has been at least 28 days prior to&#xD;
        patient registration and that wound healing has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Laboratory requirements must be done within 7 days prior to registration) Hematology:&#xD;
        Granulocytes (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelets ≥100 x 109/L Chemistry: Bilirubin ≤ULN AST and&#xD;

        creatinine in μmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and&#xD;
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to registration&#xD;
             in the trial to document their willingness to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment, response assessment and follow-up. Patients&#xD;
             registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre.&#xD;
             This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's&#xD;
             driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators&#xD;
             must assure themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for&#xD;
             complete documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events and&#xD;
             follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 2 working&#xD;
             days of patient registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma&#xD;
             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours&#xD;
             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases. (A head CT is not necessary to rule out brain&#xD;
             metastases, unless there is clinical suspicion of CNS involvement). Patients with&#xD;
             known brain metastases will be excluded from this trial due to their poor prognosis&#xD;
             and their likelihood of developing progressive neurologic dysfunction that would&#xD;
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to PF-03446962.&#xD;

                  syndrome. An ECG must be done within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with resting BP consistently higher than, systolic &gt; 150 mmHg and/or&#xD;
                  diastolic &gt; 100 mmHg (in the presence or absence of a stable dose of&#xD;
                  anti-hypertensive medication) or poorly controlled hypertension, history of&#xD;
                  labile hypertension or poor compliance with anti-hypertensive medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have experienced untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular&#xD;
                  conditions and/or have symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (unstable angina,&#xD;
                  congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous year or&#xD;
                  cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring medication, history of 2nd or 3rd&#xD;

             months prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with overt bleeding from any site (&gt; 30 ml bleeding/episode) within 3 months&#xD;
             of study entry are not eligible. No clinically relevant hemoptysis (&gt; 5 ml fresh&#xD;
             blood) within 4 weeks prior to study entry is permitted. Patients with only flecks of&#xD;
             blood in sputum are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants such as warfarin,&#xD;
             heparin or low molecular weight heparin (except for low doses for prophylaxis). INR&#xD;
             must be done within 7 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bowel obstruction or any condition or gastrointestinal tract disease&#xD;
             that would increase the risk for gastrointestinal perforation, including abdominal&#xD;
             fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within 28 days of&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient&#xD;
             to be managed according to the protocol including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the&#xD;
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The following are exclusions for enrollment on the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pregnant or lactating women. (N.B.: All women of childbearing potential must have&#xD;

                  contraception while on study and for 6 months after discontinuing therapy. Men&#xD;
                  must be surgically sterile or use a barrier method of contraception with&#xD;
                  spermicide. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
