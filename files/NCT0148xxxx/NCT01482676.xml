      Urgency, frequency and incomplete emptying are the key symptoms of lower urinary tract&#xD;
      dysfunction, including bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, and overactive bladder&#xD;
      syndrome. Lower urinary tract dysfunction is associated with cellular stress, leading to&#xD;
      changes in gene expression and consequent organ remodeling. MicroRNAs are small regulatory&#xD;
      molecules, affecting protein synthesis. They are quickly winning recognition as potential&#xD;
      therapeutic agents. The investigators will perform a comparative study of mRNAs changed in&#xD;
      lower urinary tract dysfunction and address the role of differentially expressed miRNAs in&#xD;
      regulation of the genes, important for bladder function. The experimental approach, combining&#xD;
      the analysis of human biopsy material with the in vitro cell-based models, will allow the&#xD;
      investigators to elucidate the effects of miRNAs on the expression of receptors, contractile&#xD;
      proteins and tight junction proteins. Once the disease-induced miRNAs have been characterised&#xD;
      and their target genes validated, it will be possible to influence their expression levels&#xD;
      thus counter-acting their effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' work addresses fundamental mechanisms of signal transduction in urothelium&#xD;
      and smooth muscle during cellular stress caused by inflammation or bladder outlet&#xD;
      obstruction, and its regulation in the diseased state. The investigators' findings will&#xD;
      further the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of lower urinary tract dysfunction and have&#xD;
      implications for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, they have relevance for other&#xD;
      clinical conditions, where miRNAs are implicated.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urgency, frequency and incomplete emptying are the key symptoms of lower urinary tract (LUT)&#xD;
      dysfunction, including bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS), and overactive&#xD;
      bladder syndrome (OAB). Detrusor overactivity, which causes the symptoms of overactive&#xD;
      bladder syndrome, is commonly observed in patients with bladder outlet obstruction. LUT&#xD;
      dysfunction is associated with cellular stress, characterised by changes in cell signalling&#xD;
      and the consequent alterations of gene expression leading to organ remodelling. Previously&#xD;
      the investigators showed that NK1R-mediated signalling was down-regulated in BPS patients,&#xD;
      and implicated microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of NK1R expression and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are quickly gaining recognition for their role in many biological&#xD;
      processes and disease states. MiRNAs are endogenous non-coding single-stranded RNAs which&#xD;
      regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms. The microRNAs regulate thousands&#xD;
      of human gene products, complicating the efforts to predict and functionally validate their&#xD;
      targets. Since miRNAs are important for many basic biological processes, any deregulation in&#xD;
      their biogenesis or function may develop into a medical condition. Here the investigators&#xD;
      propose to investigate the role of miRNAs in gene regulation during LUT disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic BPS is a clinical syndrome characterised by urgency/frequency, pelvic pain and&#xD;
      inflammation in the absence of a detectable agent. A multitude of pathogenetic mechanisms&#xD;
      have been postulated, but an inflammatory component is commonly thought to be involved.&#xD;
      Epithelial damage has often been invoked: the mucinous layer of the healthy bladder is often&#xD;
      compromised in patients with BPS. An initiating event (toxin) may cause increased urothelial&#xD;
      permeability, which in turn leads to nerve sensitisation. The resulting cell injury&#xD;
      propagates, leading to a self-perpetuating inflammatory reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urgency is a pivotal symptom of the lower urinary tract, and also one of the most bothersome&#xD;
      symptoms in men suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia and the resulting bladder outlet&#xD;
      obstruction (BOO). In women OAB is a dynamic disorder, and an estimated 34% of women above 40&#xD;
      experience significant urinary storage symptoms. In contrast to BPS, patients with&#xD;
      overactivity do not report bladder pain, although the perception of urgency and the arising&#xD;
      discomfort vary between individuals. In order to facilitate diagnosis of BPS and its&#xD;
      distinction from DO, and offer specific treatment regimens for each disorder, it is important&#xD;
      to unravel the mechanisms behind the pathophysiology of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previous results suggest that the diseased state of the human urinary&#xD;
      bladder is concomitant with structural and functional changes in smooth muscle and&#xD;
      urothelium. In obstructed bladders, the organ's adaptive response is often accompanied by&#xD;
      replacement of smooth muscle contractile proteins with their non-muscle or embryonic&#xD;
      isoforms. On the other hand, a continuous exposure to neurotransmitters and low pH during&#xD;
      inflammation in BPS induces a significant down-regulation of the tachykinin receptors and&#xD;
      tight junction proteins, which might be mediated by the up-regulated miRNAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to establish the individual gene expression patterns characteristic&#xD;
      for BPS and overactive as well as acontractile bladders and determine the common mechanisms&#xD;
      of the cellular stress responses. They will study the role of miRNAs in the regulation of&#xD;
      receptor-mediated signalling, contractility and epithelial integrity in these LUT&#xD;
      dysfunctions, and delineate the miRNA species, characteristic of each symptomatic complex.&#xD;
      Based on this information, they will identify and functionally validate gene targets of&#xD;
      miRNAs in urinary bladders in order to foster the development of customised therapies. By&#xD;
      comparing the expression of regulatory miRNAs in overactive and acontractile bladders the&#xD;
      investigators will delineate the factors influencing the switch between the two programmes.&#xD;
      Using validated miRNA/mRNA target pairs in cell based models of urothelium and bladder smooth&#xD;
      muscle, they will investigate how the persistent stress-induced signalling during disease&#xD;
      affects the miRNA expression and function of their target proteins. The findings will extend&#xD;
      the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of LUT dysfunction and have implications for&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection and sample processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four study groups will be defined according to the international guidelines and ICS&#xD;
      terminology: controls, BPS, overactive and acontractile. Twenty clinically stable patients&#xD;
      pro study group will be recruited based on the clinical findings (international prostate&#xD;
      symptom score (IPSS), bladder diary over 48 h, O'Leary-Sant questionnaire and visual analogue&#xD;
      scale for pain). Biopsies will be obtained in either general or spinal anesthesia&#xD;
      transurethrally from the bladder dome with a biopsy tong. Biopsies will then be snap frozen&#xD;
      in liquid nitrogen or submerged in RNAlater (Qiagen). All patients will be undergoing surgery&#xD;
      independent of this study. Tissue from the bladder dome for primary cell cultures will be&#xD;
      obtained from patients undergoing cystectomy or bladder augmentation for bladder dysfunction&#xD;
      as a last therapeutic option after other less invasive therapeutic options have failed.&#xD;
      Control tissue will be obtained from bladder cancer patients, who have no lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms aside from hematuria. RNA will be extracted, and the expression levels of selected&#xD;
      genes analyzed using Taqman realtime PCR and gene expression arrays (Applied Biosystems).&#xD;
      Calcium imaging will be used to monitor the receptor activation and protein levels analysed&#xD;
      by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting. Receptor tissue distribution will be analysed by&#xD;
      immunocytochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify and functionally validate gene targets of miRNAs in urinary bladder in order to&#xD;
      foster the development of customised therapies. By comparing the expression of regulatory&#xD;
      miRNAs in overactive and acontractile bladders the investigators will delineate the factors&#xD;
      influencing the switch between the two programmes. Using validated miRNA/mRNA target pairs in&#xD;
      cell based models of urothelium and bladder smooth muscle, they will investigate how the&#xD;
      persistent stress-induced signalling during disease affects the miRNA expression and function&#xD;
      of their target proteins. The findings will extend the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      of LUT dysfunction and have implications for diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA will be extracted, and the expression levels of selected genes analyzed using Taqman&#xD;
      realtime PCR and gene expression arrays (Applied Biosystems). Calcium imaging will be used to&#xD;
      monitor the receptor activation and protein levels analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting.&#xD;
      Receptor tissue distribution will be analysed by immunocytochemistry.&#xD;
