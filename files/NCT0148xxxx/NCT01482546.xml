      Hypothesis: Novice trainees will achieve significantly higher clinical competence and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction scores with the use of warm water infusion method when compared with traditional&#xD;
      air insufflation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: adenoma detection rate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: (1) independent cecal intubation rate, (2) trainer assessment of&#xD;
      trainee's colonoscopy skills, (3) trainee's assessment of clinical confidence, (4) procedural&#xD;
      medication requirement, (5) patient pain level during procedure, (6) patient satisfaction at&#xD;
      procedure completion, and (7) patient willingness to repeat procedure'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To demonstrate the stated hypothesis via above outcome measures. The long term&#xD;
      goal is to provide evidence to influence other training institutions to consider education in&#xD;
      the warm water infusion method'&#xD;

      Study Design: Prospective randomized cross-over study in a university based setting&#xD;
      (University of California Davis, Sacramento, California) with a diverse patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Total of 6 first year gastroenterology trainees (3 enrollees per year from July&#xD;
      2011 to July 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Trainees' names and contact information will be acquired via the program&#xD;
      director. They will be contacted in person on the first day of their fellowship orientation&#xD;
      and provided information regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A sealed envelope containing the randomized method (conventional air&#xD;
      insufflation or warm water infusion) will be opened at the time of signed consent for study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over Design: Trainees will perform colonoscopies using the randomized method with a&#xD;
      dedicated attending physician who uses air and/or water method as part of standard clinical&#xD;
      practice for 6 months, at which point they will cross-over to the alternate method of&#xD;
      colonoscopy with another dedicated attending for the remaining 6 months of their first year&#xD;
      of fellowship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air Insufflation Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimal amount of air will be used during insertion to open the lumen. Minimal amounts of&#xD;
      water (10 to 50 mL) at room temperature will be used for washing of residual feces. If&#xD;
      insertion is hindered by scope looping, attempts at loop reduction will be made. If&#xD;
      advancement does not occur within 3 to 5 minutes, an assistant will provide abdominal&#xD;
      compression, followed by changing the patient's position to facilitate passage of the&#xD;
      colonoscope. Cecal intubation will be suggested by identification of the appendiceal orifice&#xD;
      and ileocecal valve or intubation of the terminal ileum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warm Water Infusion Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As first described by Dr. Felix W. Leung, the maneuvers can be summarized as warm water&#xD;
      infusion in lieu of air insufflation combined with suction removal of all residual colonic&#xD;
      air and residual feces by water exchange. Because insufflated air could lengthen the colon&#xD;
      and exaggerate angulations at the flexures making insertion more difficult, the air pump will&#xD;
      be turned off before insertion of the colonoscope into the rectum to avoid accidental&#xD;
      insufflation of air. Further minimization of angulations at the flexures can be achieved by&#xD;
      suction removal of all encountered residual air. Warm water (at 36-37ºC) maintained using a&#xD;
      water bath and heat saver envelop will be infused intermittently using an Olympus OFP&#xD;
      peristaltic flushing pump via an EndoGator auxiliary water port connector and disposable&#xD;
      water bottle system for Olympus scopes. The minimum amount of water needed to distend the&#xD;
      colon and open the lumen will be used during scope insertion. When the luminal water becomes&#xD;
      turbid due to residual feces, the discolored water will be suctioned and replaced by clean&#xD;
      water until the lumen is visualized again. If advancement does not occur within 3 to 5&#xD;
      minutes, an assistant will provide abdominal compression, followed by changing the patient's&#xD;
      position to facilitate passage of the colonoscope. Cecal intubation will be suggested by&#xD;
      appropriate movement of the endoscopic image on the monitor screen when the right lower&#xD;
      quadrant is palpated or the appendiceal orifice is visualized under water. The cecum will&#xD;
      then be distended by air to confirm visualization of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal&#xD;
      orifice. No specific limit will be set for the volume of water to be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainees randomized to either use of conventional air insufflation or warm water infusion&#xD;
      method will be performing colonoscopies with a dedicated endoscopy attending during their&#xD;
      half-day weekly outpatient endoscopy clinics (for which main indications for colonoscopy will&#xD;
      be screening or surveillance) for each 6-month study period. Three faculty&#xD;
      gastroenterologists will be participating as dedicated research personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored in a standard fashion (including regular nursing assessments of&#xD;
      vital signs and discomfort). The sedation nurse will administer medications during the&#xD;
      procedure according to patient pain levels (0=none to 10=most severe) assessed every 3-5&#xD;
      minute intervals or at any time the patient appears to be in discomfort. Standard incremental&#xD;
      doses of medications (using either meperidine 25mg or fentanyl 25 mcg and midazolam 1mg) will&#xD;
      be offered to the patient when the pain level is ≥ 2. The nurse will record procedural times&#xD;
      (start time, cecal intubation time, and end time in minutes), medications administered (for&#xD;
      pre-procedural sedation, from procedure start to cecal intubation, and during withdrawal&#xD;
      period from cecum to across anus), and attending involvement (hands-on assistance or&#xD;
      take-over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attending dedicated to colonoscopy training will be present for the entire duration of the&#xD;
      procedure. Cecum is considered reached by the attending if clear-cut cecal landmarks are&#xD;
      identified (appendiceal orifice, ileocecal valve, or intubation of the terminal ileum). In&#xD;
      concordance with prior studies, attending endoscopists will allow trainees 20 minutes to&#xD;
      reach the cecum, provided the examination is progressing in a safe manner and the patient is&#xD;
      comfortable. If advancement does not occur within 3 to 5 minutes, an assistant will provide&#xD;
      abdominal compression, followed by changing the patient's position to facilitate passage of&#xD;
      the colonoscope. If the trainee has not reached the cecum by 20 minutes, the instructor will&#xD;
      take over until the cecum is reached. The instructor will take over sooner than this if the&#xD;
      trainee cannot advance the colonoscope for 5 minutes at the same site, or if it is judged&#xD;
      that patient tolerance is becoming a factor. For both the air and water methods, unlimited&#xD;
      verbal instruction will be allowed so that the instructor may guide the trainee with&#xD;
      descriptions of maneuvers as if he/she were performing the procedure. The instructor will not&#xD;
      provide hands-on assistance until either the trainee stated that he or she had reached the&#xD;
      cecum, 20 minutes had passed, or it was necessary for the instructor to take over sooner than&#xD;
      20 minutes for one of the reasons stated above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each colonoscopy, the instructor will fill out a questionnaire regarding any prior&#xD;
      colonic surgery, presence of abnormal anatomy or masses, polyp detection and removal, quality&#xD;
      of preparation using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, and difficultly of the procedure&#xD;
      (1=very easy to 5=very difficult). Overall assessment of the trainee's colonoscopy skills&#xD;
      will be assessed by the instructor after each procedure (1=poor to 5=excellent). The&#xD;
      instructor will also indicate whether the cecum was intubated and the colonoscopy completed&#xD;
      independently by the trainee, if there was hands-on assistance, or if attending had to&#xD;
      take-over the procedure. The trainee will be assessed for ease of learned technique (1=very&#xD;
      easy to 5=very difficult) and self-assessment of clinical confidence (1=not at all confident&#xD;
      to 5=extremely confident).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Record Keeping and Standardization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data collection sheet will be used for each study case, which includes data to be recorded&#xD;
      by sedation nurse (procedural times, patient pain scores, medications administered,&#xD;
      instructor involvement, and volume of water used), trainee self-evaluation, and attending&#xD;
      evaluation of the case and trainee skill. A short post procedural survey that will be&#xD;
      provided to patients to assess post-procedural pain, experience, satisfaction, and&#xD;
      willingness to undergo repeat procedure. In addition to photographic images documenting cecal&#xD;
      intubation that are scanned into our electronic records, a digital video recorder will be&#xD;
      used to record all procedures so that the consultant and PI/investigators may review a&#xD;
      predetermined 10% of the cases to ensure a uniform standard of reporting times, quality of&#xD;
      preparation, polyp detection, and degree of difficulty. Personal identifiers will be removed&#xD;
      from all digital images captured. We will track the number of additional colonoscopies that&#xD;
      the trainee will perform as part of their inpatient rotations so that it may later be&#xD;
      analyzed as a potential confounder. Pathology reports for all removed specimens will be&#xD;
      recorded so that adenoma detection rates may be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-squared (χ2) or Fisher's exact test analysis will be used to compared the proportion of&#xD;
      successful trainee unassisted cecal intubation cases (primary outcome) between the&#xD;
      conventional air insufflation and warm water infusion colonoscopy methods. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      variables will be compared using Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test or Mann Whitney U test&#xD;
      as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be used to evaluate factors&#xD;
      affecting cecal intubation time and success. We will also calculate the trainees' learning&#xD;
      curves in consecutive blocks of 25 procedures (for air and water methods) using one-way&#xD;
      variance analysis and Tukey Honestly Significant Difference test to compare unassisted cecal&#xD;
      intubation and colonoscopy success rates and time required for cecal intubation and&#xD;
      withdrawal as previously reported for conventional air method.&#xD;
