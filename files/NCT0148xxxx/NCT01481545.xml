  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and&#xD;
      bevacizumab before surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the pathological complete response (pCR-TRG1) rate in patients treated with 2&#xD;
      different schedule of bevacizumab plus primary chemotherapy and radiotherapy of the pelvic&#xD;
      region when optimal surgery is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab will be given by intravenous infusion at the dose of 5 mg/kg concurrent with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy every 2 weeks for 4 cycles from -14 days to start&#xD;
      chemo-radiotherapy (classical schedule) or 4 days before the concurrent administration of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy for 2 cycles if the number of TRG1 was not reached in the&#xD;
      first stage with the classical schedule Simon's methods will be used to calculate sample&#xD;
      size.Setting a and b errors as 0.05 and 0.20, respectively, and defining as minimum activity&#xD;
      of interest (p0) a TRG1 rate=30%. In order to demonstrate a TRG1 rate ≥50% (p1), at least 6&#xD;
      TRG1 on the first 15 patients, and at least 19 TRG1 on a total of 46 patients should be&#xD;
      reported in the first and second stage, respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Complete Tumor Regression Rate (TRG1)</measure>
    <time_frame>In 8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Complete tumor regression rate (TRG1) was the ratio of patients with TRG1, graded at surgical resection, and total patients included in the study, expressed in percentage.&#xD;
Tumor regression grade (TRG) was misured according to the Mandard Scale. Briefly,TRG1 was a complete tumor regression (regardless of the presence of acellular mucine lakes), and TRG2 was a nearly complete tumor regression with extensive fibrosis; TRG3 presented with clear evidence of residual cancer cells but with predominant fibrosis;TRG4 was a residual of cancer cells outgrowing fibrosis; TRG5 was the absence of regressive changes.</description>

    <time_frame>10 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was calculated from the date of the initial treatment until tumor progression or relapse, death for any cause or last follow up.&#xD;
Progression was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>7 weeks after chemoradiation therapy up to 11 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response was assessed before surgery with the same imaging modalities that were used for the inclusion in the study.&#xD;
Clinical response rate was the ratio between complete and partial response, evaluated by RECIST CRITERIA, and total of patients evaluated, expressed in percentage of patients.&#xD;
Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR.</description>

        <description>Complete tumor regression rate (TRG1) was the ratio of patients with TRG1, graded at surgical resection, and total patients included in the study, expressed in percentage.&#xD;
Tumor regression grade (TRG) was misured according to the Mandard Scale. Briefly,TRG1 was a complete tumor regression (regardless of the presence of acellular mucine lakes), and TRG2 was a nearly complete tumor regression with extensive fibrosis; TRG3 presented with clear evidence of residual cancer cells but with predominant fibrosis;TRG4 was a residual of cancer cells outgrowing fibrosis; TRG5 was the absence of regressive changes.</description>
