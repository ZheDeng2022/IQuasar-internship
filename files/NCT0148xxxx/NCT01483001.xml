  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung Cancer (LC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) are the major killers in&#xD;
      oncology, accounting for about 40% of cancer deaths. Although progresses have been made in&#xD;
      the last few years, unfortunately no patient with metastatic disease can obtain a definitive&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent hypothesis is that cancer is driven by a small subpopulation of cells called &quot;cancer&#xD;
      stem cells&quot; (CSCs) or &quot;tumor initiating cells&quot; with an unlimited proliferative potential and&#xD;
      the ability to reproduce the original human tumor in experimental animal models. These cells&#xD;
      are thought to be responsible for the development of the tumor and represent the only cell&#xD;
      population able to sustain tumor growth and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, CSCs represent the elective target for new targeted therapies, endowed with high&#xD;
      and selective toxicity towards the tumor but harmless towards normal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current technologies allow us to isolate and expand in vitro the CSCs from tumor specimens,&#xD;
      testing their sensitivity to different anticancer drugs in a short period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is the potential opportunity to identify LC, CRC and BC CSCs.This is a&#xD;
      prospective study assessing feasibility of CSCS isolation in LC, CRC and BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a previously performed diagnosis of LC, colon cancer or breast cancer with no&#xD;
      further standard therapy options, with a Karnofsky performance status of 100% and with tumor&#xD;
      tissue available will be considered eligible for the study. Tumor tissue will be collected&#xD;
      before study entry, i.e tissue obtained during a diagnostic or therapeutical procedure, like&#xD;
      surgery or biopsies with other purposes than the protocol. In vitro tumor sensitivity to&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs will be tested on tumor cell cultures per each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs and their combination will be considered effective and if they kill â‰¥ 60% of tumor stem&#xD;
      cells in vitro test. By using cancer spheres the investigators will also generate orthotopic&#xD;
      xenograft models that recapitulate the parental tumor behaviour, including the aggressive&#xD;
      features and the invasiveness potential. Orthotopic injection technique will be assessed in 5&#xD;
      weeks-old NOD/SCID mice&#xD;

      Patients Patients with LC, CRC and BC with good performance status and with tumor tissue&#xD;
      available, at failure of conventional therapies or without possibility to be treated with&#xD;
      therapy of proven efficacy, will be included in the study. Initial patient characterization&#xD;
      will include detailed information on the following items: gender, age, clinical history,&#xD;
      co-morbidity, physical examination, blood cell counts, complete blood analyses for liver and&#xD;
      renal function, coagulation, serological tumor markers, tumor location and stage, tumor mass,&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LC, CRC and BC CSCs identification Isolation and characterization of CSCs will be made&#xD;
      starting from samples of tumor tissue obtained from patients with LC, CRC and BC. Tumor&#xD;
      tissue will be collected before study entry, i.e tissue obtained during a diagnostic or&#xD;
      therapeutical procedure, like surgery or biopsies with other purposes than the protocol.The&#xD;
      surgical samples collected will be classified according to the specific histological&#xD;
      characteristics of the tumor. From each sample, by means of enzymatic and mechanical&#xD;
      procedures, the CSCs will be obtained and then cultivated in adequate culture mediums to be&#xD;
      subsequently used for biochemical and molecular studies. Each sample will be associated with&#xD;
      the patient history at the surgical time and an appropriate follow-up program consisting of&#xD;
      periodic clinical and instrumental controls that in order to assign a prognostic value to the&#xD;
      biological characteristics of the CSCs. Stem cells derived from the selected epithelial&#xD;
      tumors will then undergo analysis of surface and intracellular markers in order to provide a&#xD;
      definitive characterization of cellular phenotype. Stem cells derived from lung cancer, CRC&#xD;
      and BC are identified as a subset of tumor cells positive for the marker CD133.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor specimens will be washed several times and left over night in DMEM:F12 medium&#xD;
      supplemented with high doses of Penicillin/Streptomycin and Fungizone in order to avoid&#xD;
      contamination. Tissue dissociation will be carried out by enzymatic digestion and recovered&#xD;
      cells cultured in serum-free medium containing 25 microg/ml insulin, 100 microg/ml&#xD;
      apo-transferrin, 10 microg/ml putrescine, 0.03 mM sodium selenite, 20nM progesterone, 0.6%&#xD;
      glucose, 5mM hepes, 0.1% sodium bicarbonate, 0.4% BSA, glutamine and antibiotics, dissolved&#xD;
      in DMEM-F12 medium and supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF and 10 ng/ml bFGF. Flasks non-treated&#xD;
      for tissue culture will be used in order to reduce cell adherence and favourite growth of&#xD;
      undifferentiated tumour-spheres. These culture conditions select for immature tumour cells,&#xD;
      while non malignant or differentiated cells are negatively selected as assessed for CSCs of&#xD;
      different origin. Surviving immature tumor cells slowly proliferate giving rise to tumour&#xD;
      cell aggregates, &quot;spheres&quot;, within 1-2 months in these culture conditions. Sphere-forming&#xD;
      cells can be expanded by mechanical dissociation of spheres, followed by re-plating of single&#xD;
      cells and residual small cell aggregates in complete fresh medium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differentiation of LC, CRC and BC sphere-forming cells will be obtained by cell culture in&#xD;
      specific medium (Cambrex). Phenotype of LC, CRC and BC spheres and their differentiated&#xD;
      progeny will be analyzed by flow cytometric analysis or immunofluorescence. In particular&#xD;
      stem cell markers such as CD133, CD34 and BCRP1 will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successively, cancer spheres will be analyzed in order to define the status of pathways&#xD;
      involved in the process of proliferation, self-renewal and survival. In particular,&#xD;
      tumor-specific analysis will be carried out to investigate the activity and the possible&#xD;
      alteration of pathways responsible for stem cell homeostasis and global analysis&#xD;
      (phosphoproteomic and signal transduction analysis,innovative drug testing, analysis of&#xD;
      processes metastatization in vivo) aimed to provide an overall picture of the activation&#xD;
      state of the key cellular pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical model By using cancer spheres the investigators will generate orthotopic&#xD;
      xenograft models that recapitulate the parental tumor behaviour, including the aggressive&#xD;
      features and the invasiveness potential. Orthotopic injection technique will be assessed in 5&#xD;
      weeks-old NOD/SCID mice. The injection procedure will be done with the support of a&#xD;
      dissecting microscope. After anesthetization, 200 to 500 cancer sphere cells, modified in&#xD;
      order to express a bioluminescent protein such as luciferase will be injected using a&#xD;
      Hamilton syringe and 32-gauge needle. Metastatic and local tumors will be compared for their&#xD;
      stem cell content through phenotypic analysis such as growth rate, or other stem cell&#xD;
      properties including clonogenic capacity in soft agar or through limiting dilution assays.&#xD;
      Infection of CSCs with lentiviral vector, coding for green fluorescent (GFP), as well as&#xD;
      luciferase reporter proteins, will allow CSCs tracking in vivo. Particularly, the amphotropic&#xD;
      packaging cell line 293T will be transfected by the calcium-phosphate/chloroquine method.&#xD;
      Culture supernatants containing viral particles will be collected after 48h of transfection.&#xD;
      Infection will be performed by culturing target cells in 0.45 microm filtered viral&#xD;
      supernatant for 3h in a CO2 incubator. Two infection cycles will be performed to infect&#xD;
      cells. Microscopic evaluation of GFP expression in viral packaging and target cells will be&#xD;
      performed by direct observation of cells using a reversed fluorescence microscope equipped&#xD;
      with a FITC filter. After infection, cells transduced with luciferase will be sorted by flow&#xD;
      cytometry to obtain a pure marked population. The local tumor and the invasiveness&#xD;
      development will be monitored through whole-body imaging techniques, that will permit to&#xD;
      detect, localize and quantify dynamically the optical signal - bioluminescence - in a non&#xD;
      invasive localization of the marked cell population. This procedure will be performed using&#xD;
      the Photon imager in vivo imaging system(Biospace Lab), assisted by the most recent software&#xD;
      for acquisition and image analysis. Thanks to this system, it was recently acquired in the&#xD;
      laboratory and characterized by a very high sensitivity and 20 ms temporal resolution, the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze non anesthetized and freely moving animals. The bioluminescence&#xD;
      signal will be acquired simultaneously as a standard video of the animal. Once the&#xD;
      investigators are sure of the success of tumour growing, mice will be sacrificed. Tumor will&#xD;
      be removed for morphological characterization and phosphoproteomic analysis. This latter will&#xD;
      be performed through reverse phase protein microarray, which allows the achievement of a high&#xD;
      degree of sensitivity, precision and linearity, making possible to quantify the&#xD;
      phosphorylated status of signal proteins in immature and differentiated lung cancer cells.&#xD;
      This system will provide information on specific molecular pathways involved in LC, CRC and&#xD;
      BC cell growth and spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sensitivity to anti-tumoral agents To selectively discriminate the effective&#xD;
      therapeutic compounds against the putative tumor and invasion initiating cells, the&#xD;
      investigators will measure the viability of clonogenic LC, CRC and BC after the exposure to&#xD;
      several anti-tumor drugs differentially combined at singular time point up to 96 hours.&#xD;
