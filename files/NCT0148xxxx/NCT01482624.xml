  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to determine whether&#xD;
      post-arthroscopic treatment with 10 ml of 0.5% sodium hyaluronate (VISCOSEAL® SYRINGE) can&#xD;
      relief pain, improve mobility and promote joint recovery, compared to the standard&#xD;
      arthroscopy procedure alone, in patients undergoing arthroscopic procedure.&#xD;
