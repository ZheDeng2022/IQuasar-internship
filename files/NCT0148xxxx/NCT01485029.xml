      Antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance remain notoriously high in France,&#xD;
      particularly among children below three years of age. In France, the pneumococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine was officially recommended for all children under two in 2003, and consequently&#xD;
      changes occurred in Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution. Bacterial carriage among&#xD;
      children attending day-care centres may result from vaccine- and antibiotic-driven selective&#xD;
      pressure with possible repercussions on the community.&#xD;

      Antibiotic consumption and antimicrobial resistance remain notoriously high in France,&#xD;
      particularly among children below three years of age. In France, the pneumococcal conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine was officially recommended for all children under two in 2003, and consequently&#xD;
      changes occurred in Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype distribution. Bacterial carriage among&#xD;
      children attending day-care centres may result from vaccine- and antibiotic-driven selective&#xD;
      pressure with possible repercussions on the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify prevalence (rates) and trends in antibiotic resistance patterns in Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae (SP) among children attending day-care centres, as well as antibiotic&#xD;
      prescriptions and vaccine rates, nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage was monitored, by conducting&#xD;
      five cross-sectional surveys from January to March 1999, 2002, 2004, 2006 and 2008 among&#xD;
      these children in the area of the Alpes Maritimes, in South-Eastern France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions promoting prudent antibiotic use (PAU) took place in 2000 and since 2003, with&#xD;
      temporary effectiveness but national prescription rates are reported to be currently&#xD;
      increasing again. A new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine covering more serotypes (13-valent)&#xD;
      now replaces the previous one. In this situation, a new cross-sectional survey in day-care&#xD;
      centres with the same design may answer the following questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increasing antibiotic susceptibility was observed during past successive surveys. Has&#xD;
           this trend been sustained to this day?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are antibiotics prescription rates among children attending day-care centres still&#xD;
           decreasing, have they stabilized, or are they on the rise again reflecting recently&#xD;
           reported national trends?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regarding choice of antimicrobial treatment, are 3rd generation cephalosporin&#xD;
           increasingly prescribed rather than aminopenicillins?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is implementation of the new wider spectrum pneumococcal conjugate vaccine exerting&#xD;
           changes on serotype distribution and thus on the nasopharyngeal ecosystem of these&#xD;
           children? These parameters will be useful to renew, or even reinforce, and adapt&#xD;
           professional guidelines and community-oriented messages concerning prudent antibiotic&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study: Antibiotic-resistant enterobacteriaceae, initially observed in the hospital&#xD;
      setting, are currently spreading within the community, especially extended-spectrum&#xD;
      beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae, threatening antibiotic effectiveness in case of&#xD;
      infection. Such infections with Enterobacteriaceae, in particular urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      can occur among children. Prevalence rates of such carriage among children attending day-care&#xD;
      centres is unknown, although they are highly exposed to antibiotics in relation with frequent&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections, in particular to 3rd generation cephalosporins. To assess this&#xD;
      prevalence rate, faecal samples from children attending day-care centres will be collected&#xD;
      during the cross-sectional nasopharyngeal survey quoted above.&#xD;
