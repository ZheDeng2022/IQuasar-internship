      The continuous increase of the incidence of the thyroid cancer in the last years has taken&#xD;
      this neoplasia among the first 4 frequent cancers in the cancer registry of the Institute of&#xD;
      Oncology &quot;Prof.Ion Chiricuţă&quot; from Cluj-Napoca (IOCN), with a total number of over 470 new&#xD;
      cases per year, added to the other 3700 cases already being in the evidence of the Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radical treatment brings for a long term a compensated chronic drug induces mYxoedema&#xD;
      with it's important side effects. Among these one can find the dislipidemia and the change of&#xD;
      the high sensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) serological value. In the last years, many&#xD;
      epidemiological studies have confirmed the fact that the patients with a high serological&#xD;
      value of the hsCRP present a higher risk for the coronary disease and heart attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies developed in european countries and in USA have provided results that are&#xD;
      related to the predictive value of the hsCRP determinations over the cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Thus, hsCRP is an indirect risk factor for the coronary disease. The risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease is 2 to 7 times higher at the people with a high level of hsCRP comparing to ones&#xD;
      with low levels; the increase of the hsCRP serological value can be determined several years&#xD;
      before the clinical debut of the coronary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening for this population group with a high risk can introduce in use the prevention&#xD;
      of the cardiac pathology and change the approach to the monitoring of the patients with&#xD;
      thyroid cancer. A selection protocol will be elaborated for the patients that will withdraw&#xD;
      the hormone treatment by using recombinant thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) or will have&#xD;
      personalised monitoring algorithm, with a shortening of the hormone treatment withdrawal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although considered a rare type of cancer with an incidence under 6 cases for 100 000&#xD;
      persons, the thyroid carcinoma is the most frequent endocrine tumor. The incidence of this&#xD;
      malignant disease has exponentially increased in the last decade, so that many specially&#xD;
      centers in the world have focused on a better strategy of diagnosis, of treatment and of&#xD;
      monitoring. By applying a suitable multimodal treatment, the prognosis of this disease is&#xD;
      excellent, offering the patients a survival rate of over 90% at 10 years. During the&#xD;
      monitoring of the disease, the patients are periodically supposed to withdraw the hormone&#xD;
      treatment; because of this hormone imbalance, there will be important changes of the&#xD;
      metabolism, especially the lipid one. This is the reason why we are preoccupied to increase&#xD;
      the quality of life of the patients addicted to a chronic thyroid hormone therapy. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to demonstrate the way in which the lipid profile is influenced and to quantify&#xD;
      the cardiovascular risk for the patients radically treated of thyroid cancer, by total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy, metabolic irradiation and undergoing a chronic thyroid hormone treatment.&#xD;
      Nowadays, Romania is one of the countries in which these patients are supposed to be kept in&#xD;
      a iatrogenous myxoedema, the alternative being the recombinant thyroid stimulating hormone.&#xD;
      For the patients with the mentioned diagnosis, the lipid profile will be determined and will&#xD;
      consist of the following: total serologic cholesterol, cholesterol fractions, triglycerides&#xD;
      and C reactive protein highly sensitive (hsCRP). A score for the cardiovascular accident risk&#xD;
      will be elaborated. The attempt of classifying in cardiovascular risk groups the patients&#xD;
      through the present study, would facilitate the selection of the patients and their access to&#xD;
      therapies and modern monitoring strategies.&#xD;

        We will prospectively study a group of patients from the evidence of IOCN, with the&#xD;
        histology of differentiated thyroid cancer, radically treated with total thyroidectomy,&#xD;
        radioiodine therapy and undergoing chronic substitutive hormone treatment, levothyroxine.&#xD;
        The evaluation of these patients will be done during the routine oncological control, after&#xD;
        6-12 months post therapy, while withdrawing the hormone treatment and inducing a short-term&#xD;
        iatrogenic myxedema. We are estimating a total number of 30 patients with 3 successive&#xD;
        determinations in 1 year. The ethics committee will evaluate this study and each patient&#xD;
        will be included voluntarily, following clear information of the patient and an informed&#xD;
        consent.&#xD;
