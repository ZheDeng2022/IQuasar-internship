  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of Akt inhibitor MK2206&#xD;
      together with hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors, melanoma,&#xD;
      prostate or kidney cancer. Akt inhibitor MK2206 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      Akt inhibitor MK2206 together with hydroxychloroquine may kill more tumor cells than giving&#xD;
      either drug alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-2206 (Akt inhibitor MK2206) and&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) when used in combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine side effects and activity of MK-2206 and hydroxychloroquine when used in&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if hydroxychloroquine alters the pharmacokinetics of MK-2206 due to a&#xD;
      drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To validate biomarkers for autophagy detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Akt inhibitor MK-2206.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Beginning on cycle 2,&#xD;
      patients also receive hydroxychloroquine PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
