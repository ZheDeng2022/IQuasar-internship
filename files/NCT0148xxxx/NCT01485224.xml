    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) (OMIM 187300 and 600376), also known as&#xD;
      Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disease and has a prevalence between&#xD;
      1:5000 and 1:8000 in different populations. Clinically, the occurrence of mucocutaneous and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal telangiectasias and of systemic arteriovenous malformations is commonly&#xD;
      observed. Recurrent and severe epistaxis, due to the presence of telangiectasias in nasal&#xD;
      mucosa, is the most common presentation of HHT, frequently leading to severe anemia requiring&#xD;
      intravenous iron and blood transfusions. Although not life threatening, severe epistaxis has&#xD;
      a great impact on quality of life in HHT patients and it represents the most important&#xD;
      impediment in daily activities, that poses therapeutic challenge. Recently, angiogenesis has&#xD;
      been implicated in the pathogenesis of HHT. Circulating concentrations of both TGF-beta and&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are significantly elevated and therefore,&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic substances may be effective in the treatment of vascular malformations in&#xD;
      this disease. Thalidomide functions as a potent immunosuppressive and antiangiogenic agent.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the clinical effects of thalidomide therapy on the&#xD;
      severity of epistaxis in subjects with HHT who are refractory to standard therapies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the management of HHT epistaxis, multiple approaches have been tried, including&#xD;
      electrocautery, laser, embolization, arterial ligation, but all approaches are largely&#xD;
      palliative with variable results, many requiring repeated interventions. Except for nasal&#xD;
      closure, surgical options offer, at best, limited hemorrhage-free intervals, but no&#xD;
      definitive results and all have side effects. Moreover, currently, there is no established&#xD;
      medical treatment available for these patients. To limit blood loss, the few medical&#xD;
      treatments used include manipulation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways or topical&#xD;
      applications of anti-inflammatory drugs. However, multiple lesions disseminated over the&#xD;
      entire mucosal surface are common in affected individuals, making local treatment difficult.&#xD;
      Re-bleeding consumes a disproportionate share of healthcare resources devoted to multiple&#xD;
      admissions, repeated endoscopies and blood transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, angiogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HHT. Circulating&#xD;
      concentrations of both TGF-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are&#xD;
      significantly elevated and therefore, anti-angiogenic substances may be effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of vascular malformations in this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thalidomide functions as a potent immunosuppressive and antiangiogenic agent by inhibiting&#xD;
      the phagocytic ability of inflammatory cells and the production of cytokines, such as tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). It has been shown to be effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, in conditions associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      infection, and in various cancers. Bleeding inhibition has been observed in HHT patients who&#xD;
      received thalidomide as an antiangiogenic cancer therapy. A recent paper has reported that&#xD;
      thalidomide treatment induced vessel maturation in an experimental model of HHT and reduced&#xD;
      severe nosebleeds in six of the seven HHT patients studied. On the other hand, spectacular&#xD;
      improvements have been described in patients with intestinal angiodysplasias, treated with&#xD;
      thalidomide. In isolated case reports, patients with severe recurrent intestinal bleeding&#xD;
      refractory to standard treatment achieved prolonged complete remission with thalidomide at a&#xD;
      dose of 100 to 300 mg/day for a few months and tolerance was good. Cessation of bleeding was&#xD;
      associated with a reduction in serum VEGF levels. These observations suggest that thalidomide&#xD;
      might be useful for treatment of HHT patients and address significant unmet medical needs.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this drug exposes patients to the risk of severe side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug metabolism is under control of a number of enzymes specific for each drug; among these&#xD;
      enzymes, many show variable levels of activity and we can thus recognize in the population&#xD;
      extensive (high or fast) metabolizers (EM) intermediate (IM) and poor (low or slow)&#xD;
      metabolizers (PM). This is true also for thalidomide, whose metabolism is in part controlled&#xD;
      by the enzyme CYP2C19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of our study are to test the hypothesis that thalidomide reduces the bleeding&#xD;
      tendency of HHT patients and to verify to which extent CYP2C19 polymorphism modulates both&#xD;
      response to treatment and side effects.&#xD;
