      The investigators are going to compare the therapeutic effect of sorafenib and transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with major branch of portal vein&#xD;
      invasion.&#xD;

      TACE is an established therapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
      and has been shown to significantly improve survival in these patients compared to no&#xD;
      treatment. Moreover, TACE can be performed safely and may improve the overall survival of&#xD;
      patients with HCC and major branch of portal vein invasion. Sorafenib, already approved for&#xD;
      HCC, could lead to significantly improvement in tumor control and survival in patients with&#xD;
      advanced stage HCC. So far there are no head to head comparison reports about the efficacy of&#xD;
      Sorafenib and TACE. Here the investigators evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib and TACE in&#xD;
      advanced HCC with major branch of portal vein invasion.&#xD;

    <description>Antineoplastic agents are directly injected into the hepatic artery, allowing high intratumoral concentrations of drugs and thereby reducing systemic side effects. The mixture of chemotherapeutic agents and iodized oil is almost completely retained in neoplastic nodules and can remain in HCC tissue for a long time. Subsequent mechanical embolization of the artery feeding the neoplasm causes ischemic damage to the tumor and prolongs the duration of the effects of chemotherapeutic agents.</description>

    <description>The volume of iodized oil ranged from 2 to 12 mL, and the amount of doxorubicin ranged from 10 to 60 mg. Gelatin sponge particles were mixed with mitomycin and contrast material.Cisplatin was infused at the tumor feeder vessels as a solution with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL at a rate of 5-10 mL/min. The total amount of cisplatin used ranged from 50 to 100 mg depending on the patient's body weight and the level of infusion.</description>
