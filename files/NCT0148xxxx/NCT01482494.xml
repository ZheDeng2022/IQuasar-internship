      The adult onset form can occur between the second and sixth decades of life as a form of&#xD;
      proximal myopathy, predominantly in the pelvic girdle area. Sometimes the first symptoms are&#xD;
      shortness of breath and diaphragm weakness which herald progressive proximal muscle weakness.&#xD;
      The heart and liver are not affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum CK (Creatine Kinase) activity is 2 to 10 times higher than normal. EMG (electromyogram)&#xD;
      testing usually reveals a myopathic pattern and muscle biopsy may show vacuoles containing an&#xD;
      accumulation of glycogen that is not broken down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until fairly recently, an assay of acid maltase activity using cultured fibroblasts after&#xD;
      biopsy of skin or muscle tissue was required for diagnosis, as leukocytes contain a renal&#xD;
      isoenzyme that is not absent in these patients and which can mask the deficit and result in&#xD;
      false negatives. In recent years this problem has ben solved by the introduction of acarbose,&#xD;
      an inhibitor of renal α-glucosidase; it is also used in the dried blood spot method, which&#xD;
      measures acid maltase activity using maltose and acarbose as inhibitors and&#xD;
      4-methylumbelliferyl-D-glucopyranoside as substrate.&#xD;

      Lysosomal storage disorders are inborn errors of metabolism characterized by defects in&#xD;
      lysosomal function. Lysosomes contain acid hydrolases whose function is to break down complex&#xD;
      molecules in the cell into simpler ones. A deficiency in the activity of any of these enzymes&#xD;
      results in the progressive accumulation of substances that cause a storage disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pompe disease is a progressive muscle disease that is often fatal, caused by a deficiency of&#xD;
      lysosomal alpha glucosidase (also known as acid maltase) activity. This leads to the&#xD;
      accumulation of glycogen in many tissues, most notably in skeletal and cardiac tissues and in&#xD;
      muscle tissue. It is therefore also a glycogen storage disease (type II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and was the first lysosomal storage disease&#xD;
      to be identified. The incidence rate varies by geographic area and ethnic group, and is&#xD;
      estimated to be between 1/300,000 to 1:40,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has a broad clinical spectrum that varies with respect to age of onset, rate of&#xD;
      progression and extent of organ involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adult onset form can occur between the second and sixth decades of life as a form of&#xD;
      proximal myopathy, predominantly in the pelvic girdle area. Sometimes the first symptoms are&#xD;
      shortness of breath and diaphragm weakness which herald progressive proximal muscle weakness.&#xD;
      The heart and liver are not affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum CK (Creatine Kinase) activity is 2 to 10 times higher than normal. EMG (electromyogram)&#xD;
      testing usually reveals a myopathic pattern and muscle biopsy may show vacuoles containing an&#xD;
      accumulation of glycogen that is not broken down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until fairly recently, an assay of acid maltase activity using cultured fibroblasts after&#xD;
      biopsy of skin or muscle tissue was required for diagnosis, as leukocytes contain a renal&#xD;
      isoenzyme that is not absent in these patients and which can mask the deficit and result in&#xD;
      false negatives. In recent years this problem has ben solved by the introduction of acarbose,&#xD;
      an inhibitor of renal α-glucosidase; it is also used in the dried blood spot method, which&#xD;
      measures acid maltase activity using maltose and acarbose as inhibitors and&#xD;
      4-methylumbelliferyl-D-glucopyranoside as substrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, determination of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase&#xD;
      activity and confirmation of a mutation in the gene for this enzyme, located on chromosome&#xD;
      17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycogenosis type II is a multisystem disorder and therefore requires a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      approach for its treatment. Motor recovery, ventilatory support and nutritional management in&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal involvement, are seen as fundamental to the treatment. Since&#xD;
      2.000, enzyme replacement therapy with alpha-alglucosidase has been used, whose safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness, especially in childhood, has been published in several papers.&#xD;
