      The Multicenter Ozone Study in Elderly Subjects will investigate whether short-term exposure&#xD;
      of elderly volunteers to ambient levels of ozone in a controlled exposure setting causes&#xD;
      acute cardiovascular responses as assessed by changes in blood pressure, cardiac function,&#xD;
      and systemic biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will investigate whether short-term exposure of elderly volunteers to&#xD;
      ambient levels of O3 in a controlled exposure setting while intermittently exercising causes&#xD;
      acute cardiovascular responses. The study is based on the suppositions that: 1) elderly&#xD;
      people are a susceptible group for cardiovascular effects; and 2) effects are more likely&#xD;
      with exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve approximately 90 healthy volunteers aged ≥55 and ≤70 who meet strict&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion. They will be exposed for 3 hours to clean air, 0.07 ppm O3 (near the&#xD;
      current NAAQS), and 0.12 ppm O3 (a level measured in several locations in the US). A suite of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and pulmonary endpoints will be measured on the day before the exposure and up&#xD;
      to 22 hours after the exposures. The study is being conducted at three centers using a common&#xD;
      protocol and common SOPs. Most the endpoints will be analyzed by core laboratories to reduce&#xD;
      the variability in the results. A Data Coordination and Analysis Center will assemble all the&#xD;
      data generated by the three centers and conduct the statistical analyses on the combined data&#xD;
      sets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the relationship of altered autonomic balance (measured as changes in heart&#xD;
           rate and heart rate variability (HRV)), cardiac arrhythmia, and repolarization and ozone&#xD;
           exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify instances of altered systemic vascular function [measured as brachial artery&#xD;
           flow-mediated dilation (FMD)without and with nitroglycerin (NTG) when exposed to ozone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify pro-thrombotic vascular state (measured as increase in von Willebrand factor&#xD;
           antigen in blood - primary endpoints) when exposed to ozone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify any increase in micro particle-associated tissues factor (measured as number&#xD;
           of particles and tissue factor activity) and platelet activation) in ozone exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify if markers of systemic oxidative stress and inflammation and any correlation&#xD;
           with the cardiovascular effects and degree of airway injury (measured as CC16) and&#xD;
           airway inflammatory effects (neutrophils and cytokines in induced sputum) in ozone&#xD;
           exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if cardiovascular effects in ozone exposure are correlated with airway&#xD;
           inflammatory effects, but not lung function effects.&#xD;
