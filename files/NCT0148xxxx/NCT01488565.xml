  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a disease of the bone marrow characterized by&#xD;
      anemia,neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (low red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet&#xD;
      counts). MDS patients with thrombocytopenia who fail standard therapies require regular&#xD;
      platelet transfusions which are expensive and inconvenient, and are a risk for further&#xD;
      serious bleeding complications. The new treatment of MDS using azacitidine has shown to&#xD;
      increase the survival rate of MDS patients including to improve platelet production over&#xD;
      time. However,in the early cycles of treatment with azacitidine,the low platelet counts tend&#xD;
      to exacerbate before they provide any clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is a drug designed to activate the thrombopoietin receptor. Eltrombopag has been&#xD;
      able to increase platelet counts in healthy Thrombocytopenia Purpura (ITP), a disease where&#xD;
      patients destroy their own platelets very rapidly and thus develop thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is administered orally and is Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic ITP who failed to respond to&#xD;
      standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Eltrombopag&#xD;
      in the treatment of low platelet counts in adult subjects with MDS treated using azacitidine&#xD;
      This study also incorporates a correlative laboratory component designed to determined the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of 5-azacitidine +/- Eltrombopag and to determine a baseline profile&#xD;
      which may predict those most responsive. These studies will incorporate gene methylation and&#xD;
      expression, and immunoprofiling.&#xD;
