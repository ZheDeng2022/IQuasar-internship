  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects of an investigational vaccine being developed for the prophylaxis of&#xD;
      visceral leishmaniasis. The vaccine, identified as LEISH-F3 + GLA-SE, consists of the&#xD;
      recombinant two-antigen Leishmania recombinant protein LEISH-F3 together with the adjuvant&#xD;
      GLA-SE.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet ALL of the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females 18 years to 45 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             screening, a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of each study injection, must&#xD;
             not be breast-feeding, and are required to use one of the following methods of&#xD;
             contraception during the first 3 months of the study: hormonal (e.g. oral,&#xD;
             transdermal, intravaginal, implant, or injection); double barrier (i.e., condom,&#xD;
             diaphragm with spermicide); intrauterine device (IUD) or system (IUS); vasectomized&#xD;
             partner (6 months minimum); abstinence; or bilateral tubal ligation (if no conception&#xD;
             post-procedure). These precautions are necessary due to unknown effects that LEISH-F3&#xD;
             + GLA SE or LEISH-F3 alone might have in a fetus or newborn infant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following screening laboratory blood tests must have values within the normal&#xD;
             ranges or not clinically significant as determined by the PI and Medical Monitor:&#xD;
             sodium, potassium, BUN, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine,&#xD;
             fasting glucose, fasting lipid panel, total WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following serology tests must be negative: HIV 1/2 antibody, hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative urine test for recreational drugs and alcohol per Clinical Research Unit&#xD;
             standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urinalysis not clinically significant as determined by the study clinician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be capable of completing a study diary in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must give written informed consent, be able and willing to attend all evaluation&#xD;
             visits, be reachable by telephone or personal contact by the study site personnel, and&#xD;
             have a permanent address.&#xD;

             prednisone; high dose inhaled steroids) or cytotoxic therapies (e.g., chemotherapy&#xD;
             drugs or radiation) within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a blood transfusion within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donated blood products (platelets, whole blood, plasma, etc.) within past 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received any vaccine within past 1 month. Note: No immunizations while on study with&#xD;

             pulmonary, neurological, hepatic, rheumatic, hematological, metabolic, or renal&#xD;
             disorders, controlled hypertension), or use of medication that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Principal Investigator, may interfere with the evaluation of the safety or&#xD;
             immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;

             vaccine injection site or interfere with its evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI greater than 30 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypertension (systolic greater than 150 or diastolic greater than 95).&#xD;
