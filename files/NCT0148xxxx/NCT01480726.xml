    <textblock>
      Vena saphena magna is still frequently used as graft material in coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      grating(CABG, and vein grafts can harvest with either the conventional open technique (Ovh =&#xD;
      open vein harvesting), or with less invasive endoscopic techniques (EVH = Endoscopic vein&#xD;
      harvesting). The endoscopic techniques have been shown to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative wound complications while patients are more satisfied with the cosmetic result&#xD;
      of the operation on the leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized studies have raised doubts about patency rates of the vein grafts following&#xD;
      EVH compared to OVH, while other studies failed to detect any problems in relation to this.&#xD;
      There are only very few data on long-term patency rates from randomized studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate clinical outcome and patency rates of the vein&#xD;
      grafts following either EVH and OVH in 132 patients who underwent CABG for 4-7 years ago as&#xD;
      part of a randomized study investigation wound complications. A cost-effectiveness analysis&#xD;
      will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is: Patency rates following EVH are worse compared to OVH in CABG 4-7 years&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vena saphena magna is frequently used as graft material in coronary artery bypass grafting&#xD;
      (CABG. Vein grafts can be harvested with conventional open technique (OVH = open vein&#xD;
      harvesting), or with various endoscopic less invasive techniques (EVH = Endoscopic vein&#xD;
      harvesting). The endoscopic techniques have been shown to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative wound complications and patients are more satisfied with the cosmetic surgery&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-randomized trials, however, cast doubt on the patency rates of the vein grafts following&#xD;
      EVH compared to OVH, while other studies including one randomized trial failed to detect any&#xD;
      problems regarding this. There are no data regarding long-term patency rate following EVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore valuable to conduct a secondary follow-up among CABG patients who 4-7 years&#xD;
      ago were included in a randomized trial focusing on wound complications from the leg.&#xD;
      Although the study was not designed to evaluate the clinical results and patency rates of&#xD;
      vein graft, such a study may still contribute with important knowledge because the results&#xD;
      will come from a randomized patient cohorts, in contrast to results from most other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate long-term patency rates (4-7 years) patency rates and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      following EVH and OVH in first-time CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to perform a health economic analysis (cost-effectiveness analysis) to assess&#xD;
      which of the two harvesting methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patency rates following EVH are worse compared to OVH in CABG 4-7 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EVH is associated with an increased incidence of recurrence of angina and the need for&#xD;
           re-revascularization compared with OVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Although EVH immediately leads to higher direct costs compared with OVH, there is a&#xD;
           health economic benefit of this method in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment consists of a follow-up among 129 of 132 former patients who underwent&#xD;
      first-time CABG between April 2004 - June 2007 at Aalborg Hospital, Aarhus University&#xD;
      Hospital, Denmark, comparing EVH and OVH. Register data will be collected and patient records&#xD;
      will be reviewed. Surviving patients will be invited for a clinical evaluation. CT-angio in&#xD;
      order to compare long-term patency rates of the vein grafts will be performed. Furthermore&#xD;
      the incidence of recurrent angina, acute coronary syndrome, need for re-revascularization and&#xD;
      cardiovascular death since the operation wil be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All direct and indirect costs of the two methods of surgery and throughout the postoperative&#xD;
      course until this study will be valued in order to perform a health economic analysis&#xD;
      (cost-effectiveness analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects The age of the previous trial subjects was 65 years (range 43-90 years, at the time&#xD;
      they were included in the previous study, and survivors will be 4-7 years old today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that most of the surviving former patients will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 129 former patients who were included in the initial trial may be included. Deceased&#xD;
      patients are only included in the trial regarding registry data and medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria (in relation to the clinical examination):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of consent. (Register Data for previous patients who did not give their informed consent&#xD;
      for a clinical follow-up may be included in the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria (in relation to CT-angio):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Former patients with at least one of the following exclusion criteria will not have a&#xD;
      CT-angio performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      p-creatinine&gt; 120 micromol / l Estimated GFR (eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate)&#xD;
      per 1.73 m2 &lt;60 ml / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atrial fibrillation Allergy to contrast media Pregnancy Breastfeeding Lack of consent&#xD;
