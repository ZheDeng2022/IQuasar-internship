  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-armed, open label study on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      sequential IP therapy(Irinotecan plus cisplatin) and octreotide lar in the treatment of GI&#xD;
      poorly diffrentiated Neuroendocrine carcinoma. Patient with written consents will enter the&#xD;
      phase one step of the trial, receiving IP therpy. Once the IP therapy has been finished&#xD;
      without disease progression or progression occurs during the treatment, the patient will&#xD;
      enter the phase two step of the trial, receiving octreotide treatment. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is progression free survival in the two steps respectively and secondary endpoint is disease&#xD;
      control rate, overall survival and safety&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to investigate the overall progression free suvival for irinotecan plus cisplatin and octretide. The respective PFS of the two treatment steps will also be investigated. The result will be compared with the history treatment outcomes for patients of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.</description>
