  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive disorder in women of&#xD;
      reproductive age and despite decades of research the etiology the disorder is not known. The&#xD;
      characteristic hyperandrogenism and anovulation is associated with abnormal neuroendocrine&#xD;
      function and insulin resistance. Obesity is a common correlated phenotype of Polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome and weight gain worsens the reproductive and metabolic complications. Currently&#xD;
      there is no evidence-based treatment plan for infertility in Polycystic ovary syndrome; yet&#xD;
      weight loss by dietary restriction and regular exercise are strongly advocated. Weight loss&#xD;
      and increased insulin sensitivity appear to drive improvements in reproductive outcomes in&#xD;
      women with Polycystic ovary syndrome; however, the mechanism connecting these changes with&#xD;
      the reproductive axis is not fully understood.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to determine (using dietary restriction, exercise training,&#xD;
      metformin or no treatment), the effects of weight loss and/or improved insulin sensitivity on&#xD;
      reproductive function (neuroendocrine and ovarian) in obese women with Polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

Total energy expenditure as measured by a 14-day doubly labeled water (DLW) study will be used to determine the baseline energy intake of each subject. There will be no gradual ramping of dietary restriction. The 25% energy reduction goal will apply from the first day of the intervention for a period of 24 weeks. Subjects will be asked to not modify their normal level of physical activity.</description>

    <description>For the aerobic training component, subjects are required to meet a weekly energy expenditure target of 10 kcal per kg of body weight per week (KKW).&#xD;
The resistance training program will be performed 2 days a week. The resistance program includes 9 exercises. The 9 primary exercises are seated chest press, seated row, shoulder press, lat pull down, double leg press, leg extension, leg curl, back extension and abdominal crunch.</description>
