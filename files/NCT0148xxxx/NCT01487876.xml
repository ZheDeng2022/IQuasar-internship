      In order to study the immunotherapeutic effects of electroporation (EP)-mediated&#xD;
      dual-plasmids Hepatitis B Virus DNA vaccine, the investigators plan to conduct a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, approved by Chinese State Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration with written informed consent from each chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients&#xD;
      with baseline ALT more than 2 times the ULN, for whom antiviral treatment is indicated and&#xD;
      who were under the simultaneous lamivudine (LAM) chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) affects approximately more than 350 million people worldwide, leading&#xD;
      to a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from an asymptomatic carrier state to&#xD;
      self-limited acute infection or fulminant hepatitis to chronic hepatitis with progression to&#xD;
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and poses a serious public health problem in endemic&#xD;
      counties like China. Current available therapeutic remedies such as interferons and&#xD;
      nucleotide/nucleoside analogues are far from satisfactory, for their therapeutic efficacies&#xD;
      are limited by the high economic cost with the less tolerable adverse effects or the lack of&#xD;
      viral eradicative effect for its long term control of the virus in most of the patients.&#xD;
      Viral persistence has been associated with a defect in the development of HBV-specific&#xD;
      cellular immunity. Strategies to boost or to broaden the weak virus-specific T-cell response&#xD;
      of patients with chronic hepatitis B have been proposed as a means of curing this persistent&#xD;
      infection. HBV envelope- and nucleocapsid-based vaccines, new formulations for recombinant&#xD;
      vaccines and DNA-based vaccines are currently being assessed in clinical trials, among which&#xD;
      DNA vaccine represents a promising immunotherapeutic approach that can induce T-cell mediated&#xD;
      antigen specific immunity, owing to its de novo intracellular antigenic protein expression&#xD;
      and synthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical trials, although HBV DNA vaccination developed protective antibody responses and&#xD;
      antigen-specific CD8 T cells in healthy hepatitis-naive human volunteers, the detectable&#xD;
      HBV-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells and decreased serum HBV DNA levels only in some chronic&#xD;
      HBV carriers vaccinated with HBV PreS2/S DNA vaccine were limited. One resolution for the&#xD;
      main obstacles of the new technique development is to enhance the transfection efficiency of&#xD;
      plasmids into host cells; the other is to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine by&#xD;
      driving the naïve T cell responses towards the Th1 profile. To tackle the first problem of&#xD;
      low transfection rate of DNA vaccine, the investigators had applied the in vivo&#xD;
      electroporation (EP) for potency enhancement of HBV DNA vaccine, which dramatically improved&#xD;
      the host cell transfection of the plasmids and enabled the DNA vaccine the investigators&#xD;
      prepared to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses in the large body weight&#xD;
      animals like rabbit and nonhuman primates. In order to achieve the second goal of&#xD;
      immunogenicity improvement of HBV DNA vaccine for its therapeutic usage, the investigators&#xD;
      had designed and constructed the Th1 type cytokines (interleukin-2 and interferon-γ) fusion&#xD;
      protein expression gene plasmids (pFP), in attempt to direct Th1 bias in favor of cellular&#xD;
      immunity augment when being used in combination with HBV DNA vaccine. Both tactics in the&#xD;
      form of the dual-plasmids DNA vaccination mediated by EP have been investigated to be safe&#xD;
      and efficient to improve the transfection and enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccine to&#xD;
      the host in both animal models and in phase I,II trials of healthy volunteers and CHB&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the immunotherapeutic effects of EP-mediated dual-plasmids HBV DNA vaccine,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to conduct a clinical trial, approved by Chinese State Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (license number: 2006L03542) with written informed consent from each patient.&#xD;
      The trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled one in CHB patients with baseline&#xD;
      ALT more than 2 times the ULN, for whom antiviral treatment is indicated and who were under&#xD;
      the simultaneous lamivudine (LAM) chemotherapy.&#xD;
