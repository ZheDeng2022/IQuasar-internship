    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to observe and document the efficacy and safety of 5 or more&#xD;
      Adacolumn treatments, administered once weekly over 5 or more weeks, in a specific subset of&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis patients. The patient subset of interest is those with moderate/severe,&#xD;
      steroid-dependent, active ulcerative colitis with insufficient response or intolerance to&#xD;
      immunosuppressants and/or biological agents.&#xD;
