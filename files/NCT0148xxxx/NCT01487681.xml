    <textblock>
      Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection contributes as a main causative factor to the&#xD;
      development of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and its precursors (cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
      neoplasia, CIN). Currently, two prophylactic vaccines are employed for the prevention of&#xD;
      genital HPV infection. As the prophylactic efficacy is type-restricted, determining the&#xD;
      type-specific HPV distribution and their associations with ICC and its precursors would&#xD;
      provide essential information in assessment of HPV vaccination program impact. The baseline&#xD;
      information is also important for monitoring possible changes in type-specific HPV&#xD;
      distribution after vaccination has been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of HPV infection varies considerably across the world, and data were limited from&#xD;
      less-developed countries. Knowledge of the detail pattern of HPV type-specific distribution&#xD;
      in each region will be essential for public health policy decisions. This will also form the&#xD;
      basis for determining which types should be included in future generation HPV vaccines&#xD;
      targeted to specific regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most studies were focus on ICC and high-grade cervical lesions, the association between&#xD;
      HPV types and the progression of CIN1 has rarely been studied. CIN1 is an insensitive&#xD;
      histopathological sign of HPV infection, most of which will spontaneously regress to normal&#xD;
      with host immune system. However, some genotypes have been described as being more persistent&#xD;
      and associated with progression from low-grade lesions to high-grade lesions, even ICC.&#xD;
      Geographical data on type-specific prevalence of HPV in CIN1 with appropriately designed&#xD;
      prospective studies would be helpful in identifying types preferentially associated with&#xD;
      progression to malignancy and accurately predicting the future impact of vaccination in&#xD;
      specific regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Free vaccination supported by the government appears to be unlikely at present in China.&#xD;
      Thus, individuals need to pay the cost of vaccines for themselves presently. Yangtze River&#xD;
      Delta Area is the most economically developed regions in China, and people here may become&#xD;
      the largest vaccinated population at their own expense in China. To the best of the&#xD;
      investigators knowledge, no multi-center study on HPV type-specific distribution and their&#xD;
      associations with ICC and its precursors is available in Yangtze River Delta Area, China,&#xD;
      which highlights the need for timely study in this region before large scale vaccination&#xD;
      programs are carried out.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of cervical cancer estimated to be 500,000 cases per year with a 50% case&#xD;
      fatality rate. Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, which is the most common sexually&#xD;
      transmitted viral infection, contributes as a main causative factor to the development of&#xD;
      invasive cervical cancer (ICC) and its precursors (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, CIN).&#xD;
      Thus, prophylactic HPV vaccines hold great promise to reduce the global burden of cervical&#xD;
      cancer, especially in areas with no or limited screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, two prophylactic vaccines, a quadrivalent (Gardasil®, Merck &amp; Co. Inc) and a&#xD;
      bivalent (Cervarix™, GlaxoSmithKline) vaccine, are employed for the prevention of genital HPV&#xD;
      infection in more than 100 countries, and showed high efficacy for the prevention of target&#xD;
      HPV related CIN2+. Merck is also conducting a Phase III trial of a vaccine protecting against&#xD;
      nine types. As the prophylactic efficacy is type-restricted and not all the different types&#xD;
      of HPV are covered by currently available vaccines, determining the type-specific HPV&#xD;
      distribution and their associations with ICC and its precursors would provide essential&#xD;
      information in assessment of HPV vaccination program impact. What is more, it is possible&#xD;
      that the decrease in the prevalence of the target types of these vaccines could affect the&#xD;
      distribution of other types, so the baseline information is also important for monitoring&#xD;
      possible changes in type-specific HPV distribution after vaccination has been introduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous meta-analyses had showed that in ICC, HPV 16 was most common, followed by HPV 18,&#xD;
      while HPV 16/18 prevalence was 52% among high-grade cervical lesions. However, the prevalence&#xD;
      of HPV infection varies considerably across the world, and data were limited from&#xD;
      less-developed countries, let alone multi-center studies. Knowledge of the detail pattern of&#xD;
      HPV type-specific distribution in each region will be essential for public health policy&#xD;
      decisions. This will also form the basis for determining which types should be included in&#xD;
      future generation HPV vaccines targeted to specific regions. A tailed HPV vaccine according&#xD;
      to regional prevalence would best serve the population in primary prevention for ICC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, while most studies were focus on ICC and high-grade cervical lesions, the&#xD;
      association between HPV types and the progression of CIN1 has rarely been studied. CIN1 is an&#xD;
      insensitive histopathological sign of HPV infection, most of which will spontaneously regress&#xD;
      to normal with host immune system. However, some genotypes have been described as being more&#xD;
      persistent and associated with progression from low-grade lesions to high-grade lesions, even&#xD;
      ICC. Geographical data on type-specific prevalence of HPV in CIN1 with appropriately designed&#xD;
      prospective studies would be helpful in identifying types preferentially associated with&#xD;
      progression to malignancy and accurately predicting the future impact of vaccination in&#xD;
      specific regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a randomized, double-blind trial testing the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil®, Merck &amp; Co. Inc) in Chinese women (V501-041-00) has been&#xD;
      conducting and is proposed to be finished in three years. The bivalent vaccine (Cervarix™,&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline) also has applied the phase III double-blind, randomized controlled trial in&#xD;
      Chinese women. These prophylactic vaccines might be licensed and commercially available in&#xD;
      China after trials finish. However, free vaccination supported by the government appears to&#xD;
      be unlikely at present according to current economic status of China. Thus, individuals at&#xD;
      least presently need to pay the cost of vaccines for themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yangtze River Delta Area, including Shanghai city, Zhejiang Province and Jiangsu Province, is&#xD;
      the most economically developed regions in China. According to media report, the total GDP in&#xD;
      Yangtze River Delta area was approximated 1.064 trillion U.S. dollars in 2010, and the per&#xD;
      capita GDP has exceeded 4,000 U.S. dollars since 2005. As people here have the highest health&#xD;
      awareness and needs, they may become the largest vaccinated population at their own expense&#xD;
      in China. To the best of our knowledge, no multi-center study on HPV type-specific&#xD;
      distribution and their associations with ICC and its precursors is available in Yangtze River&#xD;
      Delta Area, China, except for the mono-center study in Zhejiang Province, which highlights&#xD;
      the need for timely study in this region before large scale vaccination programs are carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
