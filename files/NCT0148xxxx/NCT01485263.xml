      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to characterize the abnormal neuronal firing patterns of&#xD;
      basal ganglia neurons and those in the premotor cortex in patients with treatment-resistant&#xD;
      movement disorders undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen adult patients with treatment-resistant movement disorders who are undergoing deep&#xD;
      brain stimulation surgery at Suburban Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland, will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a physiology study of treatment-resistant movement disorder patients who have been&#xD;
      scheduled for implantation of a deep brain stimulation device into the Nucleus accumbens.&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, patients will learn a rewarded visual-motor task and undergo&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography. The task will be repeated during DBS surgery, with collection of&#xD;
      information on electrical activity including single neuronal unit and local field potentials.&#xD;
      The task and MEG will be repeated 3-4 months after surgery. The collected data will be&#xD;
      analyzed for coherence patterns during rest and rewarded movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to characterize and quantify the oscillatory activity present in motor circuits of&#xD;
      treatment-resistant movement disorder patients during rewarded visually guided movements. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that during visually guided movements, neuronal coherence will be significantly&#xD;
      increased relative to resting periods. Thus, by better understanding the alteration in&#xD;
      oscillatory patterns in these patients, we hope to develop better DBS stimulation paradigms&#xD;
      in order to better treat this disease in the future.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this pilot study is to characterize the abnormal neuronal firing patterns of&#xD;
      basal ganglia and thalamic neurons and those in the premotor cortex in patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant movement disorders undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery.&#xD;
      Neuronal activity will be studied in a decision-making task guided by reward. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will involve study of how activity in the brain is modulated in such a task and&#xD;
      how DBS can influence the cerebral activity related to decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen adult patients with treatment-resistant movement disorders (Essential tremor or&#xD;
      Parkinson s disease) who are undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery at Suburban Hospital,&#xD;
      Bethesda, Maryland, will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a physiology study of medically refractory patients who have been scheduled for&#xD;
      implantation of a deep brain stimulation device into basal ganglia or thalamic structures.&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, patients will learn a rewarded visual-motor task and undergo&#xD;
      magnetoencephalography (MEG). The task will be repeated during DBS surgery, with collection&#xD;
      of information on electrical activity including single neuronal unit and local field&#xD;
      potentials. The task and MEG will be repeated 3 and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be analyzed for coherence patterns during rest and rewarded&#xD;
      movements. We plan to characterize and quantify the oscillatory activity present in motor&#xD;
      circuits of patients during rewarded visually guided movements. We hypothesize that during&#xD;
      visually guided movements, neuronal coherence will be significantly increased relative to&#xD;
      resting periods. Activity during surgery will be compared with MEG recordings in the same&#xD;
      task both before and after surgery. By understanding the alteration in oscillatory patterns&#xD;
      in these patients, we hope to improve DBS stimulation paradigms in order to optimize&#xD;
      treatment protocols.&#xD;
