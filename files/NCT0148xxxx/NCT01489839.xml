      The primary purpose of the study will be to look for biological biomarkers to determine which&#xD;
      people with gum disease will have a worsening of the disease. A second objective of this&#xD;
      study will be to look at the effects of periodontal treatment on the levels of the biomarkers&#xD;
      that are identified.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter clinical study will investigate biomarkers of periodontal disease&#xD;
      progression. The study will enroll 375 subjects with periodontal disease and 125&#xD;
      periodontally healthy subjects. All subjects will be monitored clinically and have samples&#xD;
      taken every 2 months for 12 months for analysis of inflammatory and immunological biomarkers&#xD;
      and microbial species. Subjects displaying periodontal disease progression greater than an&#xD;
      established threshold will receive periodontal rescue therapy at progressing periodontal&#xD;
      sites and continue with monitoring. Periodontally healthy subjects and non-progressing sites&#xD;
      in subjects with periodontal disease will serve as controls. After 12 months, subjects with&#xD;
      periodontal disease will receive periodontal therapy consisting of 4 quadrants of scaling and&#xD;
      root planing. Periodontally healthy subjects will receive prophylaxis and scaling and exit&#xD;
      the study. Following periodontal therapy, subjects with periodontal disease will be followed&#xD;
      for a maintenance period of 6 months for clinical and biological monitoring. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will compare biomarkers and microbial species between periodontally healthy subjects&#xD;
      and subjects with periodontal disease, between progressing and non-progressing periodontally&#xD;
      diseased sites, and between periodontally diseased sites before and after periodontal&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Clinical Attachment Level (CAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>After the baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinic every 2 months (± 7 days relative to baseline) for 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary study outcome will be progression of periodontal disease as determined by CAL. Initial disease progression at a site will be defined as loss of ≥2 mm in CAL at any assessment or follow-up visit compared with baseline. Subsequent disease progression will be similarly defined except that the loss in CAL will be compared with the last visit at which disease progression was detected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker Levels compared between progressing and non-progressing sites as determined by CAL changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Levels measured every 2 months for 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarker levels will be compared between progressing and non-progressing periodontally diseased sites. The biomarkers include microbial species in saliva, GCF, and plaque and inflammatory and immunological markers in serum, saliva, and GCF. In addition, differences will be compared between diseased subjects before and after periodontal therapy and between periodontally diseased and healthy subjects.</description>

    <description>Subjects with periodontal disease will be enrolled. Subjects with mild disease will have at least 4 teeth with at least 1 site with pocketing of 5 mm or more and concomitant attachment greater than or equal to 2 mm, and radiographic evidence of mesial or distal alveolar bone loss around at least 2 of the affected teeth. Subjects with severe disease will have at least 8 teeth with a site having &gt;5mm pocketing and loss of 3 mm attachment with evidence of alveolar bone loss in 2 teeth.</description>

    <description>Periodontally healthy subjects have no teeth with pocketing of 4 mm or greater and attachment loss, with the exception of the distal of the second molars where a pocket of 4 mm and concomitant attachment of up to 2 mm will be acceptable.

    <description>All subjects will have professional dental prophylaxis and periodontal therapy withheld for 12 months during the disease progression and monitoring phase. After 12 months, subjects with periodontal disease will receive periodontal therapy to consist of scaling and root planing, and periodontally healthy subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis. Subjects with periodontal disease will also receive Supportive Periodontal Therapy at the 3- and 6-month post-therapy visits. Subjects showing periodontal disease progression greater than a predetermined threshold during the monitoring or maintenance phases of the study will be given rescue therapy consisting of placement of a local antibiotic at the site of disease progression.</description>

      visit for 12 months, and the 6-month post-therapy visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood. Ten mL of blood will be obtained by venipuncture from the antecubital fossa. Subjects&#xD;
      consenting to have a blood sample drawn for future DNA analysis will have an additional 7 mL&#xD;
      of blood drawn at the baseline visit.&#xD;
