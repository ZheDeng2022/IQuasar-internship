      The lack of substance screening and referral in healthcare settings is a significant problem&#xD;
      with far-reaching consequences, including excess morbidity, premature mortality, and inflated&#xD;
      healthcare costs. An easy to use, time-efficient referral system is needed to address this&#xD;
      problem. The Substance Treatment Referral Systems (STaRS), a computer assisted screening and&#xD;
      referral system, was developed to meet this need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STaRS Phase I demonstrated the feasibility of STaRS to meet this need. All aims and&#xD;
      evaluation goals of the Phase I study were met or exceeded. The purpose of the Phase II&#xD;
      research is to demonstrate the clinical utility and commercial viability of STaRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of Phase II are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Integrate STaRS with the Epic electronic health record used in the Cooper Health System&#xD;
           in Camden, N.J.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Document STaRS' effectiveness in (a) increasing the number of referrals provided for&#xD;
           substance abuse treatment and HIV screening, and (b) increasing the proportion of&#xD;
           patients that initiate specialty treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate clinician acceptance and impact upon revenue generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted at Cooper Family Medicine (CFM) department of Cooper&#xD;
      University Hospital in New Jersey. We will determine the rate of referrals and treatment&#xD;
      initiation for 3,500 adult patients treated during treatment as usual (the time before STaRS&#xD;
      is implemented at CFM) as well as 3,500 adult patients treated after the introduction of&#xD;
      STaRS. Patients will be asked about the referral initiation process, and CFM healthcare&#xD;
      providers will be asked to evaluate the system from a clinical and administrative&#xD;
      prospective. Finally, billing records will be reviewed during the STaRS implementation to&#xD;
      determine whether STaRS impacted revenue for the practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STaRS is a computer assisted screening and referral system for problem substance use,&#xD;
      designed for use in medical settings. The primary function of STaRS is to facilitate&#xD;
      physician referrals for tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, and HIV screening, tailored to the&#xD;
      patient's condition and circumstances (e.g., zip code and insurance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prototype of STaRS was developed and found to be feasible in medical settings in Phase I.&#xD;
      Phase II research will demonstrate clinical utility and commercial viability of the system in&#xD;
      a medical setting (e.g., Cooper University Hospital Family Medicine practices). Prior to&#xD;
      beginning the Phase II research, focus groups were conducted to refine changes to the STaRS&#xD;
      software. These focus groups consisted of healthcare providers from Cooper Family Medicine&#xD;
      (CFM) practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II research will be conducted in several parts, described in the following&#xD;
      sub-studies, conducted simultaneously:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Referral Sub-Study. To determine the impact of STaRS on the rate of referral for&#xD;
           substance abuse treatment and HIV screening, 7,000 adult patients' charts will be&#xD;
           reviewed (3,500 patients seen prior to STaRs implementation and 3,500 patients seen&#xD;
           after STaRS implementation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Initiation Sub-Study. To test the effectiveness of STaRS on treatment&#xD;
           initiation, 140 patients who receive referrals during the STaRS implementation will be&#xD;
           telephoned by research staff and invited to participate in this sub-study to document&#xD;
           treatment initiation. Treatment initiation refers to whether the patient has made&#xD;
           contact or scheduled an appointment with the referral provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Billing and Revenue Generation Sub-Study. Seven thousand medical records will be&#xD;
           reviewed for the referral study (described above). Patients who were given referrals for&#xD;
           substance use and HIV screening will have their billing records reviewed by the Cooper&#xD;
           Research Assistant (RA). The goal is to determine the amount billed for the session in&#xD;
           which the referral was made and the amount paid by the insurer (or Medicaid, Medicare).&#xD;
           This data will be used to determine the effectiveness of STaRS to increase revenues for&#xD;
           the practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provider Evaluation of STaRS Sub-Study. At the conclusion of the study, focus groups&#xD;
           will be conducted with the CFM healthcare providers. The focus groups will have 3 goals:&#xD;
           Rating the STaRS system on ease of use and clinical utility; soliciting suggestions&#xD;
           regarding enhancements to STaRS and procedures to implementation and training; and&#xD;
           identifying any factors that may have influenced the providers to screen or refer&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
