    <textblock>
      Part 1 (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the first part of the study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of different doses and dosing regimens of oral rucaparib administered daily to&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2A (Completed Enrollment) and Part 2B (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the second&#xD;
      part of the study is to determine the safety and clinical activity of the RP2D of oral&#xD;
      rucaparib administered daily to patients with a known deleterious BRCA mutation (germline or&#xD;
      somatic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 (Completed Enrollment) - The purpose of the third part of the study is to further&#xD;
      evaluate PK of higher dose strength tablets at the RP2D in patients with any advanced solid&#xD;
      tumor, inclusive of lymphoma, with evidence of a BRCA mutation (germline or somatic).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rucaparib (CO-338; formerly known as PF 01367338 and AG 14699) is an orally available, small&#xD;
      molecule inhibitor of poly-adenosine diphosphate [ADP] ribose polymerase (PARP) being&#xD;
      developed for treatment of ovarian cancer associated with homologous recombination [HR] DNA&#xD;
      repair deficiency (HRD). The safety and efficacy of rucaparib has been evaluated in several&#xD;
      Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral formulation is the focus of current development efforts. Rucaparib is currently being&#xD;
      investigated as monotherapy in patients with cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.&#xD;
      For this study, it is anticipated that rucaparib will promote cell death in the&#xD;
      BRCA-deficient tumor cells of ovarian cancer patients with evidence of a germline mutation,&#xD;
      thereby limiting tumor progression and providing therapeutic benefit.&#xD;

        <title>Food Effect on PK of Rucaparib - Cmax (Part 1 and Part 3)</title>
        <description>Cmax = maximum concentration following administration of rucaparib. The effect of food on rucaparib PK parameters was assessed over a 24-hour period in blood samples from a subset of patients. Patients were given a single dose of 40 mg or 300 mg rucaparib (Part 1), or 600 mg rucaparib (Part 3) and were randomized to one of two sequences where they were either Fed (with a high-fat meal) or Fasted (without a high-fat meal) on Day -7 or Cycle 1 Day 1. On each day, patients underwent blood sampling for PK at the specified time points. The median Fed and Fasted Cmax values were calculated for each arm.</description>

        <description>QTcF value change from baseline by daily dose corrected using Fridericia's method (QTcF). To evaluate the effects of rucaparib on the QT (interval from Q wave to T wave)/QTc (interval corrected for heart rate) interval, all patients underwent serial ECG monitoring at Screening, on Cycle 1 Day -1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 22, on Day 1 of all subsequent cycles, at the EOT Visit, and as clinically indicated. Worst post-baseline QTcF value was used to categorize each patient.</description>

        <population>Safety population: Consist of all Part 1 patients who received at least one dose of rucaparib. One patient in the 40 mg dose group had no Baseline evaluation and was excluded from analyses of change from Baseline.</population>

          <title>QTcF Value Change From Baseline (Part 1)</title>
          <description>QTcF value change from baseline by daily dose corrected using Fridericia's method (QTcF). To evaluate the effects of rucaparib on the QT (interval from Q wave to T wave)/QTc (interval corrected for heart rate) interval, all patients underwent serial ECG monitoring at Screening, on Cycle 1 Day -1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 1 Day 22, on Day 1 of all subsequent cycles, at the EOT Visit, and as clinically indicated. Worst post-baseline QTcF value was used to categorize each patient.</description>
          <population>Safety population: Consist of all Part 1 patients who received at least one dose of rucaparib. One patient in the 40 mg dose group had no Baseline evaluation and was excluded from analyses of change from Baseline.</population>
