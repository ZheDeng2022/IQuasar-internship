  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People are being asked to participate in this study who have metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of&#xD;
      drugs, ABT-888 and mFOLFOX-6 (modified 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin) for patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABT-888 inhibits an enzyme called &quot;PARP&quot; which helps to fix damaged DNA. By inhibiting this&#xD;
      enzyme, ABT-888 prevents cancer cells from repairing the damage caused by the mFOLFOX-6, and&#xD;
      will hopefully increase the killing of cancer cells, thus decreasing the tumors in your body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single arm, open-label Phase I/II study to evaluate the clinical activity of the&#xD;
      novel inhibitor of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), ABT-888 with modified FOLFOX-6&#xD;
      (5-Fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin) in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
