  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a scientific study on patients who do not have any limbal stem cells.&#xD;
      In this clinical study tissue is taken from the inside of the mouth, and cells from that&#xD;
      tissue (epithelial cells) will be grown to form a multilayered cell-sheet, called CAOMECS,&#xD;
      which is then transplanted onto the cornea. This transplantation method should repair the&#xD;
      damage of the cornea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to see if the transplantation of CAOMECS renews the surface of the&#xD;
      eye, by preventing the growth of the conjunctiva over the cornea and stopping new small blood&#xD;
      vessels forming.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open clinical study without a control group, which means that all patients will be&#xD;
      given the study treatment (CAOMECS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults as well as minor patients can participate in this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAOMECS is undergoing a clinical trial, which means that it has not yet been officially&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of this disease. Up to now it was clinically tested in France, on&#xD;
      26 people with limbal stem cell loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to restore the ocular surface epithelium of patients with&#xD;
      total LSCD by preventing or reducing recurrent conjunctivalization and neovascularization up&#xD;
      to 12 months post-transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open, multi-center study with CAOMECS in patients with total LSCD.&#xD;
      Stem cells will be isolated from an oral mucosa biopsy and will be grown in cell culture. The&#xD;
      resultant epithelial cell-sheets will then be transplanted to the ocular surface of the&#xD;
      respective patients under general anesthesia. After transplantation patients may be&#xD;
      hospitalized according to routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, the study will consist of a screening visit where eligibility will be evaluated, the&#xD;
      day of the biopsy, the day before the transplantation where baseline data will be evaluated,&#xD;
      the transplantation (day 0), and a follow-up period consisting of nine visits at days 1, 5,&#xD;
      and 10 and months 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36. Other visits as clinically indicated may also&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
