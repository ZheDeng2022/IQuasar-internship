  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Average Sleep Latency Time (in Minutes) as Determined From the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) Following Two Weeks of Treatment With ADX-N05 vs. Two Weeks of Treatment With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 2 weeks post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period of time. The change from baseline in the mean sleep latency from the MWT was the average of sleep latency from the four trials of the MWT.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score During Weeks 1 and 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 3 post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The ESS is a questionnaire intended to measure daytime sleepiness. In this test, participants answer questions with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over approximately the 7 days prior to the assessment while performing eight common, non-stimulating activities. The ESS total score range is 1 to 24. Each activity is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;would never doze&quot; to a maximum of &quot;a high chance of dozing.&quot; Thus, the ESS scale range is as follows: 0=would never doze, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing; 0 indicates a better outcome, and 3 indicates a worse outcome. A negative mean change value indicates a decrease in score from baseline and an improvement in daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improved Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Scores During Weeks 1 and 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and Week 3 post-dose.</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C scale was completed at Week 1 through 4 visits. The participant was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;Very much improved&quot; to a maximum of &quot;Very much worse.&quot; The proportion of participants experiencing at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C was calculated and summarized for each of the two weeks of each of the treatment periods. The CGI-C scale consists of the following ratings: 1-Very Much improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Minimally improved, 4-No change, 5-Minimally worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse; a rating of 1 indicates a better outcome, and a rating of 7 indicates a worse outcome. Improvement was defined as a CGI-rating of 1, 2, or 3.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score During Weeks 1 and 3</title>
        <description>The ESS is a questionnaire intended to measure daytime sleepiness. In this test, participants answer questions with regard to the level of sleepiness they experienced over approximately the 7 days prior to the assessment while performing eight common, non-stimulating activities. The ESS total score range is 1 to 24. Each activity is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;would never doze&quot; to a maximum of &quot;a high chance of dozing.&quot; Thus, the ESS scale range is as follows: 0=would never doze, 1=slight chance of dozing, 2=moderate chance of dozing, 3=high chance of dozing; 0 indicates a better outcome, and 3 indicates a worse outcome. A negative mean change value indicates a decrease in score from baseline and an improvement in daytime sleepiness.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Improved Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Scores During Weeks 2 and 4</title>
          <description>The CGI-C scale was completed at Week 1 through 4 visits. The participant was rated on a 7-point scale ranging from a minimum of &quot;Very much improved&quot; to a maximum of &quot;Very much worse.&quot; The proportion of participants experiencing at least minimal improvement on the CGI-C was calculated and summarized for each of the two weeks of each of the treatment periods. The CGI-C scale consists of the following ratings: 1-Very Much improved, 2-Much improved, 3-Minimally improved, 4-No change, 5-Minimally worse, 6-Much worse, 7-Very much worse; a rating of 1 indicates a better outcome, and a rating of 7 indicates a worse outcome. Improvement was defined as a CGI-rating of 1, 2, or 3.</description>
