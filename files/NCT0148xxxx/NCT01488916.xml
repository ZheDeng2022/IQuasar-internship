  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in several&#xD;
      observational studies. However, the influences of vitamin D concentrations on postprandial&#xD;
      glucose in type 2 diabetes (DM) are less studied. The purposes of the study are to study the&#xD;
      effects of vitamin D inadequacy on postprandial glucose excursion and metabolic responses in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 DM. This is a cross-sectional study. About 150-180 patients will be&#xD;
      screened for serum levels of 25(OH)D. A total of 45 eligible patients will be grouped into&#xD;
      three groups by different vitamin D status: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency,&#xD;
      and the controls. The patients will receive a mixed meal test for postprandial glucose&#xD;
      excursion and metabolic responses. The investigators will use statistical methods to assess&#xD;
      the differences in post-challenge glucose and metabolic response among the three groups of&#xD;
      patients. The investigators hope the study can explore the relationship between vitamin D and&#xD;
      glucose excursion in patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;

      three groups by different vitamin D status: vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D insufficiency,&#xD;
      and the controls. The patients will receive a mixed meal test for postprandial glucose&#xD;
      excursion and metabolic responses. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to compare&#xD;
      the differences in clinical characteristics among the three groups. Univariate analyses of&#xD;
      general linear models will be used to compare the differences in meal-derived metabolic&#xD;
      indexes among the three groups, showing effects of confounding variables including age, sex,&#xD;
      obesity, and DM-related clinical parameters. Repeated-measures ANOVA will be used to assess&#xD;
      the differences in post-challenge glucose and metabolic response in the meal test, with or&#xD;
      without adjustments of the above covariates. Pearson and partial correlation procedures will&#xD;
      be used to test the correlations of 25(OH)D with clinical parameters including lipid profile,&#xD;
      HbA1c, and meal-derived metabolic indexes. Multiple linear regression models will be used in&#xD;
      an attempt to compare the degree to which 25(OH)D concentrations is associated with the&#xD;
      meal-derived metabolic indexes in these patients. The investigators hope the study can&#xD;
      explore the relationship between vitamin D and glucose excursion in patients with type 2 DM.&#xD;

        In the present study, we propose to screen patients with type 2 DM for vatamin D&#xD;
        inadequacy. Those with different vitamin D status will be invited to participate in a mixed&#xD;
        meal test.&#xD;
