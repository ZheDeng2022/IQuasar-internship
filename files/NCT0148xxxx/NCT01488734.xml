  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two different amounts of&#xD;
      vitamin D2 (600 or 4000 International Units/day) provided by mushrooms added to one of the&#xD;
      daily meals versus same doses of vitamin D3 provided as oral supplements sold in any&#xD;
      drugstore in reaching adequate or optimal blood levels of 25(OH)D in people with Vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency and pre-diabetes (high blood sugar without full blown diabetes) or the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is the name of a group of risk factors that raise the risk for&#xD;
      heart disease and other health problems, such as diabetes and stroke as described by the US&#xD;
      department of Health and Human Services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also attempt to demonstrate and compare the effect of the intervention with&#xD;
      above two doses of vitamin D on blood levels of tests that show inflammation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor vitamin D status is now considered epidemic in North America. In addition to its effects&#xD;
      on bone metabolism, Vitamin D has several other important biological effects including&#xD;
      modulating the immune system, stimulating the production of insulin and decreasing renin&#xD;
      production in the kidney. Furthermore, the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25&#xD;
      dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), is a very potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation and&#xD;
      inducer of terminal differentiation and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with higher&#xD;
      prevalence of cancer, autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis, type 1 diabetes and hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current recommendations for dietary vitamin D in North America are much too low to&#xD;
      maintain optimal levels of 25(OH)D associated with disease prevention. The majority of&#xD;
      circulating 25(0H) D originates from cutaneous synthesis upon exposure to adequate sunlight.&#xD;
      However, seasonal changes, living at high latitudes or low polluted altitudes, dark skin&#xD;
      pigmentation and aging are among the many factors that can impede this process requiring&#xD;
      periodic reliance on dietary sources to supply the precursor to 25(OH)D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In November of 2010, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Science&#xD;
      established new DRI values for vitamin: EAR (Estimated Average Requirement) of 400 IU (10 µg;&#xD;
      RDA ( Recommended Daily Intake) of 600 IU (15µg) for adults up to 70 years of age, and an UL&#xD;
      of 4000 IU (50µg) (21). The IOM also discourages the taking of dietary supplements to achieve&#xD;
      the RDA for vitamin D and encourages Americans to achieve their needed vitamin D through food&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be to provide meals with one serving of fresh mushroom per day that&#xD;
      could have two different levels of vitamin D2 in it (600 IU or 4,000 IU/day, which are the&#xD;
      2011 currently recommended RDA to age 70 AI and UL, respectively) for four months and test&#xD;
      both the bioavailability of vitamin D in mushroom, as reflected in blood 25(OH)D levels, as&#xD;
      well as the effect of vitamin D on markers of disease (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
      Hemoglobin A1c, etc). The vitamin D2 amount in mushrooms can easily be manipulated just by&#xD;
      adjusting the time and distance of their UVB exposure. Two groups will be compared with&#xD;
      controls who will receive the same dose of vitamin D3 in the form of tablets commercially&#xD;
      available (600 IU or 4000 IU/day).&#xD;
