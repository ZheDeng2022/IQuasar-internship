  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed only at the Jewish General Hospital. It will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of treatment with aliskiren, an inhibitor of renin, a substance produced by the kidney&#xD;
      that constricts arteries and raises blood pressure, on the blood vessels, specifically the&#xD;
      arteries, of subjects who have diabetes and elevated blood pressure (hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate blood vessels, different techniques will be used. For large arteries, these&#xD;
      will be studied by non invasive methods using detection of the pulse wave or using ultrasound&#xD;
      over the skin of the neck, the wrist and the groin. To study small vessels, the investigators&#xD;
      will perform a biopsy on the buttock, under local anesthesia, and obtain a small sample of&#xD;
      tissue from under the skin, from which the vessels will be dissected. The investigators have&#xD;
      performed many hundreds of these small biopsies over the past 20 years for similar studies&#xD;
      without any complications. The biopsies are very well tolerated. From this research the&#xD;
      investigators will thus be able to learn what the structure and function of these vessels is&#xD;
      in these patients, in comparison to a normal healthy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypertensive diabetic subjects will then be assigned by chance (randomized trial) to&#xD;
      treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren or a comparator, the diuretic&#xD;
      hydrochlorothiazide. Aliskiren is a relatively new drug used to treat hypertension that is&#xD;
      very well tolerated and is now being evaluated in numerous trials in hypertensive diabetic&#xD;
      individuals. The diuretic is a well-know agent used to treat high blood pressure now for many&#xD;
      years, and which is very well tolerated. Physicians, nurses and scientists involved in the&#xD;
      study will be unaware of who is receiving which drug, as will be the patients (this is the&#xD;
      meaning of double-blind trial). However, if there is any problem, the secret code will be&#xD;
      broken and the individual withdrawn from the study. Subjects will be treated for a year, and&#xD;
      the study procedures (non invasive and the biopsy) repeated at 6 months and after one year of&#xD;
      treatment. During the study, blood samples will be drawn and urine collected at certain&#xD;
      intervals to ensure safety of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once tissues are obtained they will be studied in the laboratory. The study of the vessels&#xD;
      will allow treatment us to determine how the treatment with the renin inhibitor aliskiren&#xD;
      affects the structure and function as well as cellular and molecular aspects of arteries of&#xD;
      hypertensive diabetic persons. The investigators expect these studies to provide us knowledge&#xD;
      on mechanisms and perhaps new targets for future therapies of cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
