    <textblock>
      Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumour that often presents with&#xD;
      extensive (metastatic) disease. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, with radiotherapy&#xD;
      to the primary tumour. It is now part of care to also offer Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation&#xD;
      (PCI) in order to prevent spread of the cancer into the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment can result after cranial irradiation. Lithium is thought to be&#xD;
      neuroprotective. It is hypothesized that lithium administration with PCI will be safe,&#xD;
      tolerable and feasible, and can be studied to prevent or ameliorate the ensuing cognitive&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;

      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumour that often presents with&#xD;
      extensive (metastatic) disease.[1] It frequently has micrometastatic disease at presentation.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment with radiotherapy to the primary tumour. It is now&#xD;
      part of care to offer Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI)with 25 Gy in 10 fractions&#xD;
      dependent on the extent of response in the primary tumour and the patient's performance&#xD;
      status. PCI is routine care for limited stage patients showing response and can be considered&#xD;
      in selected patients with limited stage disease showing good response.Somnolence syndrome is&#xD;
      a common intermediate side effect of cranial radiotherapy that occurs about six weeks after&#xD;
      treatment and manifests as lethargy, increased sleepiness and poor attention or subtle memory&#xD;
      changes and altered temperament[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cranial irradiation is linked to neurocognitive complications such as long term&#xD;
      memory, mood and concentration issues[3]. Decline in attention, executive function, motor,&#xD;
      language and general intellectual skills have all been reported. There is the suggestion of a&#xD;
      more rapid progression of dementing illness in patients receiving cranial irradiation&#xD;
      although the numbers of long term survivors is limited[3]. Radiation mediates neurocognitive&#xD;
      effects by affecting glial cells, neural stem and progenitor cells[4, 5] and the vascular&#xD;
      structures[3, 6]. Cranial irradiation delivered to mice has been shown to reduce neural&#xD;
      proliferation translating to long term reduction in neurogenesis[7, 8]. Lithium confers&#xD;
      neuroprotection and is associated with less cognitive loss in various brain injury models&#xD;
      including after cranial irradiation[9, 10]. In addition, neural stem/progenitor cells&#xD;
      positively respond to Lithium treatment under basal conditions[11, 12]. In humans, 4 weeks of&#xD;
      Lithium increases brain grey matter content[13] and hippocampal volume[14] as evidenced by&#xD;
      MRI scanning. Lithium was found to protect irradiated hippocampal neurons in mice from&#xD;
      apoptosis resulting in better performance reflecting learning and memory function[10].&#xD;
      Lithium is known to reduce oxidative stress, specifically via the glutathione system. Lithium&#xD;
      is a standard part of the management of moderate to severe bipolar disorder and&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorders and its toxicity profile is well understood[15, 16]. In bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, lithium has been shown to prevent the loss of cortical grey matter that occurs as&#xD;
      part of the neuroprogressive cascade seen in the disorder[17]. There is limited prospective&#xD;
      clinical data regarding the use of lithium as a neuroprotectant. A large Danish observational&#xD;
      cohort study, demonstrated that use of lithium (in those with mood disorders, who display an&#xD;
      increased risk for dementia) was associated with reduction of the rate of dementia to the&#xD;
      same level as that for the general population[18]. A follow up study by the same group showed&#xD;
      similar findings[19]. A metaanalysis of lithium on cognitive performance demonstrated minor&#xD;
      negative effects on cognition[20]. There has been one early phase study using lithium as a&#xD;
      neuroprotective agent presented in abstract form at the 2007 American Society for Therapeutic&#xD;
      Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO)[21] and updated at the 2008 annual meeting of the Society of&#xD;
      NeuroOncology (SNO)[22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term lithium treatment has also shown promise in amnestic mild cognitive impairment in a&#xD;
      study that randomized 45 participants to receive lithium (0.25-0.5 mmol/l) (n = 24) or&#xD;
      placebo (n = 21) in a 12 month, doubleblind trial[23]. Lithium treatment was associated with&#xD;
      a significant decrease in CSF concentrations of Ptau(P =0.03) and better performance on the&#xD;
      cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale and in attention tasks. The&#xD;
      data support the notion that lithium has disease modifying properties with potential clinical&#xD;
      implications in the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.[23]&#xD;
