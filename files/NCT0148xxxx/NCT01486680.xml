  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity are becoming increasingly common in New Zealand (NZ) and&#xD;
      worldwide. Both are associated with a risk of early mortality (death). Whilst weight loss&#xD;
      surgery is known to be effective for weight loss, current research suggests that it may also&#xD;
      be effective in resolving T2DM in around 60-80% of patients, with some no longer requiring&#xD;
      their medication. The mechanism for this remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main types of weight loss surgery are performed in NZ public hospitals, which include&#xD;
      gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. The gastric bypass is a more complex procedure&#xD;
      compared to the sleeve gastrectomy. Whilst both appear to be effective for weight loss (with&#xD;
      most patients losing more than 60% of their excess weight), it is still not known which one&#xD;
      is better for treating T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will therefore compare which of these two surgical procedures is most effective at&#xD;
      treating T2DM in obese patients, as well as comparing whether there are any differences in&#xD;
      the amount of weight lost, side effects and quality of life.&#xD;

      EFFECTS OF DIABETES AND OBESITY The World Health Organization indicates that 346 million&#xD;
      people worldwide have diabetes. This is expected to double between 2005 and 2030. Type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 90% of people with diabetes and is known to result from&#xD;
      a combination of physical inactivity and excess weight. In New Zealand (NZ) more than 200,000&#xD;
      people have diabetes, with an incidence amongst the Maori and Pacific population three times&#xD;
      greater than other NZ ethnic groups. Obesity is also more prevalent amongst this population,&#xD;
      with each 5 kg/m2 higher BMI resulting in a 30% higher overall mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 10 years bariatric surgery has been recognised as an effective strategy to&#xD;
      treat both morbid obesity and T2DM. Indeed in a systematic review in 2004, by Buchwald et al,&#xD;
      an overall T2DM remission rate of 76% was seen following bariatric surgery. In March 2011 the&#xD;
      International Diabetic Federation released a position statement recognising bariatric surgery&#xD;
      as an appropriate treatment option in those patients with T2DM and a body mass index (BMI)&gt;&#xD;
      OR = 35kg/m2 or BMI 30-35kg/m2 where medical treatment has failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL PROCEDURES Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB): Currently the most&#xD;
      commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. It combines a restrictive and malabsorptive&#xD;
      (duodenal bypass) component, with a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 61.6% and T2DM remission&#xD;
      rate of 83.8% reported. Analysis of our own series identified a T2DM remission rate at 1 year&#xD;
      of 88%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG): A predominantly restrictive procedure (no bypass&#xD;
      component), which was initially used as a staged approach to biliopancreatic diversion and&#xD;
      duodenal switch (BPD-DS), has gained increasing popularity due its relatively lower technical&#xD;
      complexity. In a recent systematic review a mean EWL of &gt;45% (range 6.3 - 74.6%) was reported&#xD;
      with an overall T2DM remission rate of 66%, which reduced to 59% where only those studies&#xD;
      reporting 1 year outcomes were analysed. There is however a lack of medium and long term data&#xD;
      and meta-analysis is currently not feasible in view of the high heterogeneity of studies and&#xD;
      the lack of randomised controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MECHANISM OF ACTION The mechanism of T2DM remission following these procedures remains&#xD;
      unclear and may relate to the effects of reduced caloric intake or gut hormone effects in the&#xD;
      proximal and distal intestine. Following LRYGB, the improvement in glycaemic control appears&#xD;
      to occur before weight loss and may be explained by exclusion of the duodenum / proximal&#xD;
      jejunum reducing insulin resistance or an enhanced hormonal response resulting from nutrients&#xD;
      in the distal small bowel. Following LSG both hormonal changes and a hindgut theory have been&#xD;
      proposed. In addition there is increasing evidence that changes in bone mineral density and&#xD;
      body composition, with a reduction in body fat and lean tissue mass, and an increase in&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure, may also occur following gastric bypass and other restrictive&#xD;
      surgical procedures. It is unclear whether such changes correlate with the degree of&#xD;
      comorbidity resolution after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION At the current time much of the data relating to LSG is based on non-randomised&#xD;
      observational studies and it remains unclear whether the promising T2DM remission rates and&#xD;
      excess weight loss reported will be sustainable in the long term. In the only published&#xD;
      randomised trial, by Lee et al. from Taiwan, to compare T2DM remission rates at 1 year&#xD;
      between LSG and gastric bypass in BMI &lt; 35, a much higher remission rate of 93% was seen&#xD;
      following gastric bypass compared with 47% following LSG. Given the potential technical&#xD;
      benefits of LSG, there is an urgent need to compare the efficacy of this procedure with the&#xD;
      more commonly performed LRYGB procedure, at a time when clinical equipoise remains, in order&#xD;
      to determine the optimum approach to T2DM in the future.&#xD;
