    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of gabapentin alone, and gabapentin + donepezil given&#xD;
      together in two types of experimental electrical pain tests in up to 48 healthy male subjects&#xD;
      (after 24 recruited in the first cohort an interim analysis will be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 3 was cross-over design study&#xD;
      with incomplete block design and 4 treatment options. Placebo, gabapentin alone (lower dose&#xD;
      and higher dose) or gabapentin (lower dose) with donepezil.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of gabapentin alone, and gabapentin + donepezil given&#xD;
      together in two types of experimental electrical pain tests which will be conducted on the&#xD;
      forearm and the lower leg, in 24 healthy male subjects initially. Gabapentin (a drug for&#xD;
      treatment of seizure disorders) is one of the drugs being used for the treatment of pain&#xD;
      caused by the damage to the nerves. Donepezil is a treatment to improve memory in patients&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease. 24 more subjects may be recruited following a formal analysis&#xD;
      during the trial (called interim analysis), if required for optimal scientific value. The&#xD;
      study consists of 1 screening visit,1 visit to establish the baseline pain recordings before&#xD;
      any treatment is given, then 3 treatment sessions, followed by a followup visit. Each&#xD;
      treatment session consists of 12 days of dosing at home and 2 inpatient days for dosing and&#xD;
      pain tests. Each volunteer takes part in 3 treatment sessions. In total, the study will last&#xD;
      15 weeks for each volunteer. There will be 4 treatment options: placebo, higher dose of&#xD;
      gabapentin, low dose of gabapentin, low dose of gabapentin + donepezil. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive the last two options and one out of the first two options, in a random order selected&#xD;
      by a computer before the study starts; neither the volunteers nor the persons conducting the&#xD;
      pain assessments nor the study team will know which treatment the volunteers receive during&#xD;
      the visits (known as a randomised, double-blind study). The study will be conducted in a&#xD;
      specialist clinical research unit with adequate facilities with regard to safety and&#xD;
      compliance. The results of the tests in the study will help to understand the effects of&#xD;
      gabapentin and donepezil together to design future clinical trials.&#xD;

         17. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products&#xD;
