  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain occurs frequently and is one of the most costly health problems affecting&#xD;
      industry and society. Prevention of low back pain is important both for the individual&#xD;
      patient and from an economic perspective. Therefore, there are many measures available that&#xD;
      claim to reduce low back pain and its recurrence. The most commonly used preventive&#xD;
      strategies are fitness exercises, lumbar supports, education on back mechanics and lifting&#xD;
      techniques, and ergonomic adjustments. However, their efficacy is still uncertain. The main&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of two different design&#xD;
      characteristics of lumbar support for low back pain prevention in hospital nurses.&#xD;
      Investigators hope that those two types of lumbar support will reduce the incidence of low&#xD;
      back pain and sick leave days. In addition, Investigators hypothesize that there are some&#xD;
      differences on outcome measures between those two types of lumbar support. Enrolled subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the following three groups. The first group will wear an&#xD;
      inelastic lumbar support for 6 months. The second group will wear an elastic lumbar support&#xD;
      for 6 months. The third group will receive no intervention. After the completion of 6-month&#xD;
      intervention, a further 6 months fellow-up will be added.&#xD;
