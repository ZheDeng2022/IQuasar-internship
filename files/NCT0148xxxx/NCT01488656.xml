  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if a comprehensive antioxidant/anti-inflammatory dietary supplement&#xD;
      pack can offer protection against a decline in lung function and increase in inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress following acute exposure to particulate matter air pollution with a diameter&#xD;
      &lt;2.5 µm (PM2.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is a follows: Compared to an appropriate control,&#xD;
      supplementation with a comprehensive antioxidant/anti-inflammatory dietary supplement pack&#xD;
      for 18 weeks will: 1) reduce the decline in lung function following acute exposure to&#xD;
      naturally occurring elevations in PM2.5 levels as measured by exhaled nitric oxide levels and&#xD;
      forced vital lung capacity; and 2) reduce changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines following&#xD;
      acute exposure to naturally occurring elevations in PM2.5 levels as measured by plasma levels&#xD;
      of C-reactive protein.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in Cache County, UT. Surrounded by tall mountains (2513-3042 m),&#xD;
      and subject to frequent winter atmospheric inversions characterized by stagnant air that&#xD;
      traps and concentrates pollutants, Cache Valley, home to 120,000 inhabitants, is particularly&#xD;
      susceptible to high particulate air pollution during the winter months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 70 individuals (with the goal of completing 60) between the ages of 45-80 will be&#xD;
      recruited from Cache County, UT. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two treatment arms (Placebo Dietary Supplements, Active Dietary Supplements) in a manner to&#xD;
      provide balanced assignment between the two arms with respect to age, sex and baseline&#xD;
      exhaled nitric oxide levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the Placebo or Active arms will be provided with sealed envelopes or&#xD;
      bottles containing dietary supplements (or matched placebos) along with instructions as to&#xD;
      when to consume the supplements. Participants will be instructed to consume their supplements&#xD;
      twice a day with meals containing a small amount of fat (at least 3 grams) in order to&#xD;
      optimize the absorption of fat soluble nutrients. They will also be instructed to consume the&#xD;
      supplements with liquids in order to enhance absorption and to minimize GI upset and choking&#xD;
      potential. Participants will be asked to maintain their typical diet for the 18 weeks of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine Clinic Visits are scheduled at two week intervals for the length of the study (with&#xD;
      accommodations made for Holiday schedules). During these visits, participants will: 1)&#xD;
      receive a sufficient supply of supplements to last until the next routine clinic visit; 2)&#xD;
      return any unused supplements; 3) be provided an opportunity to describe any adverse&#xD;
      events/reactions to the supplements; 4) describe any health issues experienced since the&#xD;
      previous exam; and 5) have their weight and blood pressure assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint Clinic Visits are scheduled to coincide with low and high PM2.5 exposure. Starting&#xD;
      on Jan 2, participants will be notified of a potential endpoint assessment day when the PM2.5&#xD;
      levels are predicted by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Air&#xD;
      Quality, to rise above 30 µg/m3 (peak event) or fall below 8 µg/m3 (baseline event). Endpoint&#xD;
      visits will take place 24 hrs following these peak and baseline events. Based on historical&#xD;
      patterns, we anticipate at least three peak events, with corresponding baseline assessments,&#xD;
      during the intervention time period. For purposes of analysis, each peak event will be paired&#xD;
      with the nearest baseline event so that both events are captured at a similar time after&#xD;
      initiation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each endpoint clinic visit, participants will undergo assessments of lung function and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. Blood samples will be obtained for potential future analysis of&#xD;
      additional markers of systemic inflammation and plasma antioxidant capacity.&#xD;
