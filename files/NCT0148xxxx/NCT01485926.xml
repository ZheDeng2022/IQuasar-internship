      The primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To assess the efficacy of TCH and TCHL in neo-adjuvant treatment of HER-2 positive breast&#xD;
      cancer, using pathological complete response (pCR) as the primary endpoint (Phase II).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical response rate and overall response rate for docetaxel and&#xD;
           carboplatin with trastuzumab alone or trastuzumab combined with lapatinib in HER-2&#xD;
           positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between drug exposure and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine potential molecular and pharmacological markers of response to trastuzumab&#xD;
           and lapatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess Disease-free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if prophylactic Loperamide significantly reduces the number of diarrhoea&#xD;
           -related adverse events.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. The presence of any other medical or psychiatric disorder that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating physician, would contraindicate the use of the drugs in this protocol or&#xD;
             place the patient at undue risk for treatment complications&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Male patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary products or other&#xD;

             study drugs or their ingredients (eg, polysorbate 80 in docetaxel)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because lapatinib is member of the&#xD;
             4-anilinoquinazoline class of kinase inhibitors with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lapatinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lapatinib&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with lapatinib. Appropriate&#xD;
             studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy&#xD;
             when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patients with GI tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication,&#xD;
             malabsorption syndrome, a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures&#xD;

             colitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Concomitant requirement for medication classified as CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors as&#xD;
             defined in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Have current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with&#xD;
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver&#xD;
             disease per investigator assessment)&#xD;
