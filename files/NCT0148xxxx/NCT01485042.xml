      3 STUDY RATIONALE Based upon the above rationale, the investigators propose a phase I study&#xD;
      combining Pazopanib with TH-302 in advanced solid tumors. Pazopanib is FDA approved at a dose&#xD;
      of 800mg per day. Using this dose ensures consistency with standard clinical use. It also&#xD;
      ensures using the dose most likely to induce maximal hypoxia, which in turn will help ensure&#xD;
      maximal local activation of TH-302 (a hypoxia activated prodrug). TH-302 can be given as&#xD;
      monotherapy at a weekly dose of 575 mg/m2. When TH-302 is combined with full doses of various&#xD;
      chemotherapeutics, the recommended dose of TH-302 has ranged from 240 to 480 mg/m2. Little&#xD;
      overlapping toxicity between TH-302 and pazopanib is expected. However to ensure patient&#xD;
      safety, the starting dose for the combination will be conservative and use the TH-302 dose&#xD;
      found safe with the majority of cytotoxic agents, 340 mg/m2 given days 1,8, 15 on an every 28&#xD;
      day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a standard 3+3 design, the investigators will add increasing doses of TH-302 (340&#xD;
      mg/m2, 480 mg/m2, 575 mg/m2 given weekly, 3 weeks on/1 week off (the standard TH-302 dosing&#xD;
      schedule) to the full monotherapy dose of pazopanib (800 mg p.o daily) with expected accrual&#xD;
      ranging from 12-18 subjects. Once the recommended phase II dose is identified, the&#xD;
      investigators will then enroll an expanded cohort of approximately 12-18 (i.e. total of 30&#xD;
      subjects overall) patients to better define the tolerability of this study drug combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 STUDY OBJECTIVES 4.1 Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the maximal tolerated dose (if any) and the recommended phase II doses for the&#xD;
           combination of pazopanib plus TH-302 in patients with advanced solid tumors 4.2&#xD;
           Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe any dose limiting and non dose-limiting toxicities of this drug combination&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN 5.1 Study Description This open-label, non-randomized phase I trial is designed&#xD;
      to assess the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose&#xD;
      (RPTD) of TH-302 plus pazopanib in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be accrued (enrolled) at Duke University Medical Center. Accrued (enrolled)&#xD;
      subjects are defined as subjects who give informed consent. Approximately 50 subjects may be&#xD;
      enrolled to ensure the trial obtains approximately 30 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluable subjects are defined as those subjects who give informed consent, meet&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion screening criteria, received study drug treatment and completed the first&#xD;
      cycle of safety assessments or have dose limiting toxicity that precludes completing the full&#xD;
      cycle of assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that the number of accrued subjects exceeds the number of evaluable subjects for&#xD;
      the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screen failures: Subjects with informed consent that do not meet inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           screening criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treated patients: Subjects with informed consent that meet the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria and received study drug treatment but did not complete the first cycle of&#xD;
           safety assessments for primary study end points (e.g. those subjects who have disease&#xD;
           progression or inter-current illness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two stages to this Phase I study. Stage 1 will be the dose escalation component&#xD;
      to determine safety and the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) for TH-302 plus pazopanib&#xD;
      combination. Dose escalation will begin with cohort 1 and continue as described in Table 5.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will be an expanded cohort which will better describe the tolerability and toxicity&#xD;
      profile and (2) to further assess biomarkers related to mechanisms of the study agents. The&#xD;
      treatment schedule will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 5.1 Cohort Doses Cohort # subjects Threshold 302 mg/m2, intravenously Days 1, 8, 15&#xD;
      Pazopanib mg, orally daily&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 3-6 240 800 Starting Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 3-6 340 800&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 3-6 480 800&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 3-6 575 800 Expanded Cohort 12-18 RPTD 800&#xD;
&#xD;
                Subjects will be treated on 28 day cycles after satisfying eligibility and&#xD;
                screening criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Intermediate dosing levels may be explored. Toxicity will be assessed every visit&#xD;
                and as clinically indicated. Efficacy will be assessed every 2 cycles and as&#xD;
                clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Dose Escalation and Treatment Schema&#xD;
&#xD;
                The NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0 will be used to grade adverse events.&#xD;
                The following adverse events will be considered dose limiting toxicity (DLT) if&#xD;
                occurring during the first cycle of treatment and deemed to be related to study&#xD;
                treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematologic toxicity: Any grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or anemia or grade ≥ 3&#xD;
           neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting over 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neutropenic fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea,Vomiting or Diarrhea grade 3 and lasting 4 days despite adequate supportive&#xD;
           measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade ≥ 3 ALT or AST elevation &gt; 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other non-hematologic toxicity grade 3 excluding alopecia, anorexia, fatigue,&#xD;
           hypertension, isolated lab abnormalities (not clinically significant) and/ rare,&#xD;
           idiosyncratic reactions to any of the study drugs. Anorexia, fatigue and hypertension&#xD;
           will be considered as DLT only if they reach grade 4 or are considered unmanageable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment delay of ≥ 14 days for cycle 2 due to unresolved toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any treatment-related death or treatment-related hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management and dose modifications associated with adverse events are outlined in Sections 9&#xD;
      and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will proceed in Stage 1 within each cohort according to the following scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients with DLT at a Given Dose Level Escalation Decision Rule 0 out of 3 Enter 3&#xD;
      subjects at the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 out of 3 Enter 3 more subjects at this dose level. &lt; 1 out of 6 (a) Proceed to the next&#xD;
      dose level OR (b) This will be the recommended MTD/RPTD if at highest dose level. &gt; 2 out of&#xD;
      3-6 Dose escalation will be stopped. Three (3) additional subjects will be entered at the&#xD;
      next lowest dose level (if only 3 subjects were treated at this level).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 subjects with advanced solid tumors will be accrued at the starting dose level. If no&#xD;
           DLTs are seen, 3 subjects will be enrolled in the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be monitored for at least one full cycle before advancement to the next&#xD;
           dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If one of three subjects has DLT at a given dose level, then an additional three&#xD;
           subjects will be enrolled at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1/6 subjects experiences DLT at a given dose level, then escalation will continue to&#xD;
           the next dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≥ 2 out of 3-6 subjects have DLT at any dose level, then that dose level will be&#xD;
           considered to have unacceptable toxicity, and the next lower dose level will be expanded&#xD;
           to 6 patients. In this case, the next lower dose level will be declared as the MTD&#xD;
           provided ≤ 1/6 subjects have DLT (otherwise, dose will be further de-escalated). In&#xD;
           cases where the only toxicity seen at this lower dose level is Grade ≤ 2, re-escalation&#xD;
           for intermediate dosing will be considered. If there is uncertainty about study drug&#xD;
           attribution to DLT then re-escalation to full doses is also permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If &gt; 33% of subjects has DLT at any dose level, then that dose level will be considered&#xD;
           to have unacceptable toxicity. The dose level immediately below the one with&#xD;
           unacceptable toxicity will be the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no unacceptable toxicity is seen at the highest dose level, then the highest dosing&#xD;
           regimen will be considered the MTD or the phase II RPTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at MTD to better define tolerability and safety before&#xD;
           proceeding to the expanded cohort.&#xD;
