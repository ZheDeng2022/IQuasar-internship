      RATIONALE: Mibefradil dihydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the best dose of mibefradil dihydrochloride when&#xD;
      given together with temozolomide in treating patients with glioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of mibefradil dihydrochloride administered&#xD;
           prior to five days of temozolomide (TMZ) at 150-200 mg/m² in subjects with progressive&#xD;
           or recurrent high-grade glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the safety of mibefradil dihydrochloride administered prior to five days of TMZ&#xD;
           at 150-200 mg/m² when the mibefradil dihydrochloride dose is escalated from a starting&#xD;
           dose of 100 mg/day, given four times a day for seven consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of mibefradil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the steady state levels of mibefradil dihydrochloride on the last day of&#xD;
           dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the severity and frequency of adverse events for tested mibefradil&#xD;
           dihydrochloride dose levels including cumulative toxicity and/or tolerance to adverse&#xD;
           effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the number and type of radiographic responses to treatment with mibefradil&#xD;
           dihydrochloride and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the potential effect of mibefradil dihydrochloride on tumor metabolism as&#xD;
           determined by Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography (FLT PET) scans with the&#xD;
           radiotracer [18F]-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine (dose-expansion cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of mibefradil dihydrochloride followed by a&#xD;
      dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive mibefradil dihydrochloride orally (PO) 4 times a day on days 1-7 (days 1-8&#xD;
      on first course) and temozolomide PO on days 8-12 (days 9-13 on first course). Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected during the first course for pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the dose-expansion cohort undergo [18F]-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-L-thymidine&#xD;
      (FLT)-positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and on day 7 of the first course of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
