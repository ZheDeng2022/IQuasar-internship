      Introduction Prostate biopsy is a procedure in which small samples are removed from a man's&#xD;
      prostate gland to be later tested for the presence of cancer. It is typically performed when&#xD;
      the scores from a PSA blood test rise to a level that is associated with the possible&#xD;
      presence of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common method for performing a prostate biopsy procedure is the ultrasound guided&#xD;
      transrectal procedure. The information obtained from the standard prostate biopsy is&#xD;
      deficient and even misleading. Cancers can be missed on initial and even in repeated biopsy.&#xD;
      Moreover, the detection of a tumor cannot predict accurately the tumor size and location1. It&#xD;
      was proven that the exact location of the obtained cores, even in an initial biopsy, can&#xD;
      influence the cancer detection rate2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An imaging tool that will enable a three-dimensional navigation in the prostate volume and&#xD;
      selecting biopsy locations in view of previous core taken will allow building a &quot;tumor map&quot;&#xD;
      '(i.e. detecting tumor size and location). By mapping the prostate cancer an adequate&#xD;
      treatment can be chosen while avoiding over or insufficient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to be able to produce an accurate mapping of the malignant tissue, a complementary&#xD;
      optimized pathology method should be also implement in addition to the navigation system, it&#xD;
      has been shown that a pre-embedding procedure that keeps the specimen orientation, unfolding,&#xD;
      unity, and location along the needle notch improves the histological yield and hence the&#xD;
      cancer detection rate3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NaviGo™ Workstation (hereafter the NaviGo™ Workstation or the NaviGo™ System) allows&#xD;
      physicians to see the prostate gland together with the biopsy sites in a three dimensional&#xD;

&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE Study objective Evaluate the contribution of the Navigo™ system, an&#xD;
      aiding navigation tool for TRUS prostate biopsy, to increase the prostate cancer detection&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is a noninvasive navigation tool that produces on line 3D model of the&#xD;
      prostate that assist the physician to navigate in the prostate volume during the biopsy&#xD;
      procedure without changing the imaging system or the biopsy routine whatsoever. The ability&#xD;
      to create a 3D model of the prostate and accurately and evenly position the biopsy needle&#xD;
      will enable a more accurate biopsy and better analysis of the procedure and the pathological&#xD;
      results, hence it might improve the clinical outcomes and may lead to new&#xD;
      treatments/diagnostic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NaviGo workstation is used as an adjunct to the ultrasound imaging and biopsy procedures&#xD;
      of the prostate gland. When operated in conjunction with the standard equipment in a TRUS&#xD;
      guided prostate biopsy procedure, the NaviGo™ software may be used for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assist the physician by transfer and display of ultrasound images on the workstation&#xD;
           screen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Build display and manipulate a 3D model of the prostate on screen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Archiving the ultrasound images and the 3D model;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing data management solutions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tracking, displaying and recording of the biopsy needle trajectory location in real&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NaviGo™ Workstation is designed to work with standard transrectal ultrasound system&#xD;
      without changing or interfering with the physician's flow of work. The ultrasound images are&#xD;
      displayed on the ultrasound system, and the information provided by the NaviGo provides&#xD;
      supplementary information to the physician during the procedure. The NaviGo™ Workstation&#xD;
      connects to the video output of the ultrasound system and tracks the ultrasound probe's&#xD;
      position using an off-the-shelf electromagnetic tracking system consisting of two sensors,&#xD;
      one on the ultrasound probe (at the base/ non invasive part of the probe) and the other on&#xD;
      the patient's back, a transmitter placed beneath the patient mattress, a processing unit, a&#xD;
      laptop computer and the workstation screen. Figure 1 below presents a general view of the&#xD;
      NaviGo™ Workstation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NaviGo™ system is an aiding tool in the management of prostate biopsy procedure. The&#xD;
      NaviGo™ system allows prostate biopsy tracking, recording, and management solution. The&#xD;
      NaviGo™ system is designed to assist the physician in performing prostate biopsy procedures&#xD;
      by displaying a 3D model with real-time tracking and recording of the biopsy needle location.&#xD;
      The device includes means to compensate for patient body and prostate motion at any time&#xD;
      during the procedure. The 3D model can be rotated, manipulated and displayed in the&#xD;
      physician's preferable choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is intended to record and display in 3D the biopsy procedure of any&#xD;
      patient undergoing a prostate trans-rectal biopsy. The Navigo™ system is intended to record&#xD;
      all the data from the initial scan, the volume measurements, and the biopsy needle insertion.&#xD;
      All the images are saved and can be reviewed in post analysis, the needle location can be&#xD;
      updated according to the physician's marking on the recorded ultrasound image and the&#xD;
      pathology results will be displayed in color on the 3D model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post procedure, the physician defines the boundaries of the prostate on selected&#xD;
      ultrasound images and a 3D model of the prostate is displayed with all recorded biopsy&#xD;
      specimens' locations displayed in the prostatic volume. The physician will be able to examine&#xD;
      in post analysis the scattering quality of the biopsy specimens in the prostatic volume and&#xD;
      update the pathology results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of features/capabilities incorporated in the NaviGo™ Workstation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient data management (recording, retrieval, off-line analyses and addition of biopsy&#xD;
           results).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Contour-based 3D model of the prostate (surface rendering).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Real-time tracking of the needle trajectory - the trajectory is displayed on the 3D&#xD;
           model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Recording of biopsy locations - using operator supplied information regarding where&#xD;
           biopsies were obtained, a 20mm long mark is provided on the bottom part of the 3D model&#xD;
           (where the trajectory crossed the 3D model), with each mark numbered and linked to the&#xD;
           relevant saved US image.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prostate volume calculation and measurement - a 3D model is displayed with volume&#xD;
           calculation, and 2D measurement capabilities (point to point inside the model) are&#xD;
           available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Off line procedure planning - on the previous acquired 3D model with the updated&#xD;
           pathology results the physician can schematically place future biopsy locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pathology results management and display - update of the pathology results to the 3D&#xD;
           model and a color display according to the severity of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Procedure report - automatically generated by the end of each procedure in an HTML&#xD;
           format. The report can also be saved to an external memory device or viewed at a later&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND PROCEDURES Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study is an open prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The trans-rectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy procedure will be conducted according&#xD;
           to the standard 12 biopsy scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition to normal procedure set up, there will be Electromagnetic flat transmitter&#xD;
           under the patient's mattress, 2 externally attached sensors and the Navigo™ system stand&#xD;
           including a laptop computer and the workstation screen (detailed in appendix A - User's&#xD;
           Manual).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Following the initial prostate scanning and the standard volume measurements done by the&#xD;
           physician, a 3D on-line model will be produced as supplementary information to the&#xD;
           B-mode standard image. The physician will navigate and determine the biopsy position&#xD;
           using the standard B-mode ultrasound image and the 3D prostate on- line model, both&#xD;
           shown on the working station screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The biopsy samples obtained will be placed straightened in a designated pathology&#xD;
           cassette or a kit for the orienting of biopsies, constituted from nitrate cellulose&#xD;
           filtering membranes. (See appendix B, C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient details, core locations in the prostate volume are saved for future analysis and&#xD;
           planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The data obtained in these experiments will be compared to a retrospective data from a&#xD;
           comparable cohort of patients who went through standard procedures with the same biopsy&#xD;
           scheme. (The control cohort will be chosen to have similar patient's characteristics-&#xD;
           age, PSA level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer detection rate (via pathology) compared with a control group- standard 12 biopsy&#xD;
           from retrospective data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis of positive cores distribution in the prostate volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection rate vs. PSA level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population will be recruited from the pool of patients who are scheduled for standard&#xD;
      trans-rectal biopsy procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is a navigation aiding tool which assists the physician to navigate in the&#xD;
      prostate volume. The physician can locate the biopsy core according to the desired biopsy&#xD;
      scheme. The physician can see on-line the location of the previous cores obtained, and thus&#xD;
      gaining the advisable dispersing of the cores and avoiding an overlap between adjacent cores.&#xD;
      Core positions are saved for post procedure analysis and future planning. Therefore the&#xD;
      patient can gain from an accurate positioning of the biopsy cores, which may increase the&#xD;
      cancer detection rate in the current biopsy and produce baseline information for future&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POTENTIAL RISKS TO THE PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Navigo™ system is an aiding tool that does not require any change in the procedure&#xD;
      performed today and doesn't come instead of the B-mode ultrasound, but works in parallel to&#xD;
      it, to add 3D information. The various components do not come in direct contact with the&#xD;
      patient or the physician and the computer and 3D tracking system are well within the required&#xD;
      safety protocols. Hence, there is no risk to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3D tracking system is approved by the FDA for medical use and is classified as Type CF&#xD;
      which is the most stringent classification, being required for those applications where the&#xD;
      applied part is in direct conductive contact with the heart or other applications as&#xD;
      considered necessary. The 3D tracking system is also part of an approved Helsinki trial in&#xD;
      Bnei-Zion hospital (monitoring of the birth progress, trial initiated by Dr. Yoav Paltieli)&#xD;
      Adverse effects, any pain or discomfort to the patients are not expected according to the&#xD;
      accumulated experience gained in a series of preliminary experiments preformed on 30 patients&#xD;
      with the Navigo™ system in Bnei-Zion as part of a Helsinki trail (0101-10-BNZ). The system is&#xD;
      also approved to be used in Haemek medical center (Helsinki number, 0018-11) and Meir medical&#xD;
      center (?). Therefore, in view of the above mentioned information there is no risk to the&#xD;
      patients and to the users.&#xD;
