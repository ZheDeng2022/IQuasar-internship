      Aims: We plan to investigate how common uterine malformations are in high-risk women (with&#xD;
      history of miscarriage or preterm delivery), by analysing different characteristics in these&#xD;
      groups. This study will also investigate other ultrasound characteristics detected on these&#xD;
      women. This study will point towards the possible mechanism of how uterine malformations may&#xD;
      affect pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;

      Background: Congenital abnormally shaped wombs (uterine malformations) have long been thought&#xD;
      to be more common in women with poor pregnancy outcomes, e.g. miscarriage (Rackow and Arici&#xD;
      2007) and preterm delivery (Tomazevic, Ban-Frangez et al. 2007). However, the true prevalence&#xD;
      is difficult to assess as there are no universally agreed classification systems and some of&#xD;
      the best investigations are invasive. In addition, previous prevalence studies have not&#xD;
      examined the details of subfertility or pregnancy loss, such as duration of subfertility, the&#xD;
      gestation of pregnancy loss, or miscarriage pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: We plan to investigate how common uterine malformations are in high-risk women (with&#xD;
      history of miscarriage or preterm delivery), by analysing different characteristics in these&#xD;
      groups. This study will also investigate other ultrasound characteristics detected on these&#xD;
      women. This study will point towards the possible mechanism of how uterine malformations may&#xD;
      affect pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We plan to recruit women who have had miscarriage or preterm delivery into our&#xD;
      study. A sample of women who had normal term deliveries will be recruited as comparison. All&#xD;
      women will undergo one 3-dimensional ultrasound scan each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The proportions of women with congenital uterine malformations will be determined.&#xD;
      Any ultrasound-detected markers found especially in women with poor pregnancy outcomes may&#xD;
      point towards how uterine malformations affect pregnancies.&#xD;
