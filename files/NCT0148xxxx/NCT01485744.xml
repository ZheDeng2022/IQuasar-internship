  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LDE225 is a new medicine that blocks the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. The Hh pathway is a cascade&#xD;
      of molecular events that control cell growth and have been linked with the development of&#xD;
      many human cancers, including pancreatic cancer. Information from research studies suggests&#xD;
      that LDE225 in combination with FOLFIRINOX may help to stop the growth of cancer cells. In&#xD;
      this research study, the investigators are looking to determine the maximum dose of LDE225 in&#xD;
      combination that can be given safely to patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      Study medication will be given in cycles of 14 days. Subjects will keep a study drug diary&#xD;
      for each treatment cycle. LDE225 capsules will be taken by mouth in the morning every day of&#xD;
      each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On days 1-2 of each cycle, subjects will take LDE225 at the clinic followed by FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      intravenous infusion (through a vein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will come to the clinic weekly for the first 5 weeks, then every other week (Week 7,&#xD;
      9, 11, etc.) and receive the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of current medications and any side effects Physical exam Performance Status Blood&#xD;
      tests (2 teaspoons of blood) Assessment of tumor (repeated every 8 weeks) ECG at week 3 and 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also have pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples taken. PK samples are used to find&#xD;
      out the amount of study medication in the blood. Each PK sample is about 1/2 teaspoon of&#xD;
      blood. Subjects will have PK samples taken on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 before the dose of LDE225 Day 1 of Cycle 5 - drawn&#xD;
      before the first dose of LDE225 and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 hours Day 2 of Cycle 5: One PK&#xD;
      blood sample&#xD;
