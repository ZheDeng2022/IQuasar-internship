  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the effect of incorporating acupuncture into the&#xD;
      management of migraines. The primary aim is to determine in a randomized, controlled study&#xD;
      whether individuals experiencing migraines have fewer occurrences and less intense migraines&#xD;
      when acupuncture is integrated with nonprescription pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
      Nonprescription pharmacological treatment in this study refers to the use of the following&#xD;
      over the counter medications: Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Acetaminophen (with or without&#xD;
      caffeine). Aspirin, Ibuprofen, and Naproxen are members of a class of drugs known as&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      70 men and women between the ages of 18-65 diagnosed with migraines by a medical doctor.&#xD;
      Participants must be using only nonprescription medication to treat their head pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once initial eligibility has been determined and informed consent obtained, a Traditional&#xD;
      Chinese Medicine (TCM) differential diagnosis will be carried out to determine the underlying&#xD;
      cause of the migraines experienced by the participant. If the migraines are due to Liver Qi&#xD;
      stagnation with Liver Yang rising they will be eligible for participation in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1 will continue&#xD;
      taking their current nonprescription migraine medication as needed and will receive&#xD;
      acupuncture once a week for 8 weeks. Group 2 will continue with their current nonprescription&#xD;
      migraine medication as needed but will not receive acupuncture. The same set of predetermined&#xD;
      acupuncture points will be used at each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a daily headache and medication use diary for four weeks on&#xD;
      two separate occasions. In addition all participants will complete the Headache Impact Test&#xD;
      (HIT-6) survey on three separate occasions.&#xD;
