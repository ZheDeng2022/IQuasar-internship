  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between lipid-induced inflammation&#xD;
      and ovarian androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); and to examine&#xD;
      the effect of salsalate and polygonum cuspidatum extract (PCE) containing resveratrol on&#xD;
      lipid-induced inflammation, ovarian androgen secretion, body composition and ovulation in a&#xD;
      subset of normal weight women with PCOS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesizes that in women with PCOS, HCG administration will stimulate an&#xD;
      exaggerated ovarian androgen response, dairy cream ingestion will stimulate white blood cells&#xD;
      to generate an inflammatory response, and that there is a relationship between HCG-stimulated&#xD;
      ovarian androgen secretion and the inflammatory response to dairy cream ingestion regardless&#xD;
      of body fat status. Thirty (30) women with PCOS (10 normal weight with normal abdominal&#xD;
      adiposity, 10 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) and 30 ovulatory&#xD;
      control women (10 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity, 10 normal weight with&#xD;
      increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) will participate over a 3-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator also hypothesizes that both salsalate and PCE administration for 12 weeks&#xD;
      will attenuate the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration and the inflammatory&#xD;
      response to dairy cream ingestion, reduce abdominal adiposity, increase insulin sensitivity&#xD;
      and induce ovulation in normal weight women with PCOS. A subset of 16 women with PCOS of&#xD;
      which 8 will receive salsalate (4 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal&#xD;
      weight with increased abdominal adiposity) and 8 will receive PCE (4 normal weight with&#xD;
      normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity) will&#xD;
      participate in this intervention over a 3-year period. This pilot project will help determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women with PCOS to&#xD;
      further test the latter hypothesis.&#xD;
