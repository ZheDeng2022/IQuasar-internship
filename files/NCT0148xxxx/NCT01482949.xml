      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical response to AGS-003 alone or in combination&#xD;
      with sunitinib therapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGS-003-005 is a rollover, open label, Phase II clinical study testing the biologic activity&#xD;
      and safety of AGS-003 in subjects who have experienced either partial responses or prolonged&#xD;
      stable disease and continue to benefit from ongoing treatment with AGS-003 in protocols&#xD;
      AGS-003-004 or AGS-003-006.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rollover subjects from AGS-003-004 will continue with AGS-003 monotherapy booster dosing&#xD;
      until disease progression or until a discontinuation criterion is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that progress on AGS-003 monotherapy (from the AGS-003-004 protocol) may start&#xD;
      sunitinib treatment and re-initiate AGS-003 therapy beginning with the induction phase dosing&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rollover subjects from AGS-003-006 will continue sunitinib dosing in combination with booster&#xD;
      dosing of AGS-003 until disease progression or until a discontinuation criterion is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject has disease progression due to a new tumor lesion, upon consultation between the&#xD;
      investigator, Argos representatives and the Argos medical monitor, the subject may be&#xD;
      considered for re-manufacture of study product (from the new metastatic lesion) and dosing&#xD;
      with this new product in combination with sunitinib beginning with the induction phase dosing&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those subjects initiating treatment with the induction phase as described above,&#xD;
      restaging imaging occurs at screening (baseline), prior to the fifth dose in the induction&#xD;
      phase (as applicable) and every 12 weeks during the booster phase (at the start of the&#xD;
      sunitinib holiday, 2 weeks prior to the next AGS-003 dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects on combination therapy, if dosing with sunitinib is stopped due to&#xD;
      sunitinib-related issues, treatment with AGS-003 may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Close-out visits will occur upon disease progression (other than circumstances discussed&#xD;
      above which are eligible for re-induction) or upon decision to terminate the study by the&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quarterly follow-up for survival for each subject will occur by telephone interview for 1&#xD;
      year following the last AGS-003 administration or study termination.&#xD;
