    <textblock>
      This investigator driven study will examine the safety, efficacy and biological effects of&#xD;
      combining pembrolizumab (MK-3475) an antibody targeted against anti-programmed cell death 1&#xD;
      (PD-1), with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for oligometastatic renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (RCC). The investigators hypothesise that the safety profile of this combination&#xD;
      will be clinically acceptable.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Participants must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic renal&#xD;
             cell carcinoma. Oligometastatic lesions do not need to be biopsied but they must be&#xD;
             clinically consistent to represent metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient can either be treatment naïve or have previously received up to 2 lines of&#xD;
             systemic treatment (eg. Pazopanib or Sunitinib). The total number of metastases&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Must have had surgical consideration for metastasectomy and thought appropriate for&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Male participants should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting&#xD;
             with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Based on clinician assessment of disease volume and rate of progression of patient's&#xD;
             tumor deposits, the patient requires immediate TKI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has had previous high dose radiotherapy (biological equivalent of 30Gy in 10#) to an&#xD;
             area to be treated which includes vertebral bodies (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Previous high dose radiotherapy is defined as a biological equivalent dose to&#xD;
             above that of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using an alpha/beta ratio [82] of 3. Where a&#xD;
             patient has received radiotherapy to an equivalent or lower dose than defined above,&#xD;
             stereotactic radiotherapy of the area may be considered. In doing so, assessment of&#xD;
             the volume and total dose received by any overlap region must be made, and documented&#xD;
             by generating a cumulative plan incorporating both the previous and current treatment&#xD;
             fields. It is the treating radiation oncologist's responsibility to review both the&#xD;
             current plan and the cumulative plan inclusive of previous radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has evidence of untreated or active intracranial metastases. Patients who have had&#xD;
             fully resected brain metastasis or those controlled by stereotactic radiotherapy are&#xD;
             eligible as long as they are not requiring corticosteroids for symptomatic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has evidence of Spinal Cord Compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has a Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score ≥ 7 unless lesion reviewed by a&#xD;
             neurosurgical service and considered stable (see Appendix 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Requires surgical fixation of bone lesion for stability. This must be performed before&#xD;
             enrollment into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks of registration&#xD;
             or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to&#xD;
             agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy&#xD;
             within 2 weeks of registration or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at&#xD;
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and&#xD;
             may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If participant received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from&#xD;
             the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Participants with previously treated brain metastases may participate&#xD;
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have&#xD;
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are&#xD;
             not using steroids within 7 days of registration. This exception does not include&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the participant's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the participant to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of registration&#xD;
