      The VQI TCAR Surveillance Project is designed to monitor the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      stents placed directly into the carotid artery while reversing blood flow within the carotid&#xD;
      artery to reduce stroke risk. It will compare this less-invasive surgical procedure with&#xD;
      standard carotid endarterectomy in centers that participate in the Society for Vascular&#xD;
      Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contemporary randomized trials of transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TF CAS) and carotid&#xD;
      endarterectomy (CEA) have shown comparable long-term ipsilateral stroke prevention (&gt;30 days)&#xD;
      but have consistently demonstrated higher periprocedural (&lt; 30 day) stroke rates, including&#xD;
      contralateral stroke, compared with CEA, with the highest risk centered around &quot;day zero&quot;.&#xD;
      Potential etiologies for this excess risk likely relate to embolization during unprotected&#xD;
      catheterization of the aortic arch and supraaortic vessels from a TF approach and/or&#xD;
      suboptimal distal embolic protection during CAS. TransCarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR)&#xD;
      combines the surgical principles of neuroprotection with minimally invasive endovascular&#xD;
      techniques to treat stenosis in the carotid artery. It involves surgical exposure and&#xD;
      clamping of the proximal common carotid artery with continuous carotid blood flow reversal&#xD;
      via an extracorporeal arteriovenous shunt from the target carotid artery to a femoral vein,&#xD;
      during which carotid bifurcation/internal carotid artery stenting is performed. Thus, TCAR&#xD;
      avoids catheter manipulation in the aortic arch and emulates the &quot;clamp and backbleed&quot; method&#xD;
      of neuroprotection during CEA, but differs from CEA in that the carotid artery is accessed&#xD;
      through a smaller, supra-clavicular incision below the main plexus of cranial nerves.&#xD;
      Further, the direct transcarotid approach allows the use of larger bore sheaths and tubing to&#xD;
      achieve higher reverse carotid artery flow rates than is possible with smaller transfemoral&#xD;
      catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published TCAR Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial study of TCAR in patients deemed to be at high risk for complications from CEA&#xD;
      have shown that TCAR appears to provide superior stroke and death outcomes when compared to&#xD;
      prior registry results from both CEA and TF CAS. Schermerhorn, et al reported outcomes from&#xD;
      the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) Vascular Registry in high surgical risk patients and&#xD;
      found that in this real world registry, the 30-day stroke and death rates in symptomatic&#xD;
      patients for CEA and TF CAS were 6.4% and 7.9% respectively. (Citation: Schermerhorn) In&#xD;
      asymptomatic, high risk patients, the 30-day stroke and death rates for CEA and TF CAS were&#xD;
      3.7% and 4.8% respectively. In contrast, a recent study of TCAR (ROADSTER pivotal trial) ,&#xD;
      the 30-day stroke and death rates for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were 2.8%&#xD;
      and 2.9%, respectively. (Citation: Kwolek) While these initial results of TCAR are&#xD;
      encouraging, they involved only 114 patients in the pivotal trial, such that further&#xD;
      evaluation is clearly important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the VQI TransCarotid Artery Revascularization Surveillance Project is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TCAR in real world practice, using a contemporaneous&#xD;
      comparison with CEA. Stroke and death outcomes data in TCAR and CEA patients deemed to be at&#xD;
      high risk for complications from CEA will be collected and analyzed using the SVS PSO CAS and&#xD;
      CEA Registries. High surgical risk is defined according to the CMS criteria published in the&#xD;
      National Coverage Determination for Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (20.7) and listed&#xD;
      in the inclusion criteria. The evaluation of these alternate strategies for surgical&#xD;
      treatment of carotid artery disease is central to the mission of the SVS PSO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All high surgical risk patients treated with TCAR and CEA in the SVS PSO CAS and CEA&#xD;
      Registries will be included and separately analyzed as symptomatic and asymptomatic, with&#xD;
      symptomatic defined as a history of ipsilateral stroke, TIA and/or amaurosis fugax within 180&#xD;
      days of the procedure. 30-day and one-year outcomes will be analyzed in propensity matched,&#xD;
      risk adjusted cohorts. Any FDA-cleared proximal embolic protection device and FDA-approved&#xD;
      carotid artery stent system indicated for the transcarotid approach will be included in the&#xD;
      registry. Sites participating in VQI are audited for consecutive case submission by&#xD;
      comparison with claims data. A Steering Committee within the SVS PSO will monitor the quality&#xD;
      and completeness of submitted data, and adjudicate any questionable outcomes by querying&#xD;
      sites for clarifying information. This committee will be responsible for scientific analysis&#xD;
      and periodic publication of the results.&#xD;
