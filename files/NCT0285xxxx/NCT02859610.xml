  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has already been shown that increased certain markers of stress, such as prolonged&#xD;
      elevation of CRP in the absence of bacterial infection, increased free cortisol and serum&#xD;
      copeptin, are associated with an excess of mortality in cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MPs are membrane vesicles of variable size between 0.1 and 1 .mu.m, released into the&#xD;
      extracellular space following activation or cellular apoptosis. MPs are also found in the&#xD;
      circulating blood of healthy volunteers and their plasma levels rise in certain diseases to&#xD;
      increased thrombotic risk, such as in cancer. Their membrane is composed of antigens whose&#xD;
      organization is characteristic of the parent cell and negatively charged phospholipids,&#xD;
      phosphatidylserines, conferring pro-coagulant properties to these MPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, work on the MPs are increasing following the discovery of their involvement in&#xD;
      physiological processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell activation and immune&#xD;
      response but it is certainly their pro-thrombogenic power that was the most studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have also implicated MPs in the pathophysiology of chronic liver disease.&#xD;
      Cirrhotic patients have elevated concentrations of MPs from leukocytes, endothelial cells and&#xD;
      hepatocytes compared to control subjects, and concentrations of MPs increase with worsening&#xD;
      liver function. Increasing MPs during the cirrhosis may be related on the one hand with a&#xD;
      decreased clearance and secondly with an excess of proinflammatory cytokines by increasing&#xD;
      the phenomenon of intestinal bacterial translocation. The assumption of the role of systemic&#xD;
      inflammation in the training of MPs is reinforced by the existence of a significant&#xD;
      correlation between the original MPs hepatocyte or buffy endothelial and CRP Thus, the&#xD;
      increase in MPs observed with the increase of PH could increase the risk of thrombosis in&#xD;
      intestinal microcirculation leading to enterocytic suffering from ischemic, reflected by an&#xD;
      increase in serum concentrations of I-FABP ( intestinal fatty acid binding protein). This&#xD;
      suffering enterocytes leads to increased intestinal bacterial translocation and ultimately to&#xD;
      increased formation of MPs. These MPs could also worsen liver function by the same phenomenon&#xD;
      of thrombosis in the hepatic microcirculation.&#xD;
