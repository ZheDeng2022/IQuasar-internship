  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary research program is to develop and optimize&#xD;
      new cross-species translational assessments of reward and cognition that will not only be&#xD;
      assessed in parallel in humans and rats, but also produce neurophysiological and behavioral&#xD;
      metrics that can be objectively compared across species. The research will build on prior&#xD;
      studies by further developing and optimizing (in Phase 1), then validating via&#xD;
      pharmacological challenge (in Phase 2), the following assays in both humans and rats:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. advanced neurophysiological and computational modeling techniques to record and analyze&#xD;
           EEG activity within and across species; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. behavioral assessments of reward learning, cognitive control, and cognitive flexibility&#xD;
           will be analyzed within and across species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase of the study will test the translational validity of these assays, by&#xD;
      assessing the impact of a targeted drug on task performance and EEG activity in both species.&#xD;

      The overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary research program is to develop and optimize&#xD;
      new translational assessments of reward and cognition that will produce neurophysiological&#xD;
      and behavioral metrics that enable objective comparison of drug effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (2016-2018) will seek to develop and optimize computer-based tasks to measure of&#xD;
      reward learning and cognition, to be administered during an EEG examination. Each participant&#xD;
      will be asked to come for a single visit to complete a brief psychological assessment&#xD;
      (interview and surveys), then perform two of the computer-based tasks while EEG data are&#xD;
      collected. The three tasks are the Flanker Task, the Reversal Learning Task, and the&#xD;
      Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 2 (2018-2021), a new set of participants will be enrolled for four visits. At the&#xD;
      first visit they will have a brief psychological assessment (interview and surveys). They&#xD;
      will then be assigned to one of the tasks developed during Phase I, and they will also be&#xD;
      assigned to one of the study drugs: modafinil (a cognitive enhancer) or methylphenidate (a&#xD;
      dopamine enhancer). At the second, third, and fourth visit, the subject will be given their&#xD;
      drug in one of the three doses: a low dose, a higher dose, and a placebo. They will then&#xD;
      perform the assigned task during an EEG exam.&#xD;
