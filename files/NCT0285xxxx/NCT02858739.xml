      technology in all comers patients with an indication to percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINTS: the cumulative hierarchical incidence of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events (MACCE) defined as: cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and&#xD;
      ARC-defined stent thrombosis (18) at any time point and bleeding defined according to BARC&#xD;
      classification (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS: clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: multicenter (presumably 10 centers across the Italian territory), prospective&#xD;
      observational registry aiming to enroll a population of 1000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION: We project 12 months for recruitment, 5 year follow-up duration after last&#xD;
      patient in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP PLAN: 30 days, 3, 6, 9 months, 1 year, and then yearly up to 5 years after&#xD;
      the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS SELECTION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an &quot;all comers&quot; registry and patient who will be enrolled have to meet the sequent&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must be at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the Informed Consent&#xD;
           Form after Biofreedom placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All &quot;de novo&quot; lesion subsets are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must agree to undergo all required follow-up visits and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must have indication to percutaneous coronary intervention following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stable angina or evidence of myocardial ischemia with stress echocardiography/&#xD;
                myocardial SPECT/exercise test, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unstable angina / non ST-elevation myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ST-elevation myocardial infarction with de novo culprit lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria must follow the most recent IFU which may include but are not limited&#xD;
      to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known intolerance to any of the device components&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In-stent restenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Woman with childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &lt; 18y/o&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inability to provide written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY PARAMETERS: TLR and TVR up to 5-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY &quot;PATIENT ORIENTED&quot; PARAMETERS: all cause mortality, any myocardial infarction, Stent&#xD;
      thrombosis based on the ARC classification, up to 5-year follow-up and bleeding occurrence&#xD;
      according to BARC classification. Data on dual antiplatelet therapy use will also be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed according to duration and cessation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification: Being this an observational registry aiming at quantifying effect&#xD;
      estimates without direct comparisons to other devices for coronary angioplasty, we relied on&#xD;
      confidence interval profiling for sample size justification, without proceeding with formal&#xD;
      power analysis. The main analysis will be an overall and comprehensive analysis and it will&#xD;
      be planned the primary analytical approach of all-comers patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease and indication to PCI. Accordingly, we computed that a target sample of 1000 patients&#xD;
      will enable the computation of reasonably precise 95% confidence intervals. Specifically,&#xD;
      assuming a 8% MACE rate at 1 year (in keeping with RUDY study and LEADERS FREE trial design),&#xD;
      confidence intervals computed with the adjusted Wald method would be 7.1% to 9.6% for a&#xD;
      1000-patient sample (point estimate 80/1000 [8.0%]). Given that the registry aims to reflect&#xD;
      real-world patients and practice, no prevision to limit or restrict patient enrollment is&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical plan: Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the total number of&#xD;
      patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Tabulation of categorical&#xD;
      parameters will include counts and percentages. The outcomes will be summarized as both a&#xD;
      discrete and a continuous variable using the method described above. Survival analysis will&#xD;
      be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be based on the&#xD;
      computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method. Additional analyses&#xD;
      will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline, lesion, and procedural features,&#xD;
      with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level. Specifically, Student t, Fisher&#xD;
      exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such bivariate analyses, whereas multivariable&#xD;
      linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard analyses will be used to&#xD;
      adjust for confounders.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RUDI FREE REGISTRY on the polymer-free DES (BIOFREEDOM) for coronary artery disease&#xD;
           is a investigator-initiated, prospective, multicenter registry of all-comers patients&#xD;
           with an indication to percutaneous coronary intervention. This Registry will enroll 1000&#xD;
           patients in approximately 10 sites throughout the Italian territory where BIOFREEDOM has&#xD;
           regulatory approval and is commercially available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Coronary device evolution&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1977 Andreas Gr√ºntzig performed the first balloon coronary angioplasty, a revolutionary&#xD;
      treatment that lead to the birth of a new specialty, &quot;interventional cardiology&quot;. Since that&#xD;
      pioneering procedure, extensive developments and advances culminated in percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) being one of the most frequently performed invasive medical procedures in&#xD;
      clinical practice today. Coronary stenting became widely implemented after the publication of&#xD;
      the landmark BENESTENT trial and the STRESS both with evidence indicating that stenting is&#xD;
      safe in the absence of anticoagulation therapy with the use of dual antiplatelet therapy&#xD;
      (DAPT) and/or adequate stent deployment in order to avoid the stent thrombosis phenomenon. By&#xD;
      1999, coronary stenting was performed in 84.2% of PCI procedures ; however, despite their&#xD;
      obvious advantages, there were associated problems and concerns. Most notably and in addition&#xD;
      to the risk of thrombosis, an iatrogenic problem emerged in the form of in-stent neointimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia . The dramatic reduction in restenosis rates, seen with the use of these DES&#xD;
      compared with BMS , has been the major driving force behind the exponential growth of PCI as&#xD;
      a treatment for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Even drug-eluting permanent&#xD;
      metallic stents, however, have some short and long-term limitations: a still unclear duration&#xD;
      of dual antiplatelet therapy which is strongly linked to the risk of stent thrombosis that,&#xD;
      although infrequent, is a ominous event with poor prognosis. Durable polymers in&#xD;
      first-generation of DES, triggering hypersensitivity reactions and chronic inflammation in&#xD;
      the vessel layers, may indeed promote stent thrombosis. Therefore, in order to overcome these&#xD;
      late undesirable effects by reducing arterial wall toxicity, new DES platforms with more&#xD;
      biocompatible durable polymers, biodegradable polymers or polymer-free have been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 BIOFREEDOM technology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom is a drug-coated stent (DCS) that consists of a stainless&#xD;
      steel stent platform with a textured abluminal surface onto which BA9 in solvent is applied .&#xD;
      The drug-coated stent is crimped onto a delivery system which includes a high pressure,&#xD;
      semi-compliant balloon incorporated onto the distal tip of a rapid exchange delivery catheter&#xD;
      system. The delivery system has two radiopaque markers inside the balloon, which&#xD;
      fluoroscopically mark the ends of the stent to facilitate proper stent placement. For this&#xD;
      trial, the BioFreedom DCS will be available in 6 nominal stent diameters (2.25-4.0 mm), seven&#xD;
      lengths (8-28 mm), and a dose of Biolimus A9 of 15.6 Œºg/mm of stent length. After&#xD;
      implantation, the stent thus releases the anti-proliferative agent directly into the vessel&#xD;
      wall, without the use of any polymer in the coating, thereby eliminating polymer associated&#xD;
      tissue responses. BA9 is extremely lipophilic, and once it is taken up by the vessel wall, a&#xD;
      process that is 98% complete at 4 weeks in an animal model, the stent becomes a BMS. In a pig&#xD;
      model at 28 and 180 days, BioFreedom stents were associated with an inflammation score that&#xD;
      was significantly lower than Cypher sirolimus eluting polymer-coated stents, and similar to&#xD;
      that observed with BMS . It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that this DCS may have a&#xD;
      safety advantage, with a lesser dependence on prolonged DAPT than a polymer-associated DES.&#xD;
      The anti-proliferative efficacy of the device was assessed in the BioFreedom first-in-man&#xD;
      trial. Two different BA9 doses on the BioFreedom stent were compared to the Taxus Libert√©&#xD;
      stent in 182 low-risk patients, 92% of whom underwent control angiography at 4 or 12 months.&#xD;
      DAPT was recommended for at least 6 months for all patients. The primary endpoint was a&#xD;
      non-inferiority comparison between BioFreedom standard dose and Taxus of mean in-stent late&#xD;
      lumen loss at 12 months (P = .001). In addition, median in-stent late loss was compared among&#xD;
      the three groups in the study, resulting in values of 0.17 mm for the standard dose (15.6&#xD;
      Œºg/mm), 0.22 mm for the low dose (7.8 Œºg/mm), and 0.35 mm for the Taxus stent (standard dose&#xD;
      vs Taxus: superiority P = .11). At 2 years clinically-driven target lesion revascularization&#xD;
      (TLR) was 3.4% for the standard dose BioFreedom, 9.9% for the low dose and 5.0% for the Taxus&#xD;
      (ns). There was no ST in any patient up to 2 years. Based on these results, the standard dose&#xD;
      device was selected for further clinical evaluation. Recently has been published the&#xD;
      rationale and design of the LEADERS FREE trial : A randomized double-blind comparison of the&#xD;
      BioFreedom drug-coated stent vs the Gazelle bare metal stent in patients at high bleeding&#xD;
      risk using a short (1 month) course of dual antiplatelet therapy. A total of 2456 patients&#xD;
      considered at high risk of bleeding will be randomized in a double-blind fashion to the&#xD;
      BioFreedom drug-coated stent or to a control arm (Gazelle bare metal stent). Both groups will&#xD;
      be treated with DAPT during 1 month only, followed by long-term aspirin alone. At 1-year&#xD;
      follow-up, the primary safety endpoint (a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      and stent thrombosis) will be assessed by a non-inferiority analysis, and the primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint (clinically driven target lesion revascularization) by a superiority&#xD;
      analysis. This trial should help better characterize a neglected subset of PCI patients and&#xD;
      quantify both their thrombotic and bleeding risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 STUDY DEVICE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device to be used in this registry is the the Biolimus A9-coated BioFreedom stent (DCS)&#xD;
      System manufactured by Biosensors. The Biofreedom stent refers to a system that consists of&#xD;
      the drug-coated stent that is crimped onto a delivery system (see the IFU for details&#xD;
      concerning indications for use, contraindications, system preparation, precautions, and&#xD;
      warnings).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 REGISTRY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present registry is to investigate the procedural as well as the long-term&#xD;
      clinical results in terms of safety and efficacy of the polymer-free DES technology in all&#xD;
      comers patients with an indication to percutaneous coronary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 REGISTRY FLOW AND CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RUDI FREE REGISTRY is a prospective multi-center national registry evaluating the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy in terns of procedural and clinical outcomes of the BIOFREEDOM stent in daily&#xD;
      use in all comers patients with indication to PCI. All lesion subsets are included. DAPT&#xD;
      cessation will be left to operator's discretion according to the different clinical&#xD;
      characteristics of the patients (high bleeding risk, stable and ACS population).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Number of Patients to be Registered and Patient Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RUDI FREE REGISTRY will enroll approximately 1000 pts in about 10 sites throughout the&#xD;
      Italian territory where Biofreedom stent has regulatory approval and is commercially&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have clinical follow-up by telephone contact or office visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Measures Taken to Avoid and Minimize Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize bias in assessing MACCE outcomes, these events will be adjudicated by an&#xD;
      independent committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Clinical follow-up plan: 30 days, 3, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly up to 5 years&#xD;

&#xD;
      Outcomes are as specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 Primary safety endpoints: the cumulative hierarchical incidence of major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events (MACCE) defined as: cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and&#xD;
      ARC-defined stent thrombosis at any time point and bleeding defined according to BARC&#xD;

      collected and analyzed according with the difference in terms of duration (according with&#xD;
      operator's discretion) and cessation according with the new classification by PARIS study&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. PATIENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Patient Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled into this registry will be male and female patients derived from the&#xD;
      general interventional cardiology population who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. The RUDI FREE REGISTRY will enroll 1000 patients in approximately 10 sites&#xD;
      throughout the national territory (see section 4.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Patient Screening and Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.1 Patient Screening All patients admitted for PCI with Biofreedom stent should be&#xD;
      evaluated for participation in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2.2 Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator or designee, who has been trained on the protocol, will explain the nature&#xD;
      and scope of the registry and inform the patient of the potential risks and benefits of&#xD;
      participation, and document consent to treatment with an Biofreedom stent according to&#xD;
      standard hospital practice. For this registry the patient must consent to data collection and&#xD;
      follow-up visits. All patients (or legally authorized patients' representatives if&#xD;
      applicable) must sign, date and time Medical Ethics Committee (MEC) approved informed consent&#xD;
      prior to data collection for this registry. Obtaining the consent, provision of a copy to the&#xD;
      patient, along with the date and time must be documented in the patient's medical records.&#xD;
      The informed consent form must be signed by the investigator. In addition, the signed&#xD;
      informed consent must be kept in the patient's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3.1 General Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled into this registry will be male and female patients derived from the&#xD;
      general interventional cardiology population who are scheduled for PCI and BIOFREEDOM&#xD;
      implantation. All patients admitted for PCI should be evaluated for participation in the&#xD;
      registry. The choice of this stent will be left to the operators' discretion considering the&#xD;
      coronary anatomy, lesions characteristics, patients characteristics. Patients must meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria to be considered for the registry. If any of the exclusion criteria is&#xD;
      met, the patient will be excluded from the clinical evaluation and cannot be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of patients characteristics the DAPT recommendation will be left to operator's&#xD;
      discretion according with PCI guidelines and basal clinical patient's charachteristics in&#xD;
      terms of high bleeding risk feature, stable and ACS patients Data on dual antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy use will also be collected and analyzed with a particular focus on different DAPT&#xD;
      cessation (discontinuation, interruption and disruption) as defined in PARIS registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.4 Patient Discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once registered, each patient shall remain in the registry until completion of the required&#xD;
      follow-up period; however, a patient's participation is voluntary and the patient has the&#xD;
      right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. Conceivable reasons for&#xD;
      discontinuation may include but not be limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient voluntary withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrawal by physician as clinically-indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient lost-to-follow-up: If the patient misses two consecutive scheduled follow up&#xD;
           time points, and attempts at contacting the patient are unsuccessful, then the patient&#xD;
           is considered lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No additional data is needed and will be recorded from patients once withdrawn from the&#xD;
      registry. Patients will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.5 Registry Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      An eCRF registry completion form must be completed when:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patient is considered lost-to-follow-up per the above definition or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patient withdraws from the registry or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the investigator withdraws the patient from the registry or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patient's follow-up is terminated upon registry follow-up completed (see Section 4.3&#xD;
           for details)&#xD;
&#xD;
           7. TREATMENT AND SCHEDULE OF EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment strategy will be determined by the investigator. It is required that each&#xD;
      enrolling investigator review the most recent Biofreedom IFU and assess the&#xD;
      contraindications, warnings and precaution sections with respect to the risks and benefits&#xD;
      for treating potential patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preparation will be in accordance with standard hospital policy for the care of&#xD;
      interventional cardiology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data will be collected as per eCRF. The Syntax score will be calculated in all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, patients will receive appropriate anticoagulation and other therapies&#xD;
      according to standard hospital practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QCA analysis is recommended pre implantation of the BIOFREEDOM stent, for correct sizing.&#xD;
      IVUS, VH-IVUS and OCT techniques are encouraged. These imaging tools will be subject of&#xD;
      subgroup analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3 Post-procedure (In-hospital)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post procedure data will be collected as per eCRF&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.3.1 Follow-up Antiplatelet Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      As informed previously minimum of 6 months duration of DAPT is recommended with variations&#xD;
      left to operator's discretion according to the previous expressed clinica patient's&#xD;
      charactreistics.. Specific type of DAPT will be recorded as per eCRF considering the new&#xD;
      PARIS classification of DAPT cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4 Clinical Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      ‚Ä¢ Clinical follow-up will be performed at 30 days, 3, 6 months, 1 year and then yearly up to&#xD;
      5 years after the index procedure: office visit is encouraged after the index procedure by&#xD;
      telephone contact or office visits. Office visit will be encouraged. The angiographic follow&#xD;
      up will be clinically driven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.5 Angiographic follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The angiographic follow up will be clinically driven. However, patients undergoing angio&#xD;
      follow up and IVUS or OCT follow up will be included in subgroup analysis and judicated by&#xD;
      internal observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. ADJUDICATION OF EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to minimize bias in assessing MACCE outcomes, these events will be adjudicated by an&#xD;
      independent Clinical Event Committee. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board will also be&#xD;
      established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.1 Statistical Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be reviewed by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Safety and Monitoring Board will be also responsible for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determining whether information collected are sufficient to address the objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recommending modifications to the statistical analysis plan to address additional&#xD;
           research questions based on review of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.2 Analysis Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who are successfully registered will be included in the analysis. 9.3 Sample&#xD;
      Size Calculations and Assumptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being this an observational registry aiming at quantifying effect estimates without direct&#xD;
      comparisons to other devices for coronary angioplasty, we relied on confidence interval&#xD;
      profiling for sample size justification, without proceeding with formal power analysis. The&#xD;
      main analysis will be an overall and comprehensive analysis and it will be planned the&#xD;
      primary analytical approach of all-comers patients with coronary artery disease and&#xD;
      indication to PCI. Accordingly, we computed that a target sample of 1000 patients will enable&#xD;
      the computation of reasonably precise 95% confidence intervals. Specifically, assuming a 8.0%&#xD;
      MACE rate at 1 year (in keeping with RUDI 2 study and LEADERS FREE , confidence intervals&#xD;
      computed with the adjusted Wald method would be 7.1% to 9.6% for a 1000-patient sample (point&#xD;
      estimate 80/1000 [8.0%]). Given that the registry aims to reflect real-world patients and&#xD;
      practice, no prevision to limit or restrict patient enrollment is considered .&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.4 Statistical Analyses Continuous endpoints will be summarized by presenting the total&#xD;
      number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Tabulation of&#xD;
      categorical parameters will include counts and percentages. The outcomes will be summarized&#xD;
      as both a discrete and a continuous variable using the method described above. Survival&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical inference will be based&#xD;
      on the computation of 95% confidence intervals using the adjusted Wald method. Additional&#xD;
      analyses will involve key subgroups defined according to baseline, lesion, and procedural&#xD;
      features, with statistical significance set at the 5% 2-tailed level. Specifically, Student&#xD;
      t, Fisher exact, and log-rank tests will be used for such bivariate analyses, whereas&#xD;
      multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazard analyses&#xD;
      will be used to adjust for confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator/institution will permit direct access to source data/documents in order for&#xD;
      registry-related monitoring, audits, MEC review, and regulatory inspections to be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the informed consent, the investigator or designee will obtain permission for&#xD;
      registry monitors or regulatory authorities to review, in confidence, any records identifying&#xD;
      the patients in this registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.1 Protocol and Informed Consent Approval The Principal Investigator at each site must&#xD;
      confirm and agree with the content of the protocol prior to participation in this registry.&#xD;
      Also, the Principal Investigator will obtain written approval of the protocol, informed&#xD;
      consent form, and other registry related documents from the MEC. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigator will take actions necessary for ongoing registry approval at their site per&#xD;
      established procedures of the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will advise the MEC of the progress of this registry on a regular basis&#xD;
      until registry completion as required by the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will submit any amendments to the protocol as well as associated informed&#xD;
      consent form changes and obtain written MEC approval prior to implementation as required by&#xD;
      the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.2 Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monitoring plan will be established. Remote monitoring by the CRO and source documents&#xD;
      analysis for events throughout the study period by an independent Event Committee, will be&#xD;
      conducted to ensure compliance with the protocol and applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the registry duration, the investigator will maintain complete and accurate documentation&#xD;
      including but not limited to the following: medical records, registry progress records,&#xD;
      laboratory reports, electronic case report forms, signed informed consent forms, device&#xD;
      serial numbers for monitoring malfunctions, correspondence with the MEC and registry&#xD;
      monitor/Sponsor, SAE reports, and information regarding patient discontinuation or registry&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.1 Source Documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history/physical condition of the patient before involvement in the registry&#xD;
           sufficient to verify protocol entry criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dated and signed notes on the day of entry into the registry referencing the sponsor,&#xD;
           protocol number, patient ID number and a statement that informed consent was obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dated and signed notes from each patient visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events reported and their resolution including supporting documents such as&#xD;
           discharge summaries, catheterization laboratory reports, ECGs, and lab results including&#xD;
           documentation of site awareness of SAEs and of investigator device relationship&#xD;
           assessment of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Notes regarding Dual Anti Platelet Therapy medications taken during the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (including start and stop dates)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's condition upon completion of or withdrawal from the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other data required to substantiate data entered into the CRF&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.2 Electronic Case Report Form Completion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary data collection based on source-documented hospital and /or clinic chart reviews will&#xD;
      be performed clearly and accurately by site personnel trained on the protocol and eCRF&#xD;
      completion. eCRF data will be collected for all patients that are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13. ETHICAL CONSIDERATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.1 Medical Ethics Committee Review Medical Ethics Committee (MEC) approval for the protocol&#xD;
      and informed consent form /other written information provided to the patient will be obtained&#xD;
      by the Principal Investigator at each investigational site prior to participation in this&#xD;
      registry. No changes will be made to the protocol or informed consent form or other written&#xD;
      information provided to the patient without appropriate approvals by the MEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until the registry is completed, the Investigator will advise his/her MEC of the progress of&#xD;
      this registry, per MEC requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, any amendments to the protocol as well as associated informed consent form changes&#xD;
      will be submitted to the MEC and written approval obtained prior to implementation, according&#xD;
      to each institution's MEC requirements.&#xD;
