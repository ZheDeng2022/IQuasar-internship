      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and Dose-Limiting Toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) of Recombinant humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (JS001) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of JS-001, a humanized monoclonal IgG4&#xD;
      antibody targeting the Programmed Death -1 (PD-1). It is estimated that 12-24 subjects with&#xD;
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors or will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 3+3 design will be utilized for this Phase 1 study. Four dose levels are planned and&#xD;
      include: 0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg/dose. Each of the 4 dose levels will use 2 dose schedules:&#xD;
      single dose, repeated doses every 2 weeks. Subjects will be assigned to a dose schedule in&#xD;
      the order of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be the traditional 3 + 3 design with 3 or 6 subjects treated at this dose&#xD;
      level and at all subsequent dose levels depending upon the incidence of DLTs. If no DLTs&#xD;
      occur in a cohort of 3 subjects, a new cohort of 3 subjects will be treated at the next&#xD;
      higher dose level. If 1 of 3 subjects in a cohort experiences a DLT, that cohort will be&#xD;
      expanded to 6 subjects. If only 1 of the 6 subjects has a DLT, then the next cohort of 3&#xD;
      subjects will be treated at the next higher dose level. If 2 or more DLTs occur within a&#xD;
      cohort, then that dose level will be above the MTD (the highest dose where no more than 1 of&#xD;
      6 subjects has experienced a DLT), and the previous lower (tolerated) dose level will be&#xD;
      considered the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DLT is defined as a Grade 3 drug-related adverse event occurring within the first cycle (28&#xD;
      days) of dosing (excluding tumor flare defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized&#xD;
      at sites of known or suspected tumor or a transient Grade 3 infusion adverse event) using&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 4.0 in a single dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response will be evaluated using immune-related response criteria (irRC), WHO criteria&#xD;
      , Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), immune-related RECIST, and&#xD;
      International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (for&#xD;
      lymphomas only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of confirmed disease progression and intolerable toxicities, subjects in the&#xD;
      single dose cohorts and multiple dose cohorts will be allowed to continue JS-001&#xD;
      administration with the consent of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      JS-001 will be administered as a 60-minute i.v. infusion. Cohorts will include escalating&#xD;
      dose levels of 0.3, 1, 3, 10mg/kg/dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety will be determined by vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status evaluations, diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and the incidence and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will also include evaluations of immune safety and immunogenicity. Particular&#xD;
      attention will be given to adverse events that may follow enhanced T-cell activation such as&#xD;
      dermatitis and colitis, uveitis, or other immune-related adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An irAE is a clinically significant adverse event of any organ that is associated with drug&#xD;
      exposure, of unknown etiology, and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is the best response rate (RR). Duration of response,&#xD;
      progression-free survival, time to progression, and overall survival will also be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC EVALUATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC, Cmax, tmax, and t½, etc. STATISTICAL METHODS The&#xD;
      sample size for this study is not determined from power analysis. It is based on the 3+3&#xD;
      design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will include: mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and&#xD;
      maximum values for continuous variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. All safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
