  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mental-health conditions affect million people worldwide. The economic burden of mental&#xD;
      illness is enormous and the economic health of both developing and developed nations will&#xD;
      depend on controlling the staggering growth in costs from mental disorders.&#xD;
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a relatively common and frequent form of anxiety that&#xD;
      affects approximately 2-3% of the population. OCD is characterized by anxiety, obsessions&#xD;
      (persistent intrusive thoughts and images with highly distressing contents) and compulsions&#xD;
      (repetitive activity), and severely impairs the lives of those affected. Despite their&#xD;
      interest as effective and affordable care and rehabilitation, cognitive therapeutic profits&#xD;
      too little from the increasing accumulation of knowledge in neuroscience, and neuroscientists&#xD;
      pay too little attention to the challenges faced by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists.&#xD;
      To reduce this cultural gap, two teams specialized in the study and multimodal imaging of&#xD;
      healthy participants and clinical patients with mental health disorders, the UMR-S&#xD;
      INSERM-EPHE-UNICAEN U1077 unit led by Francis Eustache, and ISTS team (UMR-S 6301&#xD;
      CNRS-CEA-UCBN) led by Sonia Dollfus, will joint their efforts to develop an integrated&#xD;
      approach of the neural mechanisms at stake from basic neuroscience using state-of-art&#xD;
      neuroimaging techniques, to novel and ground breaking psychological intervention. Both teams&#xD;
      evolve at the brain imaging Cyceron center in Caen in connection with the Mental Health and&#xD;
      Addictology Center, offering unique opportunities for such translational research. This&#xD;
      project will capitalize on recent evidence showing that healthy participants can prevent&#xD;
      unwanted images from entering consciousness using inhibitory control and memory suppression&#xD;
      techniques, disrupting traces of the memories in sensory areas of the brain, and weakening&#xD;
      their vividness and later reentrance. OCD is characterized by aberrant and excessive visual&#xD;
      intrusions, usually extremely vivid, detailed, and unpleasant. These distressing images are&#xD;
      particularly uncontrollable and may frequently initiate compulsive rituals. In a first phase&#xD;
      of this proposal will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to develop a&#xD;
      neurobiological model of the cognitive computations achieved by inhibition network to&#xD;
      suppress memory. To achieve this goal we will develop an attentional model of healthy memory&#xD;
      inhibition functioning, simulating the deployment of attentional resources and the different&#xD;
      mental processes at stake during suppression. Using sophisticated analyzing tools of fMRI&#xD;
      data, we will use this model to decode and infer the representational content of the brain&#xD;
      inhibition network, and further refine the connectivity pathways which underlie such control.&#xD;
      The lack of a strong neurobiological model prevents the development of therapies which would&#xD;
      increase functionality of this network and optimize intervention aiming to disrupt mental&#xD;
      intrusions and obsessions. In a second phase, we will assess whether memory suppression may&#xD;
      be transferred and trained in OCD patients using images depicting their own obsessions, as a&#xD;
      promising avenue to reduce their symptoms on the long run. In addition, fMRI and other brain&#xD;
      structural acquisitions will be collected before and after cognitive training to memory&#xD;
      suppression, offering a unique opportunity to observe the online dysfunction of intrusion&#xD;
      control in OCD patients and to identify neurobiological markers predictive of training&#xD;
      outcome and network reconfiguration with training. A fundamental goal of motivated forgetting&#xD;
      involves not only to exclude unwelcome content from consciousness but also to reduce their&#xD;
      later emotional impact by doing so. In parallel of these two main phases, we will thus also&#xD;
      measure physiological markers of autonomic nervous system activity changes in response to&#xD;
      suppressed images to better identify the consequences of memory suppression on emotional&#xD;
      states, anxiety, and mental health in general.&#xD;
