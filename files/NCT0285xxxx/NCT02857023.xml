  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disease-related neurocognitive deficits are common in pediatric sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
      These deficits can significantly disrupt otherwise normal trajectories toward academic and&#xD;
      vocational achievement and negatively impact psychosocial outcomes. Despite widespread&#xD;
      recognition of neurocognitive deficits, there are no treatments shown to maintain or recover&#xD;
      functioning once a child with SCD endures neuronal damage. Cognitive training (CT) has been a&#xD;
      standard intervention used to stabilize and recover functioning in individuals with&#xD;
      accidental or disease-related brain injury. Recent advances in technology have led to the&#xD;
      development of computerized CT programs. This study seeks to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      efficacy of using computerized CT with pediatric patients with SCD. Children and adolescents&#xD;
      with SCD between the ages of 7 and 16 years old (n = 80) will be recruited to complete a&#xD;
      randomized (intervention or waitlist-control) home-based computerized CT program (Cogmed).&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by examining participation, retention, and program completion&#xD;
      rates, as well as feedback from a feasibility and acceptability questionnaire and a brief&#xD;
      qualitative interview. Participants will also complete assessments of attention, working&#xD;
      memory, and academic fluency at baseline and immediately following the intervention. A final&#xD;
      assessment will be conducted 6 months after the conclusion of the intervention to evaluate&#xD;
      the stability of treatment effects.&#xD;
