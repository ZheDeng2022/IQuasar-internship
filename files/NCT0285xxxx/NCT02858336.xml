      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (functional HA) is a condition where a woman s period&#xD;
      stops for a temporary time. This is due to improper function of the hypothalamus. This is the&#xD;
      part of the brain that directs the whole reproductive system. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about functional HA. They also want to learn how diet, exercise, and other factors may change&#xD;
      women s menstrual cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To better understand functional HA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women ages 18-28 years old who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have regular periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise no more than 4 hours a week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Had their first period at age 11-14&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be prescreened over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 9 or 10 visits over about 3 menstrual cycles. These include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat of screening tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting energy expenditure test: Participants fast overnight before the test. They lie&#xD;
           on their back under a&#xD;
&#xD;
      canopy for a half hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition test: This is done with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pelvic ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For two full-day visits, an IV is inserted into an arm vein. The IV takes a blood sample&#xD;
           every 10 minutes for 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will keep logs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Menstrual cycle log&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diet log for three 4-day cycles&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive test kits to complete at home:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily blood and urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ovulation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a daily iron supplement. They will wear a wristband that monitors&#xD;
      activity 24 hours a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stick to a special diet for two 5-day periods of time. They will complete&#xD;
      two 4-day exercise programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a reversible form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism&#xD;
      (HH) that can be triggered by stressors such as exercise, nutritional deficits, and&#xD;
      psychological stress. Dysfunction of the hypothalamic component of the reproductive axis&#xD;
      plays a key role in functional HA and is manifest by an altered pattern of luteinizing&#xD;
      hormone (LH) pulses detectable in peripheral blood. There is ample evidence supporting the&#xD;
      use of LH as a surrogate marker of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)&#xD;
      secretion from the hypothalamus. There is also significant evidence that women vary in their&#xD;
      susceptibility to such stress-induced amenorrhea, pointing to a role for both environmental&#xD;
      and genetic factors in the etiology of functional HA. However, the variation in changes in&#xD;
      GnRH pulse frequency in response to stressors in healthy women has not been defined. Data&#xD;
      from previous work in our lab has suggested that rare variants in genes associated with other&#xD;
      forms of HH may also contribute to the variability seen in susceptibility to functional HA.&#xD;
      The long-term goal of our research is to examine the interaction of environment and genes in&#xD;
      HA. In this pilot study we propose to examine the inter-individual variability in pulsatile&#xD;
      LH secretion in response to standardized neutral and deficient energy availability (NEA and&#xD;
      DEA, respectively) in normal women. We will then relate this primary end-point to proposed&#xD;
      predictive factors including past reproductive and family history and markers of current&#xD;
      metabolic status and their response to energy availability. Our initial analyses will help to&#xD;
      determine simplified biomarkers that can be translated to larger studies examining the&#xD;
      potential combined effect of energy availability and genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed pilot study is a single-site, 2-period study in healthy female volunteers. The&#xD;
      study will enroll approximately 150 participants over 2 years with a target for study&#xD;
      completion of 25 subjects. Eligible participants will be females greater than or equal to 18&#xD;
      years of age. Eligible participants will have had menarche at or before 14 years of age and&#xD;
      no earlier than age 11. Eligible participants will have a gynecological age (years after&#xD;
      menarche) of 14 years or less. The upper age limit will vary based on each subject s age of&#xD;
      menarche and fall between 25 and 28 among participants. Eligible participants will confirm at&#xD;
      the pre-screening call having normal menstrual cycles (self-reported) for at least the&#xD;
      previous 2 months and ovulation will be confirmed during the menstrual cycle before the start&#xD;
      of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be changes in daytime LH pulse frequency, when comparing NEA vs DEA.&#xD;
      Secondary measures will evaluate past reproductive history, family history, and current&#xD;
      metabolic status using medical history interviews, lifestyle questionnaires and maximum&#xD;
      oxygen uptake (as a measure of fitness). Resting energy expenditure, body composition as well&#xD;
      as metabolic and stress hormones will be measured at baseline and in association with the&#xD;
      interventions. Blood samples will be collected for eventual genotyping.&#xD;
