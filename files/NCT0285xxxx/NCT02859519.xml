  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of topical MOB015B in&#xD;
      patients with mild to moderate distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of topical MOB015B in patients with mild to&#xD;
      moderate DSO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male or female subjects aged between 12 and 75 years with confirmed DSO involving 20-60% of&#xD;
      at least one great toenail will be screened for randomization in this study. The diagnosis of&#xD;
      DSO will be confirmed prior to randomization through a positive culture of dermatophytes. In&#xD;
      addition, a central blinded assessment of the clinical disease involvement (i.e., affected&#xD;
      nail area) will be performed at Screening. Subjects have to meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      before being randomized in to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to the investigational medicinal products (MOB015B or&#xD;
      vehicle) in a ratio of 2:1. The investigational medicinal products (IMPs) will be applied to&#xD;
      all affected fingernails and/or toenails for 48 weeks once daily at bedtime. However,&#xD;
      fingernails will not be assessed for efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both the IMPs are indistinguishable in appearance and mode of administration, the study&#xD;
      will be performed as a double-blind study, i.e., both the investigator and the subject will&#xD;
      remain blinded throughout the entire study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 4-week follow-up period without IMP treatment the end of study (EoS) Visit will be&#xD;
      performed at Week 52 (Visit 7). The primary efficacy variable will be assessed at Week 52.&#xD;
      The end of the clinical study for each individual subject is defined as the EoS Visit at Week&#xD;
      52 (Visit 7). The end of the clinical study is defined as the last visit of the last subject&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
