  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a continuation of a research program (STU00017005: Interventions to&#xD;
      teach melanoma patients skin self-examination) designed to increase early detection of&#xD;
      melanomas before they metastasize. In 2015, approximately 73,870 individuals in the U.S. will&#xD;
      be diagnosed with invasive melanoma and about 9,940 will die from the disease. During&#xD;
      2002-2011, melanoma incidence increased at an average annual rate of 1.6% for men and 1.5%&#xD;
      for women. People with a history of melanoma have a 10 times greater risk of developing a&#xD;
      second primary melanoma relative to the general population. Early detection with surgical&#xD;
      excision at an earlier stage when treatment is usually more effective is the only proven&#xD;
      curative strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship factors to help sustain skin self-examination will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been amended to include an administrative supplement, which builds upon the&#xD;
      pilot research completed during the summer of 2017 that measured the efficacy of two wearable&#xD;
      UV sensors (Shade and Wearifi) and a survey assessing sun protection along with the quality&#xD;
      of life. See Detailed Description for a description of amendment addition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research was expanded to distance (remote) learning provided by mailing the same&#xD;
      workbook used in the in-office training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The completed R01 demonstrated preliminary evidence for a melanoma survivor and partner skin&#xD;
      self-examination (SSE) training program resulting in regular and accurate SSEs relative to&#xD;
      patients and partners receiving treatment as usual care. However, one caveat is that the&#xD;
      patients and partners in the well-controlled study are potentially being cued to conduct the&#xD;
      SSEs following training and reinforced for their actions. Whereas in &quot;real-world&quot; conditions&#xD;
      the participants would see their dermatologist less frequently with significantly less cueing&#xD;
      to conduct SSEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research addresses this limitation by examining the long-term influence of SSE training&#xD;
      on SSE knowledge, self-efficacy, performance, and accuracy under real-world conditions for&#xD;
      melanoma patients in the treatment group from the ongoing R01 study relative to controls (Aim&#xD;
      1). In addition, the continuation study will also examine for whom the intervention works&#xD;
      best under real-world conditions (Aim 2). Findings from clinical RCTs of behavioral&#xD;
      interventions involving patients are rarely if ever, examined to determine generalizability&#xD;
      to real-world settings. The current proposal will contribute critical information to the&#xD;
      scientific literature on the impact of early detection of melanomas using SSEs and will be&#xD;
      the first to test the sustainability and long-term impact of an efficacious SSE intervention&#xD;
      for early detection targeting melanoma survivors in real-world settings. Relationship factors&#xD;
      to help sustain skin self-examination will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amended part of the study is an administrative supplement, which builds upon the pilot&#xD;
      research completed during the summer of 2017 that measured the efficacy of two wearable UV&#xD;
      sensors (Shade and Wearifi) and a survey assessing sun protection along with the quality of&#xD;
      life. The Shade sensor provided a more reliable time-stamped assessment. With the use of the&#xD;
      Daily Minutes of Unprotected Sun Exposure Inventory (MUSE) and the Shade sensors, the&#xD;
      investigators assessed the sun protection behaviors of melanoma survivors and found that 13%&#xD;
      of the melanoma survivors were surprised by their amount of UV exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now wish to determine the feasibility of simultaneously obtaining wearable&#xD;
      sensor data for physical activity (ActiGraph) and the Shade sensor and completion of&#xD;
      self-reported surveys for the same time period. The feasibility and methodological&#xD;
      information derived from this project are highly relevant to capture and quantify UV exposure&#xD;
      among physically active individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 participants will be recruited for this phase (324 from initial study + 40 from&#xD;
      amended section = 364 anticipated total).Ten participants (5 melanoma survivors and 5 young&#xD;
      adult relatives), testing the feasibility of wearing two sensors and completing daily online&#xD;
      surveys. After feasibility testing, the study will enroll melanoma survivors, age 18-70&#xD;
      years, with Stages 0-1A (n=15) and their young adult relatives (n=15) who are 18-39 years&#xD;
      old. The sex of enrolled participants will be monitored to assure equivalent numbers of male&#xD;
      and female participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two arms were added: a) Feasibility of wearing 2 sensors, and b) Feasibility of completing&#xD;
      online daily survey. The research team will strive to integrate event level data in&#xD;
      real-time. At the conclusion of the study, participants receive a report of their UV exposure&#xD;
      and physical activity over the 7 days of the study. Eligibility Criteria has also been&#xD;
      updated for the amended portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distance (remote) learning will be compared with in-person learning with online surveys&#xD;
      assessing SSE knowledge, confidence, anxiety and performance. Electronic health record review&#xD;
      will identify biopsies of concerning moles and the number and stage of melanomas identified.&#xD;
