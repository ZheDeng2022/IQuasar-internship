    <textblock>
      Alpha-agonist in anesthesia display immunomodulatory effect in addition to antiadrenergic&#xD;
      control. This effect of the immune system can be a key to a better perioperative safety and&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association of dexmedetomidine at general anesthesia adds up organic protection and&#xD;
      inflammatory control to a surgery trauma owing to antinociception and immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim this study is evaluate if the association of dexmedetomidine at general anesthesia&#xD;
      standing effective immunomodulatory control to trauma and improve changes at outcomes in&#xD;
      patients undergoing to spinal fusion.&#xD;

      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interactions between the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic nervous system and&#xD;
      immunological system acts in the initiation and propagation to reactions of trauma distress.&#xD;
      A large number of factors affect the activation of immune response owing to surgical trauma&#xD;
      and anesthesia. Regarding the current field, surveys are need to evaluate the real clinical&#xD;
      significance of immune control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to blunt the surgical stress response, the control of inflammatory response is&#xD;
      considered by many authors the most important factor. Therefore, dexmedetomidine as an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory anesthesic agent plays a way to more effective control to the endocrine&#xD;
      metabolic response, predicate role to better outcomes in patients undergoing to major&#xD;
      surgical trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is designed as a double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled to evaluate the&#xD;
      utility of dexmedetomidine as immunomodulatory anesthetic agent in a major surgical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine provide more effective immune control at general anesthesia in patients&#xD;
      undergoing to spine fusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals standard to immune control, hemodynamic safety and recovery quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure of release pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin 1-beta (IL-1b), interleukin 6&#xD;
           (IL-6) and tumoral necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)] to evaluate the anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           activity in vivo of dexmedetomidine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Serum dosage of interferon-gamma and interleukin 4 (IL-4) to evaluate changes of&#xD;
           cellular and humoral T-helper cells activity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endocrine-metabolic changes will be evaluated with the dosage serum cortisol, insulin&#xD;
           and glucose;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hemodynamic safety will be performed with a vital signals and changes of ventricular&#xD;
           stress and myocardium ischemia markers [brain natriuretic pro-peptide (pro-BNP),&#xD;
           troponin I and creatine kinase (CK-MB)];&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Renal function will be evaluated with measure diuresis rate, fluid balance, serum levels&#xD;
           of Cystatin-C, electrolytes [sodium and potassium] and arterial blood gas;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Time to open eyes after turn off anesthesic gases to evaluate the wake-up time (time to&#xD;
           recovery of consciousness (ROC);&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2) and respiratory rate immediately after the end&#xD;
           of anesthesia to evaluate a respiratory changes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Ricker Sedation-Agitated Scale and Visual Analogic Pain Scale will be performed after 15&#xD;
           minutes on arrival of patients at the recovery room;&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The QoR-40 (quality of recovery - 40) questionnaire before the surgery and the first&#xD;
           postoperative day to a quality support;&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, bleeding, bradycardia and&#xD;
           tachycardia will be recorded during surgery and in a pos anesthetic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHOD&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized double-blind clinical trial was elaborated to compare two groups of patients,&#xD;
      active dexmedetomidine group (Dexmedetomidine group - SD) and placebo comparator (Placebo&#xD;
      group - SP). For our knowledge, our proposal study was approved by the Ethnic Committee of&#xD;
      the Sarah Network of Rehabilitation Hospitals since June of 2016 (Approval Number:&#xD;
      50057415.0.0000.0022). All patients who will be enrolled to our study must sign informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once schedule spinal fusion, patients both sex, 18 to 75 years old and physical state (ASA)&#xD;
      1-3 will be enrolled in this trial. All patients will be evaluated in the anesthesic&#xD;
      ambulatory. Then, the patients will be randomly divided blindly into Group SD or Group SP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pre-anesthesic room, patients will be monitored with electrocardiography, non invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse oximetry and entropy. After peripheral venous access obtained, the&#xD;
      first sample (Time 0: Before induction of anesthesia) can be taken and start dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      or placebo dripping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a clinic demand, anesthesia will be performed with propofol, rocuronium,&#xD;
      fentanyl, methadone and/or remifentanyl. After endotracheal access, the lungs will be&#xD;
      ventilated with oxygen in air (1:2), and the ventilation rate will be adjusted to maintain&#xD;
      the end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure between 35 and 45 mmHg. The concentrations of&#xD;
      sevoflurane will be adjusted for maintain hypnosis entropy score between 40 and 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive blood pressure through radial artery will be obtained. The samples of blood will be&#xD;
      retrieved from arterial line at three moments: Time 1: 8h after the end of surgery; Time 2:&#xD;
      7:00h AM, 24h after the first sample have been collected, and; Time 3: 7:00h AM, 48h after&#xD;
      the first sample have been collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the SD group, dripping of dexmedetomidine (0.2 - 1 ug/kg/hr) will be administered during&#xD;
      surgery. Already in the SP group, normal saline will be administered with same rate as a&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective site concentration of anesthesics drugs will be adjusted for maintain entropy&#xD;
      between 40 and 45 and changes of vital sign between 20% of baseline value. On line&#xD;
      sevoflurane concentrations using an infrared anesthetic gases analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of surgery, all anesthetics agents will be discontinued and the time to wake-up&#xD;
      will be recorded. Patients will be asked to open their eyes and the time of eyes open will be&#xD;
      recorded. After the eyes open, the patients will be transferred to recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After arrival on the recovery room, blood pressure, heart rate, Ricker Sedation-Agitated&#xD;
      Scale and Visual Analogic Pain Scale will be measure in the first 15 minutes and in the leave&#xD;
      of recovery room. The time of staying in postanesthetic care unit is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, bleeding, bradycardia and&#xD;
      tachycardia will be recorded during surgery and staying at postanesthetic care unit. All&#xD;
      participants will be followed for the duration of surgery and postanesthetic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation or absolute values. The Student's&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test to performed to demographic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Wilcoxon rank-sun test to compare cytokines concentrations and scores of quality between&#xD;
      groups at the time points. Friedman's test will be performed to compare cytokine or clinical&#xD;
      markers among each time points groups. Dunn's pos hoc test for statistic significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery and quality profiles [time to recovery of consciousness (ROC); Ricker&#xD;
      sedation-agitated scale at the postanesthetic care unit and; QoR-40] will be analyzed by&#xD;
      paired t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of nausea/vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, bleeding, bradycardia, and&#xD;
      tachycardia will be analyzed by Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be performed using SPSS version 15.0 software for Windows. A P-value &lt; 0.05&#xD;
      will be deemed to a statistical significance.&#xD;
