  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, 9.6% of men and 18% of women aged over 60 years suffer from osteoarthritis (OA),&#xD;
      most of which involve the knee. Within the OA patient population, 80% of the OA patients have&#xD;
      limitations of movement, and 25% cannot perform the majority of their daily activities (WHO).&#xD;
      Some of these symptoms contribute to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), a reflexive&#xD;
      decrease in motor output to the muscles surrounding the affected joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMI is characterized by abnormal afferent information transmitted to the central nervous&#xD;
      system, resulting in altered afferent feedback to the quadriceps motoneurons (MN) which in&#xD;
      turn results in reduced excitability of that particular pool. The altered afferent input is&#xD;
      suggested to stem from stimulation of mechanoreceptors, via joint effusion or excessive&#xD;
      movements, nociceptors as a response to pain, or loss of joint receptors (Palmieri-Smith et&#xD;
      al., 2009). Although the evidence concerning the role of the central nervous system is&#xD;
      scarce, pre- and postsynaptic spinal mechanisms directly affecting alpha-MNs seem affected.&#xD;
      Dysfunction of γ-loops also seems to be involved (Konishi et al., 2002). These mechanisms&#xD;
      together result in AMI that manifests through aberrations in voluntary quadriceps torque,&#xD;
      force control, and reflex excitability often measured by the H-reflex (Hopkins et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the evident role of motor efferents, sensory afferents also influence motor control&#xD;
      (Gentilucci et al., 1997) and poor proprioceptive function is predictive of poor chair-stand&#xD;
      performance (Sharma et al., 2003). Reduction of the sensory deficits could potentially&#xD;
      increase motor function in knee OA. The present study aims to evaluate whether low-intensity&#xD;
      peripheral electrical nerve stimulation, a form of increasing afferent input, could&#xD;
      potentially improve OA patients' motor function. The most limiting factor in OA patients,&#xD;
      however, is pain, experienced at rest and during movement. Although previous paradigms used&#xD;
      high-frequency stimulation and the lack of physiological explanations concerning pain&#xD;
      reductions after peripheral electrical nerve stimulation, it is possible that reductions in&#xD;
      experienced pain are mediated by reduced analgesia, i.e., decreased excitability of&#xD;
      nociceptive neurons.&#xD;

      Worldwide, 9.6% of men and 18% of women aged over 60 years suffer from osteoarthritis (OA),&#xD;
      most of which involve the knee. Within the OA patient population, 80% of the OA patients have&#xD;
      limitations of movement, and 25% cannot perform the majority of their daily activities (WHO).&#xD;
      OA is a progressive articular cartilage disorder involving motor and sensory dysfunctions,&#xD;
      including a decreased range of motion, muscle weakness, impaired proprioception, and pain.&#xD;
      Some of these symptoms contribute to arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI), a reflexive&#xD;
      decrease in motor output to the muscles surrounding the affected joint that is most likely&#xD;
      mediated by GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMI is characterized by abnormal afferent information transmitted to the central nervous&#xD;
      system, resulting in altered afferent feedback to the quadriceps motoneurons (MN) which in&#xD;
      turn results in reduced excitability of that particular pool. The altered afferent input is&#xD;
      suggested to stem from stimulation of mechanoreceptors, via joint effusion or excessive&#xD;
      movements, nociceptors as a response to pain, or loss of joint receptors. Although the&#xD;
      evidence concerning the role of the central nervous system is scarce, pre- and postsynaptic&#xD;
      spinal mechanisms directly affecting alpha-MNs seem affected. Dysfunction of γ-loops also&#xD;
      seems to be involved. These mechanisms together result in AMI that manifests through&#xD;
      aberrations in voluntary quadriceps torque, force control, and reflex excitability often&#xD;
      measured by the H-reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor dysfunction thus is an important limiting factor for OA patients and involves motor and&#xD;
      sensory factors. Besides the evident role of motor efferents, sensory afferents also&#xD;
      influence motor control and poor proprioceptive function is predictive of poor chair-stand&#xD;
      performance. Reduction of the sensory deficits could potentially increase motor function in&#xD;
      knee OA. The present study aims to evaluate whether low-intensity peripheral electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation, a form of increasing afferent input, could potentially improve OA patients'&#xD;
      motor function. The most limiting factor in OA patients, however, is pain, experienced at&#xD;
      rest and during movement. High-frequencies stimulation paradigms are normally used to reduce&#xD;
      pain, but 40-50 minutes of low-frequency electrical stimulation (4 Hz, &lt; MT intensity) can&#xD;
      also be effective in reducing pain at rest, pain during movement, and pain sensitivity,&#xD;
      although a recent systematic review questions consistency of these effects considering the&#xD;
      limited evidence. Although, to the best of our knowledge, there is no clear physiological&#xD;
      explanation concerning pain reductions after peripheral electrical nerve stimulation, it is&#xD;
      possible that reductions in experienced pain are mediated by reduced analgesia, i.e.,&#xD;
      decreased excitability of nociceptive neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves and muscles has been applied in various forms to&#xD;
      modulate muscle strength, motor skill, spinal- and cortical excitability. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (NMES) evoked forces can generate torques up to 112% of maximal&#xD;
      voluntary contraction force and increases with increasing stimulation frequency up to 70-80&#xD;
      Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas NMES is primarily focused on increasing muscle strength, low-intensity somatosensory&#xD;
      electrical stimulation (SES) has been used to increase motor skill acquisition in neurologic&#xD;
      patients and healthy participants. SES excites group Ia, Ib, and II afferents, as well as&#xD;
      secondary muscle afferent fibers. SES increases motor performance the most when applied to a&#xD;
      peripheral nerve at high sensory intensities (2-3 times perceptual threshold) at 10 Hz (SES&#xD;
      applied in 1 Hz trains consisting of 5 pulses at 10 Hz). High-frequency transcutaneous&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and sensorimotor training can both repositioning error&#xD;
      reflecting impaired knee proprioception in patients with knee OA. Both TENS and SES thus&#xD;
      excite afferent fibers involved in knee proprioception. Impaired knee proprioception has been&#xD;
      associated with impaired ability to accurately and steadily control force and impaired&#xD;
      eccentric strength. In contrast with NMES, in which induced increases in muscle force most&#xD;
      likely involve changes in metabolism, hypertrophy, and possibly spinal mechanisms, and TENS,&#xD;
      where large diameter primary afferents are pivotal in pain reductions, SES targets sensory&#xD;
      pathways, both cutaneous and proprioceptive, which seem an appropriate target to reduce&#xD;
      sensory deficits involved in OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SES can improve stroke patients' motor function but whether such improvements can occur in&#xD;
      patients with knee AO is unknown. Excitation of primary afferents by SES could serve as a&#xD;
      physiological basis for the hypothesis that SES positively influences the afferent input to&#xD;
      α-MN of the quadriceps muscles surrounding the dysfunctional joint and reduce pain. The&#xD;
      increased afferent input by SES, as shown previously in healthy participants and stroke&#xD;
      patients, is expected to increase motor control, measured by an increase in tracking&#xD;
      performance in the dysfunctional knee joint. As a task variant to visuomotor tracking, force&#xD;
      steadiness and accuracy are expected to increase after SES because these measures are&#xD;
      associated with proprioception, an outcome SES is known to improve through excitation of&#xD;
      muscle afferents. If this expectation is correct, SES could then be used in future studies&#xD;
      and rehabilitation protocols as a primer to potentiate the effects of NMES and other exercise&#xD;
      therapies designed to improve quadriceps strength and power. Second, if SES reduces pain and&#xD;
      increases motor control, SES can possibly postpone surgery and can serve as an adjuvant for&#xD;
      patients for patients who are unsuitable for or resist a total knee replacement to improve&#xD;
      activities of daily and therefore quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present study will examine the acute and delayed effects of 60 minutes of SES&#xD;
      (five pulses in 1 Hz trains at 10 Hz at motor threshold intensity) of the femoral nerve in&#xD;
      patients suffering from knee OA. Figure 1 depicts a schematic overview of the proposed study&#xD;
      design. As an initial step, a pilot experiment in 5-6 healthy individuals should reveal&#xD;
      whether there are some effects or trends observed after 30 minutes of SES, a duration&#xD;
      probably would be more optimal at 60 minutes considering the 120 minutes standard used for&#xD;
      improving neurological patients' hand function. The primary outcomes of the study is motor&#xD;
      coordination evaluated using target tracking based on knee position and not based on&#xD;
      quadriceps force, because position vs. force is less affected by the influences of pain and&#xD;
      therefore more suitable in the current context. Secondary outcomes are motor control and&#xD;
      proprioception reflected by increased force steadiness and accuracy, maximal voluntary&#xD;
      strength and daily physical function. The investigators hypothesize based on previous data&#xD;
      that afferent input induced by SES reduces abnormalities in sensory input as a result of OA,&#xD;
      and therefore increases motor control.&#xD;
