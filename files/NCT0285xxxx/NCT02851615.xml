    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SCThrive, a&#xD;
      an innovative, technology-enhanced, group self-management intervention that uses a mixed&#xD;
      in-person and online format and supported by a tailored mHealth tool, iManage. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the initial efficacy of SCThrive for increasing behavioral activation (BA) in&#xD;
      adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) ages 13 to 21. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      participants in the SCThrive group will show greater BA (primary outcome) at post-treatment&#xD;
      than the attention control group, and that participants in the SCThrive group will continue&#xD;
      to show significantly greater BA at the six week follow-up compared to the attention control&#xD;
      group. Investigators will also explore whether SCThrive is associated with greater&#xD;
      improvements in self-management behaviors and quality of life (secondary outcome) compared to&#xD;
      attention control at the six-week follow-up assessment.&#xD;

    <measure>Scores on Behavioral Activation Measure at Baseline and 6 Weeks (Post-treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), which is a 13 item measure on skills, knowledge, confidence and readiness for self-management developed by Hibbard et al., 2005. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale of 1 = &quot;Disagree Strongly&quot; to 3 = &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; Raw scores range from 13 to 52 and are converted to scores that range from 0 to 100. This score was then divided into four levels of activation, which reflect a developmental progression from being passive with regard to one's health to being proactive: Level 1 (score of 0.0 - 47.0), Level 2 (47.1 - 55.1), Level 3 (55.2 - 72.4), and Level 4 (72.5 - 100). Higher scores indicate more behavioral activation.</description>

    <measure>Scores on a Self-management Measure at Baseline and 6 Weeks (Post-treatment)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ-5), which is a well-validated 20-item questionnaire that measures the skills needed to manage a chronic condition independently. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale of 1 = &quot;No, I do not know how&quot; to 5 = &quot;Yes, I always do this when I need to&quot; and divided into 5 subscales: Managing Medication, Appointment Keeping, Tracking Health Issues, Talking with Providers, and Managing Daily Activities. Overall and subscale scores are calculated by averaging the scores of answered items. Mean scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating better self-management.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Scores on the UNC TRxANSITION Scale at Baseline and 6 Weeks Post-Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants complete the UNC TRxANSITION Scale, an interview administered by trained independent evaluators to measure the skills of youth with chronic conditions. For this study, we administered 6 of the 10 possible subscales: Type of Chronic Health Condition, Medications, Adherence, Nutrition, Self-Management Skills, and New Health Care Providers. Each item is scored individually as either 1 (adequate knowledge/skill mastery), 0.5 (some knowledge/skill attainment), or 0 (no knowledge/skill attainment). Higher scores indicate better self-management. Subscale scores are calculated by dividing the patient's score by the total possible subscale score. Subscale scores are then combined to create a total score, ranging from 0 to 10, but since we only used 6 scales, 0 to 6. Total and subscale proportion scores were used in analyses.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Caregiver (or AYA &gt; 18 years) consent that the participant will be the sole user of&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  another chronic disease (which would complicate measurement of behavioral activation)&#xD;

          -  Non-English-speaking (&lt;5% of the target population); or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  cognitive or psychiatric disorder that the physician or study therapists believe would&#xD;

             as this is the usual procedure.&#xD;

        <title>Scores on Behavioral Activation Measure at Baseline and 6 Weeks (Post-treatment)</title>
        <description>Participants complete the Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), which is a 13 item measure on skills, knowledge, confidence and readiness for self-management developed by Hibbard et al., 2005. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale of 1 = &quot;Disagree Strongly&quot; to 3 = &quot;Strongly Agree.&quot; Raw scores range from 13 to 52 and are converted to scores that range from 0 to 100. This score was then divided into four levels of activation, which reflect a developmental progression from being passive with regard to one's health to being proactive: Level 1 (score of 0.0 - 47.0), Level 2 (47.1 - 55.1), Level 3 (55.2 - 72.4), and Level 4 (72.5 - 100). Higher scores indicate more behavioral activation.</description>

Analyses were conducted using the internal Monte Carlo simulation capabilities of Mplus (Version 1.20). Based on the effect size obtained from published pilot data, we expected the change in baseline/posttreatment Behavioral Activation for the SCThrive intervention group to be n2 = .14 (large effect). Based on these assumptions, the desired sample size was 54 participants (N = 27 per group) to achieve power of .80.</non_inferiority_desc>

        <description>Participants complete the Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ-5), which is a well-validated 20-item questionnaire that measures the skills needed to manage a chronic condition independently. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale of 1 = &quot;No, I do not know how&quot; to 5 = &quot;Yes, I always do this when I need to&quot; and divided into 5 subscales: Managing Medication, Appointment Keeping, Tracking Health Issues, Talking with Providers, and Managing Daily Activities. Overall and subscale scores are calculated by averaging the scores of answered items. Mean scores range from 1 to 5 with higher scores indicating better self-management.</description>

        <title>Total Scores on the UNC TRxANSITION Scale at Baseline and 6 Weeks Post-Treatment</title>
        <description>Participants complete the UNC TRxANSITION Scale, an interview administered by trained independent evaluators to measure the skills of youth with chronic conditions. For this study, we administered 6 of the 10 possible subscales: Type of Chronic Health Condition, Medications, Adherence, Nutrition, Self-Management Skills, and New Health Care Providers. Each item is scored individually as either 1 (adequate knowledge/skill mastery), 0.5 (some knowledge/skill attainment), or 0 (no knowledge/skill attainment). Higher scores indicate better self-management. Subscale scores are calculated by dividing the patient's score by the total possible subscale score. Subscale scores are then combined to create a total score, ranging from 0 to 10, but since we only used 6 scales, 0 to 6. Total and subscale proportion scores were used in analyses.</description>
