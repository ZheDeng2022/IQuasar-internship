    <textblock>
      This study seeks to evaluate post-operative patient pain and quality of life, and&#xD;
      intra-operative hemodynamic status and changes in inflammatory markers, with use of a&#xD;
      pressure-barrier insufflator and conventional insufflator at high and low pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      pressure settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized-controlled double-blinded trial examining outcomes from total&#xD;
      laparoscopic hysterectomies performed under low and high pressure pneumoperitoneum with&#xD;
      either a novel pressure-barrier insufflator (AirSeal®) or conventional insufflator. All&#xD;
      patients scheduled for total laparoscopic hysterectomy (without robotic-assistance) will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility in the study. If eligible, a standard informed consent process will&#xD;
      ensue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research activities will commence on the day of surgery, in the pre-operative preparation&#xD;
      area. Enrolled subjects will undergo standard registration and pre-operative preparation by&#xD;
      the staff preoperative nurse, including placement of intravenous access line and&#xD;
      administration of standard pre-operative intravenous medications (typically ondansetron,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and ketorolac). While in the pre-operative area, and prior to any sedative&#xD;
      drug administration by anesthesia, the patient will complete an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NRS) for baseline pain, as well as a baseline 18-question quality of life survey with the&#xD;
      Abdominal Surgery Impact Scale (ASIS). Both study instruments will be self-administered by&#xD;
      the patients and collected by the research team. A baseline blood collection will be&#xD;
      performed in the pre-operative area by the research team assistant and sent for inflammatory&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be moved to the operating room and the anesthesia team will apply the pads&#xD;
      for use with the Cheetah Non-Invasive Cardiac Output Monitoring (NICOM) system, in addition&#xD;
      to other standard anesthesia monitoring equipment. The Cheetah NICOM will be activated for&#xD;
      baseline measurements prior to anesthesia induction. Induction, intubation, and anesthesia&#xD;
      administration will be performed according to standard practice by a dedicated group of&#xD;
      anesthesia providers. A second set of hemodynamic measurements from the Cheetah NICOM will be&#xD;
      measured after intubation, prior to pneumoperitoneum. A select group of anesthesia providers&#xD;
      familiar with the protocol will administer anesthesia using non-depolarizing muscle relaxants&#xD;
      continuously adjusted to be no less than one twitch during pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to any incision, preoperative prophylactic antibiotics and surgical sterile preparation&#xD;
      will be performed per usual technique. Bilateral upper extremities will be placed in a tucked&#xD;
      position, and no shoulder pads will be used in any case. An 18g peripheral IV (ideally&#xD;
      antecubital) will be placed to allow intra-operative blood draws. This may be placed before&#xD;
      or after anesthesia induction, but prior to arm tucking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will occur after the patient is anesthetized, but prior to surgical start time&#xD;
      to allow proper equipment to be opened on the surgical field without waste. Randomization&#xD;
      will be into one of four groups with equal allocation to each (1:1:1:1 ratio):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conventional insufflation at 15mmHg intra-abdominal pressure. (Group 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conventional insufflation at 9mmHg intra-abdominal pressure (Group 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. AirSeal® insufflation at 15mmHg intra-abdominal pressure (Group 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. AirSeal® insufflation at 9mmHg intra-abdominal pressure (Group 4) If randomized to an&#xD;
           AirSeal® group, the tri-lumen filtered tube set and dedicated access trocar will be&#xD;
           opened and placed on the surgical field. If randomized to the conventional insufflation&#xD;
           group, conventional insufflation tubing with an additional conventional trocar will be&#xD;
           opened and placed on the surgical field. The patient will remain blinded to&#xD;
           randomization throughout the study, as will the research team assistant responsible for&#xD;
           blood draws and administration of NRS and ASIS questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic entry will typically be obtained by optical trocar in the periumbilical region,&#xD;
      but placement may be modified at the surgeon's discretion. Initial pneumoperitoneum will be&#xD;
      established through this trocar to a pressure of 15mmHg for all groups. Pressure will remain&#xD;
      at this setting during Trendelenburg positioning and placement of other necessary&#xD;
      laparoscopic trocars. Data will be recorded for the third time from the Cheetah NICOM at this&#xD;
      point. Once all trocars are inserted, the AirSeal® system will be activated if necessary&#xD;
      based on group randomization, and pressure will be decreased to 9mmHg if indicated based on&#xD;
      randomization. Additional recordings of data from the Cheetah NICOM will occur 10 minutes and&#xD;
      30 minutes after pressure decrease, and the surgery will proceed according to the surgeon's&#xD;
      preferred technique. Any surgeon-directed modifications of intra-abdominal pressure at any&#xD;
      time for surgery completion and/or patient safety will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty minutes after pneumoperitoneum is established, the research team assistant will&#xD;
      perform the second blood draw for inflammatory markers. The surgery will be completed per&#xD;
      typical fashion, and total operative time and estimated blood loss will be recorded. A final&#xD;
      Cheetah NICOM recording will be made 5 minutes after deflation of pneumoperitoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will emerge from anesthesia under their usual monitoring and be transferred to&#xD;
      the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) when meeting appropriate routine criteria. A staff PACU&#xD;
      nurse will care for the subject in the PACU and administer pain medications as necessary&#xD;
      and/or per patient request. All pain medication administration in the hospital will be&#xD;
      recorded in the Epic electronic health record (EHR). The amount of each patient's narcotic&#xD;
      administration will be recorded from the EHR and documented in study files. The staff PACU&#xD;
      nurse will be blinded to subject group allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team assistant will administer a NRS pain survey to the patient two hours&#xD;
      post-operatively and inquire regarding presence of shoulder pain. The third blood draw will&#xD;
      also occur at this timepoint by the research team assistant. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      planned same-day discharge to home. If unable to be discharged, they will stay overnight in&#xD;
      the hospital with documented rationale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day after surgery, the subject will be contacted by the research team assistant who&#xD;
      will administer a NRS pain survey by telephone (or in person if still in hospital) and ask&#xD;
      patient to report number of narcotic pain pills used since discharge and dosage of each.&#xD;
      Presence of shoulder pain will again be asked. If patient is still in the hospital, narcotic&#xD;
      usage will be collected from the EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per standard routine, the patients will be asked to return to clinic two weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively for evaluation and examination. The 18-question ASIS will be administered at&#xD;
      this visit by the blinded research team assistant. If the patient cannot complete the&#xD;
      &quot;two-week visit&quot; within 1-3 weeks after surgery, the research team assistant will administer&#xD;
      the ASIS by telephone. The patient will exit the study after this visit. Blinding of the&#xD;
      patient will be broken after administration of the ASIS, as it is standard practice to&#xD;
      provide the patient with a copy of the operative report during this visit, which will&#xD;
      describe the pneumoperitoneum settings used during their case.&#xD;
