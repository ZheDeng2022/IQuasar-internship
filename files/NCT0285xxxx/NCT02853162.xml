      Phase II study (n=30) to evaluate the safety and feasibility of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy (SBRT) with fiducial markers in inoperable patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The standard treatment of RCC is (partial-) nephrectomy. Alternatives to this&#xD;
      treatment are less invasive techniques like radio frequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation&#xD;
      (CA). Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an alternative curative treatment&#xD;
      modality, which has shown promising results in several North-American phase I-II studies over&#xD;
      the last years. In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SBRT for&#xD;
      patients with inoperable RCC on a conventional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) linear&#xD;
      accelerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate safety and feasibility of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      with fiducial markers in inoperable patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single arm prospective study. Study population: Inoperable patients ≥ 18 years,&#xD;
      with a pathology proven RCC fulfilling the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Prior to treatment, patients will undergo fiducial marker placement (in&#xD;
      combination with a biopsy, if RCC has not been pathology proven), followed by a contrast&#xD;
      enhanced planning computed tomography (CT)-scan and a contrast enhanced MRI-scan. Fiducial&#xD;
      markers will be used as this increases visibility of the tumor and therefore the accuracy of&#xD;
      radiotherapy, particularly the irradiated healthy kidney tissue will be diminished by using&#xD;
      this approach. Baseline toxicity and quality of life will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT using a VMAT technique will be delivered in five fractions of 7 Gy every other day. The&#xD;
      target volume for treatment is defined on a 4D planningCT and MRI and the tumor is treated in&#xD;
      the midposition of the breathing cycle. After treatment, follow-up will be at 1, 3, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months at the Radiotherapy department, followed by standard follow-up by the urologist. An&#xD;
      additional contrast enhanced MRI scan will be performed after the 2nd treatment fraction, and&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 months to assess treatment response to prepare for future MR-guided (MR-linac)&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Toxicity and quality of life will be assessed during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Newly developed acute toxicity grade 3 or more according to&#xD;
      the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC-AE) version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment is considered successful if all 5 treatments are completed and if in total &lt;15%&#xD;
      of the patients (=5 patients) report a toxicity ≤ grade 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be treatment response, (late) toxicity assessment, local control&#xD;
      rate and quality of life assessment.&#xD;
