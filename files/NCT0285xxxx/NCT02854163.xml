    <textblock>
      The investigators propose an open label pragmatic clinical and laboratory study designed to&#xD;
      investigate, in detail, the clinical and molecular effects of Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and&#xD;
      inhibition of IL-17 with secukinumab, on neutrophil function in vitro and ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary, exploratory objectives, the investigators will utilise the fact that&#xD;
      secukinumab is to be administering to 20 patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and&#xD;
      investigate whether there is any relationship between vitamin D status and response to&#xD;
      secukinumab, with respect to efficacy and adverse events. The results of this secondary&#xD;
      exploratory analysis will inform the design of a larger, definitive study.&#xD;

      Phase: Phase 2 Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: 20 patients plus 10 healthy controls are to be enrolled in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient treatment group: 20 patients with active psoriatic arthritis (fulfilling&#xD;
      Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis [CASPAR] criteria) affecting ≥2 peripheral&#xD;
      joints (swollen and tender) that have not responded to at least one standard&#xD;
      Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy control group: 10 healthy control blood samples (matched for gender to the patients&#xD;
      and within 5 years of mean age within each gender subgroup).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: 1 - Rheumatology clinic at Aintree University Hospital, Liverpool&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 24 months in total with 12 months of therapy, and 12 months for staggered&#xD;
      enrolment and laboratory investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Agent/Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secukinumab 150mg/300mg subcutaneous injection once weekly for the first 4 weeks then 150mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous injection 4 weekly for up to 11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the molecular effects of IL-17 and inhibition of IL-17 with&#xD;
      secukinumab on neutrophil phenotype, lifespan, function and production of IL-17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if neutrophil life span and function is associated with vitamin D&#xD;
           concentration and VDR receptor expression in PsA patients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore whether vitamin D concentrations and VDR expression influence neutrophil&#xD;
           lifespan and function in PsA patients before and after treatment with secukinumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical response of patients with psoriatic arthritis, treated with&#xD;
           secukinumab using Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75) and American College of&#xD;
           Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify whether vitamin D status according to winter or summer seasons and levels of&#xD;
           VDR expression are associated with skin and joint responses or infection in patients&#xD;
           treated with secukinumab in PsA, assessed using PASI 75 and 90, ACR20 response and&#xD;
           reporting of infection adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of patients treated with secukinumab in terms of adverse events&#xD;
           (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), infections and serious infections, malignancies,&#xD;
           acute injection site reactions and potential immunogenicity over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient group: Patients attending routine rheumatology assessments will be screened for&#xD;
      suitability for the study. Eligible patients, based on diagnosis of PsA (meeting CASPAR&#xD;
      criteria and with peripheral joint involvement), will be approached to determine if they are&#xD;
      willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be registered into the study and will receive secukinumab treatment in&#xD;
      addition to their standard DMARD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy Control Group: Healthy controls matched by gender and within 5 years of mean patient&#xD;
      age (assessed in patient group) will be recruited from National health Service (NHS) and&#xD;
      university staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function ACR20, Body Surface Area (BSA),&#xD;
      PASI 75 and 90, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria&#xD;
      (PSARC), EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ5D) &amp; Health Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (HAQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secukinumab group&#xD;
&#xD;
           3 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90,&#xD;
           NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
           6 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90,&#xD;
           NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
           9 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR , ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90, NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D HAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
           12 months - assessment of Vitamin D, VDR, Neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 AND 90,&#xD;
           NAPSI, PSARC, EQ5D, HAQ&#xD;
&#xD;
           13 months (final follow up visit) - pregnancy test, Full Blood Count (FBC), LFTs, serum&#xD;
           creatinine and body temperature measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then exit study&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Healthy Control Group: Blood sample obtained at baseline for assessment of Vitamin D,&#xD;
           VDR and neutrophil function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure change at 3 month, 6 and 12 months assessments (from baseline) in neutrophil&#xD;
           function, in the secukinumab group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure vitamin D concentration, VDR at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Model fluctuation in vitamin D, which is season dependant and estimate when it is&#xD;
           maximal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare treatment response at time point treatment with lowest vitamin D concentration&#xD;
           (winter time) with that with highest vitamin D concentration (summer time).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether difference in neutrophil function, ACR20, PASI 75 and 90 response and&#xD;
           NAPSI correlate with change in vitamin D, using longitudinal models&#xD;

             test or TB-Spot Test (as indicated in Section 4.1 and Table 6-1). Patients with a&#xD;
             positive test may participate in the study if further work up (according to local&#xD;
             practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of&#xD;
             active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established then treatment&#xD;
             according to local country guidelines must have been initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;

             in the past 3 months, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive malignant colon&#xD;
             polyps that have been removed).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of Vitamin D containing supplements.&#xD;

        Healthy Controls Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  10 healthy control blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The healthy controls will be recruited from staff at the University of Liverpool or&#xD;
             Aintree University hospitals and who are not taking nor have taken over the preceding&#xD;
             6 months, any immunosuppressive agent including systemic corticosteroids and whose&#xD;
             health is otherwise good. There will be an equal balance of males to females. Matching&#xD;
             to biologic or DMARD controls is not required. The healthy controls will provide one&#xD;
