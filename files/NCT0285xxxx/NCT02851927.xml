  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Undiagnosed pleural effusion is a diagnostic dilemma especially in exudative pleural&#xD;
      effusions (EPE). 20-40 % are unable to be attributed to a specific diagnosis, even after&#xD;
      thoracentesis and closed pleural biopsy. Thoracoscopy has been demonstrated to increase the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield in undiagnosed EPE. The diagnostic yield of thoracoscopy in malignant and TB&#xD;
      pleural effusion ranges from 91% to 94% and 93% to 100%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigid thoracoscopy has traditionally been the modality of choice. The recently introduced&#xD;
      semirigid thoracoscope provides ease of handling like a flexible bronchoscope. However, there&#xD;
      are concerns about the diagnostic yield of semi-rigid thoracoscopy when compared with rigid&#xD;
      thoracoscopy. According to the available literature, the yield of semirigid and rigid&#xD;
      thoracoscopy is almost similar if adequate pleural biopsy is obtained. However there are&#xD;
      concerns that with semi-rigid thoracoscope, there might be greater incidence of inability to&#xD;
      obtain adequate pleural biopsy. On the other hand, the use of conventional rigid thoracoscope&#xD;
      may be associated with greater procedure related pain.Mini-Thoracoscopy is a newer rigid&#xD;
      thoracoscopy instrument which is smaller in diameter (5.5 mm) and may allow pleural biopsy&#xD;
      with a smaller incision. There is scant literature on its utility. The investigators hereby&#xD;
      propose to undertake a randomized comparison of rigid 'mini thoracoscope' vs semi rigid&#xD;
      thoracoscope in undiagnosed pleural effusions.&#xD;

      Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and giving prior consent for the study shall be&#xD;
      randomised. The randomization sequence will be computer generated with variable block size&#xD;
      and the assignments will be placed in opaque sealed envelopes. All patients will undergo&#xD;
      hemogram, liver and renal function tests, coagulation profile, an electrocardiogram and&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) of the chest before entering the study. Chest ultrasound will be&#xD;
      performed in all patients to evaluate the rib spaces, amount of pleural fluid and for&#xD;
      selection of the entry point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments The semi-rigid thoracoscope to be used is the autoclavable Olympus LTF-160&#xD;
      (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) thoracoscope with 2.8 mm inner channel diameter and 7 mm outer&#xD;
      diameter. The forceps is flexible forceps with alligator jaw with spike cusps, 2.8 mm of the&#xD;
      outer diameter. The rigid mini thoracoscope is the Richard Wolf 5.5 mm operating endoscope&#xD;
      with the working channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracoscopy technique Thoracoscopy will be performed in the interventional pulmonology lab.&#xD;
      Patients shall be fasting for solids for 8 hours and for liquids 6 hours. Patients shall be&#xD;
      having continuous monitoring of blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical anesthesia will be achieved by infiltrating 2% lidocaine locally at the incision&#xD;
      site. The procedure shall be performed under conscious sedation and analgesia using a&#xD;
      combination of midazolam and intravenous fentanyl. An incision shall be made at the site of&#xD;
      maximum fluid thickness as assessed by pre-procedural USG chest, with the patient in lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position and involved side upward. After incision, the appropriately sized trocar&#xD;
      shall be placed through the skin into the pleural space. The thoracoscope shall be inserted&#xD;
      through the trocar. The pleural surfaces shall then be thoroughly inspected. A minimum of 6-8&#xD;
      pleural biopsy samples shall be obtained by semi-rigid thoracoscope and at least 4 with rigid&#xD;
      mini-thoracoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples shall be sent for histopathological analysis and mycobacterial cultures. At the end&#xD;
      of the procedure, a chest tube shall be placed and removed subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients shall be followed up for a period of six months from the time of procedure if&#xD;
      non-specific inflammation/ fibrinous pleuritis is the diagnosis or no definitive diagnosis is&#xD;
      made during that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data shall be expressed as mean Â± standard deviation (SD), or percentage. Differences in&#xD;
      continuous variables between the two groups shall be compared using Student's t test (or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test); while differences in categorical data shall be compared using the&#xD;
      chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test). A p value of less than 0.05 shall be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
