  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical, throat, anal, and genital cancers. Cancers&#xD;
      caused by HPV have a HPV protein called E7 inside of their cells. In this new therapy,&#xD;
      researchers take a person s blood, remove certain white blood cells, and insert genes that&#xD;
      make them to target cancer cells that have the E7 protein. The genetically changed cells,&#xD;
      called E7 TCR cells, are then given back to the person to fight the cancer. Researchers want&#xD;
      to see if this can help people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine a safe dose and efficacy of E7 TCR cells and whether these cells can help&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with an HPV-16-associated cancer, including cervical, vulvar,&#xD;
      vaginal, penile, anal, or oropharyngeal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will list all their medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have many screening tests, including imaging procedures, heart and lung&#xD;
      tests, and lab tests. They will have a large catheter inserted into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. A&#xD;
      machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle&#xD;
      in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cells will be changed in the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital. Over several days, they will get:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      E7 TCR cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shots or injections to stimulate the cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored in the hospital up to 12 days. They will get support medicine&#xD;
      and have blood and lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a clinic visit about 40 days after cell infusion. They will have a&#xD;
      physical exam, blood work, scans, and maybe x-rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have many follow-up visits with the same procedures. At some visits, they&#xD;
      may undergo leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 15 years.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-16+ cancers (cervical,&#xD;
           vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers) are incurable and poorly&#xD;
           palliated by standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV-16+ cancers constitutively express the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, which is absent from&#xD;
           healthy human tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of T cell receptor (TCR) gene engineered T cells can induce objective&#xD;
           tumor responses in certain malignancies including HPV-16+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T cells genetically engineered with a TCR targeting HPV-16 E7 (E7 TCR) display specific&#xD;
           reactivity against HLA-A2+, HPV-16+ target cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To determine a safe dose for E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      HPV-16+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine safety and efficacy of E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic HPV-16+ cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with metastatic or refractory/recurrent&#xD;
           HPV-16+ cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the patient declines standard&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be HLA-A*02:01-positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase I/II clinical trial that will test the safety and efficacy of E7 TCR&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of E7 TCR cells. Cell&#xD;
           infusion will be followed by high-dose aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-enrollment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Measurable metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer (determined by in&#xD;
                  situ hybridization (ISH) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients must be HLA-A*02 by low resolution typing, and HLA-A*02:01 by one of the&#xD;
                  high resolution type results.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. All patients must have received prior first line standard therapy or declined&#xD;
                  standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patients with three or fewer brain metastases that have been treated with surgery&#xD;
                  or stereotactic radiosurgery are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with&#xD;
                  stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for one month before protocol&#xD;
                  treatment. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time&#xD;
                  of enrollment on this study up to four months after treatment. Patients must be&#xD;
                  willing to undergo testing for HPV-16 prior to becoming pregnant after this&#xD;
                  period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of&#xD;
                  the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus. Women of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential are defined as all women except women who are&#xD;
                  postmenopausal or who have had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as&#xD;
                  women over the age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least one&#xD;
                  year. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
                  secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR transduced PBL, breastfeeding&#xD;
                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR transduced PBL. These&#xD;
                  potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Serology:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this&#xD;
             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can&#xD;
             have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental&#xD;
             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If&#xD;
             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the&#xD;
             presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Hematology:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm^3 without the support of&#xD;
&#xD;
        filgrastim.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WBC greater than or equal to 3000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             b. Chemistry:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum ALT/AST less than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated creatinine clearance (CCr) greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/1.73^2 using&#xD;
             the Cockcroft-Gault equation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL, except in patients with Gilbert's&#xD;
             Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             c. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time&#xD;
             the patient receives the E7 TCR cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past three weeks, as&#xD;
        long as all toxicities have recovered to Grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active systemic infections (for e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation&#xD;
             disorders or other active major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory&#xD;
             or immune system, as evidenced by a positive stress thallium or comparable test,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, severe obstructive or restrictive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease. Patients with abnormal pulmonary function tests but stable&#xD;
             obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency&#xD;
             Disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune&#xD;
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible&#xD;
             to its toxicities).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with autoimmune diseases such as Crohn s disease, ulcerative colitis,&#xD;
             rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis or pancreatitis, and systemic lupus&#xD;
             erythematosus. Hypothyroidism, vitiligo and other minor autoimmune disorders are not&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients on immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids. With the exception of:&#xD;
             intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g.,&#xD;

&#xD;
             -Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent;&#xD;
&#xD;
             or,&#xD;

             premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide, fludarabine&#xD;
             or aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with a history of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms unless&#xD;
             patient has a normal cardiac stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 45% tested. The following patients will&#xD;
             undergo cardiac evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Any other condition, which would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
             indicate that the subject is a poor candidate for the clinical trial or would&#xD;
             jeopardize the subject or the integrity of the data obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with baseline screening pulse oxygen level of &lt; 95% on room air will not be&#xD;
             eligible. If the underlying cause of hypoxia improves, then they may be reevaluated&#xD;
