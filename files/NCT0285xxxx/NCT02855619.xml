  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction appears to contribute to slow weaning from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Several trials of inspiratory muscle training to facilitate weaning&#xD;
      in intensive care have been performed, with inconsistent results, utilizing different methods&#xD;
      of IMT in different populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to compare the incidence of 3 inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training programs on inspiratory strength, on difficult to wean patients in intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center randomized trial not blinded with 3 parallels groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Martin's group: a threshold-based IMT is performed like used by Martin in a randomized&#xD;
           trial in 2011, in a view of inspiratory strength increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cader's group: a threshold-based IMT is performed like used by Cader in a randomized&#xD;
           trial in 2010 , in a view of inspiratory endurance increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EDRIC's group: a new treshold-based IMT is performed, in a view of both inspiratory&#xD;
           strength and endurance increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators think that a new threshold-based IMT performed in a view of both&#xD;
      inspiratory strength and endurance increase, is more effective and well tolerated than the 2&#xD;
      others protocols.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determinate which IMT program is the most effective on&#xD;
      the inspiratory muscle strength and endurance increase. The investigators will be able to&#xD;
      study the impact on the weaning time of IMT performed with the best protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to conduct a randomized trial with intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
      Following 18h of invasive mechanical ventilation in a controlled mode, the failure of the&#xD;
      first single breathe trial of 2 hours and the presence of sevrability criterias defined by&#xD;
      the European consensus conference in 2007, 88 participants will be included. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomizesd to receive one of the 3 protocols of IMT, 2 times per day, 7 days per&#xD;
      week, from the inclusion to the extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratio of randomization will be 1:1:2 for a better evaluation of EDRIC's group wich&#xD;
      propose a new IMT protocol.&#xD;
