  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We and others have shown that many younger patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic&#xD;
      Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) have orthostatic intolerance (OI), i.e., they can't tolerate&#xD;
      prolonged standing. OI in ME/CFS is often accompanied by either postural tachycardia syndrome&#xD;
      (POTS) in which standing results in an excessive heart rate, and neurally mediated&#xD;
      hypotension (NMH) in which standing causes a fall in blood pressure and fainting. Intravenous&#xD;
      fluids can alleviate these symptoms, but is difficult to administer; oral fluids fail to&#xD;
      provide the same benefit. We would therefore like to test the effectiveness of an oral&#xD;
      rehydration solution (ORS, W.H.O. formula) making use of co-transport of glucose and sodium,&#xD;
      to reverse these symptoms in ME/CFS subjects with POTS or NMS, and will compare these results&#xD;
      with healthy control subjects.&#xD;

      We and others have shown that a majority of younger patients with Myalgic&#xD;
      Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) have orthostatic intolerance (OI), the&#xD;
      inability to tolerate orthostatic stress such as prolonged standing. OI in ME/CFS comprises&#xD;
      postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) in which symptoms occur along with excessive upright&#xD;
      heart rate, and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH) in which symptoms occur along with an&#xD;
      upright fall in blood pressure. The causes of OI are diverse but are clearly initiated by&#xD;
      postural contraction of central blood volume (BV) by gravitational translocation of 500-800&#xD;
      mL of blood from the upper to the lower body. Intravenous central BV expansion with isotonic&#xD;
      saline is commonly and effectively used to reduce OI regardless of etiology, but has&#xD;
      complications if used long term. Usual forms of oral hydration fail to provide similar&#xD;
      benefit. Interestingly, a specific isotonic oral rehydration solution (ORS W.H.O. formula),&#xD;
      making use of co-transport of glucose and sodium, has been shown to efficiently rehydrate&#xD;
      cholera patients suggesting an ability to increase central BV rivaling intravenous fluids.&#xD;
      Since the circulatory effects of saline or ORS BV expansion are incompletely understood, we&#xD;
      propose to study the neurovascular physiology of fluid loading during orthostatic stress in&#xD;
      ME/CFS patients with POTS or NMH, comparing results with healthy control subjects. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that equal volumes of ORS is not inferior and may be superior to intravenous&#xD;
      saline infusion in increasing intravascular and interstitial fluid volume and improving&#xD;
      orthostatic tolerance. Using noninvasive measurements of heart rate and blood pressure by&#xD;
      Finapres and oscillometry, cardiac output and peripheral arterial resistance by inert gas&#xD;
      rebreathing, cerebral blood flow velocity by transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and regional&#xD;
      fluid shifts by impedance and venous occlusion plethysmography, we have acquired preliminary&#xD;
      data in ME/CFS patients with OI demonstrating superior restoration of orthostatic tolerance&#xD;
      with ORS. We will recruit patients aged 15-29 years who have confirmed ME/CFS with OI,&#xD;
      including 15 with NMH and 15 with POTS, and compare them to 15 healthy volunteer subjects. In&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 we will measure BV by Daxor iodinated albumin technique before orthostatic&#xD;
      stress imposed by step-wise lower body negative pressure (LBNP) to measure the threshold for&#xD;
      OI. Relative changes in BV using serial hematocrits in OI patients will be compared to data&#xD;
      from control subjects similarly tested. In Specific Aim 2, all subjects will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive saline or ORS in a cross over study. On one day, total BV and neurovascular&#xD;
      properties will be measured in patients and control subjects before and 1 hour after&#xD;
      completing one liter administration of intravenous normal saline infusion or ORS. On another&#xD;
      day (separated by 1 week), we will repeat measurements using the other hydration route. We&#xD;
      will perform LBNP on each day following saline or ORS to determine whether orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance and circulatory physiology are improved similarly with equivolumic IV saline or&#xD;
      ORS hydration.&#xD;
