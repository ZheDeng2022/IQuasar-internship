  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that growth in size (weight, length, and&#xD;
      head circumference) and in body composition (fat and lean mass) in preterm infants should&#xD;
      adhere as close as possible to the growth and body composition of a healthy infant in utero&#xD;
      at the same gestational age. However, there are no body composition reference curves&#xD;
      available at this time for the preterm infant population. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      collect cross-sectional body composition data using air displacement plethysmography (PEA POD&#xD;
      Infant Body Composition System, Life Measurement, Inc) on approximately 240 preterm infants&#xD;
      within 3 days of birth, for the purpose of generating means, standard deviations, and&#xD;
      percentile values for total body fat mass, total fat free mass, and percent body fat for&#xD;
      infants born at 30-36 weeks gestation. Relatively healthy infants without evidence of growth&#xD;
      retardation will be selected for form the reference sample. The goal is to generate a set of&#xD;
      common reference curves to be used in clinical centers against which to compare body&#xD;
      composition status for individual infants.&#xD;
