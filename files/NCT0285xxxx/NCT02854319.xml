      The objective of the REPRISE EDGE study is to confirm the acute performance and safety of the&#xD;
      LOTUS Edge™ Valve System when used with the Lotus™ or iSleeve™ Introducer Set for&#xD;
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in symptomatic patients with severe calcific&#xD;
      aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.&#xD;

      This clinical study is a prospective, single-arm study designed to demonstrate that the acute&#xD;
      performance and safety of the LOTUS Edge Valve System when used with the iSleeve or Lotus&#xD;
      Introducer Set are consistent with the results of the commercially approved Lotus Valve&#xD;
      System used in the REPRISE II study, when delivered and deployed in symptomatic subjects who&#xD;
      have severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk for surgical aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (SAVR).&#xD;
