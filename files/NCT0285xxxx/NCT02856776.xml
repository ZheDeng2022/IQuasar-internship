  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There continues to be debate as to how much vitamin D an adult requires to be vitamin D&#xD;
      sufficient. A multitude of association studies have suggested that improving serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      &gt;30 ng/mL may reduce risk of many chronic illnesses and improve immune function. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to define dynamic changes in PTH, broad gene expression in circulating immune&#xD;
      cells, metabolomics, and microbiome profile in response to varying doses of vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D requires two metabolic conversions, 25-hydroxylation in the liver and&#xD;
      1Î±-hydroxylation in the kidney, before its hormonal form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      [1,25(OH)2D], can bind to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) to modulate gene transcription. The&#xD;
      VDR is present in a wide variety of cells and tissues and 1,25(OH)2D via its receptor&#xD;
      directly or indirectly have been reported to have effects on cell cycling and proliferation,&#xD;
      differentiation, apoptosis and the production of cathelicidin, renin and insulin. It is&#xD;
      estimated that VDR activation may regulate directly and/or indirectly the expression of a&#xD;
      very large number of genes (0.5-5% of the total human genome i.e., 100-1250 genes). Early&#xD;
      microarray studies performed in squamous carcinoma and osteoblasts cells revealed that&#xD;
      1,25(OH)2D3 regulated the expression of numerous genes including those implicated in immune&#xD;
      function . Although there have been numerous observations of vitamin D deficiency and its&#xD;
      links to chronic diseases, a study on how a person's vitamin D status and improvement with&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation affects genomic expression in vivo in humans had not been reported&#xD;
      until recently when we observed in a small pilot study that supplementation of healthy adults&#xD;
      with vitamin D significantly affected the expression of 291 genes that have been linked to&#xD;
      more than 80 different metabolic pathways. This small randomized controlled double blind&#xD;
      study funded by our CTSI and registered in Clinical Trials.gov (NCT01696409) included 2&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 received 400 IUs of vitamin D3 (400 IUs at the time of the study in 2010 was&#xD;
      before the IOM released its new recommendations) and was considered the control group and&#xD;
      group 2 received 2000 IUs of vitamin D3 daily for 2 months during the winter. Comparing gene&#xD;
      expression in these two groups (deficient vs. insufficient or sufficient) led us to study the&#xD;
      effect of vitamin D status as well as vitamin D supplementation on genome-wide gene&#xD;
      expression. To explore gene-expression relationships between and within the 400 IU and 2000&#xD;
      IU groups, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. We observed the same trend in&#xD;
      gene expression in the subjects who received 400 and 2000 IUs vitamin D3. There was however a&#xD;
      trend for a larger change in the expression of these genes for the group who received 2000&#xD;
      IUs vitamin D3/d compared to the group who received 400 IUs vitamin D3/d. Regarding all&#xD;
      participants, with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.1, and a 1.5 fold change, 291 genes were&#xD;
      found to have a statistically significant difference in expression from baseline to follow-up&#xD;
      after vitamin D3 supplementation. There was at least a 1.5 fold inhibition of 82 genes (top&#xD;
      ~30% of the heat map) whose expression was dramatically reduced and at least a 1.5 fold&#xD;
      induction of 209 genes (bottom ~70% of the heat map) whose expression was significantly&#xD;
      increased after supplementation with either 400 or 2000 IU of vitamin D3 for 2 months. For&#xD;
      verification that genes that we observed to have their expression affected by vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation did occur expression changes were evaluated by real-time PCR for four genes&#xD;
      including CD83, TNFAIP3, KLF10 and SBDS. The gene expression changes were concordant with&#xD;
      those observed by the microarray analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This subgroup analysis of the baseline gene expression for the 291 genes in the vitamin D&#xD;
      deficient group compared to the vitamin D insufficient/sufficient group revealed that,&#xD;
      expression of 66 genes were significantly different between the two groups (p&lt;0.01 and fold&#xD;
      change&gt;1.5). There was at least a 1.5 fold increase in gene expression (brown-orange) of 14&#xD;
      genes and at least a 1.5 fold decrease in the expression (yellow-white) of 52 genes in the&#xD;
      vitamin D deficient adults compared to those who were vitamin D insufficient or sufficient at&#xD;
      baseline. After vitamin D3 supplementation gene expression in the vitamin D deficient group&#xD;
      was similar to vitamin D insufficient/sufficient group. To learn which of these genes&#xD;
      affected by vitamin D3 supplementation contained VDR binding domains near the transcriptional&#xD;
      start site (TSS), we performed a VDRE analysis. Of the 66 genes that were influenced by at&#xD;
      least 1.5 fold in their expression by the baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration,17 of these&#xD;
      genes that were significantly changed after vitamin D3 supplementation in both deficient and&#xD;
      insufficient/sufficient groups (p&lt;0.01) were selected for VDRE analysis. We found at least&#xD;
      one candidate VDRE in the upstream region within 30 kb of the TSS in these 17 genes. For&#xD;
      example, the candidate VDRE in coatomer protein complex, subunit beta 2 (COPB2), a gene that&#xD;
      was stimulated at least 1.5 fold by vitamin D3 supplementation, had two hexameric binding&#xD;
      motifs associated with the VDRE. Twelve housekeeping genes served as negative controls. There&#xD;
      were no sequences of candidate VDREs in 100 kb upstream of TSS of these housekeeping genes&#xD;
      and the expression of these housekeeping genes after vitamin D3 supplementation was not&#xD;
      changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VDR is present in a wide variety of cells and tissues, in particular they are prominent on&#xD;
      cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity; especially CD8+ T lymphocytes.These immune&#xD;
      cells are found throughout the body including parts of the digestive tract. In particular,&#xD;
      the upper GI tract (including the pyloric antrum and duodenum) has the greatest concentration&#xD;
      of CD8+ T cells relative to the rest of the GI tract. Studies have found that those who&#xD;
      increase their vitamin D intake have a reduction in opportunistic pathogens and an increase&#xD;
      in gut microbiome. Through the action of vitamin D on CD8+ T cells, there is an increase&#xD;
      immune response against gammaproteobacteria which allows the gut microbiome to flourish. This&#xD;
      study found that although the upper GI tract generated the greatest change in microbiome&#xD;
      secondary to vitamin D supplementation, the rest of the GI tract and stool also displayed a&#xD;
      change. Gut microbiome is important for general health maintenance. For example, changes in&#xD;
      gut microbiota have been associated with early onset of Type 2 - Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
      Thus, it is possible to understand the prevalence of VDR expression on immune cells in an&#xD;
      individual by observing the microbiota in the gut/stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this proposed project will be to expand on these preliminary data in a&#xD;
      well-defined group of healthy adults ages 18-50 years with a BMI &lt;30 kg/m2 who are vitamin D&#xD;
      insufficient with a 25(OH)D of &lt; 29 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
      There continues to be debate as to how much vitamin D an adult requires to be vitamin D&#xD;
      sufficient. A multitude of association studies have suggested that improving serum 25(OH)D&#xD;
      &gt;30 ng/mL may reduce risk of many chronic illnesses and improve immune function.&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D] may regulate at least 2000 genes. Our recent pilot&#xD;
      study evaluating the effect of vitamin D status and vitamin D supplementation on broad gene&#xD;
      expression revealed as many as 291 genes are influenced by vitamin D3 supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Define Dynamic Changes in PTH, Broad Gene Expression in Circulating Immune Cells,&#xD;
      metabolomics, and microbiome profile in Response to Varying Doses of Vitamin D&#xD;
      Supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis that will be tested is that as serum 25(OH)D levels increase as a result of&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation there will be a gradual decline in PTH levels. Furthermore we&#xD;
      expect that there will continue to be alterations in gene expression, metabolomic protein&#xD;
      levels and in the gut microbiome when the dose is increased to 10,000 IUs daily whereas the&#xD;
      PTH levels will plateau at a dose of 4000 IUs daily and remain the same when the dose is&#xD;
      escalated to 10,000 IUs daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 24 weeks and blood, urine, and stool samples will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline and at 8 week intervals to evaluate the time course for the changes in 25(OH)D, PTH&#xD;
      levels, gene expression, and determine if these changes remain constant or are continuing to&#xD;
      change after vitamin D supplementation. We will conduct a metabolomics profile in blood and&#xD;
      urine as well as determine if there are any microbiome changes in the stool as previously&#xD;
      described. In addition, one arm of the study will include a group who will receive 600 IUs&#xD;
      for the first 8 weeks followed by 4000 IUs for the next 8 weeks followed by 10,000 IUs of&#xD;
      vitamin D3 for the final 8 weeks to determine whether continued increase in vitamin D intake&#xD;
      in the same adult will continue not only to alter gene expression, metabolomics activity, and&#xD;
      microbiome changes, but also influence PTH levels. Although the IOM's UL for vitamin D for&#xD;
      adults is 4000 IU/D they and the Endocrine Society recognized that up to 10,000 IUs/D was&#xD;
      safe in healthy adults for up to 5 months. In addition a recent study reported that adults&#xD;
      taking up to 20,000 IUs/D for at least one year never raised their blood level above 250&#xD;
      nmol/L i.e. 100 ng/mL which is considered by the IOM, Endocrine Society and many reference&#xD;
      laboratories to be the upper limit of normal. Results from this study should provide a new&#xD;
      insight as to how much vitamin D a healthy adult requires to maximize their calcium and bone&#xD;
      metabolism and expression of genes related to the immune system and other biologic pathways&#xD;
      in the blood, urine, and stool.&#xD;
