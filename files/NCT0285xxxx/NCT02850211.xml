    <textblock>
      Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are commonly used analgesics that provide similar&#xD;
      analgesia but reduced adverse effects compared to other analgesics. However, few studies have&#xD;
      been conducted on postoperative pain and tendon-to-bone healing. Here, the investigators&#xD;
      investigated the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor on analgesia and tendon-to-bone&#xD;
      healing following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.&#xD;

      Participants Selection After obtaining institutional review board approval and written&#xD;
      informed consent from all participants, the investigators prospectively enrolled 180&#xD;
      participants scheduled to undergo arthroscopic acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair for a&#xD;
      partial or full thickness tear between September 2011 and August 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A priori statistical power analysis was performed to calculate the number of subjects&#xD;
      required. A difference of one point in the visual analogue scale (VAS) was defined as the&#xD;
      minimal clinically important difference. With a power of 80% and an alpha of 0.05, the power&#xD;
      analysis demonstrated that a sample size of 51 participants per group was needed. Assuming a&#xD;
      dropout rate of 20%, the investigators calculated a sample size of 60 participants per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned in equal numbers to receive selective COX-2 inhibitors&#xD;
      (celecoxib; Celebrex® 200 mg bid, Pfizer, Korea), traditional NSAIDs (ibuprofen; Carol-F® 385&#xD;
      mg tid, Ildong, Korea), or opioid drugs (tramadol; Tridol® 50 mg bid, Yuhan, Korea) for 2&#xD;
      weeks from the first day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic medication was not prescribed preoperatively. Subacromial participant-controlled&#xD;
      analgesia (Automed 3200, Ace Medical, Seoul, Korea) was used for the first 48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively in all participants. Intravenous cefazolin was used as the postoperative&#xD;
      antibiotic for one day. If participants could not tolerate pain with regular postoperative&#xD;
      medication, oxycodone (IR codon 5 mg, Unimed, Korea) was administered as rescue medication;&#xD;
      the maximum dosage was limited to 20 mg per day according to the investigators institution's&#xD;
      standard postoperative pain control procedures for 2 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Radiological Assessment Participants rated pain and satisfaction with medication&#xD;
      using a VAS of 0 (no pain/no satisfaction) to 10 (unbearable pain/extreme satisfaction)&#xD;
      preoperatively and 3 days and 2 weeks postoperatively. Administration of rescue medication&#xD;
      and side effects were also recorded. Side effects were categorized into five categories:&#xD;
      nausea/vomiting, somnolence/dizziness, gastrointestinal complications (constipation,&#xD;
      diarrhea, abdominal discomfort), pruritus, and bruising; respiratory difficulties, renal&#xD;
      failure, heart failure, and seizure were also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 180 participants, 82 were followed for at least 24 months after surgery. Shoulder&#xD;
      functional scores were obtained based on range of motion (ROM) data, pain VAS scores,&#xD;
      Constant-Murley Shoulder scores, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, and Korean&#xD;
      Shoulder Scoring system scores. Radiological integrity of the repaired rotator cuff was&#xD;
      assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 70 participants (25 in the celecoxib&#xD;
      group, 23 in the ibuprofen group, and 22 in the tramadol group) and ultrasonography in the&#xD;
      remaining 12 participants . Postoperative rotator cuff integrity assessed using MRI was&#xD;
      categorized as type I to V according to the classification developed by Sugaya et al. as&#xD;
      follows: type I, sufficient thickness compared with the normal cuff and homogenously low&#xD;
      intensity; type II, sufficient thickness compared with the normal cuff and partial high&#xD;
      intensity; type III, insufficient thickness (less than half the thickness of the normal cuff)&#xD;
      but no discontinuity, suggesting a partial-thickness delaminated tear; type IV, presence of a&#xD;
      minor discontinuity in 1-2 slices on both oblique coronal and sagittal images, suggesting a&#xD;
      small full-thickness tear; type V, presence of a major discontinuity in more than two slices&#xD;
      on both oblique coronal and sagittal images, suggesting a medium or large full-thickness&#xD;
      tear. Postoperative incomplete healing or re-tear was defined as either Sugaya type IV or V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI and ultrasonography data were analyzed by a musculoskeletal radiologist with 10 years of&#xD;
      experience who was blinded to the study. The deltoid muscle, subacromial/subdeltoid bursa,&#xD;
      long head of the biceps tendon, and entire rotator cuff were examined, with special emphasis&#xD;
      on the integrity of the subscapularis tendon, supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, and&#xD;
      teres minor tendon. The tendons were scanned along their long and short axes. The radiologist&#xD;
      defined a full-thickness tear as incomplete healing or a re-tear, such as a hypoechoic&#xD;
      full-thickness cleft inside the tendon, detachment of the tendon from the bone, insertion&#xD;
      with medial dislocation, and non-visualization of the tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedure and Postoperative Care The senior investigator conducted all surgical&#xD;
      procedures arthroscopically using three portals: anterior, lateral, and posterior. In&#xD;
      participants with a stiff shoulder, manipulation was performed with capsular release.&#xD;
      Synovectomy, biceps procedures, and debridement for partially torn rotator cuff tendons were&#xD;
      performed for the glenohumeral joint. After glenohumeral procedures, subacromial&#xD;
      decompression was performed to remove inflamed bursal tissue, and acromioplasty was conducted&#xD;
      with a motorized burr in almost all participants except those with an extremely thin acromion&#xD;
      to yield a flat acromion undersurface and to ensure adequate working space for the repair.&#xD;
      Distal clavicle resection was performed in selected participants. The anteroposterior and&#xD;
      retraction size of the tear were measured with a calibrated probe, and footprint preparation&#xD;
      was performed with a ring curette, rasp, and shaver to expose the bleeding bony surface.&#xD;
      After anchors were inserted according to the selected repair technique, the loaded sutures&#xD;
      were passed through the tendon using a flexible suture passer (Expressew®, Depuy Mitek,&#xD;
      Raynham, MA) or a suture passer (Spectrum®, Linvatec, Largo, FL). All sutures were secured&#xD;
      using the SMC knot. After subacromial procedures, the operator always returned to the&#xD;
      glenohumeral joint for irrigation and to identify medial anchor pull-out, missed foreign&#xD;
      materials, or biceps incorporated into rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants followed the same rehabilitation protocol. They wore an abduction brace for&#xD;
      5 weeks and started passive ROM after brace removal. Participants who had limited motion&#xD;
      preoperatively started tolerable controlled passive motion right after pain had subsided&#xD;
      postoperatively. Shrugging of the shoulder and active motion of the elbow (flexion,&#xD;
      extension), forearm (supination, pronation), wrist, and hand were encouraged immediately&#xD;
      after surgery. After brace weaning, active assisted ROM was performed according to a&#xD;
      pre-established protocol for 6 weeks. After full passive ROM was obtained,&#xD;
      muscle-strengthening exercises were started; all sports activities were permitted 6 months&#xD;
      after surgery. All physical therapy protocols were followed with the cooperation and&#xD;
      supervision of a rehabilitation physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 18.0E;&#xD;
      SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Frequency and descriptive statistics were analyzed to determine the&#xD;
      baseline characteristics, and the t-test, chi-square test, analysis of variance, and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test were performed to compare the three groups. Tukey's post-hoc test and&#xD;
      Bonferroni's test were used to determine the groups between which differences occurred.&#xD;
      Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
