  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      tracheal stenosis is the result of abnormal wound-healing processes leading to hypertrophic&#xD;
      scar formation and obstruction of the airway lumen by excess granulation tissue. This process&#xD;
      is progressive so treatment and prevention is essential. Resection-anastomosis of the trachea&#xD;
      is becoming the standard of care in many centers and gives the most consistent results in&#xD;
      both adult and pediatric patients. But recurrence stenosis, re-granulation and&#xD;
      re-inflammation are probable. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of systemic&#xD;
      prednisolone on prevention of recurrent tracheal stenosis after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tracheal stenosis affects 4-13% of adults and occurs in 1-8% of neonates after prolonged&#xD;
      intubation in United States. The causes of adults' tracheal stenosis include trauma, chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases, benign neoplasm, malignant neoplasm and collagen vascular diseases.&#xD;
      The most common cause of tracheal stenosis continues to be trauma, which can be internal&#xD;
      (prolonged endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, flame, burn injury) or external (neck&#xD;
      trauma). Approximately 90% of chronic subglottic stenosis in children and adults results from&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy and about 10% results from other causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resection anastomosis is the most effective treatment to cure this condition. The other&#xD;
      treatments are mechanical dilation (dilators, rigid bronchoscopes), stents, laser co2, diode,&#xD;
      and cold knife. But they are not as effective as resection anastomosis. Rigid bronchoscopes&#xD;
      or dilators may shear the mucosa leading to further damage. Resection of all damaged segments&#xD;
      of the airway, approximation and anastomosis of the two intact ends by means of fine&#xD;
      synthetic absorbable sutures with minimum tension. Steroids with anti-inflammatory effect&#xD;
      widely use as first line therapy for this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who underwent resection anastomosis during 2014-2016 for treatment of&#xD;
      post-intubation tracheal stenosis will be included in this study. Systemic prednisolone will&#xD;
      be used for treatment and prevention of recurrent tracheal stenosis in post-operative&#xD;
      patients. Post-operative patients will divide in two groups, one of them will receive&#xD;
      prednisolone and the other will receive placebo for 30 days. The results will be compared by&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (FOB or rigid) after 30 days.&#xD;
