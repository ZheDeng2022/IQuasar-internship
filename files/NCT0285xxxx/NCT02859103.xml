  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anhedonia (the lack of pleasure in normally pleasurable things) is a common symptom of major&#xD;
      depressive disorder (MDD), and it may impact how patients with depression experience reward.&#xD;
      Understanding how anhedonia is related to the experience of reward may help improve how&#xD;
      depression is treated. Computer tasks can be used to measure how reward is experienced, and&#xD;
      these measures might be able to predict things like who is likely to become depressed, or who&#xD;
      will respond to antidepressant medication. Studying the relationship between anhedonia and&#xD;
      reward in patients with depression might also tell us something about how to improve&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment of other psychiatric disorders.This is an open label controlled&#xD;
      treatment study lasting 8 weeks. The brain scans will be used to find changes in brain areas&#xD;
      that may be related to how people perform on the tasks. The investigators goal is to use this&#xD;
      information to help us find a reliable predictor that can be used to guide MDD treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Measuring Reward association and valuation using the Reward Association Task</measure>

    <description>Based on signal detection theory, it evaluates response bias as a function of prior reward and permits an objective assessment of disorder-related sensitivity to reward.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This distinction was included in the design in order to dissociate potentially different neural circuits subserving learning reward associations and using them to guide behavior.

    <measure>Anticipation of reward using the monetary incentive delay during fMRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This task was designed to disentangle anticipatory vs. consummatory phases of reward processing. To evaluate the how the 6 facets of reward are related to each other in unmedicated MDD patients in order to develop a clearer understanding of reward pathways</description>

    <measure>Motivation/effort using the Cued-Reinforcement Reaction Time Task and the EEfRT task.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Cued-Reinforcement Reaction Time Task (CRRT) provides an evaluation of reward-based reaction time speed as an index of incentive motivation.The EEfRT task allows analysis of the predictive value of reward probability and magnitude on effort-based decision making.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>participants are presented with a choice of two stimuli. Based on their first choice, the selected stimulus will be rewarded with a high probability, while the other will be rewarded with a low probability.To evaluate the how the 6 facets of reward are related to each other in unmedicated MDD patients in order to develop a clearer understanding of reward pathways</description>
