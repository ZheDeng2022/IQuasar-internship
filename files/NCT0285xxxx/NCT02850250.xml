      Congenital heart defects are structural or functional anomalies in the heart that occur&#xD;
      during fetal development and are present at birth. Congenital heart disease is the most&#xD;
      common congenital structural malformation. The survival of children born with congenital&#xD;
      heart disease has improved dramatically over the past thirty years, improvements in&#xD;
      diagnosis, medical and surgical management as well as anaesthetic care has improved survival&#xD;
      rates from 20% to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric cardiac surgery Children with congenital heart disease may undergo either closed&#xD;
      or open heart surgery. In a closed operation, the heart and main blood vessels can be&#xD;
      operated on while the heart is still beating. In open procedures, the heart is opened and the&#xD;
      blood flow to the child's vital organs is supported by a heart-lung bypass machine&#xD;
      (Cardio-pulmonary bypass - CBP). In light of improving outcomes recent years has seen a&#xD;
      worldwide shift towards neonatal biventricular repair where possible. For those where repair&#xD;
      is not possible then the majority will be offered surgical univentricular palliation&#xD;
      typically requiring 'high-risk' surgery in the first few weeks. 'High risk' neonates&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery often spend prolonged periods on the intensive care requiring&#xD;
      maximal support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients on the intensive care unit can suffer from multi-organ failure due to a&#xD;
      variety of reasons and may require cardiovascular and respiratory support, and also renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy in the form of peritoneal dialysis or haemodialysis/filtration. As a&#xD;
      result of organ failure/support and different cardiac anatomy and physiology, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of drugs used in this post-operative period could potentially vary greatly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative surgical site infections Post operative wound infections in paediatric&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery occurs in 2.3% to 8% of patients. This&#xD;
      complication results in increased morbidity, longer hospitalisations and increased cost. A&#xD;
      major strategy in reducing postoperative surgical site infections has been the use of&#xD;
      perioperative antibiotics to reduce primarily gram-positive skin flora that colonises the&#xD;
      skin and can potentially infect an open wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of particular concern for patients undergoing cardiac surgery are deep sternal wound&#xD;
      infections or mediastinitis. Associated mortality is significant and has been reported to be&#xD;
      as high as 60% in adults although there is little comparable data for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonates are at high risk of post-operative sternal wound infection, with an incidence of&#xD;
      5.5% versus 0.5% in older children in one study, which also highlighted an increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in the neonatal group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audit and data from our own institution has clarified that children aged less than 3 months&#xD;
      at the time of surgery are at highest risk of developing a post-operative surgical site&#xD;
      infection, and that the most commonly isolated organism is Staphylococcus Aureus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cefuroxime is the preferred choice of antibiotic prophylaxis in Alder Hey Children's&#xD;
      Hospital. It is given intra-operatively, and post operatively for 24hours post, unless the&#xD;
      patient's chest remains open, in which case the cefuroxime is continued until the chest is&#xD;
      closed, or they are changed to another anti-microbial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of drugs in paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery Pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      is a discipline aimed at predicting the best dosage and dosing regimen for each single drug&#xD;
      in order to ensure and maintain therapeutically effective concentrations at the action sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In postoperative cardiac patients in critical care, there are a number of pathophysiological&#xD;
      and iatrogenic conditions that may significantly alter the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  temperature (if the patient is being actively cooled)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  single/biventricular circulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute kidney injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  passive peritoneal drainage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  active peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  continuous veno-venous haemofiltration/dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is research available that paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) may have sub-therapeutic cefuroxime levels and the dose of&#xD;
      cefuroxime should be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In post op paediatric cardiac patients there are a number of studies describing different&#xD;
      drug pharmacokinetics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetics may be influenced by age within the neonatal period, weight,&#xD;
      total bypass time, and presence of intracardiac shunt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower bodyweight was associated with lower epinephrine clearance. Milrinone clearance also&#xD;
      appears to increase with age. Phenobarbital pharmacokinetics is also influenced by age and&#xD;
      weight. Subjects with single ventricle physiology demonstrated a 15% decrease in clearance&#xD;
      when compared with subjects with two-ventricle physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far to date, there are no pharmacokinetic studies investigating cefuroxime in this&#xD;
      specific post-operative patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, variations in the extracellular fluid content as a response to the trauma of&#xD;
      surgery and the fluid load or significant drug loss through thoracic drainages or through PD&#xD;
      catheter may significantly lower plasma concentrations of extracellularly distributed&#xD;
      hydrophilic antimicrobials (beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides). Instability of&#xD;
      renal function may promote significant changes in body fluid concentrations of renally&#xD;
      eliminated drugs, even in a brief period of hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These factors cumulatively may lead to reduced or increased exposure to drugs. Dosages of&#xD;
      some medicines are generally reduced in paediatric population following cardiac surgery to&#xD;
      account for potential AKI (e.g. prophylactic antimicrobials), however potential losses&#xD;
      through PD dialysis or through free drainage via PD catheter are not usually considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Peritoneal Drainage/Peritoneal dialysis following paediatric cardiac surgery Children&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease are especially prone to acute kidney injury&#xD;
      (AKI). It is difficult to appreciate the true incidence of this complication because,&#xD;
      throughout the literature available, great variability is seen in the criteria used for the&#xD;
      diagnosis. The reported incidence ranges between 1% and 17%, depending largely on the&#xD;
      criteria used to define the condition, and the associated mortality is between 21% and 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peritoneal dialysis is commonly used in the post-operative period after cardiac surgery to&#xD;
      aid the removal of fluids or sometimes as a treatment modality for acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is routine clinical practice in many centers, including ours (Department of Cardiac&#xD;
      Surgery at Alder Hey Children's Hospital) to insert a peritoneal dialysis catheter electively&#xD;
      at the time of surgery for potential peritoneal dialysis in neonates and children undergoing&#xD;
      bypass surgery deemed to be at significant risk of needing post-operative PD. Following&#xD;
      elective insertion of a PD catheter, hourly fluid drainage is documented as part of the&#xD;
      routine ICU fluid balance charts. The vast majority will drain some fluid from the catheter&#xD;
      in the initial hours. AKI usually develops early and PD is usually prescribed in the first&#xD;
      days after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between January 2014 until March 2015, 420 children underwent cardiac surgery at Alder Hey&#xD;
      children's Hospital. Of these patients, 4% required PD in the post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECMO Occasionally patients are unable to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass following&#xD;
      surgery, or deteriorate after arrival to intensive care and require Extracorporeal Membrane&#xD;
      Oxygenation (ECMO). This group of patients have an increased volume of distribution and&#xD;
      therefore, altered pharmacokinetic changes.&#xD;
