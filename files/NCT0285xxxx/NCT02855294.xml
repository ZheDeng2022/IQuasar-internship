      1. Recording Data Sheet:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data and information of each woman in both groups (A &amp; B) participated in this study&#xD;
           were recorded in a recording data sheet (Appendix II).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight-Height scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A valid and reliable weight -height scale, with a range of 1 to 150 kilograms weight,&#xD;
           and 1 to 200 centimeters height was used to measure the relevant subject's data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Siemens Immulite Immunoassay System:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics Immulite 1000,Los Angles, CA, 900-456900 U.S.A)&#xD;
           to measure the serum Progesterone and Estradiol levels in both groups (A&amp; B) using (TKE&#xD;
           21 Kit) for Estradiol and (TKPG 1 Kit) for Progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biodex balance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodex Balance System (BBS), P.O. Box 702, Shirley, Ny 11967.It is an apparatus used to&#xD;
      measure the dynamic balance. It utilizes dynamic multi axial platform. This platform allows&#xD;
      approximately 20 degree inclination in 360 degree range and is interfaced with computer&#xD;
      software. It measures the patient's ability to control the platform's angle of tilt, which is&#xD;
      quantified as a variance from the center, as well as the degree of deflection over time at&#xD;
      various stability levels as shown in (Fig. 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability levels allowed by the system ranged from one to eight. Stability level 8, allows&#xD;
      the highest level of stability as it makes the platform to be the least tilted. On the other&#xD;
      hand, stability level one represents the least level of stability and is more difficult for&#xD;
      the subject to maintain stability on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test consists of recording the patient's ability to control the platform variance from a&#xD;
      perfectly balanced position. A large variance is indicative of poor control and balance.&#xD;
      Further definition is realized with the quantification of Anterior/ Posterior and&#xD;
      Medial/Lateral responses.&#xD;

      various stability levels as shown in .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability levels allowed by the system ranged from one to eight. Stability level 8, allows&#xD;
      the highest level of stability as it makes the platform to be the least tilted. On the other&#xD;
      hand, stability level one represents the least level of stability and is more difficult for&#xD;
      the subject to maintain stability on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test consists of recording the patient's ability to control the platform variance from a&#xD;
      perfectly balanced position. A large variance is indicative of poor control and balance.&#xD;
      Further definition is realized with the quantification of Anterior/ Posterior and&#xD;
      Medial/Lateral responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BBS Consists of the Following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Display Screen: Its height can be adjusted from 51cm to 68 cm above the platform.&#xD;
           Display angle of the screen can be adjusted from vertical back up to 45º. Display&#xD;
           viewing area: 122 mms x 92 mms. Display accuracy: ±1 degree of tilt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Support Handle Rails: Adjustable from 125 cm to 136.5 cm above the platform. The rails&#xD;
           can be swung away from the platform if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Platform: Its height is 8 cm above floor, with a diameter of 21.5 cm. The platform has a&#xD;
           grid which consists of two coordinates: X and Y. The platform X coordinate is marked in&#xD;
           numbers from 1 to 21, whereas the platform Y coordinate is marked in letters from A to&#xD;
           P, the platform is also marked in angles from 0º to 45º, for precise feet placement and&#xD;
           documentation of the subject during the test procedures .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Printer: Cannon Bubble-Jet Printer, centronics parallel interface.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Biodex balance system has been allowed for eight stability levels, which has been ranged&#xD;
      from stability level (1) to stability level (8).which allows setting up of the test&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability indices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The woman's ability to control the platform's angle of tilt measured by the system.The&#xD;
           woman's performance wasnoted as a stability index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The stability index represents the variance of platform displacement in degrees from&#xD;
           level. A high number is an indicative of a lot of motion, which indicates balance&#xD;
           problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The data regarding the balance of the tested woman were supplied to the system. These&#xD;
           data includesantero-posterior stability index (APSI), medio-lateral stability index&#xD;
           (MLSI) &amp;overall stability index (OSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the upper most part of the surface of the platform appear angles from 0o to 95o with&#xD;
           the lines which represents these angles. These lines would be used to measure foot&#xD;
           angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The smaller the amount of sway, the lower the numerical value of these indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over all stability index (OSI): Represents the woman's ability to control her balance in&#xD;
           all directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anterior/Posterior stability index (APSI): Representsthe woman's ability to control her&#xD;
           balance in front to back directions (sagittal plane).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medial/Lateral stability index (MLSI): Represents the woman's ability to control her&#xD;
           balance from side to side directions(frontal plane).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III-Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation procedures were explained in details for every woman in both groups (A&amp;B) to&#xD;
      increase her interest and co-operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Mass Index&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of each woman in both groups were taken according to items of the recording data&#xD;
      sheet then, the weight and height were measured and BMI was calculated according to the&#xD;
      following equation BMI = Weight/Height (Kg/m2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evening Blood sample was collected from each woman to limit the effect of hormone diurnal&#xD;
      variations,For both groups samples have been collected at mid-luteal phase (20th to 23th days&#xD;
      of the cycle), at Al-Madina Lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample was allowed to clot in water bath at room temperature.the serum was separated&#xD;
      using a centrifuge at 4000 rmp for 15 min.Then using the TKE 21 and TKPG 1 Kits in a low&#xD;
      temperature air conditioned room to measure serum Estradiol and Progesterone levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodex balance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures were performed in dynamic balance lab at physical therapy faculty&#xD;
      CairoUniversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodex Balance System used for assessment of the postural stability in female oral&#xD;
      contraceptive users and non-users. The assessment was conducted for each woman individually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of the work was explained to the woman before conducting this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Biodex balance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operating the balance system:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the system is on, the first displayed screen showed the main menu. It allowed us to&#xD;
           choose entering test or system utilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Choosing to enter testing showed the next screen, which allowed for determining the test&#xD;
           parameters as test duration and the stability levels were chosen as the initial&#xD;
           stability level (8) and the end stability level (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next screen was used for centering process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The next screen was the stability test screen. The start key was pressed while on this&#xD;
           screen to unlock the platform allowing the test to start. A cursor appeared during the&#xD;
           test tracing the movement of the platform while the timer counting till the time of the&#xD;
           test ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of test lasts for 20 seconds staring with stability level (8) and&#xD;
           progressing the stability levels ending with stability level (4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The foot platform automatically returned to the locked position. At this point, the&#xD;
           investigators printed the screen, including the numeric value of the APSI, MLSI and OSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Testing procedures was done at mid-luteal phase (20th to 23th days of the cycle). Each&#xD;
           woman was received verbal explanation about the test steps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The woman was tested without footwear and with eyes opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two test trials was done before specific test condition for the purpose of instrument&#xD;
           familiarity prior to data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A high stability level (stability level 8) and reduced test time (20 sec) was chosen to&#xD;
           avoid falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each woman was asked to perform two trial tests and their mean was calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each test started with the balance platform in the locked position and standing on its&#xD;
           center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparatory step: the parameters of each examined woman (weight, height and age) as well as,&#xD;
      test duration and stability level of the platform of the BBS were typed to the software of&#xD;
      the device as shown in Fig. (8). All woman were asked to stand on the platform of the BBS in&#xD;
      an erect posture as possible and kept it all through the test duration (i.e. stand on both&#xD;
      feet, chin in, shoulders were leveled, as well as, retracted , back was straight and knees&#xD;
      were drawn backward). Hence, the support handle rails and display screen were adjusted&#xD;
      according to the height of each examined woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Centering step: with the aim of positioning the center of gravity (COG) of the subject at the&#xD;
      middle of her base of support between the two feet and recoding the women's feet position.&#xD;
      Centering was achieved by asking each woman to stand on the platform of the BBS while&#xD;
      grasping the support handle rails by both hands while the platform was locked . Formerly, the&#xD;
      platform was unlocked at stability level 8, the display screen showed a circle with a central&#xD;
      cursor. At that time, the subject was asked to achieve a central position on the platform by&#xD;
      shifting her feet position until she was able to keep the cursor (which represents the center&#xD;
      of platform) centered on the circle that appeared on the display screen and correspondingly&#xD;
      the platform was kept easily leveled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Once centering was achieved and the cursor was in the center of the display screen, each&#xD;
      woman was instructed to maintain her feet at that position constant until the end of test&#xD;
      procedures. At that time, the platform was locked again to allow recording the feet angles&#xD;
      and heel's coordinates from the platform grid. The heel's coordinates were determined by&#xD;
      finding the location of the center of the back of each heel in relation to X and Y&#xD;
      coordinates of the platform, while the feet angles were determined by finding a line on the&#xD;
      platform parallel to the 2nd metatarsal bone of each foot. Then, the feet angles and heels&#xD;
      coordinates for each womanwere entered to the software of the BBS&#xD;
