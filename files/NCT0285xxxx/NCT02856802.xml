      multiple centers in the United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, two double-blind (DB) treatment period dosing study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously diagnosed subjects with a history of episodic migraine (as defined by&#xD;
      International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), 3rd edition [beta version] [ICHD&#xD;
      3]) who experienced an average of 2 to 8 migraine attacks per month for at least the prior 12&#xD;
      months, with no more than 14 headache days per month, and with 48 hours of headache free time&#xD;
      between migraine, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio in both DB periods to receive either DFN-02&#xD;
      (sumatriptan nasal spray 10 mg) or a matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects treated one moderate to severe migraine attack in the first double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period (DB1) and, if eligible, were re-randomized into the second double-blind treatment&#xD;
      period (DB2) to treat another migraine attack at any pain level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There was a screening period of up to 21 days to evaluate whether subjects fit the migraine&#xD;
      inclusion criteria pursuant to ICHD-3, and did not have medication overuse. Subjects with at&#xD;
      least a 12 month medical history of acute migraine were eligible for enrollment in the&#xD;
      treatment period. Subjects continued to take their normal migraine medication during this&#xD;
      screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eligible and randomized, subjects in the DB1 treatment period were instructed to use the&#xD;
      study medication in one migraine attack as soon as (and no more than within one hour after)&#xD;
      experiencing moderate to severe migraine pain (defined as headache pain rating of Grade 2&#xD;
      [moderate] or Grade 3 [severe] on a pain severity scale of 0 to 3). If the subject was not&#xD;
      able to use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they were instructed&#xD;
      to use the study medication for the next attack. Those subjects who did not experience a&#xD;
      migraine attack, and/or did not treat any migraine attack with study medication or record&#xD;
      diary data, were not allowed to continue into the DB2 treatment period, and were&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treating a migraine attack with study medication, subjects were instructed to contact&#xD;
      the site within 24 hours of the treated migraine (or the next working day) to schedule their&#xD;
      next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects returned to the study site within 2 to 7 days in the DB1 treatment period and, if&#xD;
      continuing to be eligible, were re-randomized into a DB2 treatment period to treat one&#xD;
      migraine attack at any pain level, and return to the study site within 2 to 7 days of the&#xD;
      second treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once randomized, the total duration of each subject's participation in the study was up to 10&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 hours after study medication administration</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from headache pain at 2 hours after the first dose of study medication taken within one hour after experiencing a migraine attack of moderate to severe headache pain during the DB1 treatment period, e.g., headache pain rating of moderate [Grade 2] or severe [Grade 3] predose and reduced to none [Grade 0] postdose). Mild headache pain was recorded as Grade 1. If the subject was not able to use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they were instructed to use the study medication for the next attack. If the subject experienced insufficient relief from the first dose of study medication, they were permitted to take a second dose of study medication or rescue medication 2 or more hours after the first dose, and only after completing the 2 hours' postdose assessments. If no relief was experienced from the first dose of study medication after 2 hours only rescue medication could be administered. Maximum 2 doses of study medication per 24 hours.</description>

    <description>Number of participants with their MBS among nausea, photophobia and phonophobia absent at 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the first dose of study medication taken for a migraine attack during DB1 treatment period are summarized by treatment group and time point for the full analysis set (FAS1). The corresponding p-values from Fisher's exact test were computed for the comparison between treatment groups. Subjects who reported a MBS predose and reported the status of the MBS at the particular postdose time point were analyzed.</description>

If the subject was not able to use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they were instructed to use the study medication for the next attack.</description>

    <baseline>
      <population>A maximum 21 day screening period was conducted to evaluate whether a subject met the migraine inclusion criteria pursuant to ICHD-3, and did not exhibit medication overuse. If eligible and randomized, subjects in the DB1 treatment period were instructed to use the study medication for their first migraine attack as soon as (and no more than 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe migraine pain. If the subject was missed dosing the first migraine, they were to dose the next attack.</population>

        <description>Freedom from headache pain at 2 hours after the first dose of study medication taken within one hour after experiencing a migraine attack of moderate to severe headache pain during the DB1 treatment period, e.g., headache pain rating of moderate [Grade 2] or severe [Grade 3] predose and reduced to none [Grade 0] postdose). Mild headache pain was recorded as Grade 1. If the subject was not able to use study medication for the first migraine after randomization, they were instructed to use the study medication for the next attack. If the subject experienced insufficient relief from the first dose of study medication, they were permitted to take a second dose of study medication or rescue medication 2 or more hours after the first dose, and only after completing the 2 hours' postdose assessments. If no relief was experienced from the first dose of study medication after 2 hours only rescue medication could be administered. Maximum 2 doses of study medication per 24 hours.</description>
