  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (ISLA) remains a serious complication of&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Rapid diagnosis of ISLA is a key issue for improving the prognosis. The&#xD;
      determination of calprotectin in ascites, used for the diagnosis of infection of ascitic&#xD;
      liquid, could allow the diagnosis in a very short time (about 30 minutes). To date, the&#xD;
      determination of calprotectin in ascites was not evaluated properly. The investigators would&#xD;
      thus evaluate the interest of the determination of calprotectin in ascites for the rapid&#xD;
      diagnosis of ISLA in cirrhotic patients, like you, hospitalized for decompensation of their&#xD;
      disease. The main purpose of this pilot study will determine the optimal threshold&#xD;
      calprotectin in ascites for diagnosis of ISLA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of ascites in cirrhotic patients is a frequent event (about half of these&#xD;
      patients developed ascites after 10 years of evolution) and marks an evolutionary turning&#xD;
      point in the natural history of cirrhosis (30% survival at 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (ISLA) is the leading infectious complication cirrhotic&#xD;
      patient (prevalence of 10-30%). Half of these ISLA are already present on admission of the&#xD;
      patient and over 20% of these infections are totally asymptomatic. The delay processing of&#xD;
      ISLA causes heavy mortality. Even when antibiotic treatment is started immediately after the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ISLA, in-hospital mortality remains high (about 20%) and mainly related to the&#xD;
      development of severe sepsis, septic shock and hepatorenal syndrome; the medium-term&#xD;
      prognosis remains severe as also survival after an episode of ISLA is 30-50% at 1 year.&#xD;
      Therefore, the surviving patients with a first episode of ISLA are candidates for liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Given the major prognostic implications and the asymptomatic nature of these&#xD;
      infections, examination of ascites with neutrophil count (ANC) and bacteriological cultures&#xD;
      still recommended during any puncture, which increases support. This is why clinicians are&#xD;
      sensitive to processes that simplify the diagnosis of ISLA or make it faster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of calprotectin in ascites could be of major interest for the rapid diagnosis&#xD;
      of ISLA. It is a glycoprotein of 36 KDa fixing calcium and zinc, synthesized by neutrophils&#xD;
      (where it represents 60% of the soluble proteins from the cytosol) as well as monocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages in the lower concentration. It has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal,&#xD;
      immunomodulatory and pro-apoptotic. Its synthesis is increased in case of inflammation and&#xD;
      its rate reflects, in inflammatory bowel disease, the severity of the inflammation of the&#xD;
      bowel wall. Fecal calprotectin allows to discriminate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)&#xD;
      functional impairment of the gastrointestinal tract (irritable bowel syndrome) in symptomatic&#xD;
      patients and also seems more powerful than other non-specific markers of inflammation (CRP,&#xD;
      sedimentation rate, leukocytosis) to make this distinction; again, this biological marker&#xD;
      allows therapeutic monitoring for patients with IBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference technique proposed by the laboratory for assaying BÜHLMANN calprotectin is a&#xD;
      quantitative ELISA in a stool sample or ascites but the Quantum Blue® Reader offers a faster&#xD;
      quantitative measure (in 12 minutes). It consists of a sandwich immunoassay including the&#xD;
      speed could be advantageously used for the diagnosis of ISLA. However, few studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the assay of plasma calprotectin or in ascites in cirrhotic patients. A high plasma&#xD;
      concentration of calprotectin could have a prognostic value in alcoholic cirrhosis, as a high&#xD;
      concentration of calprotectin in ascites in decompensated cirrhosis.&#xD;
