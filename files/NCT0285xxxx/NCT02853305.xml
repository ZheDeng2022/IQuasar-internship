  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (pembro,&#xD;
      MK-3475) with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy&#xD;
      alone with respect to Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in all&#xD;
      participants, and that pembrolizumab alone is superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to&#xD;
      OS in all participants and in participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)&#xD;
      positive tumors (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥10%).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As specified by the protocol, the study hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing the pembro&#xD;
      combo arm or pembro arm separately to the chemo arm.&#xD;

    <measure>Pembro Combo vs Chemo: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 42 months (through Primary Analysis cut-off date of 29-Apr-2020)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study.&#xD;
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the chemo arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants). PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro combo arm and chemo arm. Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between all participants of the pembro arm and chemo arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma were recruited to examine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembro combo) versus pembrolizumab alone (pembro) or chemotherapy alone (chemo).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>1,010 participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, pembrolizumab alone, and chemotherapy alone. Two participants randomized to pembrolizumab alone were treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in error, therefore the Treated population included 349 participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 302 participants in the pembrolizumab alone group.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pembro Combo vs Chemo: Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Response Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study.&#xD;
Per protocol, PFS in the pembro combo arm was compared to the chemo arm as a pre-specified primary analysis of the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population (all randomized participants). PFS is reported here for all participants in the pembro combo arm and chemo arm. Per protocol, PFS was compared separately between all participants of the pembro arm and chemo arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE)</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an AE.

        <title>Pembro Combo vs Chemo: Disease Control Rate (DCR) Using RECIST 1.1 as Assessed by BICR</title>
        <description>DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a confirmed CR (disappearance of all target lesions), PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions), or Stable Disease (SD: neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD [at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD]). Per protocol, DCR in the pembro combo arm was compared to the chemo arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population. The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR was reported as the DCR for all participants in the pembro combo arm and chemo arm. Per protocol, DCR was compared separately between participants of the pembro arm and chemo arm and is presented later in the record.</description>

DOR for participants who had not progressed or died at the time of analysis was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. DOR is reported here for all participants in the pembro arm and chemo arm who had CR or PR. Per protocol, DOR was assessed separately in responders of the pembro combo arm and chemo arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

The percentage of participants who experienced a confirmed CR, PR, or SD according to RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR was reported as the DCR for all participants in the pembro arm and chemo arm. Per protocol, DCR was compared separately between participants of the pembro combo arm and chemo arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per RECIST 1.1, PD was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum had to demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. The sponsor allowed a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ on this study. Per protocol, PFS was compared between arms as a pre-specified secondary analysis of the ITT population (all randomized participants). PFS is reported here for all participants at 6 months based on the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method for censored data.</description>

        <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the Global Health Status (GHS) question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the Quality of Life (QoL) question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of the pembro combo arm and the chemo arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. As specified by the protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of the pembro arm and chemo arm and is presented later in the record.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 18</time_frame>
        <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to the pembro combo arm and chemo arm who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who completed at least 1 EORTC-QLQ-C30 assessment were included in the analysis. Per protocol, the pembro arm was compared to the chemo arm separately and is not included in this analysis.</population>

          <description>The EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. Participant responses to the Global Health Status (GHS) question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the Quality of Life (QoL) question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Using linear transformation, raw scores were standardized so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. Per protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared between all participants of the pembro combo arm and the chemo arm as a pre-specified secondary analysis. As specified by the protocol, change from baseline to Week 18 in the GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between all participants of the pembro arm and chemo arm and is presented later in the record.</description>
          <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to the pembro combo arm and chemo arm who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who completed at least 1 EORTC-QLQ-C30 assessment were included in the analysis. Per protocol, the pembro arm was compared to the chemo arm separately and is not included in this analysis.</population>

        <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the QoL question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. TTD in GHS/QoL was defined as the time from first dose date to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline in GHS/QoL combined score without confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared between the pembro combo arm and chemo arm.

          <description>EORTC-QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the QoL of cancer patients. Participant responses to the GHS question &quot;How would you rate your overall health during the past week?&quot; (Item 29) and the QoL question &quot;How would you rate your overall quality of life during the past week?&quot; (Item 30) were scored on a 7-point scale (1=Very Poor to 7=Excellent). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better overall outcome. TTD in GHS/QoL was defined as the time from first dose date to the first onset of a ≥10 point decrease from baseline in GHS/QoL combined score without confirmation. Per protocol, TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared between the pembro arm and chemo arm. TTD in GHS/QoL combined score was compared separately between the pembro combo arm and chemo arm and is presented earlier in the record.</description>
          <population>All participants in the ITT population randomized to the pembro arm and chemo arm who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who had an EORTC-QLQ-C30 assessment at baseline were included in the analysis. Per protocol, the pembro combo arm was compared to the chemo arm separately and is not included in this analysis.</population>

      <desc>All-Cause Mortality table includes all randomized participants reported by treatment received. Two participants randomized to pembrolizumab were treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy in error, thus there were 353 in pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm and 305 in the pembrolizumab arm. Serious and Other AEs include all treated participants. Per protocol, MedDRA preferred terms &quot;Neoplasm progression&quot;, &quot;Malignant neoplasm progression&quot; and &quot;Disease progression&quot; unrelated to drug excluded as AEs.</desc>
