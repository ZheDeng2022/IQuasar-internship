      In this study, 100 persons with Multiple Sclerosis and 50 matched controls will be examined&#xD;
      with magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cognitive tests. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis for the study is: Interhemispheric connectivity, determined using graph&#xD;
      theoretic analysis (GTA) on source-reconstructed MEG data, is a biomarker for cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration in MS, which has value at the individual patient level.&#xD;

      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease type (Progressive onset/Relapsing onset)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease phase (onset, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive, …)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EDSS measurement (standard in the neurological examination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time since last relapse (important for the exclusion criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-morbid Intelligence Quotient (IQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the final design of this study, the investigators will screen our patient group using&#xD;
           the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), a fast (5 min) and easy test that has been&#xD;
           shown to be predictive of general cognitive impairment in MS probably due to the&#xD;
           importance of information processing speed in cognitive deterioration in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This screening procedure will allow us to include an 'enriched' sample of MS patients;&#xD;
           i.e. including patients with different cognitive abilities will allow us to assess&#xD;
           correlations between brain network organization and cognition over a broader range of&#xD;
           cognitive abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEG/EEG assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects are asked to come to the MEG unit in the Université libre de Bruxelles&#xD;
           (ULB) Erasmus Hospital in Anderlecht&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEG measurements will be obtained using a Neuromag-306 Vector View system (Elekta). This&#xD;
           scanner has 306 channels: 102 pairs of orthogonal planar gradiometers and 102&#xD;
           magnetometers. To aid artifact detection, electrooculograms (EOG) and electrocardiograms&#xD;
           (ECG) were also recorded. Sampling frequency is 1000 Hertz (HZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be monitored for excessive eye-blinks. Although methods as independent&#xD;
           component analysis (ICA) can remove these artefacts to some extent, too many eye-blinks&#xD;
           may render the subsequent analyses impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preparing the subject for the MEG assessment takes about 45 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient's head movement will be continuously monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting-state&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eyes Open&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 10 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects will be asked to pay attention to a fixation cross&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eyes Closed&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 10 min&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects will be asked not to fall asleep&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjusted SDMT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In this experiment, the patients are shown a code that links the numbers 1-9 to a&#xD;
           certain symbol. For each trial, they also see one example that links a number to a&#xD;
           symbol and they are asked to press the LEFT button if they think the example conforms&#xD;
           with the presented code and the RIGHT button if they think otherwise. Subjects will be&#xD;
           given a maximum of 6 s for each decision to be made and response timings will be&#xD;
           recorded. The code that is presented varies with every example. This computerized set up&#xD;
           of the SDMT was kindly provided by prof. Rypma. There is a pause of 2s between every&#xD;
           decoding task. A total of 256 stimuli are presented, half of which are correct. The&#xD;
           design follows the design by Leavitt et al. very closely (except for variable the&#xD;
           interstimulus interval- 4,8,12 s - that was fixed to 3s in this design. Depending on the&#xD;
           speed at which the subjects answers, this paradigm is expected to last between 9 and 10&#xD;
           min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practice trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. The subjects are shown 10 trials and their response is monitored. In this step, the&#xD;
           researcher checks if the subject understands the paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actual paradigm&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The patients will be shown 256 trials, 50 % of which are correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The total time for this experiment (at a speed of 2s per decision is : 9 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. The subjects won't receive any feedback from this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A small break of 10 minutes in order not to fatigue the subjects too much.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Auditory P300 paradigm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects are asked to press a button when they hear a high-pitched tone among a&#xD;
           series of standard tones. The interstimulus interval will randomly shift between 1 and&#xD;
           1.5 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Practice trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subjects will first hear the standard tone 10 times (1000 Hz)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects will hear the target (high-pitched, 1500 Hz) tone 2 times&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Subjects will hear the distractor tone (500 Hz) 2 times&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The interstimulus interval will be sampled from the same distribution as the&#xD;
                interstimulus interval used in the actual test&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients are not asked to press any buttons in this part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actual test&#xD;
&#xD;
           1. The subjects will hear a series of 400 tones. The total test time is therefore 8m20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  80 % of the tones will be frequent tones&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 % of the tones will be target tones, for which the subjects are asked to press a&#xD;
           button&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 % of the tones will be distractor tones. Subjects are asked not to press any button&#xD;
           in case of these distractor tones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects won't get any feedback on their performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N-back test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the N-back test, a subjects sees a series of numbers (1-4) and is asked to compare&#xD;
           the current stimulus to the N'th previous stimulus. In the case of a zero-back&#xD;
           experiment, the subjects are asked to press a button when they see a certain number&#xD;
           (e.g. 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The experiment is designed as follows. There are three conditions imposing different&#xD;
           loads on working memory (0-,1- and 2-back tasks). Each block lasts 30 s and there are&#xD;
           eight blocks for each condition. The total registration time is therefore 12 min. The&#xD;
           experiment is designed in agreement with the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the actual experiment, there will be a small practice trial including the three&#xD;
           blocks (0-, 1- and 2-back task). This lasts approximately 2 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Possible confounders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. These confounders are to be administered right after the MEG recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. These confounders are important as they may influence the cognitive results&#xD;
                obtained during the MEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression (Beck Depression Inventory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue (Fatigue scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions, FSMC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (2) MRI assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The informed consent asks for permission to analyse the T1 and T2 image, two images&#xD;
           included in the standard clinical protocol, in the data analysis for the study.&#xD;
           Furthermore, we will acquire and analyse a diffusor tensor imaging (DTI) measurement and&#xD;
           a resting-state functional MRI image.&#xD;
