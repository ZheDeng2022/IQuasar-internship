  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis can affect organs other than the lungs. Liver disease affects about 30% of&#xD;
      patients: its main manifestation is the development of portal hypertension (PHT). The&#xD;
      pathophysiology of this comorbidity is still poorly understood. It was previously considered&#xD;
      secondary to the formation of biliary cirrhosis but another hypothesis would be that of a&#xD;
      primitive pathology of venous vessels may cause the gradual emergence of portal hypertension&#xD;
      without cirrhosis. Evidence indiscutly suggest that cystic fibrosis is associated with a&#xD;
      specific endothelial dysfunction, especially as the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane&#xD;
      conductance Regulator) protein is expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that liver disease related to PHT-associated cystic fibrosis is&#xD;
      associated with systemic endothelial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate a systemic endothelial dysfunction in patients with cystic fibrosis when&#xD;
      associated with PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the correlations between measures of systemic endothelial function and serum markers&#xD;
      of endothelial dysfunction and between measures of liver stiffness and systemic endothelial&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

      Prospective , monocentric study, with four groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with cystic fibrosis and PHT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystic fibrosis patients without PHT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients free from cystic fibrosis with PHT from other causes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy controls. One study visit, no follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit the following examinations will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of a blood sample of 21 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver eElastography achieved through hardware FibroScan® -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of endothelial function with Endopat®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contrast-enhanced tomography. Abdominal CT scan will not be performed in healthy&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;

    <measure>Endothelial systemic function measured by EndoPAT®</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the systemic endothelial function between the four study groups, the arterial tone index is measured by EndoPAT®.&#xD;
The EndoPAT® is the leading medical device for noninvasive endothelial function assessment. It quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in vascular tone, elicited by a 5-minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard blood pressure cuff). When the cuff is released, the surge of blood flow causes an endothelium-dependent. Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD). The dilatation, manifested as Reactive Hyperemia, is captured by EndoPAT® as an increase in the PAT Signal amplitude. A post-occlusion to pre-occlusion ratio is calculated by the EndoPAT® software, providing the arterial tone index.</description>

    <measure>Serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction (tPA, thrombomodulin, Willebrandt factor, PAI1)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sample (21 ml) is collected from each patients to dose the markers of endothelial dysfunction (tPA, thrombomodulin, Willebrandt factor, PAI1).&#xD;
The objective is to compare for the 4 groups the relations between:&#xD;
the serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction and peripheral endothelial function;&#xD;
And the serum levels of markers of endothelial dysfunction and the presence of portal hypertension (HTP).</description>

    <measure>Endogline/Syndecan-4 ratio measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sample (21 ml) is collected from each patients to measure the blood levels of endoglin and syndecan.&#xD;
Endoglin and syndecan-4 are transmembrane glycoproteins present on endothelial cells.&#xD;
The objective is to compare for the 4 group the relation between :&#xD;
endoglin/syndecan-4 ratio and peripheral endothelial function;&#xD;
and, endoglin/syndecan-4 ratio and presence of HTP.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measurement of hepatic elasticity by Fibroscan®</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The objective is to compare for the 4 groups the relations between hepatic elasticity and endothelial systemic function.&#xD;
The Fibroscan measures the velocity of the sound wave passing through the liver from the device and then converts that measurement into a liver elasticity measurement. The result reveals the health of the liver: more the liver is hard, more his state is pathologic.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatic abnormalities observed on injected abdominal CT.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>All hepatic abnormalities observed on injected abdominal CT for groups A, B and C are analyzed.&#xD;
The objective is to compare the hepatic radiologic abnormalities associated with HTP in cystic fibrosis with hepatic radiologic abnormalities associated with HTP from other causes.</description>
