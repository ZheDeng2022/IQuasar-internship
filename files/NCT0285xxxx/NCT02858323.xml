      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets are blood cells that help blood clot. Some people have what is called&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia. This means they have a low blood platelet count. They need platelet&#xD;
      transfusions very often. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization occurs for a lot of&#xD;
      these people. They become refractory. This means their platelet levels no longer increase&#xD;
      after transfusions. Researchers want to study a procedure that detects HLA antibodies. They&#xD;
      want to test how well it predicts how a person will respond to a transfusion. They want to&#xD;
      see if it does this better than the procedure that is usually used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of C1q-binding of Class I HLA antibodies on platelet refractoriness in&#xD;
      people who get platelet transfusions. To test if this method better predicts response to&#xD;
      platelet transfusion than the IgG solid phase immunoassay method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People enrolled on protocols 11-C-0136, 08-H-0156, 03-C-0277, 01-C-0157, or 01-C-0129 who:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agreed to have their specimens and data used for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had Class I HLA antibodies detected by the IgG method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Had one or more platelet transfusions at NIH after the first positive HLA IgG antibody result&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, researchers will look at a small portion of their archived plasma&#xD;
      sample. The samples were left over from prior HLA antibody tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants samples will be analyzed. They will be tested to see if C1q-binding HLA&#xD;
      antibodies are present. This will be done by solid phase immunoassay. Results will be&#xD;
      compared with the past results of the IgG method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants data will be stored in database that s protected by password.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization is common in patients undergoing frequent&#xD;
      platelet transfusion, and is the most important cause of immune platelet refractoriness.&#xD;
      Management strategies in HLA alloimmune platelet-refractory patients include transfusion with&#xD;
      HLA-matched or crossmatched platelets; however, in broadly-sensitized patients, or in&#xD;
      patients with uncommon HLA types, antigen-negative or epitope compatible donors may be&#xD;
      difficult to find.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Luminex immunoglobulin (Ig)G single-antigen-bead (SAB) solid phase immunoassay is now&#xD;
      commonly used to detect HLA antibodies. However, an assay that specifically detects&#xD;
      C1qbinding to HLA antibodies has been reported to identify a clinically relevant subset of&#xD;
      HLA antibodies in solid organ transplantation; one group has studied the utility of this&#xD;
      assay in platelet transfusion of HLA-alloimmunized platelet refractory patients. We intend to&#xD;
      evaluate the ability of this C1-binding immunoassay to predict response to platelet&#xD;
      transfusion in HLA alloimmune patients.&#xD;
