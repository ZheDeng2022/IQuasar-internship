    <textblock>
      The study is designed to substantiate the efficacy of Cardiac Contractility Modulation (CCM)&#xD;
      in the heart failure population with ejection fraction ranging between 25 and 45%. The study&#xD;
      is designed in an adaptive manner to ensure proper statistical significance and power of the&#xD;
      primary efficacy evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect efficacy data in a randomized controlled setting, including New York&#xD;
      Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III Heart Failure population with baseline ejection&#xD;
      fraction (EF) of 25% to 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is previous evidence related to the beneficial effect of CCM in patients with baseline&#xD;
      ejection fraction of &lt;35%. While patients with EF between 35% and 45% were not prospectively&#xD;
      studied in the original clinical study initially conducted to support Conformité Européene&#xD;
      (CE) Marking of the OPTIMIZER System, recently available data from a randomized study that&#xD;
      included such patients show CCM to be safe and effective in this group of patients as well.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the literature supports that this population has very similar clinical&#xD;
      characteristics, in practice are treated with nearly the same medications, and have similar&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms of disease compared to patients with EF &lt;35%. CCM has been successfully&#xD;
      used also in patients with EF greater than 35% in routine use and in the FIX-HF-5 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the system is CE marked and since the population includes patients meeting the approved&#xD;
      indication as well as population that has shown to benefit from CCM (EF 35%-45%), the risk&#xD;
      involved in performing such a clinical investigation seems acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to substantiate the efficacy of CCM in heart failure patients with EFs&#xD;
      in the range of 25%-to-45% (inclusive). This is a prospective, randomized study comparing CCM&#xD;
      plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) (Treatment Group) to OMT alone (Control Group) over a 24&#xD;
      week period. The primary endpoint shall be a comparison of changes in Peak VO2, which is an&#xD;
      established objective physiological indicator of exercise capacity which is relevant in heart&#xD;
      failure device studies. To further improve the accuracy and objectivity of measurements,&#xD;
      double assessment of the Peak VO2 will be performed at each of the primary time points. Tests&#xD;
      can be performed using upright and semi-supine bicycle ergometer or using treadmill. In sites&#xD;
      where more than one option is available, bicycle ergometer is the preferred option. Treadmill&#xD;
      is only allowed in case no bicycle is available at the site. Each subject shall be&#xD;
      consistently tested using the same method throughout the study. The study is designed in an&#xD;
      adaptive manner to ensure proper statistical significance and power of the primary efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will collect additional (exploratory) efficacy data on the difference between the&#xD;
      treatment group and control group in the changes over 24 weeks in predicted survival&#xD;
      probability. To evaluate the survival probability, two established models are used: the&#xD;
      Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM), and the Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart&#xD;
      Failure (MAGGIC) model . These models use information collected at a certain time point to&#xD;
      predict survival probabilities over the following years. The information used for such&#xD;
      prediction includes status of the disease (NYHA, Left Ventricular EF (LVEF)), documented&#xD;
      medical history and co-morbidities, documented therapies and medications, and standard blood&#xD;
      tests values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, hospitalization data will be collected from medical records of the site and/or&#xD;
      from any other medical records of clinics/hospitals where the patient may have been treated&#xD;
      for a timeframe of 12 months before enrollment and until 24 weeks after the Study Start Date&#xD;
      (SSD).&#xD;
