  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain and spinal cord tumors are uncommon. But they contribute substantially to cancer deaths&#xD;
      in the U.S. in children and adults. Little progress has been made in treating brain tumors.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about these tumors by studying people who have them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand brain and spinal cord tumors better and uncover areas for further research.&#xD;
      Also, to connect people with these tumors to doctors who can help them manage their illness&#xD;
      and give them new treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an initial (baseline) visit. They will have their medical history&#xD;
      taken and undergo physical and neurological exams. They will have blood tests. They may have&#xD;
      scans (imaging studies) of the nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have urine or cerebrospinal fluid collected during their regular care,&#xD;
      researchers may save some.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain tumor tissue from a prior surgery may be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genomic DNA testing will be done on samples. Results will be linked to participants medical&#xD;
      and/or family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of study visits at NIH will depend on the wishes of participants and their local&#xD;
      doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a brain tumor survey on a computer. They can take it all at once or in&#xD;
      6 separate sections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their general well-being. They will answer questions&#xD;
      to learn if they have symptoms of depression or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will discuss test results with participants. They will recommend management and&#xD;
      treatment options.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to meet an unmet need in neuro-oncology by evaluating patients with&#xD;
      CNS tumors throughout their disease course. The protocol will evaluate patients with tumors&#xD;
      of the central nervous system (CNS) who appear to be probable candidates for future protocol&#xD;
      entry, have disease manifestations that are of unique scientific interest, importance, and/or&#xD;
      educational value, or who have understudied tumors with unknown or unclear natural history.&#xD;
      Patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing CNS cancers will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate patients with tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) who are probable&#xD;
           future candidates for NCI Phase I and II protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To follow patients with tumors of the CNS that are representative of important&#xD;
           scientific and/or clinical principles&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To follow patients with CNS tumors that are understudied or have indeterminate natural&#xD;
           history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate and follow patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing&#xD;
           CNS cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with tumors of the CNS (or a&#xD;
           history of tumors of the CNS) of interest to the NOB, who may be candidates for an NOB&#xD;
           trial at some point in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with tumors of the CNS that are of particular interest to members of the NOB&#xD;
           because they pose important clinical and/or scientific questions and/or shed light on&#xD;
           important aspects of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with known genetic syndromes at high risk of developing CNS cancers are&#xD;
           eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with rare tumors of the CNS who offer an important educational benefit to&#xD;
           neuro-oncology trainees and staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and the&#xD;
           willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will undergo an initial evaluation by a member of the NOB or by a health&#xD;
           care provider participating in the patient s care, where past medical and oncologic&#xD;
           histories will be obtained as well as relevant data such as neuroimaging and pathology&#xD;
           review. A total of 10,000 patients will be accrued to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center at varying intervals depending on the&#xD;
           clinical situation. Data related to the natural history of their disease course and&#xD;
           outcome will be collected at least every visit at the NIH Clinical Center in which&#xD;
           imaging is reviewed. Patients will be seen at a clinic visit or followed remotely at a&#xD;
           minimum of once every year.&#xD;
