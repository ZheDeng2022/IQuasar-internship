      EPIRMEX is a complementary study to the national cohort EPIPAGE 2 the INSERM Unit 953 is&#xD;
      responsible. The objective of this study is to evaluate at the age of 5 years corrected&#xD;
      executive functions in children born very prematurely in relation to structural brain&#xD;
      abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (technical conventional and advanced)&#xD;
      performed at the age of term. The current study is a project on a subset of the population of&#xD;
      premature EPIRMEX subjects who had an advanced technique as magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      (MRS). It is a recent imaging technique for a study of the cerebral metabolism. It is based&#xD;
      on the detection of cerebral metabolites, and the variations of their concentration to&#xD;
      characterize different pathologies. In most cases, combinations of metabolites are informed&#xD;
      creatine + phosphocreatine (CR), glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (CHO) +&#xD;
      Nacétylaspartate Nacetylaspartylglutamate (NAA), myoinositol (INS) and lactate (LAC). In the&#xD;
      premature newborn, the NAA / CHO ratio increases with age in all brain regions. The LAC / NAA&#xD;
      ratio decreases significantly with age in the thalamus, basal ganglia, the corticospinal&#xD;
      tract, and parietal white matter tends to decrease elsewhere . A number of studies show that&#xD;
      proton spectroscopy term can predict the long-term newborn who presented an anoxic-ischemic&#xD;
      encephalopathy .These studies indicate that an increase in lactate and a decrease in NAA are&#xD;
      correlated with abnormal neurological development. And decreases in NAA / CR and / or NAA /&#xD;
      CHO ratios are predictive of motor abnormalities in children with anoxic encephalopathy&#xD;
      presented an ischemia . These decreases were also measured in the basal ganglia, occipital&#xD;
      cortex, and areas near the last. Few studies have explored the magnetic resonance&#xD;
      spectroscopy of proton-term prediction of the future of large premature.&#xD;

      This is a prospective cohort study on a subsample of children born prematurely (before 33&#xD;
      weeks of gestation (SA) otherwise included in the national cohort EPIPAGE 2 and included in&#xD;
      epirmex and who enjoys a spectrosocpie. This research project proposed in the framework of&#xD;
      the AORC as ancillary study EPIPAGE 2 -EPIRMEX therefore focuses on spectroIRM voluntarily at&#xD;
      the age of term (39-41 SA), and more specifically the emergence executive functions to 5&#xD;
      years EPIRMEX main objective of the study. the application of our project to this tender is&#xD;
      requested by the PACA region due to the high rate spectroIRM performed by our area (about&#xD;
      75%) and strong involvement of Dr. C. Gire in EPIPAGE 2 and EPIRMEX. However, only&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments FE 5 years testing sub-cities will be funded EPIPAGE 2. The&#xD;
      specific aspect of our study is not funded EPIPAGE 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children received conventional MRI at the age of term (39-41 SA), supplemented by&#xD;
      specific sequences for single voxel analysis in microstructural analysis (white matter, basal&#xD;
      ganglia and brainstem), short echo and echo time consuming. The study of the spectra will be&#xD;
      done quantitatively by CEMEREM laboratory - UMR 6612 CNRS / Université de la Méditerranée /&#xD;
      Division of Medical Imaging (Pr Guye).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relevance of the project was its ability to include quality as 550 MRI were performed,&#xD;
      including 120 MRI spectrometer can be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These children were assessed within 2 EPIPAGE the corrected age of 2 years, 3 years (EPIRMEX)&#xD;
      and 5 years (2 + EPIPAGE EPIRMEX). The balance sheet under 5 years in EPIRMEX is evaluating a&#xD;
      comprehensive intellectual efficiency WPPSI III, some elements of the NEPSY and the figure of&#xD;
      REY.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So magnetic resonance spectroscopy may provide additional diagnostic value to cranial&#xD;
      ultrasound and MRI in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the relation between the cerebral MRS at term-equivalent age&#xD;
      of very preterm infants and the executive functions at the age of 5 years corrected.&#xD;
