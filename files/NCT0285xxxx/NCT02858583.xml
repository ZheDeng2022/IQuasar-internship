      Research question In newborn infants requiring CPR, does CC superimposed by sustained&#xD;
      inflation compared to 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio improves return of spontaneous&#xD;
      circulation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall objective: CC superimposed by sustained inflation will improve short- and long-term&#xD;
      outcomes in preterm (&gt;28 weeks or older) and term newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested Primary hypothesis: By using CC superimposed by sustained inflation&#xD;
      (CC+SI) during CPR the time needed to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)&#xD;
      compared to the current 3:1 compression to ventilation (C:V) will be reduced in asphyxiated&#xD;
      newborns.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background The majority of newborn infants successfully make the transition from fetal to&#xD;
      neonatal life without any help. However, an estimated 10% of newborns need help to establish&#xD;
      effective ventilation, which remains the most critical step of neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
      Fortunately, the need for chest compression (CC) or medications in the delivery room (DR) is&#xD;
      rare. Although, only about 0.1% of term infants and up to 15% of preterm infants receive&#xD;
      these interventions, this will result in approximately 1 million newborn deaths annually&#xD;
      worldwide. A recent cohort study at a level III center with a trained resuscitation team&#xD;
      showed that only 6 per 10,000 infants received epinephrine. However, the same study showed&#xD;
      that those infants who received epinephrine during resuscitation had a high incidence of&#xD;
      mortality (41%) and short-term neurologic morbidity (57% hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and&#xD;
      seizures)4. A recent review of newborns who received prolonged CC and epinephrine but had no&#xD;
      signs of life at 10 minutes following birth noted 83% mortality, with 93% of survivors&#xD;
      suffering moderate-to-severe disability. The poor prognosis associated with receiving CC&#xD;
      alone or with medications in the DR raises questions as to whether improved cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation (CPR) methods specifically tailored to the newborn could improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inability to predict which newborns need CPR, and the infrequent use of CPR in the DR&#xD;
      have limited neonatologists' ability to perform rigorous clinical studies to determine the&#xD;
      best method for delivering CC to newborn infants. The main cause of cardiovascular collapse&#xD;
      in most newborns is asphyxia, which makes newborn infants distinctively different to the&#xD;
      adult population. The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and the American&#xD;
      Academy of Pediatrics/American Heart Association Neonatal Resuscitation Program have&#xD;
      recognize this difference, however the guidelines almost exclusively rely on data from&#xD;
      studies in the adult population or animal studies. Such data may not be wholly applicable to&#xD;
      the neonatal population because the most common cause of cardiovascular collapse in the adult&#xD;
      is ventricular fibrillation, not asphyxia. Thus, further studies are needed to determine the&#xD;
      optimal method for improving hemodynamics and recovery during neonatal resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question In newborn infants (preterm infants &gt;28 weeks' gestation and term infants)&#xD;
      requiring CPR, does CC during sustained inflation compared to 3:1 compression to ventilation&#xD;
      ratio improves return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To prove that CC during sustained inflation will improve recovery from CPR&#xD;
      in preterm and term newborns with faster ROSC than that by 3:1 CPR technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To examine i) if CC during sustained inflation will improve short- and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes in preterm and term newborns, and ii) the value of feedback devices (e.g.&#xD;
      ECO2, ECG and/or SpO2) in determining ROSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to be tested Primary hypothesis: By using CC during sustained inflation (CC+SI)&#xD;
      during CPR the time needed to achieve ROSC compared to the current 3:1 compression to&#xD;
      ventilation (C:V) ratio will be reduced in asphyxiated newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses: The benefits associated with CC+SI will i) decrease death; ii) improve&#xD;
      short- and long-term outcomes in preterm and term newborns; and iii) feedback devices help to&#xD;
      determine ROSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Ethics This multi-center cluster randomized clinical trial will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the appropriate Research Ethics Office at all participating sites. We will request a deferred&#xD;
      consent model at all sites (see parental consent paragraph for details). Written consent will&#xD;
      be sought from the parents of these infants as soon as possible after the birth so that&#xD;
      acquired data could be utilized for research35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria All infants (term or preterm infants &gt;28 weeks' gestation) requiring CC in&#xD;
      the delivery room will be eligible for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Infants will be excluded if they have a congenital abnormality or&#xD;
      condition that might have an adverse effect on breathing or ventilation (e.g. congenital&#xD;
      diaphragmatic hernia), or congenital heart disease requiring intervention in the neonatal&#xD;
      period. Infants will be also excluded if their parents refuse to give consent to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization At the beginning of the trial participating sites will be randomized. Centers&#xD;
      will be equally allocated to either CC+SI group (&quot;intervention group&quot;) or 3:1 C:V group&#xD;
      (&quot;control group&quot;) for the first year. For the second year, after a wash out period of 2&#xD;
      months, centers in the intervention group will be changed to control and vice versa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Power calculation Our primary outcome measure will be time to achieve ROSC.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the time to achieve ROSC will be reduced in the &quot;CC+SI group&quot;. A sample&#xD;
      size of 208 infants, 104 in each group, would be sufficient to detect a clinically important&#xD;
      33% reduction in time to achieve ROSC using Cox proportional hazards regression with 80%&#xD;
      power and a 2-tailed alpha error of 0.05. This 33% reduction represents 282 sec versus 420&#xD;
      sec of CC (based on the database of 30 term infants requiring CC in 2014 and 2015 at the&#xD;
      Royal Alexandra Hospital, Edmonton). To account for cluster randomization, the sample size is&#xD;
      multiplied by design effect of 1.045, so the total sample size is 218 infants, 109 in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding There will be no blinding during the recruitment phase. Each hospital is allocated&#xD;
      to one treatment arm and therefore the CC technique used at each particular site is known to&#xD;
      the clinical team. The outcome assessor will be unaware of the group allocation. This&#xD;
      blinding will be maintained until the data is locked for the final analysis and un-blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique of Resuscitation Infants will only be eligible and randomized if they require chest&#xD;
      compressions. The methods described below also describe resuscitation interventions for&#xD;
      infants prior to the start of chest compressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of general interventions Term infants The initial steps of the resuscitation will&#xD;
      be according to the current neonatal resuscitation guidelines1. Delayed cord clamping should&#xD;
      be performed as per local hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline) at&#xD;
      participating sites where eligible. Afterwards, dry and stimulate the infant, and open the&#xD;
      airway. If heart rate is &lt;100/min, the infant is gasping or has apnea, start positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation. At the same time consider attaching a pulse oximeter and also consider&#xD;
      applying electrocardiography. If heart rate remains &lt;100/min, perform MR. SOPA (Mask is&#xD;
      tightly applied to the face, Re-position the head into the &quot;sniffing&quot; orientation, Suction&#xD;
      the nares and the pharynx, Open the mouth, Pressure of PPV can be increased to a max of 40 cm&#xD;
      H2O, Alternate airway (endotracheal tube or Laryngeal Mask Airway). If heart rate is &lt;60/min&#xD;
      or remains &lt;60 despite all steps of MR. SOPA including alternate airway, start chest&#xD;
      compressions and increase to 100% oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants The initial steps of the resuscitation will be according to the current&#xD;
      neonatal resuscitation guidelines1. Delayed cord clamping should be performed as per local&#xD;
      hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline) at participating sites where eligible.&#xD;
      Immediately afterwards, preterm infants (according to local hospital policy - standard&#xD;
      hospital practice guideline) will be either placed (without drying) in a polyethylene bag&#xD;
      under radiant heat44 or dried and placed under radiant heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pulse oximeter will be used to monitor oxygen saturation immediately after birth and oxygen&#xD;
      delivery will be guided by published norm values for oxygen saturation in preterm infants45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If heart rate is &lt;100/min, the infant is gasping or has apnea, start positive pressure&#xD;
      ventilation. Also consider applying electrocardiography at that time. If heart rate remains&#xD;
      &lt;100/min, perform MR. SOPA (Mask is tightly applied to the face, Re-position the head into&#xD;
      the &quot;sniffing&quot; orientation, Suction the nares and the pharynx, Open the mouth, Pressure of&#xD;
      PPV can be increased to a max of 40 cm H2O, Alternate airway (endotracheal tube or Laryngeal&#xD;
      Mask Airway). If heart rate is &lt;60/min or remains &lt;60 despite all steps of MR. SOPA start&#xD;
      chest compression and increase to 100% oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mask Ventilation The clinical team will determine if an infant requires mask ventilation. If&#xD;
      mask ventilation is required, it should be provided with a T-Piece device (e.g. Fisher &amp;&#xD;
      Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand or Giraffe Warmer, GE Health Care, Burnaby, BC, Canada), and&#xD;
      appropriate face mask with default settings for peak inflation pressure (PIP) of 25 cmH2O, a&#xD;
      peep expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, and a gas flow rate of 8-10L/min using a&#xD;
      ventilation rate of 40-60 inflations/min. Initial respiratory support can include initial&#xD;
      sustained inflations (instead of positive pressure ventilation alone) as per local hospital&#xD;
      policy (standard hospital practice guideline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation If heart rate is &lt;60/min or remains &lt;60/min despite all steps&#xD;
      of MR. SOPA start chest compressions. Prior to the start of CC intubation should be&#xD;
      considered. However, in cases of intubation failure it is possible to start CC during mask&#xD;
      ventilation. Compressions will be performed using the 2-thumb encircling technique as&#xD;
      recommended by current resuscitation guidelines46. Epinephrine will be administered according&#xD;
      to current resuscitation guidelines either via umbilical vein catheter (0.01 mg/kg per dose -&#xD;
      first line) or via endotracheal tube (0.05 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg) or every three to five minutes&#xD;
      as needed44. Chest compressions and epinephrine will be continued until ROSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of ROSC ROSC will defined as an increase in heart rate &gt;60/min for 60sec&#xD;
      determined by auscultation of the heart. Return of spontaneous circulation will be assessed&#xD;
      after 60sec of a heart rate of &gt;60/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current neonatal resuscitation guidelines do not recommend feedback devices (e.g. exhaled&#xD;
      carbon dioxide (ECO2) monitors, electrocardiography (ECG), or pulse oximetry for detection of&#xD;
      ROSC1. A secondary objective of the study will be to examine if either feedback device ECO2,&#xD;
      ECG or pulse oximetry can be used for detection of ROSC. Participating centres (e.g.&#xD;
      Edmonton, Graz, Winnipeg, Ulm, San Diego) are using either ECO2 monitors, ECG, and/or pulse&#xD;
      oximetry routinely during neonatal resuscitation35,47-49.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions &quot;3:1 C:V group&quot; If the PIP has been increased &gt;30 cm H2O during MR.SOPA, the&#xD;
      PIP should be decreased to 30 cmH2O prior start of chest compression. Infants randomized into&#xD;
      the &quot;3:1 C:V group&quot; will receive CC at a rate of 90/min and ventilations at a rate of 30 /min&#xD;
      in a 3:1 C:V ratio as recommended by the current resuscitation guidelines1 (study flow&#xD;
      diagram). During CC, the inflations should be delivered using a PIP of 25-30 cmH2O (As per&#xD;
      local hospital policy /standard hospital practice guideline). Heart rate should be&#xD;
      reevaluated every 60sec according to current neonatal resuscitation guidelines1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;CC+SI group&quot; If the PIP has been increased &gt;30 cm H2O during MR.SOPA, the PIP should be&#xD;
      decreased to 30 cmH2O prior start of chest compression. Infants randomized into the &quot;CC+SI&#xD;
      group&quot; will receive a SI with a PIP 25-30 cmH2O while receiving CC. CC will be performed at a&#xD;
      rate of 90/min. The SI will be delivered over a period of 20 seconds. This will be followed&#xD;
      by PEEP of 5-8 cm water as per local hospital policy (standard hospital practice guideline)&#xD;
      for one second. Then the next SI for 20sec is started while CCs are continued. Again after&#xD;
      20sec there will be a 1sec pause with PEEP, which will be followed by another SI for 20sec&#xD;
      with continuous CC. After 3x20sec SI+CC (total of 60sec) an assessment of heart rate should&#xD;
      be performed. If heart rate is &gt;60/min continue with standard care as per local hospital&#xD;
      policy (standard hospital practice guideline). If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with&#xD;
      CC+SI for another 60sec (3x20sec SI+CC (total of 60sec) at which time a further assessment&#xD;
      should be performed. If heart rate remains &lt;60/min continue with CC+SI. If CPR is ongoing for&#xD;
      5 minutes using SI+CC, the clinical team must convert to the standard method of care using&#xD;
      3:1 C:V ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuing Resuscitation Deciding how long resuscitative efforts should continue in any of&#xD;
      the study infants will be solely at the discretion of the clinical team in accordance with&#xD;
      the current neonatal resuscitation guidelines1 and per local hospital policy (standard&#xD;
      hospital practice guideline) at every participating site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18-24 months follow-up SI+CC might result in improved pCO2 during CPR. A more favourable pCO2&#xD;
      might be neuro-protective, and we hypothesize that SI+CC infants will have a better&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome compared to infants randomized to 3:1 C:V. Most infants who&#xD;
      receive chest compressions are routinely assessed for neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-24&#xD;
      months of age in the outpatient clinic in the study hospital. A Bayley III assessment&#xD;
      (reference) will be performed by a psychologist or other professional with the relevant&#xD;
      competence at the study site. This participant data will be collected at the 18-24 month&#xD;
      follow up visit if this is part of routine care; it is not mandatory to collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome Time to achieve ROSC is defined as a heart rate of &gt;60/min&#xD;
      for 60sec determined by auscultation of the heart. Return of spontaneous circulation will be&#xD;
      assessed after 60sec of a heart rate of &gt;60/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes amongst others will include neonatal mortality&#xD;
      (Neonatal death &lt;28 days) and morbidities, for example, rates of brain injury (reported&#xD;
      either via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or head ultrasound), changes in regional cerebral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring started in the DR and&#xD;
      discontinued when clinical stabilization is achieved, results of amplitude-integrated&#xD;
      electroencephalograpy (aEEG) monitoring until normalization of background patterns and&#xD;
      occurrence of sleep-wake cycling, DR interventions (including the use of epinephrine),&#xD;
      admission temperature, use of therapeutic cooling, mechanical ventilation, pneumothorax, use&#xD;
      of inotropes, infection/sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhages, necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity and long-term neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      outcomes. We will also assess the value of ECO2, ECG and/or SpO2 in determining ROSC as&#xD;
      described previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome assessment tools Mortality: All causes of mortality will be recorded. Cerebral injury&#xD;
      will be assessed with either cerebral ultrasound or cerebral MRI if performed prior to&#xD;
      discharge. If an infant dies prior to any neuro-imaging, a request for autopsy should be&#xD;
      made. Autopsy could include imaging alone or full autopsy. Morbidity: Case history until&#xD;
      discharge or term age (for preterm infants). Secondary outcome parameters: Case history and&#xD;
      output from feedback devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with the Protocol The clinical investigation will be conducted in compliance with&#xD;
      this protocol. Modifications to the protocol will not be implemented without agreement from&#xD;
      the Principal Investigators and relevant ethics committee approval are obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are not allowed to deviate from the protocol except as specified above. Any&#xD;
      major or safety related deviations will be recorded, analyzed and the ethics committees&#xD;
      notified. If an investigator refuses to comply with the protocol he/she will be disqualified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Infants will be recruited over a period of 26 months. Approximately another&#xD;
      six months will be required to collect hospital data on all infants enrolled. Resuscitation&#xD;
      data will be collected on a standard form (Neonatal Resuscitation Record) that will form part&#xD;
      of each infant's hospital record. The Neonatal Resuscitation Record should be completed by&#xD;
      the clinical team attending the resuscitation. Other medical data on each infant will be&#xD;
      collected on an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). The eCRF will be designed in&#xD;
      collaboration with Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta,&#xD;
      Edmonton, Canada. Data will be entered into REDCap database from each site within one week&#xD;
      after discharge or death of an infant. Long-term follow-up will be entered within two weeks&#xD;
      after examination. All information entered into REDCap database will be used for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The Clinical Research Informatics Core and Biostatistics Core of the Women and&#xD;
      Children's Health Research Institute, at the University of Alberta, will do data management&#xD;
      and analysis. Additional information about the storage, management and analysis of study data&#xD;
      is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Ver. 24 (IBM Corp.) and SAS version 9.4&#xD;
      (SAS Institute Inc.) or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis Interim safety analysis will be performed at 10%, 25% and 50% of enrolment&#xD;
      to review the primary outcome, ROSC, and severe adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, three interim analyses will be performed at 22 patients (11 patients per group), 54 (27&#xD;
      patients per group), and 110 (55 patients per group) to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention. At each interim analysis posterior probability of SI+CC arm to reduce time to&#xD;
      ROSC by 10% or more compared to the control arm will be calculated. If this probability is&#xD;
      less than 0.5, the trial will be stopped for futility. If the posterior probability is&#xD;
      greater than 0.98, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board will consider the trial to be stopped&#xD;
      for superiority. Since no statistical tests will be performed at interim analyses, type I&#xD;
      error (alpha) does not need adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Analysis Primary Analysis The primary outcome is the time to achieve ROSC defined as a&#xD;
      heart rate of &gt;60/min for 60sec. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to treat basis and&#xD;
      will include all randomized participants. A per protocol analysis will also be conducted&#xD;
      using the data from the actual allocation of participating infants. A survival analysis will&#xD;
      be used to analyze the difference in time to ROSC between intervention and control groups. To&#xD;
      account for cluster randomization, Cox proportional hazards regression with time to ROSC as&#xD;
      an outcome and allocation group as an independent variable will be created. Centers will be&#xD;
      entered as clusters in the model and the statistical significance of the allocation group&#xD;
      variable will be evaluated. The analysis will be 2-sided and p-value &lt; 0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Analysis The data will be presented as mean (standard deviation, SD) for normally&#xD;
      distributed continuous variables and median (interquartile range, IQR) when the distribution&#xD;
      is skewed. The clinical characteristics and outcome parameters will be compared using&#xD;
      Student's t-test for parametric and Mann-Whitney U-test for nonparametric comparisons of&#xD;
      continuous variables, and χ2 for categorical variables. All p-values will be 2-sided and p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of safety Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Infants who require CPR in the DR are&#xD;
      a very seriously ill patient group. Most adverse events may be of a serious nature with or&#xD;
      without the SURV1VE-trial intervention, and both intervention groups are expected to have a&#xD;
      very high proportion of serious adverse events (SAEs). Serious adverse events to be recorded&#xD;
      are therefore mortality within the DR (e.g. did not achieve ROSC or did achieve ROSC but care&#xD;
      was withdrawn), and within the NICU (any mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected adverse events Adverse events we expect to be related to the application of the&#xD;
      treatment guideline include: No ROSC leading to death, accidental displacement of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube or extubation, accidental displacement of venous or arterial catheters, use&#xD;
      of Nitric Oxide for pulmonary hypertension, sepsis, pneumothorax, and intraventricular&#xD;
      hemorrhage (grades 1-4)52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Safety Monitoring Board A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the&#xD;
      study to: (1) protect all study patients, (2) safeguard the interests of all study patients,&#xD;
      (3) monitor the overall conduct of the trial, (4) advise the investigators in order to&#xD;
      protect the integrity of the trial, and (5) supervise the conduct and analysis of all interim&#xD;
      analyses. To its end the DSMB will receive regular reports from the trial on any injuries or&#xD;
      adverse events, any developments that jeopardize the continued success of the trial, and data&#xD;
      by which to accomplish the evaluation of pre-determined early stopping rules. Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Events to be reported (mortality) will be sent within 72 hours to the DSMB; reports of&#xD;
      other/less serious adverse events and recruitment will be sent monthly; demographics and&#xD;
      adverse events (including pneumothorax, and intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 or higher&#xD;
      according to Papile52) will be included with the interim and final safety and efficacy&#xD;
      analyses. The DSMB will perform interim safety analysis at 10%, 25% and 50% of enrolment to&#xD;
      review the primary outcome of ROSC, and SAEs. At the discretion of the DSMB further interim&#xD;
      analyses can be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the DSMB are Myra Wyckoff (current Chair of the International Liaison Committee on&#xD;
      Resuscitation (ILCOR), Neil Finer (Professor Emeritus, University of California San Diego),&#xD;
      and Maryna Yaskina (Statistician, Biostatistics Unit, Women and Children's Health Research&#xD;
      Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada).&#xD;

      investigator and the ethics committees can make decisions about trial discontinuation. If the&#xD;
      trial is terminated or suspended the parents of all trial participants will be informed and&#xD;
      appropriate follow-up will be assured. If sponsor/principal investigator terminates or&#xD;
      suspends the trial the relevant ethics committees will be provided with a detailed written&#xD;
      explanation of the termination or suspension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor/principal investigator can, upon completion of the analysis of the reason(s) for&#xD;
      a suspension, decide to lift the suspension when the necessary corrective actions have been&#xD;
      implemented. The investigators and ethics committees will be notified and provided with the&#xD;
      relevant data supporting the decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DSMB will review the data at interim analyses at 10%, 25% and 50%. Predefined stopping&#xD;
      rules will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An increased mortality in the SI+CC group by 25% compared to the 3:1 C:V group at the&#xD;
           predefined interim analysis at 10%, 25% and 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase in rate of morbidities including pneumothorax, intraventricular hemorrhage or&#xD;
           the combination, in the SI+CC group by 25% compared to the 3:1 C:V group at the&#xD;
           predefined interim analysis at 10%, 25% and 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Bayesian posterior probability of SI+CC group being better than the control is less than&#xD;
           0.5 or greater than 0.98. (Posterior probability of SI+CC arm to reduce time to ROSC by&#xD;
           10% or more compared to the control arm will be calculated. If this probability is less&#xD;
           than 0.5, the trial will be stopped for futility. If the posterior probability is&#xD;
           greater than 0.98, DSMB will consider the trial to be stopped for superiority. Since no&#xD;
           statistical tests will be performed at interim analyses, type I error (alpha) does not&#xD;
           need adjustment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opt-out Rule In any cases were CPR is ongoing for 5 minutes, the clinical team must convert&#xD;
      to the standard method of care using the 3:1 C:V ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations The SURV1VE-trial will be conducted in compliance with the guidelines&#xD;
      of the Declaration of Helsinki in its latest form, the International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. In case of modifications in the study&#xD;
      protocol that are not merely of a formal nature but contain changes pertinent to the study&#xD;
      participants, a renewed vote of the relevant ethics committees will be obtained. If&#xD;
      applicable, the patients (parents) will be informed in the patient information and consent&#xD;
      form about changes in the terms and conditions of the trial. The SURV1VE-trial will only&#xD;
      start the randomization of participants after approvals from the relevant ethics committees&#xD;
      have been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Data handling and archiving Source data will be registered in the&#xD;
      participant's medical records/CRF and into the eCRF. A common web-based eCRF will be devised&#xD;
      to enable a central database (Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of&#xD;
      Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). Data entry into the central database and handling of medical&#xD;
      records is the responsibility of the investigators. After the establishment of a 'clean&#xD;
      file', the database will be locked; The data will be locked after completion of patient&#xD;
      recruitment and data entry. After long-term follow-up data entry this portion of the database&#xD;
      will locked. Data will be stored for statistical analysis at the Biostatistics Unit, Women&#xD;
      and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. The trial&#xD;
      database will hereafter be kept according to the respective national laws. After the end of&#xD;
      trial, the data will be archived for 25 years according to good clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
      At each trial-site the data flow will be monitored according to the GCP principles by a&#xD;
      locally appointed external monitoring committee. After completion of statistical data&#xD;
      analysis, data will be pseudo-anonymized and stored at the University of Alberta, Edmonton,&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data protection The investigator(s) permits trial-related monitoring, audits, and regulatory&#xD;
      inspection(s) by providing direct access to the source data and other relevant documents.&#xD;
      Trial data will be handled according to regulations of the data protection agency in the&#xD;
      respective countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance The trial will be carried out in accordance with the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki in its latest form and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring The chief investigator consents to data evaluation being performed by the person&#xD;
      in charge of monitoring in accordance with the monitoring plan, in order to ensure&#xD;
      satisfactory data collection and adherence to the study protocol. Furthermore, the chief&#xD;
      investigator states that he/she is willing to cooperate with this person and shall provide&#xD;
      this person with all required information whenever necessary. This includes access to all&#xD;
      documents related to the trial, including study-relevant medical files of patients in&#xD;
      original form. The tasks of the investigator include maintenance of these patients' medical&#xD;
      files as comprehensively as possible; this includes information concerning medical history,&#xD;
      accompanying diseases, inclusion in the trial, data about visits, results of investigations,&#xD;
      dispensing of medication, and adverse events. The monitor will also be permitted to perform&#xD;
      data evaluation and draw comparisons with the relevant medical files in accordance with the&#xD;
      standard operating procedures and ICH-GCP guidelines at predetermined intervals, in order to&#xD;
      ensure adherence to the study protocol and continuous registration of data. All original&#xD;
      medical reports required as sources for the information given in the CRF or the database&#xD;
      shall be inspected. The study participants will have given their consent to such inspection&#xD;
      by signing the consent form. The person in charge of monitoring is obliged to treat all&#xD;
      information as confidential and to preserve the basic claims of the study participants in&#xD;
      respect of integrity and protection of their privacy.&#xD;
