      This study determines in people with chronic SCI the health and functional impact and user&#xD;
      acceptance and satisfaction - of a 6-month comprehensive Lifestyle Intervention; the impact&#xD;
      and user acceptance/satisfaction of a Complementary Caregiver Curriculum (CCC) on SCI&#xD;
      caregiver health and function and whether the complementary caregiver curriculum (CCC)&#xD;
      enhances health and functional benefits obtained by the SCI dyadic partner enrolled in the LI&#xD;

      The current proposal addresses the compelling problem of cardiometabolic disease risk and&#xD;
      functional decline in persons with disability from spinal cord injuries and disease (SCI/D).&#xD;
      'Obesity/overweight' addressed in this project - a major component of cardiometabolic disease&#xD;
      risk (CMD) - represents the sole chronic condition whose speed of growth and widespread&#xD;
      dispersion parallels pandemics of communicable diseases. Nearly 2/3 of Americans are&#xD;
      currently overweight or obese, with a growth rate exceeding 10% in the past decade. The&#xD;
      prevalence and impact of obesity is expected to worsen. Obesity-related health risks cross&#xD;
      all lines of gender, geographic region, socioeconomic status, race, heritage, and educational&#xD;
      level, and are strongly associated with comorbid conditions including: cardiometabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, inflammatory disease, coronary artery disease, congestive&#xD;
      heart failure, stroke, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, depression, cancer, respiratory failure,&#xD;
      disorders of coagulation, and degenerative joint disease. All of these disorders are widely&#xD;
      reported at elevated prevalence in people with physical disability (PWPD). A study based on&#xD;
      pooled data from the 1994-5 National Health Interview Survey, the 1994-5 Disability&#xD;
      Supplement, and the 1995 'Healthy People 2000' Supplement reported a 66% higher rate of&#xD;
      obesity among PWPD than the general population. A regional study reported that extreme&#xD;
      obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 40) was four times more prevalent among PWPD than those&#xD;
      without. Prevalence rates for overweight and obesity in persons with chronic SCI/D are&#xD;
      equally daunting, and range from 55% to 95.7% of the population. Numerous causes explain&#xD;
      accretion of body fat after SCI including sarcopenia leading to loss of metabolically active&#xD;
      muscle mass, reduced whole body energy expenditure, restricted choices for exercise&#xD;
      conditioning, and a hypercaloric diet. Irrespective of cause, weight gain after disability&#xD;
      brings about diminished work capacity, musculoskeletal decline, pain, accelerated&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and progressive life dissatisfaction. Overweight/obesity after&#xD;
      SCI/D is also disturbingly co-morbid with dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, and insulin&#xD;
      resistance, a 'pro-inflammatory phenotype, and risks of postprandial lipemia. Increasing body&#xD;
      mass (BM) promotes wheelchair injury and dysfunction, imposes significant burdens on&#xD;
      self-image and perceived health, and is far more difficult to reverse than obesity occurring&#xD;
      in persons without disability. Overweight in particular: a) Poses functional limitations, and&#xD;
      restricts physical activity, independence, and community integration; b) affects ease of&#xD;
      transferring, joint function, and fracture risk; and, c) compromises 'activities of daily&#xD;
      living' (ADLs) in 39% of individuals with SCI. Despite all of these risks and concerns an&#xD;
      effective solution to this problem has evaded researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders with&#xD;
      SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While an overweight body has implications for health and function of PWPD, it also has an&#xD;
      impact on their caregivers. Within the past quarter decade there has been a predictable shift&#xD;
      of many health and function related responsibilities to adjuvant providers (i.e., healthcare&#xD;
      provider extenders) -- so-called 'caregivers' - who are challenged to administer greater&#xD;
      health and functional demands of aging PWPD while they are similarly experiencing health and&#xD;
      functional 3 decline accompanying their own aging. This shifting of providers will likely&#xD;
      continue, or possibly worsen due to an uncertain future of disability coverage within a&#xD;
      tentative American health system. The investigators have already started to observe - yet not&#xD;
      fully comprehend - the many complex difficulties imposed by aging on PWPD and their&#xD;
      caregivers, and speculate how to effectively intervene on them. Unlike caregivers for persons&#xD;
      with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, caregivers of people with wheelchair&#xD;
      dependency are required to be more physically active, lift/push/roll an impaired body far&#xD;
      more often, and often assume caregiving responsibilities earlier in the life of PWPD. While&#xD;
      clinicians and researchers often focus on the person with disability, their caregiver can be&#xD;
      left out of the care plan. It is thus not surprising that pain, anxiety, and depression among&#xD;
      caregivers of PWPD is exceedingly prevalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraging evidence already suggests an important role for primary and secondary lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention (LI) in the form of weight-lessening and fitness-promoting nutrition and&#xD;
      exercise to improve health and function of people aging with disability. Comprehensive LI&#xD;
      programs of exercise, nutrition, and behavioral support for people without disabilities have&#xD;
      been designed and systematically tested in multi-center clinical trials, and have been found&#xD;
      effective in the short term for promoting weight loss and lessening conversion rates to frank&#xD;
      diabetes. The LI programs have been compared against pharmacotherapy and have actually been&#xD;
      found more effective. Programmatic modifications made for community deployment of the LI&#xD;
      plans, and testing of long-term follow-up have shown remarkable success in sustaining - or&#xD;
      even further improving - benefits obtained during initial treatment. These research findings&#xD;
      make LI programs of weight-loss promoting reconditioning exercise, nutrition, and behavioral&#xD;
      support legitimate candidates for testing in PWPD, although no studies have ever done so.&#xD;
      Moreover, the impact of these interventions on caregiver burden has never been examined,&#xD;
      although it is reasonable to conjecture that loss of body BM and improved fitness/function of&#xD;
      care-receivers would reduce global caregiver burden. Further, evidence supports lifestyle and&#xD;
      health benefits to the care-receiver when a caregiver is enrolled in a linked behavioral&#xD;
      intervention program, making the relationship of the dyadic partners in benefiting one&#xD;
      another through coordinated intervention an intriguing intervention benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To: a) address the concerning problem of overweight/obesity after SCI, b) better understand&#xD;
      its impact on health and function of persons with SCI and their caregivers, and c) intervene&#xD;
      on these hazards where inaction would forecast additional decline, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a randomized, controlled, multi-center intervention study examining persons with&#xD;
      disability from SCI and their caregivers, who will together be enrolled as dyadic partners.&#xD;
      Key questions will address whether: a) people with disability from SCI benefit from the LI&#xD;
      plan through improved health and function, b) caregivers of people with disability from SCI&#xD;
      benefit from the LI plan through their own improved health and function, c) co-participation&#xD;
      of a caregiver partner in a LI curriculum provides a cross benefit for their partner, and d)&#xD;
      benefits of clinical intervention are long-lasting with minimal supervision. The&#xD;
      investigators will use an intervention for all participants with SCI that is modeled after&#xD;
      the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) that incorporates population-appropriate exercise,&#xD;
      nutrition, and behavioral support. Caregivers (linked with their partners) will be randomized&#xD;
      to either 'behavioral support' or a 'control condition'. Clinical training will take place&#xD;
      for 6 months and then be followed by a 6-month minimally supervised extension phase. Outcomes&#xD;
      tested for participants with SCI will focus on domains of health and function reflected by&#xD;
      fitness, cardioendocrine risk and inflammatory stress; multi-dimensional function and pain;&#xD;
      Sol and independence; and self-efficacy, program acceptance, and life satisfaction. Outcomes&#xD;
      tested for caregivers will focus on multidimensional function and pain; and, Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QoL) and independence, the latter including perceived caregiver burden.&#xD;

                  (ADA) are observed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) 110-126mg/dL after a fast of 8 hours OR 2 hyperglycemia&#xD;
        symptoms (i.e. Polyuria, polydipsia and unexplained weight loss) and a causal plasma&#xD;
        glucose ≥200 mg/dL. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, these criteria will be&#xD;
        confirmed by repeat testing per (ADA) criteria. Should repeat testing confirm diabetes,&#xD;
        subjects will be discharged and referred for medical treatment.&#xD;
