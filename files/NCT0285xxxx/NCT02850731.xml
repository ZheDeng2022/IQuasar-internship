      Highly diversified programs of physical activity in older people have shown their&#xD;
      effectiveness in terms of improving functional capacities. Only one of these programs, to&#xD;
      date, has used a motorized platform. The motorized platform allows the use of sensorimotor&#xD;
      programs adapted to this population. Thus, for the user, a combination of motor and sensory&#xD;
      capacities necessary to actively control different positions as well as reactions to maintain&#xD;
      balance are stimulated, and are as important as psychomotor capabilities to maintain autonomy&#xD;
      and the fight against losing independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstration of the effectiveness of this type of equipment would propose a new modality of&#xD;
      physical activity adapted to this population. Use of this new equipment could allow the&#xD;
      possibility of standardizing this activity, whilst continuing to individualize physical&#xD;
      activity programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phases for each group (Intervention/Control):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (day 0 - week 6): 2x1 hour sessions per week using the Hu360® (Intervention group) or&#xD;
      an adapted physical activity program (Control group) under supervision of a therapist who&#xD;
      will adapt the program according to the progress of the patient, following a standardized&#xD;
      procedure (exercises: postural/balance training, strength training for the legs/trunk and&#xD;
      coordination and endurance activities) Phase 2 (week 6 - month 6): Physical activity program&#xD;
      at home for both groups, performed independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded evaluations will be performed at 6 weeks and at 6 months for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of the motorized platform will allow superior&#xD;
      physical performance compared to a traditional physical activity program.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of aging causes a progressive decline in functional capacities. Maintaining&#xD;
      physical fitness appears to be an important factor to fight against frailty (40% more frailty&#xD;
      in people &gt; 65 years old), a condition that causes loss of independence but that is&#xD;
      clinically reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fragility is a condition that associates: slowed walking speed, sedentary lifestyle, weight&#xD;
      loss, muscle weakness and low energy levels. It is therefore correlated with physical&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have demonstrated the benefit of physical activity in frail older people.&#xD;
      Levels of adherence to physical activity programs are not well known but low adherence&#xD;
      decreases the positive effects of the intervention. It seems therefore interesting to suggest&#xD;
      another approach that integrates innovative technology (plate-forme Hu360®) that can improve&#xD;
      the clinical condition of the frail older person, as well as levels of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly diversified programs of physical activity in older people have shown their&#xD;
      effectiveness in terms of improving functional capacities. Only one of these programs, to&#xD;
      date, has used a motorized platform. The motorized platform allows the use of sensorimotor&#xD;
      programs adapted to this population. Thus, for the user, a combination of motor and sensory&#xD;
      capacities necessary to actively control different positions as well as reactions to maintain&#xD;
      balance are stimulated, and are as important as psychomotor capabilities to maintain autonomy&#xD;
      and the fight against losing independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demonstration of the effectiveness of this type of equipment would propose a new modality of&#xD;
      physical activity adapted to this population. Use of this new equipment could allow the&#xD;
      possibility of standardizing this activity, whilst continuing to individualize physical&#xD;
      activity programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two phases for each group (Intervention/Control):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (day 0 - week 6): 2x1 hour sessions per week using the Hu360® (Intervention group) or&#xD;
      an adapted physical activity program (Control group) under supervision of a therapist who&#xD;
      will adapt the program according to the progress of the patient, following a standardized&#xD;
      procedure (exercises: postural/balance training, strength training for the legs/trunk and&#xD;
      coordination and endurance activities)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (week 6 - month 6): Physical activity program at home for both groups, performed&#xD;
      independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded evaluations will be performed at 6 weeks and at 6 months for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that the use of the motorized platform will allow superior&#xD;
      physical performance compared to a traditional physical activity program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be realized, blinded to the treatment group. The analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted with intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal analysis will be made using a linear mixed model for repeated data, taking into&#xD;
      account stratification factors (gender and class Score SPPB at baseline) by random effect,&#xD;
      without imputation of missing data. An exploratory analysis will be conducted on the&#xD;
      principal outcome measure using a linear mixed model for repeated data, taking into account&#xD;
      stratification factors and some covariates that may change the effect of the intervention,&#xD;
      such compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be will be analysed in a similar manner by generalized linear&#xD;
      mixed models. The tests will be bilateral. An error-correction modem of 5% will be considered&#xD;
      during the analysis.&#xD;
