      This clinical trial is designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, parallel&#xD;
      design, multi-center, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GV1001 in&#xD;
      patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Eligible subjects are randomized into a group out&#xD;
      of the three study groups and a placebo group after four weeks of placebo run-in period.&#xD;
      Placebo run-in period is concurrently proceeded as a wash-out period for previous treatment&#xD;
      of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and a placebo is administered intradermally twice with&#xD;
      two-week interval during this period. After that, the randomized subjects receive a study&#xD;
      drug and a placebo intradermally seven times with two-week interval by visiting at Week 0, 2,&#xD;
      4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. After the treatment period, the subjects additionally visit at Week 13&#xD;
      and 16, and the efficacy is evaluated at Week 4, 8, 12, 13, and 16, and the safety is&#xD;
      evaluated over the 16-week period.&#xD;

    <description>IPSS questionnaire: 7-item questionnaire that measures urinary symptoms, but with an additional, independent eighth question on quality of life. It measures the level of urinary symptoms (including incomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) reported as the total IPSS score. The first 7 items has a 6-point response scale (0=none/never to 5=almost always/5 or more times) with a total score that can range from 0-35: mild (0-7), moderate (8-19), or severe (20-35). The last item assesses quality of life reported as a Quality of Life assessment index.</description>

             patient has to consent to avoid pregnancy by using contraceptive devices or oral&#xD;
             contraceptives during the patient's participation in clinical trial and for 90 days&#xD;
             after the end of treatment, except if the partner reaches menopause or is surgically&#xD;
             sterilized. (Consent should be obtained before visit 4, when necessary.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        [Exclusion Criteria]&#xD;
&#xD;

             patient is not participating in other ongoing clinical trial.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If diagnosed with prostate cancer in the past or at present&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A patient who was considered by an investigator to have an influence to an evaluation&#xD;
             on urine flow symptoms due to other previous or current diseases besides benign&#xD;
             prostatic hyperplasia (e.g., neurogenic bladder, bladder neck contracture, urethral&#xD;

             steroids for systemic action, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Any other patients who are considered to be ineligible for this study by an&#xD;
             investigator&#xD;
