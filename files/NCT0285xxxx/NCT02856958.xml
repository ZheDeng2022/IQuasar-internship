    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare acute nerve decompression versus nonoperative&#xD;
      treatment in the management of peroneal nerve palsy after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We&#xD;
      hypothesize that acute nerve decompression patients will have better long-term outcomes to&#xD;
      patients treated non-operatively for peroneal nerve palsies after TKA.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peroneal nerve palsy after TKA has been reported in the literature to be 0.3% to 1.5%,&#xD;
      although it can be as high as 9.5%. Several risk factors have been described: preoperative&#xD;
      valgus deformity and flexion contracture, prolonged intraoperative use of a tourniquet, use&#xD;
      of epidural anesthesia, and rheumatoid arthritis. Peroneal palsy is rarely diagnosed on&#xD;
      postoperative day 0, but in more than 85% of cases, it presents prior to postoperative day&#xD;
      4.Initial treatment should include flexing the knee, removing any compressive bandages, and&#xD;
      discontinuing epidural anesthesia. When there are residual deficits, supportive measures are&#xD;
      initiated, including application of an ankle-foot orthosis and physical therapy to prevent&#xD;
      ankle contracture. If there is no clinical recovery by six to twelve weeks, electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) is typically performed. Some clinicians have advocated the use of EMG studies in the&#xD;
      acute phase. In cases of incomplete recovery, delayed surgical exploration and decompression&#xD;
      of the peroneal nerve is an option that has been reported to improve outcomes. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      not all cases respond, even with surgical treatment. In addition, little information is&#xD;
      available describing the outcomes of acute surgical decompression for peroneal nerve palsy&#xD;
      after total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there have been retrospective case reports and series that have examined outcomes after&#xD;
      delayed peroneal nerve decompression, we are unaware of reports describing acute&#xD;
      decompression. Delayed decompression of the peroneal nerve has been associated with the&#xD;
      return of nerve function. Krackow et al. reported the results of five patients who underwent&#xD;
      delayed surgical decompression for peroneal nerve palsy after total knee arthroplasty at an&#xD;
      average of 27.2 months (range, 5-50 months) and found that 100% were able to discontinue use&#xD;
      of the ankle-foot orthosis and 80% had full neurological recovery. The patient who had&#xD;
      partial return of neurological function did not undergo decompression until almost four years&#xD;
      postoperatively. Mont et al. found that, in patients who underwent surgical peroneal nerve&#xD;
      decompression two to sixty months following total knee arthroplasty, 97% reported functional&#xD;
      and subjective improvements at a mean of three years post-decompression and were able to&#xD;
      discontinue use of the ankle-foot orthosis. Only 33% of the patients who were managed&#xD;
      nonoperatively reported improvement in functional and subjective outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in 33% of the patients, an acute decompression would not have been necessary, but&#xD;
      in the other 67%, it may have been beneficial. In both studies, patients underwent a trial of&#xD;
      nonoperative treatment, and no patient underwent a peroneal nerve decompression earlier than&#xD;
      two months after the index total knee arthroplasty. Initial experience with two peroneal&#xD;
      nerve palsies following TKA has encouraged some institutions to offer acute decompression to&#xD;
      all patients who present with peroneal palsy following total knee arthroplasty. This&#xD;
      parallels the practice patterns regarding the wrist, where an acute carpal tunnel release is&#xD;
      performed to avoid complications when a patient demonstrates carpal tunnel compressive&#xD;
      symptoms postoperatively from wrist surgery. While most patients will improve with&#xD;
      nonoperative treatment over time, acute decompression may accelerate recovery, which can&#xD;
      decrease uncertainty and stress for both the patient and the surgeon. The surgical technique&#xD;
      is relatively straightforward; however, the surgeon and patient must consider the risks of a&#xD;
      second anesthetic and operation. In previous experiences with both acute and delayed&#xD;
      decompression, while direct damage to the nerve itself is rare, fascial bands, hematomas, and&#xD;
      local edema are typically identified that contribute to the compression of the peroneal&#xD;
      nerve. Therefore, while nonoperative treatment would possibly result in a return of nerve&#xD;
      function once the hematoma resorbed and edema decreased, there may still be some residual&#xD;
      dysfunction from the time period of nerve compression and thickened fascial bands around the&#xD;
      nerve. Additional study of acute decompression is warranted to understand if it offers both&#xD;
      short and long-term advantages over nonoperative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Groups: Acute Nerve Decompression - patients will initially receive conservative&#xD;
      management (flexing the knee, removing any compressive bandages, and discontinuing epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia) followed by a peroneal nerve decompression within 1 week of diagnosis of peroneal&#xD;
      nerve palsy. Decompression involves surgical intervention in the setting of a sterile&#xD;
      operating room. The patient will be provided with multiple options of anesthesia (per&#xD;
      discussion with the anesthesia team). The surgical procedure involves an incision at the&#xD;
      lateral aspect of the knee, near the proximal fibula at the level of the fibular neck. The&#xD;
      peroneal nerve is carefully identified and dissected. Tissue surrounding or impinging the&#xD;
      nerve is carefully removed or cut to rid the compressive environment. The nerve is re-&#xD;
      examined to ensure there are no additional points of compression/irritation. The soft-tissues&#xD;
      and skin are subsequently closed with suture. Nonoperative Treatment - patients will receive&#xD;
      conservative management (flexing the knee, removing any compressive bandages, and&#xD;
      discontinuing epidural anesthesia) as well as supportive measures (ankle-foot orthosis and&#xD;
      physical therapy) for symptoms lasting longer than 6 week. Outcome Measures: Primary Measure&#xD;
      - â‰¥ 3/5 dorsiflexion strength 3 months after surgery/randomization&#xD;
