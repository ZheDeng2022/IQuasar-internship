  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SGCs are rare (less than 1% of head and neck cancers) and include many malignant histotypes.&#xD;
      SGCs are treated mainly with surgery, followed by radiotherapy in selected cases.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is reserved for palliative treatment of metastases or local recurrence but&#xD;
      results in term of response rate are very low. Adenoid cystic cancer (ACC) is the most common&#xD;
      SGC histotype observed in metastatic subjects while the other histotypes (non-ACC) such as&#xD;
      mucoepidermoid cancer (MEC), salivary duct gland cancer, adenocarcinoma, myoepithelial&#xD;
      carcinoma are more uncommon. A phase II trial with sorafenib carried out in 37 subjects (19&#xD;
      ACC and 18 non-ACC) with recurrent and/or metastatic SGCs showed a response rate of 16% (11%&#xD;
      in ACC and 22% in non-ACC). In preclinical models, VEGF seems to contribute to tumor&#xD;
      aggressiveness and to distant metastatization of SGCs, in particular in ACC and MEC.&#xD;
      Remarkably three confirmed partial responses, one ACC, one renal cancer and one lung cancer,&#xD;
      on 36 patients were observed in a phase I study with Inlyta, a potent VEGFR&#xD;
      specific-inhibitor approved by FDA as second line treatment for renal cancer. Based on these&#xD;
      data, we want to test Inlyta in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic SGC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carcinomas of the salivary glands (SGCs) are rare, (less than 1% of all cancers of the head&#xD;
      and neck and include more than 20 malignant histotypes). They can occur both in major and&#xD;
      minor salivary glands, are locally aggressive, demonstrating invasiveness that leads to&#xD;
      involvement of the facial nerve, skin, bone and surrounding soft tissue. The standard&#xD;
      treatment is surgical excision, followed by radiotherapy in selected cases such as high-grade&#xD;
      histotypes, advanced disease and neck nodes diffusion. Loco-regional recurrence occurs in 16%&#xD;
      to 85%, it can be managed in very selected cases with further surgery and/or radiotherapy,&#xD;
      although the prognosis of these patients remains poor. Adenoid cystic cancer (ACC) is the&#xD;
      most common SGC histotype observed in metastatic subjects (60%), while the other histotypes&#xD;
      (non-ACC) such as mucoepidermoid cancer (MEC), salivary duct gland cancer, adenocarcinoma,&#xD;
      myoepithelial carcinoma are more uncommon. Distant metastases are the principal cause of&#xD;
      failure, being diagnosed in 25-55% of the patients. Only 20% of the patients with distant&#xD;
      metastases is alive at 5 years. First-line treatment is palliative chemotherapy that is&#xD;
      typically not associated with solid data showing any benefit neither in response rate nor in&#xD;
      outcome. Very recently a phase II trial with sorafenib has been carried out in 37 subjects&#xD;
      (19 ACC and 18 non-ACC) with recurrent and/or metastatic SGCs. Interestingly, a response rate&#xD;
      of 16% (95% CI 6,2-32,0) was observed, 11% in ACC and 22% in non-ACC cases with two&#xD;
      outstanding responses in patients with an high-grade MEC. In one case the metastatic lesion&#xD;
      evolved in a cavitation as observed with antiangiogenic agents. In preclinical models, VEGF&#xD;
      seems to contribute to tumor aggressiveness as well as to distant metastatization of SGCs, in&#xD;
      particular in ACC and MEC. Remarkably three confirmed partial responses, one ACC, one renal&#xD;
      cancer and one lung cancer, on 36 patients were observed in a phase I study with Inlyta®.&#xD;
      These results prompted a phase II study to test the activity of axitinib in relapsed and/or&#xD;
      metastatic and progressive ACC patients. Results were 9% of partial responses and 75% of&#xD;
      stable disease as best overall response. Inlyta®, a potent VEGFR specific-inhibitor, has been&#xD;
      approved by FDA as second line treatment for renal cancer. Based on preclinical and clinical&#xD;
      data, we believe that targeting VEGFR might represent a rational basis to further test&#xD;
      Inlyta® in patients with relapsed and/or metastatic ACC but also in subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic non-ACC .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, monocentric, single arm phase II study evaluating the activity and safety of&#xD;
      axitinib in recurrent and/or metastatic tumors of salivary gland. 26 patients with&#xD;
      histologically proven relapsed or metastatic SGC, progressed within 6 months at study entry&#xD;
      will be enrolled over two years. A 2-stage Simon design will be applied: 15 patients enrolled&#xD;
      into step one and if a least 1/15 response is observed, 11 additional patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled into second step. Axitinib will be administered orally at 5 mg twice daily to&#xD;
      patients for the first two weeks. Patients who tolerate axitinib with no adverse events&#xD;
      axitinib-related should have a dose increased until to 10 mg twice. The drug will be taken&#xD;
      until progression of disease or intolerable toxicity. Tissue paraffin block from primary&#xD;
      lesion or metastasis will be collected for CRTC1-MAML2 translocation analysis in MEC;&#xD;
      MYB-NFIB translocation analysis in ACC; androgen receptor and HER2 analysis in SDC and&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma NOS.&#xD;
