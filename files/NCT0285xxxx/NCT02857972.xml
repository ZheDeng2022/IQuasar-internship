      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the preference and performance in terms of satisfaction and acceptability as well&#xD;
      as safety profile of a novel innovative design of menstrual hygiene device (Wondaleaf®)&#xD;
      during the night for menstruating women by comparing it to prior experience of the usual&#xD;
      hygienic product for menstrual control, i.e. sanitary pads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the preference of participants between Wondaleaf® and usual sanitary pads&#xD;
           as a night use menstrual hygiene product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the satisfaction of participants towards Wondaleaf® and usual sanitary pads&#xD;
           as a night use menstrual hygiene product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the acceptability of participants towards Wondaleaf® as a night use&#xD;
           menstrual hygiene product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety profile of the Wondaleaf®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof of concept study to assess preference, satisfaction and acceptability of&#xD;
      Wondaleaf® versus prior experience of sanitary pads for night use among menstruating women.&#xD;
      Community sampling will be done and 30 women within ages of 18 to 45 years old with regular&#xD;
      menstrual cycles will be recruited. Potential participants will be screened based on the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Visit 1 after recruitment, participants will have to complete the Baseline&#xD;
      Questionnaire (Refer to Appendix):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1 - Socio-demographic: age, race, education level, marital and personal / family income&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 2 - Usual menstrual characteristics for the past 1 year: age of menarche; most frequent&#xD;
      length of menstrual cycle (days); most frequent duration of each menstrual bleeding (days);&#xD;
      number of days with heavy bleeding; the usual (i.e. commonest types) of sanitary pads used at&#xD;
      night (panty liner, ultra-thin, regular, maxi / super or night use); estimated number of&#xD;
      times hygiene product changed at night with heavy bleeding; estimated number of times hygiene&#xD;
      product changed at night with average menstrual flow and current menstrual problems if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 3 - satisfaction of usual sanitary pads usage: product comfort; cleanliness; capacity;&#xD;
      convenience; appearance and quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive instructions and demonstrations regarding the investigational&#xD;
      device usage. Any update on the device will be informed by research officers through phone&#xD;
      call. Each women subject is required to use the investigational device given for the&#xD;
      subsequent menstrual cycle at night and record the day of the menstrual flow starts and ends&#xD;
      with the frequency of the device changed for each night in the Wondaleaf® Menstrual Diary.&#xD;
      The test materials that are used shall be discarded appropriately in the usual manner at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Home-based Questionnaire on the safety of the investigational device has to be completed by&#xD;
      the participants at home within 24 hours of the last usage of Wondaleaf®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction, acceptability and preference questionaire will be given at Visit 2 at the end&#xD;
      of menstrual cycle within 7 days following the last use of Wondaleaf®. Any unused&#xD;
      investigational devices will be returned for counting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A final follow up by a phone call to each subject will be performed to enquire their general&#xD;
      well-being after 3 months (+/- 7 days) of last Wondaleaf® usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the women were confirmed pregnant during study duration, the subject will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study and referred for antenatal care of their choice. If any adverse event arises,&#xD;
      subject will be advised to stop using the investigational device and will be referred for&#xD;
      medical care in the Hospital by relevant specialist.&#xD;
