    <textblock>
      A cold season involves higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several epidemiologic&#xD;
      studies have implicated that persons with a cardiac disease, such as coronary artery disease&#xD;
      (CAD) may be at higher risk for these adverse health events, but the mechanisms are not well&#xD;
      established. Because both exercise and cold exposure stimulates cardiac and circulatory&#xD;
      functions it is important to study their interaction especially among people with CAD and&#xD;
      whose myocardial oxygen supply and function are weakened. The study examines how recommended&#xD;
      health-enhancing upper and lower body exercise and warm-up in combination with cold exposure&#xD;
      affects cardiovascular functions of people with CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research includes randomized controlled experiments where the participants are 35-75 year&#xD;
      old men with CAD (CCS I-II) and recruited from the Oulu University Hospital. Each participant&#xD;
      undergoes four different trials in random order where the temperature (+22°C or -15°C) and&#xD;
      the form of exercise (brisk walking at 5.5 km/h or upper body exercise at 30 W), and warm-up&#xD;
      regime is varied. The used exercise, clothing and exposure resemble an ordinary wintertime&#xD;
      exercise event. Novel techniques are used to broadly assess cardiovascular function before,&#xD;
      during and in the recovery phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The obtained information is synthesized and translated to tailored year-round exercise&#xD;
      instructions for people with CAD by the research team including experts from sports sciences,&#xD;
      physiology, public and occupational health, clinical sciences and with complementary&#xD;
      knowledge in physical activity, effective interventions and cardiovascular function. The&#xD;
      study has broad national and international impact on the relatively passive aging population&#xD;
      having CAD and residing and working in a cold climate. The produced information enables&#xD;
      finding means to activate persons with CAD and where appropriate and safe year-round exercise&#xD;
      may reduce or prevent adverse health effects. Health care personnel will have an improved&#xD;
      possibility to prescribe physical activity programs for their clients and enabling better&#xD;
      instructions of healthy and safe exercise as a way to promote health.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      National and International significance of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a worldwide estimate 42% of people with coronary artery disease (CAD) are&#xD;
      physically inactive. There are approximately 200 000 persons in Finland with CAD, and even&#xD;
      more have other connected health problems (high cholesterol or blood pressure, diabetes)&#xD;
      further weakening their cardiac function and physical capacity and causing mortality. This&#xD;
      increasing ageing population are often inactive, but would benefit substantially from regular&#xD;
      year-round physical activity for maintaining their functional ability and independent living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present it is not known whether the exercise recommendation for CAD patients involves a&#xD;
      health risk during cold exposure as they regularly report symptoms of chest pain and&#xD;
      arrhythmias in the winter. Because both exercise and cold exposure stimulates cardiac and&#xD;
      circulatory functions precise physical activity require defining their interaction among CAD&#xD;
      patients whose myocardial oxygen supply and function are weakened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nationally and internationally the research addresses a large and special population group&#xD;
      living in the northern hemisphere, whose symptoms, health events and mortality are common and&#xD;
      provoked in the cold season. A passive lifestyle of this population is partially due to&#xD;
      inadequate instructions and guidance. As a result of ageing the proportion of people with CAD&#xD;
      will increase which emphasizes the role of prevention in reducing health care costs. The&#xD;
      proposed research entity forms an important part of the research program examining the direct&#xD;
      effect of temperature on human health in the newly established WHO Collaboration Centre in&#xD;
      Global change, Environment and Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypotheses The aims are: 1) to study separate and combined effects of upper or lower&#xD;
      body exercise and warm-up on cardiovascular response (acute, recovery) and to 2) translate&#xD;
      the research information into tailored instructions for year-round physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are: 1) moderate level endurance exercise increase cardiovascular strain in&#xD;
      CAD patients in the cold compared to a warm environment, 2) upper body exercise is more&#xD;
      strenuous than lower body exercise in the cold, 3) warm-up exercise attenuates the cold and&#xD;
      exercise induced rise in BP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The participants are 35-75-year old men (non-smokers) with CAD (NYHA CCS I-II),&#xD;
      have experienced a myocardial infarction over 3 months ago, have hypertension but no other&#xD;
      metabolic, cardiovascular or respiratory disease. The participants are recruited from the&#xD;
      Oulu University Hospital by an experienced cardiologist. The exclusion criteria are: smoking,&#xD;
      asthma, CCS class III-IV, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction less than 3 months ago,&#xD;
      chronic atrial fibrillation, claudication, unstable angina pectoris, serious complex&#xD;
      arrhythmias or ECG anomalies during rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized controlled studies (n=160) The randomized controlled studies allow understanding&#xD;
      causality and the physiological mechanisms for the separate and combined effects of exercise&#xD;
      and cold on cardiovascular function in persons with CAD. Phase I (2015-16): Separate and&#xD;
      combined effects of cold and exercise on cardiovascular function. Each participant (n=20) is&#xD;
      randomly exposed to four conditions and separately to a neutral (+22°C) and cold (-15°C)&#xD;
      environment during rest and exercise. Phase II (2016-17): Type of exercise and warm-up on&#xD;
      cardiovascular function during exercise in the cold. Each participant (n=20) is randomly&#xD;
      exposed to four conditions involving lower (brisk walking) or upper body (arm ergometry)&#xD;
      exercise in the cold (-15°C) with or without warm-up exercise at +22°C. Each experimental&#xD;
      session lasts for 105 min (15 min baseline + 30 min exposure + 60 min recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambient conditions The participants are exposed to both +22°C and -15°C (wind 1.4. m/s) for&#xD;
      30 min per experimental session in the wind tunnel of the Kastelli Research Centre. The used&#xD;
      cold exposure simulates conditions which occur frequently during the winter in a cold&#xD;
      climate. The participants are equipped with winter clothing during the experiments. The cold&#xD;
      exposure is largely restricted to the face which is known to increase BP by ca. 20 mmHg in&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental sessions are performed at the same time of the day for each participant.&#xD;
      Instructions to avoid heavy exercise or alcohol 48 h before or coffee/caffeine related&#xD;
      beverages 3 h prior to the experiments are given. The participants are informed of the&#xD;
      research, provide written consent to participate to the study and have a possibility to get&#xD;
      acquainted with the experimental conditions. A questionnaire inquiring of the health and&#xD;
      lifestyle of the participants is filled in. Following this the body composition of the&#xD;
      subjects is assessed by bioimpedance. A baseline blood sample is drawn. After this the&#xD;
      subjects are equipped with skin temperature thermistors and arm cuff (BP). ECG-electrodes are&#xD;
      attached both for online (12-lead) and long term (24 h) monitoring of cardiac function.&#xD;
      Subjects are followed in neutral conditions for 15 minutes (baseline). Continuous&#xD;
      beat-to-beat BP, central aortic blood pressure and flow mediated dilation is recorded before&#xD;
      the exposure to neutral/cold temperature and rest/exercise. For exercise in the cold the&#xD;
      subjects are equipped with winter clothing and enter the experimental conditions (wind&#xD;
      tunnel). During the exercise cardiovascular functions are followed continuously through the&#xD;
      real-time ECG. BP is measured every third minute at rest and during exercise. Physical strain&#xD;
      is assessed at 1- minute and thermal sensations at 5-minute intervals. The termination&#xD;
      criteria include an ST-depression of more than 2 mm, symptoms of angina, as well as a sudden&#xD;
      considerable change in BP. The termination of an experiment is decided by the paramedic nurse&#xD;
      monitoring and medical doctor supervising the experimental session. After ending the exercise&#xD;
      the cardiovascular functions are followed for 30 minutes at 22°C. A blood sample is taken&#xD;
      immediately after the exercise. Continuous and central BP is measured 3-8 minutes following&#xD;
      the exercise (early recovery) and after 15-20 minutes (delayed recovery). The subjects return&#xD;
      48-hours after the experiment for providing a blood sample which enables to examine both&#xD;
      immediate and delayed effects on hematological parameters (blood coagulation factors,&#xD;
      inflammation markers, endothelin).&#xD;
