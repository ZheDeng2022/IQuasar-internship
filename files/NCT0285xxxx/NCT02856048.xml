      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a temporary ovarian suppression&#xD;
      obtained by administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist during alkylating&#xD;
      agents containing chemotherapy on ovarian reserve assessed by Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)&#xD;
      serum levels in adolescents and young women with cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a French, Prospective, Multicentre, Open, Randomised study To determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of a temporary ovarian suppression obtained by administration of a Gonadotropin Releasing&#xD;
      Hormone agonist (GnRHa) on maintaining ovarian reserve, patients will be randomized, half of&#xD;
      them receiving Triptorelin extended release (LP) 3 mg intramuscularly every 28±3 days,&#xD;
      starting at the inclusion visit and at least 72 days before chemotherapy with alkylating&#xD;
      agents until 1 month after end of chemotherapy (mean duration: 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of a temporary ovarian&#xD;
      suppression achieved through administration of a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist&#xD;
      (triptorelin LP 3 mg) during alkylating agents containing chemotherapy on ovarian reserve&#xD;
      assessed by AMH serum levels in adolescents and young women with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centres 19 Research period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment duration 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of participation of each patient is: 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the treatment period is: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the follow-up period is: 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total duration: 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sample size and design One Hundred and sixty (160) patients will be included in this&#xD;
           study in order to ensure at least 128 patients who will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This number of patients should allow us to identify with a power of 80 % a difference of&#xD;
           5 pmol/L in AMH serum levels between the two groups, when accepting a risk alpha of&#xD;
           0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis populations The main analysis will be an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis,&#xD;
           which will be performed on all the randomized patients with a value of the main&#xD;
           criterion of judgment (AMH level at M24). A per-protocol (PP) analysis will also be&#xD;
           performed, as a secondary analysis, excluding patients with major protocol deviation&#xD;
           defined a priori.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Primary criteria The value of AMH level at month 24will be compared between the two&#xD;
           treatment groups using a test t of Student if AMH values are normally distributed and a&#xD;
           non-parametric Wilcoxon test if not.&#xD;
