  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin 25 milligram (mg)&#xD;
      once daily compared to placebo when administered as monotherapy, or when added onto a&#xD;
      background of metformin alone, insulin alone, or a combination of metformin and insulin, as&#xD;
      measured by the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change from Baseline at Week 26 in pediatric&#xD;
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alogliptin. Alogliptin is being tested to treat&#xD;
      children 10 to 17 years of age who have T2DM and are experiencing inadequate glycemic&#xD;
      control. This study will look at HbA1c fluctuations in children who take alogliptin in&#xD;
      addition to their background antidiabetic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 150 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain&#xD;
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent&#xD;
      medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alogliptin 25 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the tablet containing&#xD;
           alogliptin 25 mg but has no active ingredient (that is, has no alogliptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the&#xD;
      study in addition to their current background antidiabetic therapy (metformin and/or insulin)&#xD;
      if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Brazil, Germany, Italy,&#xD;
      Poland, Russia, Israel and Mexico. The overall time to participate in this study is&#xD;
      approximately 56 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.&#xD;
