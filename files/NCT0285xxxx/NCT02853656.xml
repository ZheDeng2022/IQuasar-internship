      Preterm birth (babies being born before 34 weeks pregnancy) occurs in approximately 11% of&#xD;
      pregnancies; preterm birth can lead to complications for the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When mothers are identified as being at risk of going into preterm birth (giving birth within&#xD;
      the next 14 days) there are several treatments available that may help reduce the likelihood&#xD;
      of complications for the baby. These treatments usually need to be started within 24 hours so&#xD;
      it is very important that diagnosing preterm labour in not only fast but accurate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several methods commonly used within hospitals for diagnosing mothers who may be at&#xD;
      risk of going into preterm labour. The two most common ones are foetal fibronectin (fFN) and&#xD;
      phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (phIGFBP-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two tests to see which is more accurate at&#xD;
      predicting preterm birth.&#xD;

&#xD;
      There are several methods commonly used within hospitals for diagnosing mothers who may be at&#xD;
      risk of going into preterm labour. The two most common ones are foetal fibronectin (fFN) and&#xD;
      phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (phIGFBP-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two tests to see which is more accurate at&#xD;
      predicting preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective comparative study of fFN (control) and PhIGFBP-1 test (comparator) for&#xD;
      women with singleton pregnancies between 22-34 weeks gestation presenting with self-reported&#xD;
      signs, symptoms or complaints suggestive of preterm labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both tests will be done on every participant - the tests will be sequenced so that every 5&#xD;
      participants the fFN test is undertaken first and then the next cohort of 5 will have the&#xD;
      PhIGFBP-1 swab taken first. This is to remove any potential biases surrounding which test was&#xD;
      undertaken first. Data collection (case report forms (CRFs)) will clearly document which test&#xD;
      was performed 1st and 2nd.&#xD;
