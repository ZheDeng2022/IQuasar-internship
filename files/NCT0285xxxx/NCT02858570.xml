      TYPE / DESIGN STUDY: Clinical trial phase II / III, randomized, double-blind, national&#xD;
      multi-center, with a total of 1,644 research participants stratified into 3 groups according&#xD;
      to age for starting of the primary vaccination schedule (Stratum I - 11 to 19 years, Stratum&#xD;
      II - 1 to 10 years; Stratum III - less than 1 year old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND / STUDY CASE: Clinical trial phase II / III, which purpose is to evaluate&#xD;
      immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of the vaccine against meningococcus C, conjugated&#xD;
      to tetanus toxoid, developed by Bio-Manguinhos / FIOCRUZ (MenCC-Bio). The hypothesis of the&#xD;
      study is that MenCC-BIO vaccine is safe and not inferior in terms of immunogenicity to the&#xD;
      comparator vaccine currently available for the National Immunization Program in the child's&#xD;
      immunization schedule. Thus, MenCC-Bio vaccine may meet the need for expansion of the target&#xD;
      age group of vaccination in routine public health services and will be available to the&#xD;
      National Immunization Program as a strategy to ensure sustainability and self-sufficiency to&#xD;
      vaccination policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES PRIMARY: To assess the immunogenicity of MenCC Bio-vaccine in patients from 3&#xD;
      months to 19 years of age, in relation to the vaccine against meningococcus C currently&#xD;
      provided by the National Immunization Program. To evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of&#xD;
      MenCC Bio-vaccine in patients from 3 months to 19 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the cellular immune component to meningococcal C conjugate&#xD;
      vaccine in a subset of survey participants, aged 11 to 19 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Individuals of both sexes, healthy, aged between 3 months and 19 years,&#xD;
      attending the campus of Fiocruz / Rio de Janeiro, or municipal health units in Rio de Janeiro&#xD;
      (living in areas covered by the municipal units health participants) that fit in the study&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUMBER OF CENTRES: Two Clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DURATION: Estimate of 19 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION / TREATMENT: Two intervention groups (MenCC-BIO Vaccine and Comparator) in three&#xD;
      age groups, with specific vaccination schedules. For the age groups I and II are applied 2&#xD;
      doses ideal interval of 6 months between them. In stratum III, are recommended 3 doses of the&#xD;
      vaccine, at ages 3, 5 and 12 months of age, according to calendar of the National&#xD;
      Immunization Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES PRIMARY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proportion of seroconversion defined by the seronegative status change (titles of&#xD;
      bactericidal antibodies in children rabbit complement than 1: 8) to seropositive (titers of&#xD;
      bactericidal antibodies in larger rabbit complement or equal to 1: 8) or increase 4 times of&#xD;
      post vaccinal compared to pre-vacianais after the full vaccination schedule by age stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geometric mean antibody titers (TGM) pre- and post-vaccination, for each vaccine group, and&#xD;
      the ratio of these securities after the full vaccination schedule by age stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and reactogenicity: Frequency and intensity of adverse events solicited and&#xD;
      unsolicited, which occurred 30 days after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOME : cell detection B (CD19 +) memory phenotype (CD27 + IgD +, CD27 + IgD) in&#xD;
      a subgroup of patients in the age stratum I (11-19 years old). ADDITIONAL INFORMATION age&#xD;
      escalation, with interim analysis of inter-layer security and approval by the Security&#xD;
      Independent Monitoring Committee of progression to the next lower age stratum.&#xD;
