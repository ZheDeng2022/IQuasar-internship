    <textblock>
      To investigate the bioequivalence between two formulations containing&#xD;
      S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine L-lysine monohydrate salt (SCMC-lys) when administered as single&#xD;
      oral dose in two consecutive study periods to healthy male and female volunteers under&#xD;
      fasting conditions.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As a part of the Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A. extension line program, Dompé developed a new 1.35&#xD;
      g powder for oral solution formulation of carbocysteine L-lysine salt-monohydrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present bioequivalence phase I study is needed to compare the bioavailability and the&#xD;
      concentration-time profile of the new 1.35 g powder for oral solution formulation with the&#xD;
      reference compound Fluifort® 90 mg/mL syrup (15 mL corresponding to 1.35 g of SCMC- lys).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new 1.35 g powder for oral solution formulation of carbocysteine L-lysine salt-&#xD;
      monohydrate is expected to be bioequivalent to Fluifort® 90 mg/mL syrup with the same&#xD;
      indications: mucolytic, expectorant in acute and chronic respiratory tract disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end-point is to evaluate the bioequivalent rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC0-t) of&#xD;
      absorption of carbocysteine after single oral administration of test and reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of carbocysteine after single oral&#xD;
           administration of test and reference;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to collect safety and tolerability data after single oral administration of test and&#xD;
           reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has been designed in agreement with the &quot;Guideline on the investigation of&#xD;
      bioequivalence.&quot; Due to the lack of information about the PK profile of the new formulation&#xD;
      it was decided to use a &quot;two stage&quot; bioequivalence study design, that allows a re-calculation&#xD;
      of the sample size in case the number of subjects initially enrolled in the study is not&#xD;
      large enough to provide a reliable answer to the questions addressed due to underestimation&#xD;
      of the variability or misleading estimation of the point estimate for the T/R ratio of the&#xD;
      geometric means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of stage 1 was calculated assuming a point estimate for the T/R ratio of the&#xD;
      geometric means of 1.053 (i.e. μR=0.95·μT) and a multiplicative coefficient of variation&#xD;
      (CVm) of 20% for both AUC0-t and Cmax. A power of 90% was considered and, according to the&#xD;
      Pocock spending function and to the current European bioequivalence guideline, the α level&#xD;
      was set to 0.0294. Fifteen (15) subjects per sequence (i.e. 30 subjects overall) will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the first stage of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of study stage 1, PK parameters will be calculated and an ad interim&#xD;
      bioequivalence test will be performed on the calculated PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and&#xD;
      AUC0-∞. To safeguard the overall type I error, the α level of the bioequivalence test will be&#xD;
      set to 0.0294 according to the Pocock spending function. Should bioequivalence be proven with&#xD;
      the results of the subjects of the first stage, the primary objective of the study would then&#xD;
      be satisfied and the second study stage will not take place. Should bioequivalence not be&#xD;
      proven with the results of the subjects of the first stage and with an a posteriori&#xD;
      calculated power &gt; 90% for both AUC0-t and Cmax, the study will be stopped and the&#xD;
      bioequivalence will not be proven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should bioequivalence not be proven with the results of the subjects of the first stage and&#xD;
      with an a posteriori calculated power ≤ 90% for AUC0-t or Cmax, the overall sample size for&#xD;
      the study (stage 1 plus 2) will be calculated on the basis of the ad interim bioequivalence&#xD;
      results. The additional subjects will be enrolled into the second study stage. After&#xD;
      completion of stage 2, the PK analysis and the bioequivalence test will be performed on the&#xD;
      pooled subjects of the two study stages. The α level of the bioequivalence test of stage 1&#xD;
      plus 2 will be set to 0.0294 according to the Pocock spending function. The second stage will&#xD;
      be performed after notification of the sample size to the local Ethics Committee and to the&#xD;
      central Swiss authority (Swissmedic).&#xD;
