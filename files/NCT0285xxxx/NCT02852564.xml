    <textblock>
      Phase 1 study to provide quantitative characterization of the renal elimination of ethacrynic&#xD;
      acid and metabolites in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) at the time&#xD;
      of transurethral resection of bladder tumor&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer continues to be a significant healthcare and financial liability in the United&#xD;
      States. Patients with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) are in desperate need for&#xD;
      both effective and easily tolerated treatment options. Current standard of care includes&#xD;
      immediate post-operative Mitomycin C (MMC), which decreases the rate of recurrence but does&#xD;
      not alter progression. Furthermore, in patients with high-grade NMIBC, standard of care&#xD;
      dictates that patients undergo intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy. This&#xD;
      treatment has a high degree of morbidity with both local and systemic side effects along with&#xD;
      significant discomfort from treatment (intra-urethral catheterization and bladder&#xD;
      instillation). Our goal is to develop a bladder cancer treatment strategy designed to&#xD;
      decrease recurrence/progression rates in addition to decreasing the morbidity of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve evaluable NMIBC patients will participate in this Phase 1 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment - patients will receive a single, 50 mg oral dose of ethacrynic acid administered&#xD;
      as two 25 mg strength EDECRIN® tablets immediately prior to transurethral resection of&#xD;
      bladder tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations and excretion rates of ethacrynic acid in the urine, as well as of cysteine,&#xD;
      glutathione, and mercapturate metabolites, will be measured for each of 4 urine specimens&#xD;
      collected on the day of surgery (before, during, and at 2 timepoints after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, serious adverse events, laboratory values, and vital sign measurements will&#xD;
      be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy of ethacrynic acid treatment will be estimated by recording&#xD;
      recurrence/non-recurrence of disease at 3 months post-treatment&#xD;
