  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stigma is a significant concern for those who experience psychosis. People with psychosis are&#xD;
      the most stigmatised group of all mental health difficulties. There is a lack of research&#xD;
      examining the effectiveness of psychological therapies for people who experience psychosis&#xD;
      who are also experiencing negative impacts of stigma. To date, all studies examining stigma&#xD;
      therapies have been conducted with outpatients and no support have been developed for&#xD;
      inpatients. The aim of this study to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial of a brief&#xD;
      therapy (based on cognitive behavioural therapy)to help participants cope with stigma. It&#xD;
      will be compared to a educational control intervention. Both therapies will last&#xD;
      approximately two hours and be conducted in one or two sessions by the principal investigator&#xD;
      (clinical psychologist). Participants will be given a number of questionnaires assessing a&#xD;
      number of outcomes such as impacts of stigma, depression, recovery, and self-esteem.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed on these measure prior to the therapy, post therapy and at&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

      A single-blind randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted comparing a Cognitive&#xD;
      Behaviour Therapy formulation driven internalised stigma intervention (experimental group)&#xD;
      against a psychoeducational control intervention (control group). It will follow&#xD;
      recommendations outlined by the Medical Research Council's framework for the development and&#xD;
      evaluation of complex interventions. This will allow for the medication of the intervention&#xD;
      if necessary in order to examine what type of intervention is best suited to the inpatient&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To examine the efficacy of a formulation driven intervention for internalised stigma in&#xD;
      psychosis with acute inpatients. The intervention will be compared to a brief&#xD;
      psychoeducational internalised stigma intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of therapies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Condition The experimental condition will receive a two hour intervention&#xD;
      session (across one or two sessions) which will be based on a Cognitive Behaviour therapy&#xD;
      formulation. These sessions will be undertaken within a two week period. The sessions will&#xD;
      collaboratively assess and create a narrative of the participants' experiences of stigma, and&#xD;
      develop a personalised stigma formulation. A stigma-related goal will be identified and a&#xD;
      brief intervention will be collaboratively developed to tackle this goal. The intervention&#xD;
      formulation and change mechanisms will draw upon strategies for people who experience&#xD;
      psychosis. Intervention strategies may include guided discovery, skills development,&#xD;
      normalising and belief change strategies, including behavioural experiments targeting&#xD;
      stigma-relevant appraisals and negative beliefs about self including public stereotypes of&#xD;
      psychosis, and supporting decisions about whether to disclose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Condition The control condition will receive a two hour session receiving&#xD;
      psychoeducation and normalising material relating to stigma in psychosis. The aim of the&#xD;
      material is normalise experiences of psychosis and stigma. Information includes prevalence&#xD;
      rates of psychosis, experiences of stigma and discrimination commonly reported by those who&#xD;
      experience psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both interventions will be delivered by the same therapist.&#xD;
