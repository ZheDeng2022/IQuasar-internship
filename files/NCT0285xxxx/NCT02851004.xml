      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase Ib/II study to exploratively evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of BBI608 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (CRC) not responded to or intolerant of standard chemotherapy.The same analysis will&#xD;
      be performed for the additional cohort to the Phase II part, consisting of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic CMS 1 or 4, MMS, CRC not responsive to or intolerant of standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
