  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravitreal aflibercept has been approved for the treatment of visual impairments due to&#xD;
      diabetic macular oedema (DMO) in Europe and the US in August 2014 and July 2014 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of this observational cohort field study are to evaluate effectiveness of&#xD;
      intravitreal aflibercept and to describe follow-up as well as treatment patterns in anti&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment naïve patients with DMO in routine&#xD;
      clinical practice in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
