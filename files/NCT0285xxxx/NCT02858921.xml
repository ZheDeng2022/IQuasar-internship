  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine which of 3 drug combinations best reduces the size of tumour&#xD;
      prior to surgery for advanced melanoma and prevents the recurrence of melanoma after surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The new drug options for advanced melanoma include oncogene-targeted therapy (such as&#xD;
      dabrafenib, trametinib and vemurafenib) and immune checkpoint blockade (such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, nivolumab and ipilimumab). These drugs have shown remarkable efficacy and have&#xD;
      regulatory approval for metastatic disease. However, most patients with advanced disease&#xD;
      eventually progress. It is unknown if earlier treatment with systemic therapy after surgery&#xD;
      improves long term survival or what is the optimal sequencing or combination of therapy. An&#xD;
      efficient method of assessing drugs and combinations in humans is critical, particularly as&#xD;
      combinations of molecularly targeted and/or immune therapies may have similar signals for&#xD;
      efficacy in pre-clinical models, and recapitulation of the human immune system in animal&#xD;
      models is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant clinical trials in patients with resectable but bulky stage III/IV melanoma&#xD;
      allows for the rapid evaluation of drug activity in humans utilising multiple clinical&#xD;
      endpoints (metabolic response with Positron Emission Tomography [PET], clinical response with&#xD;
      Computed Tomography [CT] imaging, pathological response, relapse-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival) and translational endpoints (morphological, genetic and immunophenotyping of tumour&#xD;
      and blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery remains the standard of care for resectable Stage III or IV melanoma, despite the&#xD;
      recent drug therapy advances described above. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has&#xD;
      recently expanded the approved use of ipilimumab to include a new use as adjuvant therapy for&#xD;
      patients with resectable stage III / IV melanoma, to lower the risk of relapse following&#xD;
      surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy in this group of patients may also result in improved survival&#xD;
      rates and in the duration of local and distant disease control, with reduced surgical&#xD;
      morbidity and the potential for early elimination of microscopic metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an emerging and rapidly growing evidence base of the value of combining targeted and&#xD;
      immunotherapies in a number of histological subtypes of cancers. The support for a potential&#xD;
      synergy between the two treatment modalities has been established, as has the increased&#xD;
      toxicity profile. Both single agent BRAF inhibitors and combined BRAF and MEK inhibitors&#xD;
      induce a marked clonal T cell infiltrate in responding melanoma metastases early during&#xD;
      treatment (day 7-15), which is transient, and is not present at progression. Concurrently,&#xD;
      melanoma tumour antigen and the programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) expression increase early&#xD;
      during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unknown whether there is potential for converting a subset of patients who fail either&#xD;
      immunotherapy or targeted therapy alone into long-term responders by treating with programmed&#xD;
      cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors in conjunction with mitogen-activated protein kinases&#xD;
      (MAPK) targeted therapies. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the PD-1 inhibitor would be&#xD;
      best combined sequentially or concurrently with MAPK inhibitors. Mouse models have provided a&#xD;
      clear rational for combining these treatments upfront, however there is no human tissue&#xD;
      evidence to guide best combination strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of how best to maximize clinical outcome via concurrent versus sequential&#xD;
      targeted and immune therapy may be explored efficiently in the human neoadjuvant setting,&#xD;
      with detailed interrogation of multiple biopsies early during treatment. Immunological,&#xD;
      proteomic and genetic features in tissue and blood provide an in vivo assessment of tumour&#xD;
      responsiveness to therapy. This may enable more selective application of therapeutic agents&#xD;
      to patients who are more likely to benefit. Such findings would improve the therapeutic index&#xD;
      and cost effectiveness of these agents. Earlier systemic therapy prior to surgery also means&#xD;
      earlier targeting of distant micrometastases that could become the source of future disease&#xD;
      relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study design is therefore based on the hypothesis that one week of&#xD;
      targeted therapy may be sufficient to induce an enhanced tumoral immunity to result in a&#xD;
      higher pathological and clinical response using the 'Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors' (RECIST) guidelines when followed sequentially with pembrolizumab, than either&#xD;
      pembrolizumab alone or the combination of targeted therapy and pembrolizumab upfront.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential for toxicities that could affect adherence to the combined study treatments are&#xD;
      recognised, as additive, overlapping or unforeseen adverse events may occur with the triple&#xD;
      combination. The adverse event profiles and safety-related interruption to treatment will&#xD;
      therefore be assessed in conjunction with the objective responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and translational findings from this study have the potential to inform rational&#xD;
      decisions regarding combinations of treatment both in the metastatic and the adjuvant&#xD;
      settings. This is a critical study to inform future practice and future phase 3 clinical&#xD;
      trials. The translational research performed on tissue biopsies and blood will provide&#xD;
      mechanistic information to guide the selection of optimal combinations of therapies for phase&#xD;
      3 studies in the advanced and the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II, randomised, open label, three arm, parallel group, clinical trial of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant combined targeted and immune therapy for patients with BRAF V600 mutant&#xD;
      resectable stage III (bulky regional stage IIIB-D, but excluding in transit disease)&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This translational study explores pathological and RECIST response rates for a 6-week&#xD;
      duration of neoadjuvant therapy across 3 treatment arms. The key secondary outcomes to be&#xD;
      measured include a detailed analysis of immunologic, proteomic and genetic biomarkers in&#xD;
      tumour tissue and peripheral blood at weeks 1, 2 and 6 compared to baseline and correlated&#xD;
      with clinical, metabolic and pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment, and relapse and&#xD;
      overall survival to adjuvant treatment. In patients who relapse within 40 weeks of adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, further analysis of tumour tissue (if possible) will be undertaken. Relapse free&#xD;
      and overall survival, surgical outcomes and adverse event profile will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients will be randomised to one of three treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio, with 20&#xD;
      patients in each treatment arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Sequential immunotherapy&quot;: Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally&#xD;
           once a day for 1 week, then followed by treatment with Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg delivered&#xD;
           intravenously at weeks 1, 3, and 6, then once every 3 weeks from week 6 for 50 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Concurrent immunotherapy&quot;: Dabrafenib 150mg orally twice a day + Trametinib 2mg orally&#xD;
           once a day + Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks for 6 weeks then&#xD;
           Pembrlizuamb alone for a further 46 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Immunotherapy alone&quot;: Pembrolizumab 200mg intravenously once every 3 weeks alone for 52&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation of treatment will be concealed prior to randomisation which will be performed via&#xD;
      a web based system in permuted blocks and stratified by BRAF V600E mutation versus non BRAF&#xD;
      V600E mutation (i.e. V600D, V600K, V600R, V600M).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant treatment for all three arms will be administered for 6 weeks, followed by&#xD;
      complete resection of tumour to no evidence of disease. Surgery is followed by 46 weeks of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab adjuvant therapy or until disease relapse, death, intolerable adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions or by withdrawal of patient consent. After 52 weeks of the study treatment phase,&#xD;
      patients will be followed 3 monthly for relapse (and progression, following relapse) and&#xD;
      survival for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarker component of this study will require blood samples and core biopsies of tumour&#xD;
      tissue at the following time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (PRE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 1 (EDT 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 2 (EDT 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 6 - complete lymph node dissection specimen (POST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Relapse (RELAPSE) if applicable and available&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance of disease during the 6 week neoadjuvant period will be undertaken with surgical&#xD;
      assessments and with ultrasounds of the affected lymph node basin.&#xD;

             tumours are defined as having no significant vascular, central nervous system or bony&#xD;
             involvement. Only cases where a complete surgical resection with tumour-free margins&#xD;
             can safely be achieved are defined as resectable. Patients who may not have sufficient&#xD;
             disease to enable multiple biopsies at weeks 1 and 2 will not be excluded, however the&#xD;
             intention of the study is that at least one biopsy at these time points is required.&#xD;

             for non-nodal lesions and / or ≥ 15mm in shortest diameter for lymph nodes) within 4&#xD;
             weeks of randomisation. 'Measurable' disease may be ascertained by CT or for cutaneous&#xD;
             and superficial lesions, by caliper measurement with digital photography. CT preferred&#xD;
