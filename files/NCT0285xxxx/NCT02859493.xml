      This study aims to evaluate the effect of a specific strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on&#xD;
      improving the effectiveness of conventional treatment of vulvo-vaginal candidiasis. This is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The administration of yeast will be local&#xD;
      (vaginal).&#xD;
