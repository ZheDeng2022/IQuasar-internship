  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mounting amounts of evidence suggests that non-invasive stimulation of the dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) maybe a&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment modality for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However the&#xD;
      large variability in the magnitude of clinical outcomes reported is likely related to the&#xD;
      current lack of knowledge of ideal side of stimulation (left vs right) and the limited&#xD;
      precision in the targeting of brain circuits needed to obtain an optimal treatment response.&#xD;
      In this protocol the investigators will: 1) generate individualized treatment plans based on&#xD;
      an individual's functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and meta-analytical based&#xD;
      connectivity analysis to guide the delivery of adjunct, imaging-based &amp; robotically delivered&#xD;
      rTMS to active duty military (ADM) subjects with PTSD participating in an intensive program&#xD;
      providing integrated evidence-based psychotherapy and pharmacological management (Treatment&#xD;
      as Usual (TAU)). 2) To use clinician ratings and self-report PTSD symptom scales, as well as&#xD;
      other indicators of clinical change, to determine whether compared with TAU, addition of&#xD;
      adjunct rTMS improves clinical outcomes. 3) To conduct neuroimaging-based assessments aimed&#xD;
      to measure rTMS effects on network connectivity in ADM receiving treatment for PTSD and the&#xD;
      potential correlation of connectivity changes with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, 20 consecutive day&#xD;
      trial of adjunct rTMS to the right DLPFC for ADM with PTSD receiving TAU at Laurel Ridge&#xD;
      Treatment Center (LRTC; San Antonio, TX). Methods: Consenting ADM receiving TAU for PTSD at&#xD;
      LRTC will be randomized to receive 20 consecutive days of adjunct rTMS according to one of&#xD;
      these two treatment arms: Arm 1 TAU plus rTMS to the right DLPFC and Arm 2 TAU plus sham&#xD;
      rTMS. At UTHSCSA's Research Imaging Institute (RII), where all brain imaging will be&#xD;
      conducted, rTMS treatment plans will be generated based on (pre-treatment) anatomical and&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to guide the optimal robotic positioning of the&#xD;
      TMS coil to accurately target each subject's DLPFC. Initial diagnostic interview and weekly&#xD;
      clinical follows ups will be conducted at the LRTC by research clinicians blinded to&#xD;
      subjects' research group. A comparison of baseline brain connectivity measurements with&#xD;
      subjects' neuroimaging follow ups conducted at treatment Week 3 will be conducted to identify&#xD;
      network connectivity changes potentially associated to treatment response.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in PTSD Severity as Measured by the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to three weeks (the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression Severity as Measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to three weeks (the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to seven weeks (four weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to seven weeks (four weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression. Remission from depression is defined as a MADRS score less than or equal to 10.</description>

    <measure>Remission From PTSD as Measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to sixteen weeks (twelve weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. Remission is defined as a PCL-5 score less than or equal to 33.</description>

    <measure>Remission From PTSD as Measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to sixteen weeks (twelve weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms; the range of the scores is 0-80; with a higher score indicating a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&#xD;
A traumatic event&#xD;
At least one &quot;Re-experiencing&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least one &quot;Avoidance&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least two &quot;Negative alterations in cognitions and mood&quot; symptoms&#xD;
At least two &quot;Alterations in arousal and reactivity&quot; symptoms&#xD;
The trauma must last at least a month&#xD;
The trauma must cause impairment&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to three weeks (the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Resting-state brain networks were identified using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Any changes in the the targeted brain network (e.g. the sub-genual cingulate cortex) were reported using functional connectivity Z-scores. Functional connectivity Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the baseline mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean, and lower connectivity, and positive numbers indicate values higher than the baseline mean, and higher connectivity</description>

        <title>Change in PTSD Severity as Measured by the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5)</title>
        <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

        <title>Change in PTSD Severity as Measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</title>
        <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

        <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <title>Change in PTSD Severity as Measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5)</title>
        <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms; the range of the scores is 0-80; with a higher score indicating a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&#xD;
A traumatic event&#xD;
At least one &quot;Re-experiencing&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least one &quot;Avoidance&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least two &quot;Negative alterations in cognitions and mood&quot; symptoms&#xD;
At least two &quot;Alterations in arousal and reactivity&quot; symptoms&#xD;
The trauma must last at least a month&#xD;
The trauma must cause impairment</description>

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to seven weeks (four weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
        <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <title>Change in PTSD Severity as Measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</title>
        <description>PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

        <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms; the range of the scores is 0-80; with a higher score indicating a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&#xD;
A traumatic event&#xD;
At least one &quot;Re-experiencing&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least one &quot;Avoidance&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least two &quot;Negative alterations in cognitions and mood&quot; symptoms&#xD;
At least two &quot;Alterations in arousal and reactivity&quot; symptoms&#xD;
The trauma must last at least a month&#xD;

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

        <title>Change in Depression Severity as Measured by the Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline to sixteen weeks (twelve weeks after the conclusion of rTMS treatment)</time_frame>
        <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. A clinically significant response is defined as a 10-20 point decrease in the PCL-5 scores.</description>

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

          <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. A clinically significant response is defined as a 10-20 point decrease in the PCL-5 scores.</description>
          <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms; the range of the scores is 0-80; with a higher score indicating a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&#xD;
A traumatic event&#xD;
At least one &quot;Re-experiencing&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least one &quot;Avoidance&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least two &quot;Negative alterations in cognitions and mood&quot; symptoms&#xD;
At least two &quot;Alterations in arousal and reactivity&quot; symptoms&#xD;
The trauma must last at least a month&#xD;

        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression. Clinically significant response is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% decrease in the MADRS score.</description>

        <title>Clinically Significant Response in Depression Severity as Measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</title>
        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression. Clinically significant response is defined as greater than or equal to a 50% decrease in the MADRS score.</description>

        <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. Remission is defined as a PCL-5 score less than or equal to 33.</description>

          <title>Remission From PTSD as Measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)</title>
          <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item measure that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms. Responders are asked to rate how bothered they have been by each item in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4. Items are summed to provide a total score. Severity can be determined adding scores of each item together to determine a total score. The range is 0-80, with a lower score suggesting a lower incidence of PTSD. A total score of 33 or higher suggests the patient needs further assessment to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD. Remission is defined as a PCL-5 score less than or equal to 33.</description>
          <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <description>The CAPS-5 is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current (past month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, and assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. The assessor combines information about frequency and intensity of an item into a single severity rating. CAPS-5 total symptom severity score is calculated by summing severity scores for the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms; the range of the scores is 0-80; with a higher score indicating a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms. To meet criteria for PTSD, a patient must have:&#xD;
A traumatic event&#xD;
At least one &quot;Re-experiencing&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least one &quot;Avoidance&quot; symptom&#xD;
At least two &quot;Negative alterations in cognitions and mood&quot; symptoms&#xD;
At least two &quot;Alterations in arousal and reactivity&quot; symptoms&#xD;
The trauma must last at least a month&#xD;
The trauma must cause impairment&#xD;
Remission is defined as a CAPS-5 score less than or equal to 29.</description>

        <title>Remission From Depression as Measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</title>
        <description>The PHQ-9 is a brief, 9-item scale that includes only the depression-related items from the PHQ. The PHQ-9 has been validated for use in primary care settings and can be used to make a tentative diagnosis of depression and to monitor depression severity and response to treatment in the past 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe. Remission from severe depression is defined as a PHQ-9 score less than or equal to 14.</description>

        <population>Discrepancies in the number of participants analyzed for this outcome measure occur because of 1) incomplete assessments at the designated outcome measure's time frame or 2) because the participant did not complete more than 15 treatment sessions, but were considered &quot;evaluable&quot; (&gt;10 sessions).</population>

        <title>Remission From Depression as Measured by the Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6 and the overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate increasing depressive symptoms. Cut-off points include: 0 to 6 - symptom absent, 7 to 19 - mild depression, 30 to 34 - moderate, 35 to 60 - severe depression. Remission from depression is defined as a MADRS score less than or equal to 10.</description>

        <description>Resting-state brain networks were identified using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Any changes in the the targeted brain network (e.g. the sub-genual cingulate cortex) were reported using functional connectivity Z-scores. Functional connectivity Z-score indicates the number of standard deviations away from the baseline mean. A Z-score of 0 is equal to the mean. Negative numbers indicate values lower than the mean, and lower connectivity, and positive numbers indicate values higher than the baseline mean, and higher connectivity</description>
