    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of monotherapy pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) in participants with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There will be two cohorts in this&#xD;
      study: Cohort A will consist of participants with clear cell (cc) RCC and Cohort B will&#xD;
      consist of participants with non-clear cell (ncc) RCC.&#xD;

             sarcomatoid features).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort B (non-clear cell RCC cohort) participant must have histologically confirmed&#xD;
             diagnosis of non-clear cell RCC (with or without sarcomatoid features). Participants&#xD;
             with tumors that have a component of clear cell histology are not eligible for&#xD;
             inclusion in Cohort B.&#xD;
&#xD;

             American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) or have recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received no prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy for RCC is acceptable if completed &gt;12 months prior to allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must provide adequate tissue for biomarker analysis for Cohorts A and B from an&#xD;
             archival tissue sample or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion&#xD;
             not previously irradiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving bone resorptive therapy (including but not limited to&#xD;
             bisphosphonate or RANK-L inhibitor) must have therapy initiated at least 2 weeks prior&#xD;
             to treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70%, as assessed within 10 days prior to&#xD;
             treatment allocation.&#xD;

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception for the course of the study through 120 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational&#xD;
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks prior to allocation, has had&#xD;

             protein (GITR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency OR is receiving a systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             exceeding 10 mg daily dose of prednisone or equivalent or any other form of&#xD;

             central nervous system (CNS) metastases (see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 2 years&#xD;
             OR a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known additional malignancy that has had progression or has required active&#xD;

             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ, such as breast cancer in situ, that has&#xD;
             undergone potentially curative therapy are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
