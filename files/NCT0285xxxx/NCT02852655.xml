    <textblock>
      PD-1 works to help tumor cells continue to grow and multiply. Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal antibody. Humanized monoclonal is an antibody that is designed to block&#xD;
      the action of the receptor, PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Pembrolizumab for&#xD;
      Glioblastoma but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;

             investigational agent, 4 weeks from cytotoxic therapy (except 23 days for temozolomide&#xD;
             and 6 weeks from nitrosoureas), 6 weeks from antibodies, or 4 weeks (or 5 half-lives,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subject of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             within 72 hours prior to registration. If the urine test is positive or cannot be&#xD;
             confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required. Women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age&#xD;
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea&#xD;
             with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or have had surgical&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the&#xD;
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing&#xD;
             potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable&#xD;
             of becoming pregnant, must agree to use highly effective contraception during study&#xD;
             treatment and for 120 days after study discontinuation. Highly effective contraception&#xD;
             is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True Abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sterilization: Surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when&#xD;
                  the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone&#xD;
                  level assessment (as described in item 3.1.16 above).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male Partner Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of&#xD;
                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the&#xD;
                  vasectomised male partner must be the sole partner for that participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives (including any registered and marketed&#xD;
                       contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent&#xD;
                       - including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must agree to use adequate method of contraception starting with the&#xD;
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. Examples&#xD;
             include but are not limited to symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;

             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways).&#xD;
