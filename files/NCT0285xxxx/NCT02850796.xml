      This study aims to test the efficacy and feasibility of an acceptance, mindfulness and&#xD;
      compassionate-based intervention for women with overweight and obesity without binge-eating&#xD;
      disorder (Kg-Free). Kg-Free intervention comprises 10 weekly group sessions plus 2 booster&#xD;
      fortnightly sessions (31/2months) 2h30 hours each, run in small groups at Coimbra's&#xD;
      University Hospital. The main goal of Kg-Free intervention is to reduce weight self-stigma&#xD;
      and unhealthy eating behaviours and promote quality-of-life by targeting weight-related&#xD;
      experiential avoidance and self-criticism patterns. The intervention focuses on fostering a&#xD;
      greater awareness and ability to be in contact, tolerate and accept all internal experiences&#xD;
      (even the unwanted ones, such as craving for food, fatigue, stigma and shame), rather than&#xD;
      trying to avoid, control or change them. Additionally, the intervention intents for&#xD;
      participant's to develop a compassionate attitude towards themselves, especially during&#xD;
      challenging times in order to decrease shame and self-criticism.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project aims to develop and test the efficacy of an integrated intervention (Kg-FREE),&#xD;
      based on different and complementary approaches from the 3rd generation therapies (Acceptance&#xD;
      and commitment therapies - ACT, Mindfulness and Compassion Focused Therapy) that have been&#xD;
      showing promising results individually, but that were never tested simultaneously in&#xD;
      intervention for people struggling with their eating and weight. Moreover, the intervention&#xD;
      aims to act specifically on patients' self-criticism and experiential avoidance patterns in&#xD;
      order to reduce weight-self-stigma and promote healthy behaviours and quality-of-life.&#xD;
      Indeed, several studies have been suggesting the crucial role of these emotional regulation&#xD;
      processes on behavioural modification. This study will investigate the impact of the changes&#xD;
      in several psychological processes in different obesity dimensions, such as body mass and&#xD;
      biochemical parameters associated with health risks, eating behaviours, stigma, health and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kg-FREE intervention encloses 10 weekly group sessions (2, 5 hours/ each), highly&#xD;
      experiential followed by two 2 booster fortnightly sessions. The intervention is divided into&#xD;
      several modules, that are applied in a structured way: a) psycho education related to eating&#xD;
      and physical exercise healthy habits; b) how our brain works and how does this relate to our&#xD;
      eating and weight; c) Life values identifications to enhance intrinsic motivation; d)&#xD;
      cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance as maladaptive strategies that underlie the&#xD;
      psychological suffering, the negative affect (e.g. shame) and self-criticism; e) mindfulness&#xD;
      exercises as a more adaptive strategy for emotional regulation; f) development of&#xD;
      self-compassion as an antidote for shame and self-criticism, activating the soothing system&#xD;
      and deactivating the threat system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kg-Free sessions were carried out by a clinical psychologist with previous training in&#xD;
      contextual-behavioral therapies and one clinical psychology master student. The intervention&#xD;
      protocol was built upon pre-existent ACT and mindfulness-based protocols for people with&#xD;
      eating and weight issues (e.g., Forman et al., 2013; Kristeller &amp; Wolever, 2011; Lillis et&#xD;
      al., 2009; Tapper et al., 2009). Additionally, and because it has been recognized the&#xD;
      importance of integrating compassion in behavioural interventions (e.g., Luoma &amp; Platt,&#xD;
      2015), specially to deal with shame and self-criticism (Gilbert, 2010) a compassion component&#xD;
      was added. This component aimed at training participants to develop a more accepting and kind&#xD;
      relationship with themselves, particularly when things go wrong or when facing errors or&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All session followed the same basic structure, starting with 30 minutes of shared experience,&#xD;
      followed by a five-minute mindfulness practice. Then the session content was delivered,&#xD;
      followed by an eating mindfulness practice to train the ability to pay attention to food and&#xD;
      eating physical sensations. Finally, the session content was briefly revised and practices&#xD;
      for the week were established (e.g., mindfulness or compassion exercises). A participants'&#xD;
      manual was provided, which included the targeted constructs, examples and exercise sheets.&#xD;
      Audio files were given to the participants to ensure the practice of mindfulness and&#xD;
      compassion exercises between sessions. Moreover, a Portuguese therapist manual was also&#xD;
      assembled and is available upon request.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously to data collection, ethical approval was obtained from Clinical Trials Unit from&#xD;
      Coimbra's University Hospital. Participants were adult women, aged between 18 and 55 years&#xD;
      old, with overweight or obesity (BMI â‰¥ 25) without binge-eating, enrolled in nutritional&#xD;
      treatment for weight loss in primary care units and Hospitals from Coimbra's district,&#xD;
      Portugal. Participants were recruited directly at the medical care units in the day of their&#xD;
      appointment. Participants were informed about the voluntary and confidential nature of the&#xD;
      data. Also, a brief overview of the treatment program was presented and participants were&#xD;
      required to sign the informed consent. In order to assure confidentiality a numerical unique&#xD;
      code was assigned to each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility assessment, participants that meet inclusion criteria were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into one of the two study conditions - experimental group that will receive the&#xD;
      Kg-Free intervention and a control group that will maintain Treatment as usual (which&#xD;
      consisted in dietary and physical activity support), using a using a computer-based random&#xD;
      allocation. The study followed the principle of treatment received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprised four different assessment moments (M0, M1, M2 e M3), namely before&#xD;
      intervention (M0), at the end of the intervention (M1) and two follow-up moments at three&#xD;
      (M2) and six months (M3) after the intervention. In all assessments data regarding&#xD;
      participants' biochemical (lipid profile) and body mass parameters, eating behaviours,&#xD;
      health, stigma and quality of life as well as psychological processes was collected.&#xD;
      Regarding biochemical data, the blood samples were collected and analysed by the clinical&#xD;
      analysis laboratory from the Pharmacy department. Confidentiality was assured hence only the&#xD;
      research code for each participant was provided to the laboratory. All participants were&#xD;
      weighted with their street clothes (without shoes) using the same Body Composition Analyzer&#xD;
      (Tanita TBF-300) accurate to 0.1kg. Waist circumference was measured using a tape measure at&#xD;
      the umbilicus. The remaining data collection was carried out by clinical psychologists from&#xD;
      the research team (blinded to participant's treatment condition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis All data analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the&#xD;
      Social Sciences (SPSS, V.20) and alpha level was set at .05. Independent sample t tests were&#xD;
      used in order to compare intervention and control groups at baseline. Power analysis for&#xD;
      ANCOVA was calculated at priori. Using a significance level of p&lt;.05 and a power of 80%, a&#xD;
      sample size of 31 per group (N = 62) was needed to detect a standardized effect size of f =&#xD;
      0.40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test between-group differences at post-treatment ANCOVA with baseline as covariate and&#xD;
      condition as a fixed factor were performed. Paired samples t-tests were performed to explore&#xD;
      within-group differences from pre to post test, for each group separately. All effect sizes&#xD;
      were calculated using Cohen's d.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second study, Repeated Measures ANOVA was performed to test differences between&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post- treatment and 3month follow-up assessments for all participant's that&#xD;
      completed Kg-Free intervention (N = 53). Whenever sphericity assumption was violated, the&#xD;
      Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used to produce a valid F-ratio. Post-Hoc analyses using&#xD;
      Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to explore pairwise differences&#xD;
      (pre-to-post treatment; pre-to-3 months and post-to-3 months). Effect sizes were calculated&#xD;
      using partial eta square (Æž2). Finally, to explore the psychological processes that underlie&#xD;
      the changes in health and weight and eating-related outcomes after the Kg-Free intervention&#xD;
      MEMORE macro (Mediation and Moderation analysis for Repeated measures designs) was used.&#xD;
      MEMORE allows for the estimation of total, direct, and indirect effects of independent&#xD;
      variable (X) on dependent variable (Y) through one or more mediators (M) simultaneously&#xD;
      two-occasion within-subjects design.&#xD;
