  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind phase II&#xD;
      trial. The randomization will be a 1:1 randomization (experimental arm:control arm). This&#xD;
      study will enroll patients with histologically confirmed esophagogastric adenocarcinoma with&#xD;
      metastatic disease. Patients will have had no previous chemotherapy for metastatic&#xD;
      esophagogastric cancer. Patients will receive nintedanib or placebo in combination with&#xD;
      mFOLFOX6 (5-Fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 bolus on day 1, 5-Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m2 continuous&#xD;
      infusion over 46 hours starting on day 1, Leucovorin 400 mg/m2 on day 1, Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2&#xD;
      on day 1) via IV infusions every 2 weeks (14 days). Dose modification of nintedanib or&#xD;
      placebo and mFOLFOX6 is allowed. Patients may continue to receive protocol therapy as long as&#xD;
      they have not experienced any adverse events requiring permanent discontinuation of study&#xD;
      medication and have not demonstrated disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that progression free survival (PFS) is&#xD;
      prolonged in HER2-negative patients with untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      when treated with nintedanib plus modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) as compared to placebo plus&#xD;
      mFOLFOX6. The analyses will be performed when 124 events for PFS will have been observed in&#xD;
      the pooled arms.&#xD;
