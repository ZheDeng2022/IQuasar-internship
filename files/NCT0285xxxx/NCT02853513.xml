      The scientific approach of this project proposes to build a cohort of &quot;psychological&#xD;
      injuries&quot; post-attack of 13 November 2015. This is called patients &quot;involved&quot;, ie patients&#xD;
      who directly witnessed the events and having the most either came under automatic gunfire or&#xD;
      were close to an explosion, whether or not physically injured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to define and validate a model of transition from acute stress disorder&#xD;
      (ASD) to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for better detection of the risk of unfavorable&#xD;
      and thus better patient supported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step is to determine independent risk factors found in analytic prospective cohort&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bayesian models are well suited to exercise because they can integrate (i) the context&#xD;
      related to the patient, (ii) the context related to the trauma itself, and (iii) the&#xD;
      immediate reactions and long-term to the latter . They are particularly suited to&#xD;
      understanding the brain disordered by saying down information (prior probability) wrong by&#xD;
      improper memory of the traumatic event. The confrontation of these descending information and&#xD;
      perceived bottom-information could be partly responsible for the symptoms of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once validated, the model will characterize the individual level the most at risk of&#xD;
      unfavorable patients (calculating a probability of developing PTSD) and to assess the&#xD;
      epidemiological impact on long-term cohort of event considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These determinations are necessary prerequisites to optimize the means of support for these&#xD;
      current and future casualties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators main objective is to define a Bayesian model describing a resilient&#xD;
      functioning facing a trauma which also allows to describe a possible evolution of the ASD to&#xD;
      PTSD by an error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The state of PTSD or not will be determined by the PCL-S scale.&#xD;
