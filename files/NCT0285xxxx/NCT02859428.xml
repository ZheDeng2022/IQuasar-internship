      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) usually progresses slowly. Researchers want to learn more&#xD;
      about how its symptoms change over time. They want to look for changes in the blood and cells&#xD;
      of people with the most common forms of HSP that might allow them to better understand the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about common forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia and find out how it&#xD;
      progresses over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 7 and older with SPG3A, SPG4A, or SPG31&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1 two-hour visit each year for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 1 visit, adult participants may have a skin biopsy. An area of skin will be numbed then a&#xD;
      tool will remove a small piece of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits, all participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits, participants will do a few tasks like walking quickly and climbing stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can give permission for their skin cells, DNA samples, and data to be used in&#xD;
      other studies. The samples and data will have no identifying information.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Neurogenetics Branch (NGB) within the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and&#xD;
      Stroke (NINDS) is conducting a study to evaluate patients with hereditary spastic paraplegia&#xD;
      types 3A, 4 and 31. The objective of this study is to understand disease progression in these&#xD;
      closely related forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia using validated rating scales such as&#xD;
      the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS), and Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short&#xD;
      Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). We also hope to develop biomarkers that could be used in&#xD;
      future treatment trials from human serum and by utilizing transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) to determine central motor conduction times and resting motor thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this protocol is to study the natural history of the most common&#xD;
      forms of autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia. The information obtained from&#xD;
      validated rating scales (SPRS and SF-36), TMS, and serum biomarkers, will allow for the&#xD;
      development of treatment trials. In some cases, blood or other biologic samples (including&#xD;
      skin biopsies) will be obtained for future laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of participants to be enrolled will be set to 300.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study of autosomal dominant forms of hereditary spastic paraplegia&#xD;
      progression, pathophysiology, and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will track disease progression using the Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale&#xD;
      (SPRS) and SF-36. Also, we will measure levels of plasma lipids, insulin, leptin, and of&#xD;
      certain micro RNAs to investigate their utility as biomarkers. We will utilize TMS (combined&#xD;
      with nerve conducting studies) to assess central motor conduction times (CMCT) and resting&#xD;
      motor thresholds (RMT).&#xD;
