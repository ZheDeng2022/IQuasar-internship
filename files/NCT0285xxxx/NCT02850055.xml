      Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent symptoms that causes more disability in patients with&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The present study postulates a possible link between&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and inner ear based on their anatomical, biomechanical and&#xD;
      physiological relationship, proposing a physiotherapy treatment for the temporomandibular&#xD;
      joint to improve tinnitus. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of adding&#xD;
      specific manual therapy to a multimodal physiotherapy treatment in patients with tinnitus and&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorder.&#xD;

      1. - INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent symptoms that causes more disability in patients&#xD;
           with temporomandibular disorder (TMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to various studies, the incidence varies between 19-69%, with a 2:1 ratio&#xD;
           between women and men, being higher in Western industrialized countries. Frequent&#xD;
           conjunction between TMJ problems and tinnitus has led to propose the existence of a link&#xD;
           between these two clinical entities. However, the mechanism linking TMD and this&#xD;
           otologic symptom is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study postulates an association based on the anatomical relationship between&#xD;
           the TMJ and the inner ear. The ligaments of the inner ear bones are close to TMJ&#xD;
           ligaments so the movements of the mandibular condyle may influence on them. The&#xD;
           discomallear ligaments (DML) and the anterior mallear ligament (AML) can be considered&#xD;
           as intrinsic ligaments of the TMJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TMJ blood supply depends on the tympanic and auricular arteries, and in its innervations&#xD;
           are involved nerve branches of the masseter, lateral and temporal/ internal pterygoid,&#xD;
           key muscles for the condylar movements (open and close the mouth and lateral movements).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypothesis supporting the link between the TMJ and the tinnitus is that the forced&#xD;
           movements of the mandibular condyle produce a ligaments stretching and muscles tension,&#xD;
           being the cause of otologic problems such as tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tinnitus is defined as the perception of a sound that does not exist in the environment.&#xD;
           It is often described as &quot;a buzz, a beep, a noise&quot;. Most conservative treatments for&#xD;
           tinnitus have focused on pharmacological treatments (particularly antidepressants),&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral treatments, medical low strength laser therapies, acupuncture,&#xD;
           cranial magnetic stimulation, music therapy and environmental sounds reduction&#xD;
           technologies. However, there is controversial evidence on the effectiveness of these&#xD;
           techniques given the heterogeneity of protocols and of the response variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Is understood as TMJ pathology, those organic or functional nosological entities&#xD;
           affecting the craneomandibular system relationship. They encompass a large number of&#xD;
           disorders, not only traumatic, neoplastic, autoimmune or infectious, but also those&#xD;
           deriving from dysfunctional alteration of its internal structure, both muscle and&#xD;
           joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TMJ disorders with a myofascial or joint dysfunction origin are those whose origin is in&#xD;
           myofascial muscle disorders or in joint by mechanical causes. Myofascial trigger points&#xD;
           pain, described by Travell and Simons, corresponds to a noninflammatory regional muscle&#xD;
           pathology that can occur in any striated muscle of the body. Its main feature is the&#xD;
           presence of a hypersensitive area called trigger point, which is present in a palpable&#xD;
           taut band of muscle tissue and has the ability to refer pain to distant areas. Joint&#xD;
           dysfunction is defined as one in which occurs an abnormal relationship between the joint&#xD;
           disk and the condyle, the fossa and the TMJ eminence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Many treatments have been applied to the TMJ with varying degrees of evidence: the&#xD;
           prevention of bad habits and parafunctions; contract/relax muscles and mental exercises;&#xD;
           heat / cold in pain or contracture areas; physiotherapy; psychotherapy; biofeedback&#xD;
           techniques with self-relaxation procedures; resting splints, muscle discharge or&#xD;
           recapture; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and ultrasound and drug&#xD;
           treatment: NSAIDs, analgesics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, muscle relaxants and&#xD;
           antidepressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In most cases, the physiotherapy in patients with TMD is focused on myofascial treatment&#xD;
           and massage and, at present, in manual therapy (for pain control and improving joint&#xD;
           movement). All of this, usually combined with splints or bite plates (for pain control,&#xD;
           bruxism and improving occlusion), although there is little evidence supporting their&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In relation to myofascial therapy, massage applied on the masticatory muscles, protocols&#xD;
           of manual therapy on TMJ, as well as mobilization and manipulation techniques of the&#xD;
           upper cervical spine, there is a wide and proven evidence of the improvement occurring&#xD;
           in pain, mouth maximum mouth opening and in pressure pain threshold in patients with&#xD;
           TMD; although systematic reviews on all manual therapy techniques present a&#xD;
           controversial evidence, given the heterogeneity of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the literature review made, it has not been found any paper issuing a proposal or&#xD;
           treatment protocol of the TMJ presenting among its main objectives the control of the&#xD;
           intensity of TMJ pain and the decrease of disability that tinnitus produces.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Only one found study proposes a treatment to reduce the intensity of TMJ pain and to&#xD;
           improve the disability that tinnitus produces by using a bite splint, without performing&#xD;
           a manual intervention therapy and exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of the present study is to raise a proposal of treatment with manual therapy&#xD;
           and exercise aiming to reduce the disability caused by tinnitus and the intensity of&#xD;
           pain and disability caused by the TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent symptoms that causes more disability in patients&#xD;
           with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The frequency with which concur the problems of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and&#xD;
           tinnitus, has led to propose the existence of an association between these two clinical&#xD;
           entities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The present study postulates the possible link developing an&#xD;
           anatomical-pathophysiological hypothesis based on the relationship between TMJ and inner&#xD;
           ear, proposing a treatment applied to temporomandibular joint for improving TMJ pain and&#xD;
           tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of specific manual therapy techniques (TM) within a multimodal physiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment is more effective in improving TMJ pain and disability that causes tinnitus that&#xD;
      the isolated application of multimodal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      General:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical therapy&#xD;
      in patients with tinnitus and TMD with a myofascial origin or joint dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical&#xD;
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in reducing pain intensity and disability&#xD;
           caused by TMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical&#xD;
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in reducing the intensity of tinnitus and&#xD;
           disability caused by tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical&#xD;
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in increasing the range of motion of the TMJ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical&#xD;
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in the painful rise by pressuring the&#xD;
           masseter, temporal and lateral pterygoid muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate the effectiveness of adding specific manual therapy to a multimodal physical&#xD;
           therapy in patients with tinnitus and TMD in the quality of life, level of anxiety /&#xD;
           depression and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of study: randomized and controlled pilot study, multicenter, blinded randomization,&#xD;
      patient assessment and data analysis. Treatment characteristics themselves prevent their&#xD;
      blinded application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Location: 3 private consultation rooms of specialized physiotherapy in TMD. Study subjects:&#xD;
      56 patients with temporomandibular dysfunction and tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will receive six treatment sessions, two sessions in the first week and a weekly&#xD;
      session to complete the intervention. The total duration of the intervention shall be one&#xD;
      month. Before starting the study, all patients will be asked to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS 22.0 program (IBM statistical&#xD;
      software). The average and the standard deviation of quantitative variables will be&#xD;
      calculated for the descriptive analysis of the sample if normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the comparative analysis, developed according to the intention to treat:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An ANOVA for repeated measure test should be carry out to evaluate the interaction&#xD;
           between levels of inter - subject factor (treatment) and the intra- subject (main&#xD;
           variables response in time) to be interpreted in case it is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm whether this interaction effect is significant, pairwise comparisons will be&#xD;
           made of the inter-subjects factor levels (treatment) for each level of main response&#xD;
           variables over time using the Bonferroni method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study - Masking: The nature of the applied treatments prevents masking&#xD;
      therapists and patients. This limitation is inherent to the type of treatment evaluated and&#xD;
      common with other forms of treatment with similar characteristics, in which therapist should&#xD;
      inevitably know the type of treatment that is applied. However, this limitation does not&#xD;
      prevent the controlled clinical trials carried out on these technologies from being of higher&#xD;
      methodological quality. Thus, in this study, randomization of patients will be blinded,&#xD;
      allocation of the random sequence, the assessment of patient evolution and analysis of&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
