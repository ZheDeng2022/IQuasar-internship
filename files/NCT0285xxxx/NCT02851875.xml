      The purpose of the Duke Scleroderma Registry (DSScR) is to obtain information about&#xD;
      scleroderma. This information could be used in future research to increase the understanding&#xD;
      of disease mechanisms, treatments, and outcomes. This research may also help develop new&#xD;
      therapies, novel measures of disease assessment or identify previously unknown manifestations&#xD;
      of the diseases. A prospectively followed cohort is an integral component of future&#xD;
      translational and clinical research programs. A registry for scleroderma would allow for&#xD;
      information to be gleaned about patients in &quot;real-world situations&quot; in an effort to improve&#xD;
      the reality, generalizability and applicability of information gathered.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Duke Scleroderma Registry (DSScR) will include 3 types of data collected at each standard&#xD;
      of care office visit, generally every 3-6 months. The data will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical data obtained by clinicians and entered electronically into a secure database&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory, procedure, and imaging data obtained over the course of clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Photographs of clinically relevant physical findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data that will be stored include historical data on patients' disease and concurrent medical&#xD;
      conditions, physical exam findings, laboratory values, imaging and other diagnostic testing&#xD;
      results, detailed list of medications and treatments, and quality of life questionnaire data.&#xD;
      Historical information will include detailed medical, obstetric, surgical, procedural,&#xD;
      social, and family history of disease comparable to information gathered at a typical initial&#xD;
      visit. No protected health information will be collected or stored on family members. Data&#xD;
      collected will be stored in a secure computer database as well as in a clinic note and will&#xD;
      be used for patient care purposes. Protected health information (PHI) that will accompany&#xD;
      subject data include name, medical record number, address, phone number, date of birth, dates&#xD;
      of diagnoses, dates of procedures, and dates of clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The database will be maintained indefinitely; there is no planned endpoint to the collection&#xD;
      of the data and maintenance of the database as the investigators are planning a long term&#xD;
      prospective evaluation of persons with these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be serially approached/recruited from existing patients in the Duke&#xD;
      Rheumatology Adult Clinic. The project will be introduced to each prospective subject by&#xD;
      someone involved in their clinical care. A waiver of consent and Health Insurance Portability&#xD;
      and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization has been filed for the Duke Scleroderma&#xD;
      Registry. Persons who have been diagnosed with scleroderma will be identified through&#xD;
      monitoring of outpatient clinic lists and the inpatient consult service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research records will be archived upon completion of the study. Subject initials and study&#xD;
      number will be used to identify subjects in the research material and on research specimens.&#xD;
      All electronic data is stored on the shared drive and secured through the following Duke&#xD;
      Health Technology Services approved methods: access rights granted and terminated for&#xD;
      authorized users only, secure laptops and workstations, individual identifier plus password&#xD;
      protection, routine electronic back up, network restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the initial screening process, no identifying information (e.g., name, address) will&#xD;
      be kept. During the consent process, participants will be informed of data storage and&#xD;
      confidentiality safeguards, which are practiced according to HIPAA regulations. Each&#xD;
      participant will be assigned a unique identifier (ID) number. All data will be de-identified&#xD;
      and coded with this number only.&#xD;
