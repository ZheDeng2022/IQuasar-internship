  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition affects until 70% of the patients hospitalized in geriatric's units and&#xD;
      constitutes an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality. Malnutrition is also&#xD;
      associated with increased length of stay and increased costs, and alters the quality of life.&#xD;
      Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) play a key role in the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      malnutrition in older people. ONS are a simple way to offer in a small volume a nutritional&#xD;
      supply with a high density of calorie and protein. The clinical efficiency of ONS is well&#xD;
      demonstrated whether on nutritional parameters or on clinical outcomes. However,&#xD;
      acceptability and consumption of these ONS are frequently suboptimal: in geriatrics, only 50%&#xD;
      to 65% of the prescribed volumes of ONS are consumed. The reasons are multiple: anorexia,&#xD;
      taste changes, monotony … also partly because patients dislike flavor, taste or texture. The&#xD;
      respect of patients' preferences is essential to improve the therapeutic observance to ONS.&#xD;
      Generally, ONS are delivered after the patient has told his preferences orally to the&#xD;
      dietitian. To date, there is no study evaluating the effect of an alternative strategy based&#xD;
      on a preliminary degustation of several products on the effective consumption of ONS in&#xD;
      geriatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as prospective, randomized, controlled, open study to test this&#xD;
      strategy in older undernourished people hospitalized in geriatrics who require prescription&#xD;
      of ONS. This study will be performed among 220 older people hospitalized in two departments&#xD;
      of geriatrics of the AP-HM (Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Marseille).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the therapeutic observance to ONS when products are&#xD;
      delivered to older people according to the usual way (preferences announced orally and/or&#xD;
      dietitian's choice) or according to an alternative strategy based on a preliminary&#xD;
      degustation of several products varying for flavor and texture but always in respect of the&#xD;
      medical prescription. The secondary objective is to compare the evolution of the nutritional&#xD;
      status estimated by routinely used clinical and biological parameters, as well as the main&#xD;
      clinical outcomes during the hospital stay. Lastly, the nutritional status of these patients&#xD;
      will be reevaluated clinically 3 months after the hospital's discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a strategy based on a preliminary degustation, leading to an informed&#xD;
      choice, will significantly improve the acceptability and the effective consumption of ONS&#xD;
      during the hospital stay, and will also impact positively the nutritional status at&#xD;
      hospital's discharge and 3 months after. The validation of this hypothesis could allow&#xD;
      recommending the generalization of preliminary degustation of ONS at the time of their&#xD;
      prescription to optimize the therapeutic observance in undernourished older people.&#xD;
