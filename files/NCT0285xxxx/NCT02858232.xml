  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Target Antigen Stimulating Cell Therapy (MASCT-I) is a new immunotherapy that&#xD;
      dendritic cells(DC) was induced from autologous peripheral blood. The DC can then be loaded&#xD;
      with antigens and re-infused. In vitro, antigen-pulsed DC can stimulate autologous T-cell&#xD;
      proliferation and induction of autologous specific cytotoxic T-cells(CTL)，similarly&#xD;
      re-infused. The previous research data showed that MASCT had the modest overall response and&#xD;
      less adverse effects for Hepatocellular Carcinoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is aimed to evaluate the safety of MASCT-1 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      This study is divided into two stages. The first stage is the safety study in small samples,&#xD;
      and the second stage is the sample size expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40-50 patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors who had failed after standard&#xD;
      treatment will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
