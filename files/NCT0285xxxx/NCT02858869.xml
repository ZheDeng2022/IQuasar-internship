    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the side effects of giving pembrolizumab together with stereotactic&#xD;
      radiosurgery to treat patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      the brain. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy&#xD;
      that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may cause less&#xD;
      damage to normal tissue. Giving pembrolizumab together with stereotactic radiosurgery may be&#xD;
      a better treatment for patients with melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to the brain.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of three different stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) radiation arms&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab for melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain&#xD;
      metastasis (BM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate intracranial outcomes - control of the treated lesion in the brain with SRS+&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (i.e. local control), development of additional sites of disease in the brain&#xD;
      that were not initially treated with SRS (i.e. anywhere intra-cranial failure), intra-cranial&#xD;
      progression free survival (local control of the area that received SRS and anywhere&#xD;
      intra-cranial failure), extra-cranial disease response (overall progression free survival),&#xD;
      rate of leptomeningeal dissemination, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the overall response rate and overall survival of combination SRS and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab compared to SRS alone (historical control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the overall response rate and overall survival of combination SRS and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab compared to pembrolizumab alone (historical control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate treatment response at un-irradiated and extra-cranial sites (i.e. the&#xD;
      abscopal effect) with all three arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare differences in potential immune biomarkers, pretreatment, during treatment, and&#xD;
      post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (SRS 6 Gy, CLOSED): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks (Q3W) for at least 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo 5 SRS fractions between days 2-15 of&#xD;
      course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (SRS 9 Gy): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A. Patients undergo 3 SRS&#xD;
      fractions between days 2-15 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (SRS 18-21 Gy): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV as in Arm A. Patients undergo 1 SRS&#xD;
      fraction between days 2-3 of course 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 1 year.&#xD;
