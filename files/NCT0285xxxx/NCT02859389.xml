  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at risk for neurocognitive deficits,&#xD;
      reduced educational and psychosocial outcomes, and lower quality of life. Neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessment is frequently implemented during therapy and continued into survivorship to&#xD;
      monitor functioning and to facilitate intervention. Children with Down Syndrome (DS) are at&#xD;
      10 to 20-fold increased risk for leukemia. Survival rates for leukemia patients with DS are&#xD;
      comparable to or lower than patients without DS, however, these patients are at greater risk&#xD;
      for treatment-related toxicities. Children with preexisting neurodevelopmental conditions,&#xD;
      including DS, are systematically excluded from neurocognitive assessment on clinical trials,&#xD;
      contributing to a gap in the investigators understanding of outcomes in these patients with&#xD;
      preexisting neurocognitive vulnerability. The investigators propose a novel preliminary&#xD;
      investigation of functional outcomes in children with DS and childhood leukemia. This study&#xD;
      has implications for future treatment of leukemia patients with DS, and may generalize to&#xD;
      leukemia patients with other predispositions or preexisting neurodevelopmental conditions&#xD;
      (e.g., genetic disorders, acquired brain injury, autism, and epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes in survivors of childhood leukemia&#xD;
           with Down Syndrome using a novel assessment approach.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit survivors of childhood leukemia with DS to participate in a&#xD;
      one-time assessment of neurocognitive and psychosocial functioning. Potentially eligible&#xD;
      families will be identified via medical record review at St. Jude Children's Research&#xD;
      Hospital (SJCRH) and contacted to discuss study objectives, assess interest, and confirm&#xD;
      eligibility. Eligible families will be scheduled for one study visit, estimated to last about&#xD;
      2.5 hours. Participants will provide informed consent prior to the start of any study&#xD;
      procedures. Survivors who are â‰¥ 5 years old will complete performance-based neurocognitive&#xD;
      measures. Caregivers (i.e., parents or legal guardians) of all participants, regardless of&#xD;
      age, will complete ratings of executive function, behavior, and adaptive skills. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to identify and provide written permission to contact a secondary informant&#xD;
      (e.g., teacher or work supervisor). Identified informants will be contacted by study team&#xD;
      members and asked to complete behavior rating scales.&#xD;
