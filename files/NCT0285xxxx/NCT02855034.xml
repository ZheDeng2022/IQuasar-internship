  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head injury is a frequent motive of consultation in paediatric emergency units and the first&#xD;
      cause of mortality in infants of more than one year old in developped countries. The&#xD;
      indication of performing cerebral CT scans currently depends on clinical decision based on&#xD;
      recommendations used in adults. In this way, 60 to 90% of scans are normal in children with&#xD;
      head injury. CT scan is expensive and irradiating with the risk of increasing the cancer in&#xD;
      children. Protein S100B and copeptin are biomarkers which have shown their ability to detect&#xD;
      cerebral lesion in children with head injury. (protein S100B and /or in adults protein S100B&#xD;
      and copetin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the first clinical biological evaluation of severity of head injury based on dosing of&#xD;
      copeptin alone or associated with protein S100B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the evaluation of the biomarkers GFAP, NFL, Tau and UCHL-1 is today necessary&#xD;
      from a scientific point of view and to optimize the diagnostic and prognostic value of these&#xD;
      biomarkers which can be combined. Indeed, these protein biomarkers are biologically linked to&#xD;
      the protein S100B and copeptin, and will allow a more specific and more thorough evaluation&#xD;
      of the presence of brain damage at the cellular level. More specifically, the measurement of&#xD;
      the S-100B and GFAP proteins will allow evaluation of gliovascular damage while those of&#xD;
      copeptin, NFL, Tau and UCHL1 proteins will allow evaluation of neuronal damage. The assay of&#xD;
      these different biomarkers will also be carried out on a control population, without head&#xD;
      injury or neurological or inflammatory pathologies, in order to establish the standards of&#xD;
      these biomarkers on a pediatric population of similar age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      265 children or infants will be recruited during 84 months. 220 patients with a suspicion of&#xD;
      head injury and 45 patients without head injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will attend a visit of inclusion and a blood sample. Just patients with a&#xD;
      suspicion of head injury have a visit at 96 hours +/- 24 hours after the inclusion: this&#xD;
      visit is made by phone. The patient and his parents will have to answer to a phone&#xD;
      questionnaire&#xD;
