  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous high-dose amoxicillin is a frequently prescribed antibiotic in intensive care&#xD;
      units and infectious disease departments, in such indications as meningitis, endocarditis,&#xD;
      listeriosis, or documented susceptible osteo-articular infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among possible side effects is the occurrence of amoxicillin crystalluria. Its incidence is&#xD;
      unknown. It is deemed uncommon but literature is poor and its incidence is probably&#xD;
      under-estimated. It can be complicated with hematuria or acute renal failure and may require&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy. measures that can limit the impact of this nephrology&#xD;
      crystalluria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the beginning of 2014, because of the occurrence of a case of macroscopic crystalluria&#xD;
      in our unit and a pharmacovigilance alert, it has been decided to search systematically for&#xD;
      amoxicillin crystalluria in several centers of the north-east of France. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to study these patients, through an observational study of a multicenter longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort, to assess the incidence of amoxicillin crystalluria during high dose intravenous&#xD;
      amoxicillin treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amoxicillin is an antibiotic of the family of β-lactams and sub-family penicillin A. It has a&#xD;
      time-dependent bactericidal activity. It is mainly active on many bacterial species&#xD;
      frequently found in infectious diseases. It can be administered orally or parenterally. It is&#xD;
      therefore a frequently prescribed antibiotic, alone or in combination. Its elimination is&#xD;
      mainly urinary in its active form. It is frequently prescribed intravenously at high doses in&#xD;
      infectious disease departments, in indications like meningitis, endocarditis, listeriosis, or&#xD;
      documented susceptible osteo-articular infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several amoxicillin treatment side effects have been reported, like hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions, gastrointestinal adverse reactions, mucocutaneous candidiasis, nervous system&#xD;
      toxicity and eventually kidney disease, namely the occurrence of crystalluria or acute&#xD;
      interstitial nephritis of whose frequency is undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature concerning the occurrence of crystalluria is mainly based on Case reports and&#xD;
      there are no incidence data. Crystalluria is characterized by the presence of amoxicillin&#xD;
      trihydrate crystals in urine, after amoxicillin urinary supersaturation. The appearance is&#xD;
      that of large needles, isolated or aggregated into &quot;broom bush-like&quot; crystal, 50-300µm, with&#xD;
      birefringent under polarized light. Amoxicillin crystalluria may be of varying importance,&#xD;
      microscopic or macroscopic, sometimes up to urinary tract obstruction and may cause acute&#xD;
      renal failure (ARF) and require renal replacement therapy. A low urine output could be&#xD;
      associated with the occurrence of crystalluria, as well as a urine pH between 5 and 7, a high&#xD;
      urinary density and high doses of amoxicillin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amoxicillin crystalluria is deemed uncommon. In the national pharmacovigilance database, in&#xD;
      November 2013, there were only 9 reported cases, from 12 to 78 years old, 5 of whom severe&#xD;
      one of which life-threatening. There is a high underreporting in these data, and it seems&#xD;
      that this impact is highly underestimated for several reasons: amoxicillin crystalluria is&#xD;
      not sought in routine clinical practice in all centers, even with high dose administrated. It&#xD;
      is not clinically detectable if microscopic and even if a urine culture is performed,&#xD;
      amoxicillin crystals may be mistaken for other crystals. In the investigator's experience&#xD;
      automated systems do not always detect these crystals. Moreover, patients likely to receive&#xD;
      high doses of amoxicillin are generally subject to severe infections and are more at risk of&#xD;
      acute renal failure either due to background or previously initiated therapies (like the&#xD;
      association with aminoglycosides), and the imputability of a crystalluria in the occurrence&#xD;
      of an episode of acute renal failure among these patients is seldom considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a recent increase in the number of reported cases in the national pharmacovigilance&#xD;
      database is an incentive to pay more attention to this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also think that the occurrence of an amoxicillin crystalluria, even apart&#xD;
      from extreme cases of macroscopic crystalluria complicated by oligo-anuric ARF, could&#xD;
      increase the risk of intra-hospital ARF. The demonstration of such an effect associated with&#xD;
      an incidence of significant crystalluria might justify the research in routine practice among&#xD;
      patients receiving intravenous high-dose amoxicillin (IHDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The search for amoxicillin crystalluria is rather simple, by performing a direct microscopic&#xD;
      examination of the urine. If in doubt about the diagnosis amoxicillin composition of these&#xD;
      crystals, due to an atypical appearance or concomitant administration of other drugs that may&#xD;
      generate similar crystals, the sample may be sent to a specialized laboratory for infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy to confirm that it is amoxicillin crystals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IHDA treatments would be the situations with a higher risk for crystalluria. The highlighting&#xD;
      of such an effect associated to a significant incidence of crystalluria might justify&#xD;
      systematic research recommendations in routine practice with patients receiving IHDA.&#xD;
      Following the occurrence in the infectious disease department of the Reims university&#xD;
      hospital of a case of macroscopic crystalluria complicated by ARF requiring renal replacement&#xD;
      and a pharmacovigilance alert, the search for amoxicillin crystalluria has been systematic as&#xD;
      well as in several centers of the Grand East of France with patients receiving IHDA to have&#xD;
      the possibility to watch these patients carefully at kidney level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose, through an observational study of a multicenter longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort, to assess the incidence of amoxicillin crystalluria during IHDA, to search for the&#xD;
      factors associated with the occurrence of this crystalluria and measure the impact of this&#xD;
      crystalluria on the occurrence of an episode of intra-hospital ARF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected in patients' paper or computerized record at the Center.&#xD;

      Statistical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Justification of the number of subjects needed The impact of drug related crystalluria&#xD;
           during amoxicillin treatment is unknown. Literature on this subject is composed of case&#xD;
           reports. However a frequency lower than 5% during IHDA would not be of significant&#xD;
           clinical interest. The number of subjects needed was then calculated with a 5% alpha&#xD;
           risk, an expected frequency of 10% with an accuracy of 5%, leading to a required number&#xD;
           of subjects of 139 patients. Taking into account 10% of possible exclusions, we plan to&#xD;
           include 153 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the observed incidence of crystalluria, an extension of the number of&#xD;
           subjects needed will be discussed secondarily by investigators to obtain the necessary&#xD;
           power to assess the impact of crystalluria on the risk of acute renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Statistical analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Flowchart :&#xD;
&#xD;
                The synthesis of the patients included, excluded and analyzed will be expressed in&#xD;
                the form of a flowchart.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analysis of the primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a descriptive analysis of the cumulative incidence of amoxicillin crystalluria under&#xD;
      IHDA. It will be expressed as a percentage and its 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c. Secondary endpoints : i. Descriptive analysis : Quantitative variables of normal&#xD;
      distribution are described by their mean and standard deviation, and quantitative variables&#xD;
      of non-normal distribution are described by their median and interquartile range. Qualitative&#xD;
      variables are described by their frequency and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Univariate analysis : Depending on the secondary endpoint, the variable to be explained&#xD;
      (dependent variable) is the occurrence of crystalluria or the occurrence of acute renal&#xD;
      failure. The measure of associations will be made by calculating odds ratios and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Multivariate analysis : Depending on the number of events, multivariate analysis with a&#xD;
      binary logistic regression model will be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the factors favoring the occurrence of crystalluria, the variables are those with a&#xD;
      p-value less than 0.20 in univariate analysis. Amoxicillinemia will be forced into the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the factors favoring the occurrence of acute renal failure, the variables are those with a&#xD;
      p-value less than 0.20 in univariate analysis. The occurrence of crystalluria will be forced&#xD;
      into the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The associations measurements will be made by calculating adjusted odds ratio and their 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
