      A quasi experimental study evaluating the effectiveness of a walking program at primary&#xD;
      health care settings in a low-income area&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a high prevalence of physical inactivity (AF) in the world and in Brazil. Offering&#xD;
      programs of physical activity becomes a convenient option to increase the physical activity&#xD;
      level of the population and promote aging process more active and healthy over the life.&#xD;
      There is need for greater depth in relation to the operation of programs to promote physical&#xD;
      activity and the effects of these programs on different biopsychosocial aspects, especially&#xD;
      those offered in primary care settings. This research aims to evaluate a walking program&#xD;
      geared to adults and seniors on the following aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characteristics and operation of the intervention,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. effects of behavior change to physical activity, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. biopsychosocial effects of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a quasi experimental and controlled study, with: 1) intervention group (n = 71), 2) and&#xD;
      control group (n = 71). The intervention will last for six months, with a subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up period of six months after the intervention. The program will offer supervised&#xD;
      exercise twice a week, lasting an hour. The classes will consist of recreational activities,&#xD;
      walking and educational strategies of behavior change for physical activity. Variables will&#xD;
      be evaluated for attendance, barriers to physical activity, waiver reasons, physical activity&#xD;
      level, sociodemographic, socioeconomic and biopsychosocial aspects. Most females, aged over&#xD;
      40 years, low levels of education, income and varied biopsychosocial characteristics are&#xD;
      expected. After the intervention, it is expected that the program present characteristics of&#xD;
      low adhesion and retention, especially because of the barrier &quot;lack of time&quot;. Still, the&#xD;
      promotion of supervised walking increase levels of physical activity beyond the time provided&#xD;
      by the program and it will improve the biopsychosocial conditions of the participants.&#xD;
