  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor cardiopulmonary endurance is observed in individuals with acute stroke, even in chronic.&#xD;
      In addition, the poor fitness may obstacle activities of daily life, decrease activities of&#xD;
      autonomic system, and increase risks of recurrent, therefore, the cardiopulmonary endurance&#xD;
      training should be included into the early-stage rehabilitation program. The ergocycling&#xD;
      training could improve cardiopulmonary endurance for individuals with stroke. Moreover, the&#xD;
      low-intensity exercise training can increase the willingness, and it is safer than the&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise training. However, it needs to be evaluated whether the&#xD;
      low-intensity exercise training can bring sufficient benefits, compared to the&#xD;
      moderate-intensity exercise training. Objectives of the study is to compare the exercise&#xD;
      benefits between the low-intensity and moderate-intensity exercise training, and then these&#xD;
      would offer optimal exercise prescription and considerations in clinical practice.&#xD;

      After giving their signed consent, subjects would be randomly assigned into the control group&#xD;
      (traditional rehabilitation), the low-intensity exercise group (traditional rehabilitation&#xD;
      plus low-intensity exercise training), or the moderate-intensity exercise group (traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation plus the moderate-intensity exercise training). Frequency of the exercise&#xD;
      training is 2-6 times/week, totally 20 times. In the symptom-limit exercise tolerance tests,&#xD;
      subjects wear a gas-collecting mask and electrocardiogram, and pre-set graduated loading was&#xD;
      offered by the bike. One therapists and one doctor would monitor the test. For resistance and&#xD;
      time setting within each exercise training, it is customized by results of exercise tolerance&#xD;
      tests in baseline and the allocation. Moreover, a therapist would stay with subject ,monitor&#xD;
      the training, and measure the blood pressure before and after the training.&#xD;
