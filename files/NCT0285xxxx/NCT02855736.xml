  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major health concern. Weeks following psychiatric admission are a highly suicide&#xD;
      risk period for those having current suicidal ideation or attempt. Recently, a pilot study&#xD;
      suggested the feasibility of positive psychology in patients in suicidal crisis. Notably,&#xD;
      gratitude exercises suggested improvement in optimism and hopelessness, two dimensions&#xD;
      associated to suicide. Moreover, gratitude has been associated to suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      attempt, independently from depression. Thus, investigators want to conduct the first&#xD;
      randomized controlled study in order to assess effectiveness of gratitude exercises (vs&#xD;
      control task) in suicidal inpatients, on 1) psychological pain reduction 2) suicidal&#xD;
      ideation, hopelessness, optimism, depressive symptomatology, and anxiety improvement.&#xD;

      Study design: monocentric randomized controlled study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      206 inpatients (Department of Emergency Psychiatry and Post Acute Care), between 18 and 65&#xD;
      years-old, having attempted suicide before hospitalisation or having current active suicidal&#xD;
      ideation at the time of the psychiatric hospitalisation. Patients suffering from&#xD;
      schizophrenia are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization into two groups: Positive Psychology (i.e., gratitude journal) (n = 103) or&#xD;
      Control Task (i.e., food journal) (n = 103), daily exercises during 7 days (in add-on from&#xD;
      usual treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment: 1) at baseline (the day before the intervention beginning) (V0); 2)&#xD;
      short daily self-assessments (immediately before and after the exercise); 3) the day&#xD;
      following the last day of the intervention (V1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0 : socio-demographic data, treatments, psychopathology, suicidal ideation,depressive&#xD;
           and anxious symptomatology, psychological pain, optimism, hopelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily self-assessments: psychological pain, optimism, hopelessness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1 : treatments suicidal ideation,depressive and anxious symptomatology, psychological&#xD;
           pain, optimism, hopelessness, intervention satisfaction.&#xD;
