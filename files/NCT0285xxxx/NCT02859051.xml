    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a preparation teaching intervention before IV&#xD;
      insertion, taught by MEDi to children and their parents, will lead to lower levels of&#xD;
      expected and experienced pain and fear and less distressing pain memories, as compared to&#xD;
      children who receive standard care. In addition, it will be examined whether this preparation&#xD;
      intervention will lead to greater parental self-efficacy, less anxiety, and less distressing&#xD;
      pain memories as compared to controls.&#xD;

      The primary aim is to determine the impact of using a humanoid robot in comparison to&#xD;
      standard care. This proposal describes the first study in the world to test such novel&#xD;
      technology for preparation teaching intervention before IV insertion. This work builds on&#xD;
      previous research conducted by the research team and represents a logical next step for this&#xD;
      collaborative group. This project team includes established and emerging leaders in pain&#xD;
      management research. This will ensure successful implementation and completion of the&#xD;
      project. These methods of teaching preparation have the potential for widespread application&#xD;
      to other medical procedures and clinical settings (eg. oncology dentistry) and lead to&#xD;
      improved health outcomes for children by easing their suffering and improving the quality of&#xD;
      their healthcare encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 1.) Does preparation administered by a humanoid robot (MEDi) reduce&#xD;
      expectancies and experience of pain and fear of IV insertion in children?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.) Children who receive preparation by MEDi will report expecting and&#xD;
      experiencing lower levels of fear and pain at IV insertion as compared to youth receiving&#xD;
      standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 2.) Does preparation administered by MEDi lead to higher self-efficacy and&#xD;
      lower anxiety in parents of children undergoing IV insertion?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.) Parents of children who receive preparation by MEDi will report higher levels&#xD;
      of self-efficacy and lower anxiety at their children's IV insertion as compared to youth&#xD;
      receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 3.) Do children who receive preparation administered by MEDi and their&#xD;
      parents have more accurate and positively estimated memories of pain and fear as compared to&#xD;
      youth receiving standard care and their parents?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.) Children who receive preparation administered by MEDi and their parents will&#xD;
      report more accurate and positively estimated memories of pain and fear as compared to youth&#xD;
      receiving standard care and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question 4.) Do children who receive preparation administered by MEDi prior to IV&#xD;
      insertion and their parents expect to experience less pain, fear, anxiety, and higher&#xD;
      self-efficacy in pain coping at future needle procedures as compared to youth receiving&#xD;
      standard care and their parents?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4.) Children who receive preparation administered by MEDi prior to IV insertion&#xD;
      and their parents will report expecting to experience lower pain, fear, and anxiety and&#xD;
      higher self-efficacy in pain coping at future needle procedures as compared to youth&#xD;
      receiving standard care and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study Design &amp; Setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single-centre prospective randomized, controlled, two-armed trial: (1)&#xD;
      humanoid robot, MEDi, provides preparation for intravenous placement; and (2) standard care.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from day surgery at the Alberta Children's Hospital Calgary, AB.&#xD;
      This study will follow the high methodological standards for reporting RCTs according to the&#xD;
      Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines - extension for nonpharmacological&#xD;
      treatments and this trial will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legal guardians and/or patients with the ability to understand the study will be asked to&#xD;
      provide written informed consent prior to participation. Day surgery patients, between the&#xD;
      ages of 4-12 years old who are presenting for general surgery under general anesthesia, and&#xD;
      in the American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 or 2, will be included.&#xD;
