      Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an upper extremity, task oriented training&#xD;
      program delivered at home (TOTE Home) for people who are in the subacute recovery phase of a&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      TOTE Home which includes a maximum of 30, one hour sessions of training conducted in&#xD;
      participants' homes. Repeated target measures of accelerometry and level of confidence to be&#xD;
      analyzed throughout the study. Change scores from standardized assessments to be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis following a stroke frequently leads to &quot;learned non-use&quot; of the weaker arm and&#xD;
      hand. Task oriented training has been suggested as a contemporary neurorehabilitation&#xD;
      technique. A single-subject AB series design with a follow-up was conducted to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a task oriented training program administered in participants' homes. This&#xD;
      intervention, Task Oriented Training at Home (TOTE Home), incorporated current&#xD;
      experience-dependent plasticity aspects modeled after the Acquired Skill Acquisition Program&#xD;
      (ASAP) protocol parameters and principles of task oriented training as suggested by Lang and&#xD;
      Birkenmeier in 2014. Repeated measures of accelerometry and level of confidence on a priority&#xD;
      task were analyzed with visual analysis of changes in level, trend, and slope. Change scores&#xD;
      from standardized assessments for the upper extremity, Motor Activity Log, Stroke Impact&#xD;
      Scale question of recovery, Functional Test for the Hemiparetic Upper Extremity, and Canadian&#xD;
      Occupational Performance Measure were evaluated on data collected at baseline,&#xD;
      post-intervention, and follow-up time periods.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  upper extremity hemiparesis due to a stroke but met minimal movement criteria in the&#xD;
             affected arm and hand (at least 10 degrees of active movement at the wrist, elbow, and&#xD;
             shoulder movement, along with 10 degrees of active movement in the thumb and two other&#xD;
             fingers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  minimal cognitive deficits as demonstrated by a 24 or higher on the Mini-Mental Status&#xD;
             Exam&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to identify at least five specific tasks participants wish to achieve with their&#xD;
             affected upper extremity. This was assessed with the Canadian Occupational Performance&#xD;
             Measure (COPM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  at least 21 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to communicate in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  3-12 months after their stroke which would classify them in the subacute level of&#xD;
             recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  all formal occupational therapy was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  upper extremity pain that interfered with activities of daily living&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  requiring maximal assistance for mobility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  arm or hand injury (unrelated to the stroke)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  upper extremity amputations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  inability to participate due to any illness, social or geographical reason, and any&#xD;
             other diagnosis or limiting conditions that would affect participation&#xD;
