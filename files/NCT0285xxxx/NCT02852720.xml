      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block provides effective analgesia and is now a standard of&#xD;
      care for analgesia after cesarean section. There is no information on levobupivacaine&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics post TAP after pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Generate a pharmacokinetic levobupivacaine model and its effect on the&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The investigators will study 12 healthy term pregnant patients, scheduled for&#xD;
      elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. A bilateral TAP block is performed with 20&#xD;
      ml 0.25% levobupivacaine with epinephrine 5 ug/ml. Sensory block will be assessed at 1-2-6&#xD;
      and 12 hours post puncture. 2 ml of venous blood will be obtained at 2-5-10-30-45-60-90 and&#xD;
      180 minutes. With a Holter machine we will study the effect of levobupivacaine plasma levels&#xD;
      and the QTc changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: 1) Plasma levobupivacaine levels; 2) Changes in QTc .&#xD;

      Introduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post cesarean section pain control is a challenging task since it is one of the ten most&#xD;
      painful surgeries. Multiple strategies have been proposed for pain control, including&#xD;
      neuraxial analgesia, systemic opioids, non-opioid drugs and peripheral nerve blocks, among&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus abdominal plane (TAP) blocks have been proven to provide effective analgesia when&#xD;
      used as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen after abdominal surgery and is becoming a&#xD;
      popular technique for post cesarean section analgesia, although recent reports of local&#xD;
      anesthesia toxicity have raised concerns about its safety in this population. Currently there&#xD;
      is no information on the pharmacokinetics of levobupivacaine of the technique in pregnant&#xD;
      patients to guide dosing in a safer way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to generate a pharmacokinetic model to characterize the plasmatic levels of&#xD;
      levobupivacaine co-administered with epinephrine and its effect on the ECG, for TAP block in&#xD;
      post cesarean section patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 12 term pregnant&#xD;
      patients American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, scheduled for&#xD;
      elective cesarean section were recruited in this prospective, single-blind pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      study. Patients were excluded if they had any allergy/sensitivity to local anaesthetic,&#xD;
      significant renal or liver dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous (18-gauge) catheter was placed under local anesthesia for co hydration. After&#xD;
      the initiation of standard monitoring (continuous electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure, and pulse oximetry), all patients received a spinal anesthesia in the L3-L4&#xD;
      or L4-L5 interspace with hyperbaric bupivacaine 0,75% 1,4 ml plus 20 ug fentanyl to achieve a&#xD;
      bilateral anesthetic level of T4 determined by pinprick. After surgery, a TAP block was&#xD;
      performed with 20 mL of 0.25% levobupivacaine, with epinephrine 1:200.000 (5 ug/ml) on each&#xD;
      side, under ultrasound (US) guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One anesthesiologist experienced in the technique performed all of the TAP blocks using a US&#xD;
      Sonosite M-Turbo US machine (Sonosite Inc, Washington) with an L38x 10-5 megahertz (MHz),&#xD;
      38-mm broadband linear array probe. A second anesthesiologist evaluated and approved the US&#xD;
      images before administration of the mixture. Blocks were performed with a 21 gauge (G),&#xD;
      110-mm spinal Quincke needle (N. Medical Industries Ltd., Japan) using an in-plane approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of sensory blockade of the TAP block to temperature, light touch, and sharp touch&#xD;
      was determined using ice, cotton wool, and pinprick, respectively at 1, 2, 6 and 12 hrs post&#xD;
      block and the metameric extent of the blockade was recorded. 2 mL venous blood samples were&#xD;
      obtained at 2, 5, 10, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 180 minutes after the block. The duration of the&#xD;
      blockade was also recorded and symptoms of local anesthetic systemic toxicity were assessed&#xD;
      on every control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitantly we studied the effects of the local anesthetic on myocardial electrical&#xD;
      conduction to characterize the pharmacodynamics of TAP block. Briefly, a portable 12-lead&#xD;
      Holter (NorthEast Monitoring®, Boston, USA) will record continuously the electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG). The information will be stored in an external flash memory card to be analyzed&#xD;
      retrospectively with ad hoc software (NorthEast Monitoring®, Boston, USA). We will correlate&#xD;
      the eventual changes in the QTc segment with levobupivacaine free plasma levels, which&#xD;
      translates the effect of local anesthetics on the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levobupivacaine Assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levobupivacaine was extracted from plasma using liquid-liquid extraction according to the&#xD;
      methods described by Adams et al. The internal standard solution (10 mL of mepivacaine, 30&#xD;
      ug/mL) was added to 0.2 mL of plasma, 100 micro(u)L of sodium hydroxide (2 mol/L solution),&#xD;
      and 0.6 mL diethyl ether. The mixture was stirred for 1 minute and centrifuged for 5 minutes&#xD;
      at 3000 revolutions/min. Subsequently; the organic phase was transferred to another tube to&#xD;
      which 0.25 mL of 0.05 N sulfuric acid was added. The mixture was stirred again for another&#xD;
      minute and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 3000 revolutions/min. The aqueous phase was&#xD;
      transferred to another tube for subsequent injection. An aliquot of 100 micro(u)L was&#xD;
      injected into the high-performance liquid chromatography system. The linearity of the method&#xD;
      was evaluated in the range of 0.125 to 10 ug/mL, and 3 concentrations (0.75, 3, and 7.5&#xD;
      ug/mL) were extracted during each protocol as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knudsen have recently reported the unbound bupivacaine plasma levels thresholds for&#xD;
      neurologic symptoms in volunteers of 0,11 ug/ml (SD 0,1 ug/ml). Ikeda et al. found that&#xD;
      although there were no differences between the concentrations of bupivacaine and&#xD;
      levobupivacaine in plasma, levels of unbound bupivacaine in the cerebral extracellular fluid&#xD;
      were significantly higher than levobupivacaine. Consequently, we opted to guide our analysis&#xD;
      using bupivacaine pharmacokinetic (PK) data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the design of relatively frequent sampling planned for each patient and assuming a&#xD;
      interindividual variability of 50%, similar to that found in a previous study, which allowed&#xD;
      the investigators to characterize the pharmacokinetics of levobupivacaine in 11 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers with good accuracy, an estimated number of 12 patients is suitable for the&#xD;
      purposes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population parameter estimations&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-compartment model with first-order input and elimination was used to describe the time&#xD;
      profile of serum levobupivacaine concentrations. Population parameter estimates were&#xD;
      calculated using nonlinear mixed effects modelling implemented in the program NONMEM (NONMEM&#xD;
      7.3, Icon Development Solutions, USA). The population parameter variability was modeled in&#xD;
      terms of random effect (η) variables. Each variable was assumed to have a mean = 0, and a&#xD;
      variance, denoted by ω2, was estimated.&#xD;
