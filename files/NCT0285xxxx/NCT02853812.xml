      The proposed research is to identify the brain areas activated or deactivated by tinnitus in&#xD;
      humans. The identification of these areas is expected to be able to treat tinnitus refractory&#xD;
      to traditional therapies by methods of brain stimulation. Furthermore, this technique would&#xD;
      be very useful to verify the effectiveness of any treatment to relieve tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain activation measured during fMRI will be performed in a position of rest, after&#xD;
      inhibition of tinnitus, and after application of a sound that does not inhibit tinnitus. This&#xD;
      comparison will identify specific brain areas activated or deactivated by tinnitus.&#xD;

      1. What is the purpose of the research?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed research is to identify the brain areas activated or deactivated by&#xD;
           tinnitus in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The identification of these areas is expected to be able to treat tinnitus refractory to&#xD;
           traditional therapies by methods of brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Furthermore, this technique would be very useful to verify the effectiveness of any&#xD;
           treatment to relieve tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the methodology?&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a diagnosis based on functional brain imaging with MRI (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be conducted in 30 subjects with unilateral tinnitus, stable lesion of&#xD;
           origin and can be inhibited by masking sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The brain activation measured during fMRI will be performed in a position of rest, after&#xD;
           inhibition of tinnitus, and after application of a sound that does not inhibit tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This comparison will identify specific brain areas activated or deactivated by tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the expected benefits?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct individual benefit could possibly be met by participants in this study. Indeed, the&#xD;
      determination of a masking noise can afford to set up a masking system to reduce the tinnitus&#xD;
      if the patient wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in case of identification of brain areas activated or inactivated by tinnitus in a&#xD;
      subject, it may propose to carry out a transcranial magnetic brain stimulation of the area in&#xD;
      an attempt to relieve the tinnitus, according to the stimulation protocols to date for&#xD;
      tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will achieved a personalized approach to treating tinnitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the expected individual benefit, other expected benefits are collective order, given&#xD;
      the highly variable success rates, but generally limited treatments against tinnitus.&#xD;
