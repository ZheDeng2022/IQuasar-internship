  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mithramycin is a new cancer drug. In another study, people with chest cancer took the drug 6&#xD;
      hours a day for 7 straight days. Many of them had liver damage as a side effect. It was&#xD;
      discovered that only people with certain genes got this side effect. Researchers want to test&#xD;
      mithramycin in people who do not have those certain genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find the highest safe dose of mithramycin that can be given to people with chest cancer&#xD;
      who have certain genes over 24 hours instead of spread out over a longer period of time. To&#xD;
      see if mithramycin given as a 24-hour infusion shrinks tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have chest cancer that is not shrinking with known therapies,&#xD;
      and whose genes will limit the chance of liver damage from mithramycin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung and heart function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-rays or scans of their tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the hospital overnight. A small plastic tube (catheter) will&#xD;
      be inserted in the arm or chest. They will get mithramycin through the catheter over about 24&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they do not have bad side effects or their cancer does not worsen, they can repeat the&#xD;
      treatment every 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have multiple visits for each treatment cycle. These include repeats of&#xD;
      certain screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stopping treatment, participants will have weekly visits until they recover from any&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing evidence indicates that activation of stem cell gene expression is a common&#xD;
      mechanism by which environmental carcinogens mediate initiation and progression of thoracic&#xD;
      malignancies. Similar mechanisms appear to contribute to extra-thoracic malignancies that&#xD;
      metastasize to the chest. Utilization of pharmacologic agents, which target gene regulatory&#xD;
      networks mediating &quot;stemness&quot; may be novel strategies for treatment of these neoplasms.&#xD;
      Recent studies performed in the Thoracic Epigenetics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory, NCI, demonstrate that under exposure conditions potentially achievable in&#xD;
      clinical settings, mithramycin diminishes stem cell gene expression and markedly inhibits&#xD;
      growth of lung and esophageal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cells in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo. These findings add to other recent preclinical studies demonstrating impressive&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of mithramycin in epithelial malignancies and sarcomas that frequently&#xD;
      metastasize to the thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I component: To determine pharmacokinetics, toxicities, and maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
           (MTD) of mithramycin administered as a continuous 24h infusion in patients with primary&#xD;
           thoracic malignancies or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the&#xD;
           chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II component: To determine objective response rates (CR+PR) of mithramycin&#xD;
           administered as 24h intravenous infusions in patients with primary thoracic malignancies&#xD;
           or carcinomas, sarcomas or germ cell tumors metastatic to the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with measurable inoperable, histologically confirmed lung and esophageal&#xD;
           carcinomas, thymic neoplasms, germ cell tumors, malignant pleural mesotheliomas or chest&#xD;
           wall sarcomas, as well as patients with gastric, colorectal or renal cancers and&#xD;
           sarcomas metastatic to the thorax are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with favorable germline SNPs in ABCB4, ABCB11, RALBP or CYP8B1 that are&#xD;
           associated with resistance to mithramycin-induced hepatotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have had or refused first-line standard therapy for their malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2, without&#xD;
           evidence of unstable or decompensated myocardial disease. Patients must have adequate&#xD;
           pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO equal to or greater than 30% predicted;&#xD;
           Oxygen saturation &gt;= 92% on room air. ABG will be drawn if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have a platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000, an ANC equal to or&#xD;
           greater than 1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT/PTT, and adequate&#xD;
           hepatic function as evidenced by a total bilirubin of &lt; 1.5 x upper limits of normal&#xD;
           (ULN) and AST/ALT &lt;= 3 X ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
           mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single arm Phase I dose escalation to define pharmacokinetics, toxicities and MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient cohorts will receive 24h infusions of mithramycin targeting total doses&#xD;
           previously administered during 7 daily six hour infusions at 30-50 mcg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 24h infusions will be administered every 14 days (1 cycle). Four cycles will&#xD;
           constitute one course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacokinetics and toxicity assessment to define MTD will be assessed during Cycle 1&#xD;
           of the first course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Due to uncertainties regarding potential cumulative toxicities, no intra-patient dose&#xD;
           escalation will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once MTD has been defined, patients will be enrolled into two cohorts (primary thoracic&#xD;
           malignancy vs neoplasm of non-thoracic origin metastatic to the chest) to determine&#xD;
           clinical response rates at the MTD, using a Simon Optimal Two Stage Design for Phase II&#xD;
           Clinical Trials targeting an objective response rate (RECIST) of 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following each course of therapy, patients will undergo restaging studies. Patients&#xD;
           exhibiting objective response to therapy or stable disease by RECIST criteria will be&#xD;
           offered an additional course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients exhibiting disease progression will be removed from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsies of index lesions will be obtained at baseline and on Day 4 of the first cycle&#xD;
           of therapy for analysis of pharmacodynamic endpoints. Optional tumor biopsies may be&#xD;
           requested at the completion of Course 1 (4 cycles) and in patients exhibiting objective&#xD;
           responses.&#xD;
