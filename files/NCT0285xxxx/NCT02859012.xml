  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare variant of adenocarcinoma that occurs in secretory&#xD;
      glands such as in salivary glands. Although ACC is histologically low grade and slow-growing,&#xD;
      more than half of patients eventually have recurrent and/or metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural course of metastatic disease with ACC is relatively indolent; however, most&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease ultimately die from their cancer. The management of recurred&#xD;
      / metastatic ACC is a distinct therapeutic challenge because of its insidious local growth&#xD;
      pattern, propensity for perineural involvement, tendency for distant metastasis, and&#xD;
      pronounced ability to recur over a prolonged period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Current treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of systemic chemotherapy in ACC is very limited and objective response to any&#xD;
      cytotoxic or molecular targeted agent is infrequent, and the optimum regimen is unclear.&#xD;
      Because of the rarity of ACC, there are few clinical trials investigating the efficacy of&#xD;
      systemic chemotherapy. Recurrent/metastatic ACC is an incurable disease with no standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VEGF is highly expressed in ACC and its expression correlates with stage, tumor size,&#xD;
      vascular invasion, recurrence and metastasis. High expression of VEGF and Ki-67 were&#xD;
      independent poor prognostic factors in ACC. MYB/NFIB translocation has recently identified in&#xD;
      ACC and MYB protein over expression was found in ACC. MYB over-expression in ACC has been&#xD;
      correlated to the increased expression of genes involved in vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF), KIT . More than 70% of ACCs highly express the oncogenic transcription factor&#xD;
      c-myb, which drives expression of genes that activate VEGFR and c-kit pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several lines of evidence suggest a function for VEGF, PDGFR signaling in ACC progression.&#xD;
      The expressions of NF-kappaB p65, iNOS, and VEGF were related with microvessel density. In&#xD;
      vitro, the inhibition of VEGF expression via iNOS gene induced apoptosis of ACC cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib (AG-013736; Pfizer) is a multi-targeted small-molecule inhibitor of the receptor&#xD;
      tyrosine kinases involved in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2&#xD;
      and VEGFR-3, c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-α and PFGFR-β. Axitinib&#xD;
      (AG-013736) has demonstrated a partial response lasting 4 months in one patient with ACC in a&#xD;
      phase I trial . In that aspect, Ho et al. conducted phase II study with axitinib in ACC.&#xD;
      Interestingly, response rate was 9.1% and tumor shrinkage was observed in 66.7%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides of axitinib, other antiangiogenic agents such as sutene or dovitinib showed promising&#xD;
      activity in ACC. Dovitinib, which is pan FGFR , VEGF, PDGFR inhibitor showed one confirmed&#xD;
      partial response PR (3.1%) and three unconfirmed PR (9.3%). Interestingly, hyperphosphatemia&#xD;
      was not observed in this study, and one PR patients showed strong PDGFR beta positivity,&#xD;
      which suggests that antiangiogenic pathway is more important than FGFR pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Gap, issue or problem that needs to be addressed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these evidences which suggest a function for VGFR, PDGFR signaling in ACC&#xD;
      tumorigenesis and progression, the use of axitinib is reasonable and valuable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the huge gap in ACC trial is lack of randomization trial. Until now, there is no&#xD;
      randomized trial in ACC because of its rarity. Hence there is no confirmatory trial in ACC.&#xD;
      Without randomization trial, we can not say the real efficacy of axitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So we design multicenter randomized trial of axtinib in ACC to confirm the efficacy of&#xD;
      axitinib in this orphan disease.&#xD;
