  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) works in imaging lymph nodes in patients with stage IIB-IIIC esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Ferumoxytol is a form of very small iron particles that are taken up by cells in normal lymph&#xD;
      nodes and may work better in imaging patients with esophageal cancer when paired with MRI.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine feasibility of administering ferumoxytol and obtaining ferumoxytol enhanced&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (MR) images in patients with resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer&#xD;
      before starting neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and again before esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect detailed information about the location of ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron&#xD;
      oxide (USPIO)-MRI detected lymph nodes prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy and again&#xD;
      prior to esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol enhanced MR imaging in the&#xD;
      assessment of pathologic lymph node involvement based on pathological findings at the time of&#xD;
      esophagectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and then undergo&#xD;
      ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI after 24-36 hours and before surgery at week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4-6 weeks.&#xD;
