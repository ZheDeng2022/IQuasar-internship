  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter study in approximately 52 adults with primary&#xD;
      (de novo) GB that has recurred or progressed (first or second recurrence, including this&#xD;
      recurrence) after treatment(s) including surgery and radiotherapy with or without&#xD;
      chemotherapy and following discontinuation of any previous standard or investigational lines&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, MDNA55, is a fusion protein comprising a genetically engineered Interleukin-4&#xD;
      (IL-4) linked to a modified version of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE). MDNA55&#xD;
      binds to the IL-4 receptor (IL4R), over-expressed by cancer cells and non-malignant&#xD;
      immunosuppressive cells of the tumor microenvironment (TME), and delivers a potent&#xD;
      cell-killing agent, PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at up to 10 clinical sites following institutional review board&#xD;
      approval and completed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that meet the study eligibility criteria will undergo surgery associated with study&#xD;
      drug administration. MDNA55 will be administered locally by convection-enhanced delivery&#xD;
      (CED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-treatment follow-up assessment of safety and efficacy will be performed monthly for the&#xD;
      first 6 months and bimonthly thereafter for approximately 1 year after study drug&#xD;
      administrations. Subjects will continued to be followed for survival and post-study&#xD;
      treatment(s) of GB after study completion or withdrawal.&#xD;
