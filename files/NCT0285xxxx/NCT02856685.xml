      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study.&#xD;

      The Phase 1 part of this study is designed to identify the MTD and RP2D, and to characterize&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and PK. The Phase 1 part of the study will include 2 parts: dose&#xD;
      escalation and dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirmation of the RP2D in the expansion part of Phase 1, enrolment into the Phase 2&#xD;
      part of the study will begin. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug when administered to patients with relapsed&#xD;
      or refractory NHL.&#xD;
