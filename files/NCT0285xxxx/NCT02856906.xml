    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether what kind of occlusion are related the&#xD;
      orofacial pain under investigation, and whether occlusal adjustment have an effect in relief&#xD;
      of this kind of orofacial pain.&#xD;

      1. T-scan analysis system is used to record the occlusal contact relationships. And at same&#xD;
           time, Electromyographic recording system is used to record the Masseter (MM) and&#xD;
           Anterior Temporalis (TA) muscles' surface electromyographic (SEMG) in the two time&#xD;
           points: before the treatment and 4-weeks follow-up after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After recording, several parameters is taken to indicate the occlusal changes when&#xD;
           researchers set the T-Scan occlusal parameters as 100% intercuspal position (ICP)&#xD;
           maximum voluntary clenching (MVC), 75% ICP-MVC, 50% ICP-MVC, 25% ICP-MVC, and the number&#xD;
           of occlusal contact and the values of the the Masseter (MM) and Anterior Temporalis (TA)&#xD;
           muscles' surface electromyographic (SEMG) values is acquired by the software in the&#xD;
           screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Occlusal imprints which indicates the their occlusal relationships is made by&#xD;
           researchers when the volunteers ICP clenching in the two time points: before the&#xD;
           treatment and 4-weeks follow-up after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Break-over and the sub-break-over point of the occlusal imprints is amplified by&#xD;
           software. The investigators compute the number and area about that.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators also recorded frequency of attack and score of visual analogue scale&#xD;
           (VAS), the dosage of drug, and short form-McGill-2 in the follow-ups time frame:&#xD;
           immediately after the first treatment, 1-, 4-, 12- and 24-weeks after treatment.&#xD;
