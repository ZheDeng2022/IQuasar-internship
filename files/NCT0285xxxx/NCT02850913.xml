  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nodding syndrome (NS) is a devastating neurologic disorder affecting thousands of children in&#xD;
      Africa. A number of toxic, nutritional, infectious, para-infectious and environmental causes&#xD;
      have been studied but the only consistent association has been with infection by the parasite&#xD;
      Onchocerca volvulus. There is no specific treatment for NS and also for the adult onchocerca.&#xD;
      However, antibiotic depletion of the Onchocerca volvulus co-symbiotic bacteria Wolbachia with&#xD;
      tetracyclines such as doxycycline results in sterilisation and premature death of the adult&#xD;
      worm and marked reductions in dermal microfilaria density. Potentially, such therapy that&#xD;
      kills adult onchocerca volvulus may improve the outcome of NS if the association were true.&#xD;

      Primary hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral doxycycline 100mg daily for six weeks in patients with NS aged 8 years or older will&#xD;
      reduce inflammatory responses and the proportion of patients with serum antibodies to NSPs or&#xD;
      leiomodin 24 months after intervention by 40% compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effects of doxycycline 100mg daily for six weeks in patients with NS 8 years&#xD;
      or older on serum levels of antibodies to NSPs (VGKC complex and others to be identified in a&#xD;
      concurrent case-control study) or leiomodin at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two-arm, placebo-controlled (double blind) randomized phase II trial of oral&#xD;
      doxycycline 100mg daily for six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kitgum general hospital, Kitgum, Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be patients with confirmed NS as defined according to the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (WHO) consensus case definition i.e. (i) Head nodding on two or more&#xD;
      occasions, (ii) Occurring in clusters at a frequency of 5-20/minute, (iii) Onset between the&#xD;
      ages of 3-18 years, (iv) Observed by a trained health worker or documented on EEG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plus any one of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) triggered by food or cold weather; b) presence of other seizures or neurological&#xD;
      abnormalities and cognitive decline and c) clustering in space or time), age ≥8 years, and&#xD;
      with written consent from a parent or guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive standard of care supportive treatment according to current&#xD;
      guidelines for NS (antiepileptic drug treatment with sodium valproate, management of&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, nutritional, physical and occupational therapy as indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All will be hospitalised in the first weeks during which period, baseline measurements&#xD;
      including clinical assessments, EEG, cognitive and laboratory testing will be performed and&#xD;
      antiepileptic drug doses rationalised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size (115 participants per arm i.e. 230 total) is estimated based on&#xD;
      the assumption that a six-weeks treatment course of doxycycline will reduce the proportion of&#xD;
      participants with antibodies to NSPs or Leiomodin by 40% (from 50.0% to 30.0%) 24 months&#xD;
      after initiation of the intervention while providing for 10% loss to follow-up (β=80%,&#xD;
      α=0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be randomised to either oral doxycycline (Azudox®, Kampala&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd) 100mg daily for six weeks or identical placebo. Treatment&#xD;
      will be initiated in hospital but will be continued at home. Each participant will be visited&#xD;
      at home at 2, 4 and 6 weeks for adherence monitoring and assessment of safety and will report&#xD;
      back to the hospital study clinic at 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up at 2, 4, and 6 weeks by the health visitor to document&#xD;
      adherence and assess safety and will be assessed for outcomes in hospital at 24 months after&#xD;
      initiation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be by intention to treat. The investigators will examine the effect of&#xD;
      doxycycline at 24 months on antibodies to host NSPs and leiomodin, inflammatory responses&#xD;
      (CRP, C3a and C3b), on epileptiform discharges and seizure control, and microfilaria density/&#xD;
      Wolbachia load, and on clinical (cognitive, motor, psychiatric and quality of life) symptoms&#xD;
      compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a sub-analysis, the investigators will examine the effects of the intervention in new&#xD;
      patients compared to patients with long standing symptoms.&#xD;
