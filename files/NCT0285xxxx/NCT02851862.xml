      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the natural history of Late Onset GM2&#xD;
      Gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff Disease) to inform future clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, subjects will come to Massachusetts General Hospital for two study visits,&#xD;
      six months apart. At each visit, the following tests will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Neurological Exam, Several Ataxia Rating Scales, A Formal Speech assessment, Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and spectroscopy, A blood draw, An optional lumbar puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and biomarkers (MRI atrophy measures, chemical shift imaging (CSI), MRS and&#xD;
      CSF metabolites) will be compared to the clinical disease course in Late Onset GM2&#xD;
      Gangliosidosis. The natural history by retrospective surveys (previously acquired) will shed&#xD;
      light on how changes in outcome measures compare to the larger context of changing symptoms&#xD;
      (that occurs on the scale of years and decades). This combined approach will elucidate&#xD;
      optimal outcome measures and determine eligibility criteria for a future clinical trial in&#xD;
      Late Onset GM2 Gangliosidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The international web-based platform for clinical research networks, NeuroBANK™, in which&#xD;
      clinicians and researchers collect and share their patients' clinical and research data, will&#xD;
      be used. This system has been implemented by and deployed at the Neurological Clinical&#xD;
      Research Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital. This platform allows clinicians to&#xD;
      enter patient data, either a) manually via a Web-based interface, or b) by exporting the data&#xD;
      from the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical data repositories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIDEO OCULOGRAPHY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye movement analysis will be performed in some patients using a formal video oculography&#xD;
      setup jointly with a portable setup. The findings will be assessed to see if respective&#xD;
      assessments concur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS (GUID):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient Global Unique Identifier (GUID) will be used as the identifier for individuals&#xD;
      participating in the study in NeuroBANK™. The GUID is an 11-character string that is&#xD;
      generated using encryption technology and algorithms licensed by the NCRI from the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GUID is generated on a secure website that utilizes 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Of&#xD;
      note, this website is not linked to NeuroBANK™. The GUID is generated using an irreversible&#xD;
      encryption algorithm - it accepts twelve identifying data elements, (e.g. last name at birth,&#xD;
      first name at birth, gender at birth, day, month and year of birth, city and country of&#xD;
      birth, etc.), and produces a unique random-generated character string, or GUID. No&#xD;
      identifying information is stored in the system; it is simply used to generate the GUID. If&#xD;
      the same information is entered again, the same GUID will be returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GUID is entered into NeuroBANK™ when the patient is being created in the system. As the&#xD;
      same patient may participate in multiple studies, NeuroBANK™ will also allow capturing a&#xD;
      study-specific ID for the patient. For more information about NeuroBANK™ or the GUID, please&#xD;
      go to: www.neurobank.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCRI Data Management Team is trained and knowledgeable regarding confidentiality and&#xD;
      integrity of data. They will be responsible for all aspects of data procedures. Alex Sherman&#xD;
      is the ALD Connect network strategist and member of the NEALS ALS consortium. He is the&#xD;
      director of Strategic Development and Systems of NCRI, serves on the Executive Committee of&#xD;
      the ALS Research Group, and is one of the leaders of the NEALS ALS Consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Checks, Logic Checks and Queries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Manager (DM) at the Neurological Clinical Research Institute (NCRI) at the&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital will conduct monthly Data Quality Checks, Logic Checks, and&#xD;
      internal data quality audits. Data field queries will be resolved in an established workflow&#xD;
      according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The queries may be created either at&#xD;
      the point of entry during the data entry process, manually by the NCRI DM, or as the result&#xD;
      of executing monthly Logic Checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-Specific Database Backup and Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCRI personnel will be responsible for the database backups that will be conducted daily.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, a separate copy of the backup in the encrypted compressed format will be&#xD;
      maintained and saved by the System Analysts. The backups will be saved on a separate computer&#xD;
      partition in a password-protected compressed format and also will be burnt into DVD medium&#xD;
      and stored in a secure location.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have a confirmed diagnosis of Late Onset GM2 Gangliosidosis as&#xD;
             defined by (a) absent to near-absent beta-hexosaminidase enzymatic activity in the&#xD;
             serum or white blood cells or (b) mutation analysis of the HEXA and HEXB genes to&#xD;
             distinguish pseudo deficiency alleles from disease-causing alleles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be older than 7 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient is very severely affected by the disease, the PI will assess whether it&#xD;
             is in the best interest of the patient to exclude them from the study for their own&#xD;
             comfort and well being. In cases where the PI deems it appropriate, severely affected&#xD;
             patients will be excluded. Patients under the age of 7 years will be excluded from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
