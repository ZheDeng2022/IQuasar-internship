  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on glaucoma therapy by drug eluting contact lenses. The contact lens will&#xD;
      be loaded with timolol maleate and dorzolamide hydrochloride, both of which are commonly used&#xD;
      ophthalmic drugs. Additionally, the lenses will contain vitamin E ((+) α-tocopherol) as an&#xD;
      additive for achieving extended release of the drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to assess the safety of the drug loaded contact lenses and the effectiveness.&#xD;
      Effectiveness will be a drop in IOP after using the lenses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second largest cause of blindness in the world (largest amongst&#xD;
      African-Americans) and affects about 66.8 million people, leaving 6.7 million with bilateral&#xD;
      blindness. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020 the number of cases for&#xD;
      blindness due to glaucoma will double to 12 million. The financial impact of glaucoma on the&#xD;
      US economy is more than $1.5 billion annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glaucoma can be managed through several intra ocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications&#xD;
      including Pfizer's XALATAN® (latanoprost), which accounted for 27% of the total US market in&#xD;
      Jan 2010. Effective management however requires patient-compliance, which is frequently low&#xD;
      for eye drop based therapies. The compliance is less than 50% for glaucoma eye drops, and&#xD;
      even lower for multiple drops and/or multiple drug therapies. In a recent study with 204&#xD;
      glaucoma patients, only 71% were able to instill the drop into the eye, with only 39% doing&#xD;
      it without touching the bottle to the eye surface. The lack of patient-compliance to glaucoma&#xD;
      therapy arises from several sources. Firstly, due to the chronic nature of the disease,&#xD;
      patients on glaucoma medication cannot immediately discern the benefits of taking the&#xD;
      medication regularly, and so they are not sufficiently motivated to be compliant. Even for&#xD;
      patients that regularly take the medicine through eye drops, the compliance can be far from&#xD;
      perfect due to the difficulties in instilling eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the lack of compliance, low bioavailability of glaucoma drugs delivered&#xD;
      through eye drops is a major problem, which can lead to side effects ranging from irritation&#xD;
      and the unpleasant taste to debilitating effects such as heart problems. The corneal&#xD;
      bioavailability of glaucoma drugs ranges in 1-5% because of the rapid tear turn over&#xD;
      accompanied by drug transport into the conjunctiva, which has a larger area and permeability&#xD;
      compared to cornea. The conjunctival and nasal absorption leads to systemic exposure in all&#xD;
      tissues, and thus leading to potential side effects. The presence of preservatives such as&#xD;
      benzalkonium chloride (BAK) further contributes to toxicity from eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deficiencies of the eye drop formulations for glaucoma therapy were addressed by Ocusert®&#xD;
      (Alza), a highly successful pilocarpine releasing ocular insert that was placed in the cul de&#xD;
      sac of the eye. Ocusert® was shown in clinical studies to produce a constant reduction in IOP&#xD;
      for over 7 days 23. The total dosage of pilocarpine administered by one Ocusert® system over&#xD;
      7-days was about one-eighth of the amount provided by the 28 applications (4 each day) of the&#xD;
      2% eyedrops. The simplified regimen and reduced side effects from Ocusert® encouraged patient&#xD;
      compliance. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of Ocusert® has discontinued making them likely&#xD;
      due to some drawbacks of the device including retention problems, twisting to change shape,&#xD;
      sight impediment due to dislocation of the device in front of the pupil, but most important a&#xD;
      sudden burst release in 0.4% of cases that could cause toxicity. Additionally, pilocarpine&#xD;
      has been replaced by several newer drugs such as prostaglandins as the first line of defense&#xD;
      against glaucoma. Our goal in this proposed research is to replicate the success of Ocusert®&#xD;
      with a newer drug and a different device design to eliminate the drawbacks of Ocusert®. To&#xD;
      improve compliance and reduce side effects, we propose to develop a drug delivery system that&#xD;
      has excellent retention and biocompatibility, with continuous release of drugs for extended&#xD;
      durations, with high bioavailability and with no possibility of drug leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact lenses have the highest possible bioavailability for cornea because drug released by&#xD;
      contact lenses is trapped in the thin post lens tear film between the cornea and the lens for&#xD;
      extended period longer than 30 minutes, compared to 2-5 minutes for eye drops. The increased&#xD;
      residence time leads to very high fractional drug uptake by cornea, which reduces the needed&#xD;
      dose, thereby improving the safety profile. The use of contact lenses for treating glaucoma&#xD;
      will also result in very high compliance for the patients who also need vision correction&#xD;
      because they will always insert the lens for the vision correction, even if they do not&#xD;
      immediately appreciate the benefits of the IOP reduction. Additional benefits of contact lens&#xD;
      based drug delivery will be elimination of the preservatives in the multi-use eye drop&#xD;
      formulations, which can cause discomfort and redness. Finally, contact lenses are the most&#xD;
      commonly used medical devices with over 41 million wearers in the United States and over five&#xD;
      decades of history of safe use. Based on all these considerations, drug loaded contact lenses&#xD;
      could be very promising for delivery of ophthalmic drugs.&#xD;
