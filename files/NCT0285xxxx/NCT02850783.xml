      Rationale: Lymph node status is the most important factor in the selection of patients for&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical treatment of primary colorectal carcinoma. Up to 30%&#xD;
      stage I/II patients with negative lymph node involvement will develop distant metastases and&#xD;
      eventually die from colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Better detection and pathologic staging of&#xD;
      the lymph nodes could contribute to a better survival of colon cancer patients. This sentinel&#xD;
      lymph node (SLN) procedure aims to identify the first draining lymph node(s) from the primary&#xD;
      tumour, which have the highest risk of harbouring metastases. These SLNs can be pathological&#xD;
      analysed with several more sensitive histopathologic techniques like immunohistochemical&#xD;
      staining (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Aim of this study is to investigate if the combination of a radioactive and&#xD;
      fluorescent tracer can increase the sensitivity and specificity of the sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      mapping (SLNM) technique in colon cancer by utilizing the radioactive component for&#xD;
      preoperative imaging (PET/CT) of the SLNs and the near infrared (NIR) fluorescence component&#xD;
      for guidance to the SLNs during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single centre pilot study Study population: Ten patients with colon cancer&#xD;
      (colon ascendens, colon transversum, colon descendens, sigmoid) stage Tis-T1-T2-T3, scheduled&#xD;
      for laparoscopic surgical resection of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be performed with the radioactive tracer 89Zr-Nanocoll and fluorescent&#xD;
      tracer Indocyanine Green (ICG). A colonoscopy will be performed to inject the radioactive&#xD;
      tracer 48 hrs before surgery. After injection, patients will undergo the first PET/CT scan. A&#xD;
      second PET/CT scan will be performed ± 24 hrs after tracer injection and a third scan just&#xD;
      before the surgical procedure; ± 48 hrs after tracer administration. During the surgical&#xD;
      procedure ICG diluted in saline and human albumin will be injected at the base of the tumour&#xD;
      by colonoscopy. The PET/CT images will be compared with respect to the total number and&#xD;
      location of foci and , if visible, lymphatic vessels. During surgery the fluorescent nodes&#xD;
      will be marked with a suture in vivo. Thereafter the PET/CT images will be used as a roadmap,&#xD;
      to detect SLNs which are not visible with the NIR laparoscope. These nodes will be marked&#xD;
      with a suture too. When all radioactive and/ or fluorescent nodes are detected, the specimen&#xD;
      will be resected like the conventional method. Ex vivo the specimen will be inspected for&#xD;
      fluorescent and/or radioactive nodes not found in vivo. All the identified nodes will be&#xD;
      taken out ex vivo and stored separately. The entire specimen will be submitted for pathologic&#xD;
      examination. All identified SLNs will be stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E). If the&#xD;
      fluorescent or radioactive SLNs are negative after routine H&amp;E staining, they will be sliced&#xD;
      in multiple parts and examined with H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry with the specific&#xD;
      marker CAM5.2. Finally, the pathologist uses palpation to identify the remaining&#xD;
      non-fluorescent and/ or radioactive lymph nodes. Nodes found by palpation will be screened&#xD;
      for fluorescent and/ or radioactive activity too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of tumour tissue in positive nodes will be evaluated with the Q-prodit; an&#xD;
      interactive video morphometry system (Leica, Cambridge, UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Main study parameter is the identification rate of SLN&#xD;
      mapping with preoperative PET/CT scans combined with intraoperative near-infrared (NIR)&#xD;
      fluorescence imaging in patients with colon carcinoma. Thereby biodistribution and kinetics&#xD;
      of 89Zr-Nanocoll have to be considered as primary study parameter. Secondary endpoints are&#xD;
      the number and localization of the SLNs and optimal tracer volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: All participating patients will receive conventional resection of the tumour and&#xD;
      follow-up according to normal standards in our hospital. The main goal of this study is to&#xD;
      optimize the SLN mapping technique in colon cancer. If the investigators are able to identify&#xD;
      the true SLN this could lead to better staging and survival of patients with this type of&#xD;
      cancer. . Because of the colonoscopy ± 48 hrs before surgery, patients stay in the hospital&#xD;
      will be prolonged with one day. The additional risks of exposure to radiation for&#xD;
      participating patients are calculated and can be considered as negligible.&#xD;
