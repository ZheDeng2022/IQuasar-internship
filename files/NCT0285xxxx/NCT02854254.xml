  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In decompensation of heart failure, it may occur low cardiac output. For patients in this&#xD;
      situation, the use of inotropic may be necessary. Prolonged intravenous infusion of inotropic&#xD;
      agents can lead to phlebitis in peripherally venous access. On the other hand, central venous&#xD;
      access presents complications inherent in the procedure. The peripherally inserted central&#xD;
      catheter (PICC) may be an option in this situation. The present research project is a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to evaluate the incidence of phlebitis by using the PICC in&#xD;
      comparison to the peripheral venous access. The criteria for inclusion are: advanced&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, in use of intravenous inotropic; platelets &gt; 50.000 mm3 and left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 0.45. Patients will be randomized to receive the PICC&#xD;
      or keep the peripheral venous access. The main outcome will be the occurrence of phlebitis.&#xD;
      The sample size will be of 40 patients for each group (PICC and control). The data will be&#xD;
      analyzed by logistic regression. Will be considered significant P 0.05.&#xD;

      Study design To evaluate the incidence of phlebitis using the PICC compared to peripheral&#xD;
      venous access a randomized clinical trial was conducted in the period between 12/07/2012 and&#xD;
      10/02/2014, in adult cardiology department of a university hospital in Brazil. Patients were&#xD;
      randomized into two groups permuted blocks of four. The sequence of randomization was built&#xD;
      with random allocation blocks 4 through of random number tables. (3).The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      occurrence of phlebitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Patients who were admitted with congestive heart failure of decompensated in use&#xD;
      of intravenous inotropic agents were screened for eligibility to participate in this study.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria were: advanced congestive heart failure, use of vasoactive drugs, patients&#xD;
      with platelet ≥50.000 mm3, left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;0.45, upper limb venous system&#xD;
      able for catheter insertion and central catheter peripherally inserted. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were age &lt;18, cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, active systemic infection without treatment&#xD;
      or without control, platelets &lt;50.000 mm3, injury skin in cubital region and presence of&#xD;
      central catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on pilot study data, we estimated the occurrence of phlebitis&#xD;
      20% in PICC group and 80% in control group. Considering statistical power of 80% and α-error&#xD;
      in 5%, the sample size was estimated by 39 patients in each group. For more conservative&#xD;
      estimation we defined 40 patients in each group (80 patients in total).Considering these&#xD;
      values the sample size was 39 patients in each group in a more conservative estimate set the&#xD;
      size in 40 patients for each group and 60% in the control group and 20% in the PICC group. In&#xD;
      total 172 patients were evaluated, of these 86 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and six did not agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics considerations Eligible patients were invited to participate and receive written&#xD;
      information about the study objectives and procedures. After detailed explanations about the&#xD;
      study if the patient agreed to participate they signed the informed consent. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the local ethics committee, and the study is in accordance with the&#xD;
      principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. (1989) Intervention and endpoints Patients&#xD;
      were divided into two groups: PICC Group and Control Group - peripheral venous access. In&#xD;
      patients PICC group the catheter was inserted by the researcher and used to puncture&#xD;
      technique guided by ultrasound (2). In the control group, patients were maintained with&#xD;
      venous access by peripheral vein with flexible peripheral intravenous device and evaluation&#xD;
      similar to the PICC group. The researcher evaluated daily the insertion site and asked the&#xD;
      patient whether feel pain or not. The degree of phlebitis considered according to phlebitis&#xD;
      scale Infusion Nurses Society (Table 1). Daily photo of all catheters and insertion site were&#xD;
      performed. The patients were followed up to present the outcome, phlebitis; in his absence&#xD;
      they were followed for ten consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dobutamine infusion was prescribed by responsible cardiologists well as the remaining&#xD;
      drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were expressed as number and percentage and&#xD;
      compared between groups using the chi-square test (א 2) or Fisher's exact test. Continuous&#xD;
      variables were expressed as mean, standard deviation and variance and compared between groups&#xD;
      by Student's t test. Kaplan-Meir free-event curve (4) was built according the groups.&#xD;
      Logistic regression analysis examined the predictive value of PICC Group and other variables&#xD;
      for the occurrence of phlebitis, determining the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Was considered statistically significant P &lt;0.05. The primary analysis respected the&#xD;
      principle of intention to treat, including only randomized patients.&#xD;
