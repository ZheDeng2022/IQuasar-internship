      The Language Environment Analysis (LENA) system is a specific tool for the language&#xD;
      environment analysis. Children aged from 18 months to 6 years old, with cochlear implants&#xD;
      (CIs), wear an electronic device during a day and their language interactions are registered.&#xD;
      Then the investigators can analyze with a specific software four different parameters (adult&#xD;
      words, conversational turns, child vocalizations and media exposure) and compare them to the&#xD;
      language ability of the children assessed by a speech therapist. With the results, the speech&#xD;
      therapist can advise the parents how to improve the language environment to help their&#xD;
      children with CIs for their language development. Parents are encouraged to follow these&#xD;
      advices at home during few months (5 months +/-1 month). Then there is a new registration of&#xD;
      the LENA device and another language assessment are performed, to see if there is any&#xD;
      improvement. The investigators also measure the family participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : There is an influence of the language environment measured by the LENA system on&#xD;
      language development in children with cochlear implants.&#xD;

      Over 24 months the investigators will recruit 90 patients with cochlear implants (CIs) in 2&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will follow during 5 months and will have three or five visits according to the&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
