  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if the combination of a study drug and patch is more&#xD;
      effective in helping heavy drinkers stop smoking than just the patch alone The study drug,&#xD;
      varenicline, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help people stop&#xD;
      smoking, but it is not known if the addition of varenicline to standard smoking cessation&#xD;
      treatment with nicotine patches will help people stop smoking who are regular, frequent&#xD;
      drinkers. This study is being done because cigarette smoking is the number one preventable&#xD;
      cause of death and disease in the United States.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct a real-world clinic-based smoking cessation trial examining the&#xD;
      augmentation strategy of Chantix (Varenicline Tartrate), nicotine patch, and behavioral&#xD;
      counseling versus standard treatment of patch plus behavioral counseling only in heavy&#xD;
      drinkers who smoke (HDS). While Chantix is approved for smoking cessation, it is not&#xD;
      routinely given in practice for HDS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, there will be 4 total in-person study visits over the trial (pre-quit, quit&#xD;
      date, week 2 and week 12), ending 12 weeks after the quit date. Biochemical verification from&#xD;
      breath tests for CO, as well as vital signs and weight, will be measured at each visit along&#xD;
      with survey responses measuring smoking urge and withdrawal, negative affect, neurocognition,&#xD;
      and alcohol and smoking behaviors. These will also be used at a 26-week follow-up by&#xD;
      telephone with biochemical verification for CO in those reporting being smoke-free.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Randomization Participants will respond to advertisements and will undergo a&#xD;
      brief phone screening to determine initial eligibility requirements. Qualified candidates&#xD;
      will be invited into the lab to conduct a short screening and study information session at&#xD;
      the Clinical Addictions Research Laboratory at the University of Chicago. At screening,&#xD;
      participants will sign an informed consent document. Next, demographics, smoking, alcohol and&#xD;
      substance use patterns, health history, medications, vital signs, a urine test (for pregnancy&#xD;
      and/or drug toxicology) and a blood test will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized into one of two treatment groups: Standard Treatment&#xD;
      (w/ placebo) will proceed with the study receiving nicotine patches and brief counseling&#xD;
      sessions; Augmented Treatment will proceed with the same nicotine patches and brief&#xD;
      counseling sessions, but will also receive standard dosing of Chantix (Varenicline tartrate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine Patches Nicotine patches will be utilized starting at study quit date, and proceed&#xD;
      according to package insert directions (10+ cigs/day smokers will begin with 21mg patches for&#xD;
      six weeks, followed by 14mg patches for four weeks, and finally 7mg patches for two weeks.&#xD;
      Those smoking fewer than 10 cigarettes/day will follow the same process starting at the 14mg&#xD;
      patch level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chantix (Varenicline Tartrate) Those receiving Augmented Treatment will receive varenicline.&#xD;
      They will undergo an up-titration week prior to the quit date, 12 weeks of target dosing, and&#xD;
      a down-titration week. As per Pfizer recommendations, up-titration will be 0.5mg tablets once&#xD;
      daily for 3 days followed by twice daily for four days leading to the quit date on day 8. The&#xD;
      sequence will reverse for a down-titration week on week 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo for Varenicline Those receiving standard treatment will also receive placebo&#xD;
      medication that will be identical in appearance to and follow the same distribution protocol&#xD;
      as varenicline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking Cessation Behavioral Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend one-on-one behavioral counseling sessions with a trained Masters or&#xD;
      PhD. Level therapist at each study visit. Behavioral sessions will involve teaching&#xD;
      behavioral skills to assist with smoking cessation, preventing relapse, and coping with&#xD;
      physical or emotional changes associated with cravings. At each study visit, subjective&#xD;
      measures (i.e. brief self-report surveys about&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Interview (Week 26) At Study Week 26, participants will complete a follow-up&#xD;
      telephone interview, completing similar subjective measures as those completed during study&#xD;
      visits. Participants reporting being smoke-free during this interview will arrange for&#xD;
      biochemical verification of this status via expired CO testing either by arranging for a time&#xD;
      to stop into one of the study sites or by arranging for study staff to meet with them in&#xD;
      their home or workplace.&#xD;

          <title>Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence score</title>
          <description>Fagerstrom Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) score is a standardized self-report measure used to assess for severity of cigarette smoking dependence. It consists of 6 items, with the two yes/no items scored from 0 to 1 and the four multiple-choice items scored from 0 to 3. A higher summary score (range: 0 - 10) indicates more severe cigarette dependence.</description>
