    <textblock>
      The current study included the singleton pregnancies (without history of previous risk&#xD;
      factors), had their homocysteine measured as part of a serum-screening program in addition to&#xD;
      uterine artery Doppler. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values,&#xD;
      for development of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes were assessed as&#xD;
      follows; (1) Homocysteine cutoff level at 6.3 µmol/l; (2) Bilateral notches on Doppler with a&#xD;
      mean RI &gt;0.5, all unilateral notches with a mean RI &gt;0.6, in addition, absence of notches&#xD;
      with a mean RI &gt;0.7; (3) Doppler assessment combined with the homocysteine cutoff (6.3&#xD;
      µmol/l).&#xD;

      These participants had uterine artery Doppler investigations, as part of a routine scan&#xD;
      between the 18th and the 22nd week of pregnancy. The investigators were blinded to the&#xD;
      results of the biochemistry results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples of the tHcy measurement were collected between 15 and 19 weeks of gestational&#xD;
      age, as calculated from the last menstrual period or from early ultrasound dates (when the&#xD;
      menstrual dates differed from the specified gestation). The plasma tHcy concentrations were&#xD;
      measured by means of a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uterine artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained using an SD 800 Doppler system (Philips&#xD;
      Medical Systems, Gland, Switzerland) with a 3.5/5-MHz linear array probe. The high-pass&#xD;
      filter was set at 100 Hz. One operator performed the measurements. The use of mean resistance&#xD;
      index (RI) cutoff points with bilateral and unilateral notches has already been shown to&#xD;
      improve the efficacy of uterine artery Doppler screening using qualitative assessment (10). A&#xD;
      screen-positive or abnormal result was defined as bilateral notches and a mean RI &gt;0.55 (50th&#xD;
      centile), unilateral notches and a mean RI &gt;0.65 (80th centile), and absence of notches and a&#xD;
      mean RI &gt;0.7 (95th centile) (11). Women with these abnormal results were offered growth&#xD;
      scans, amniotic fluid volume assessment, and umbilical artery Doppler every 4 weeks until 36&#xD;
      weeks in view of the recognized increased risk of isolated IUGR (12), unless there were other&#xD;
      clinical indications, which necessitated closer surveillance&#xD;
