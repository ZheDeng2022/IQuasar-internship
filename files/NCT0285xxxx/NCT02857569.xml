      The study aims to evaluate the 6 month-treatment tolerance defined as the immune related&#xD;
      grade 3-4 adverse event-free survival of the combination therapy IT ipilimumab + IV&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IV ipilimumab + IV nivolumab (same doses than in Phase I) arm will be used as an internal&#xD;
      control to interpret the results obtained in the IT ipilimumab arm.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women &gt;/= 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed and dated written informed consent prior any study related procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed and clinically or radiologically progressing unresectable&#xD;
             Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, as per AJCC staging system&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with at least two lesions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one injectable tumor lesion (≥1cm3)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least one target lesion (measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment naïve subjects or patients relapsing after prior local or systemic&#xD;
             anticancer therapy. Note that systemic anticancer therapy is permitted if it was&#xD;
             completed at least 28 days or 5 times its half life (whichever is shorter) prior to&#xD;
             the first study dose, and all related adverse events have either returned to baseline&#xD;
             or stabilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recent (less than 3 month) tumor tissue must be provided for patient stratification&#xD;
             and biomarker analyses. In order to be equally randomized, a subject must be&#xD;
             classified as PDL1 positive, PD-L1 negative, or PD-L1 indeterminate. If an&#xD;
             insufficient amount of tumor tissue is available prior to the start of the screening&#xD;
             phase, subjects must consent to allow the acquisition of additional tumor tissue for&#xD;
             performance of biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects with wild-type BRAF. BRAF-mutant can be included only if they have been&#xD;
             treated with, or developed toxicity with or refused to be treated with BRAF-and/or&#xD;
             MEK-targeted therapy in front-line&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  WBC &gt;/= 2000/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Neutrophils &gt;/= 1500/μL&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 40 mL/min&#xD;
                  (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula):&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female CrCl = [(140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85] / (72 x serum creatinine in&#xD;
             mg/dL) Male CrCl = [(140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 1.00] / (72 x serum&#xD;
             creatinine in mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST and ALT ≤3.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN); if liver metastases AST and ALT&#xD;
                  ≤5.0 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have&#xD;
                  total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subject Re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a subject that has&#xD;
             discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (ie, subject has not been randomized&#xD;
             / has not been treated) after obtaining agreement from the coordinator prior to&#xD;
             re-enrolling a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum β-HCG pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 7 days prior to initiation of treatment. Both sexually active females and&#xD;
             males (and their female partners) patients must agree to use two methods of effective&#xD;
             contraception, one of them being a barrier method, or to abstain from sexual activity&#xD;
             during the study and for at least 5 months after last study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must be willing and able to comply with the visits, treatments, procedures,&#xD;
             and laboratory tests, and other requirements that are scheduled in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patient affiliated to a social security regimen or beneficiary of the same&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases&#xD;
             or leptomeningeal disease are eligible if these lesions have been treated or if they&#xD;
             are asymptomatic and there is no clinical evidence of progression within 28 days prior&#xD;
             to first dose of study drug administration. CNS lesions should be monitored bu&#xD;
             contrast enhanced MRI at disease assessment timepoints. Justification for allowing&#xD;
             patient with CNS disease: whereas tumor-targeting antibodies have limited access to&#xD;
             the central nervous system because of the blood brain barrier, immune targeted&#xD;
             antibodies can generate a T-cell mediated anti-tumor immune response which I able to&#xD;
             cross the blood brain barrier. Indeed, anti-CTLA-4 and anti PD-1 imAbs have shown&#xD;
             their ability to induce tumor responses from metastatic sites all over the body,&#xD;
             including in the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ocular melanoma. Distant metastatic relapse of ocular melanoma outside the CNS can be&#xD;
             discussed with the study coordinator on a case by case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers&#xD;
             that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer,&#xD;
             superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo,&#xD;
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only&#xD;
             requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or&#xD;
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted&#xD;
             to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;&#xD;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14&#xD;
             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal&#xD;
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of&#xD;
             active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or&#xD;
             any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell costimulation or immune&#xD;
             checkpoint pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known&#xD;
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of allergy to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnancy or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients presenting coagulation abnormalities and/or patients requiring concomitant&#xD;
             treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. Prophylactic low dose of&#xD;
             anticoagulants for thrombo-embolic events is allowed. Prophylactic anticoagulants&#xD;
             shall be stopped during 24h prior and after deep lesion biopsies/injections. No&#xD;
             stopping rule for biopsies/injections of skin and sub-cutaneous lesions.&#xD;
