    <textblock>
      National clinical trial, phase III, multicenter, single-arm, efficacy study, 80 participants&#xD;
      of both sexes, aged equal or more than 12 and less than 65 years. The group will use Busonid®&#xD;
      (budesonide 200mcg and 400mcg) one application (inhalation) of 200 mcg every 12 hours (400mcg&#xD;
      / day). During follow-up visits if the participant has not shown an increase in forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in one second greater than 12% and greater than 0,20L or 200ml in&#xD;
      spirometry compared with baseline visit, will increase the dose to 800 mcg / day (2x 400 mcg&#xD;
      day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to revalidate by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) the&#xD;
      registration of the drug Busonid® which there is a vast scientific literature on the&#xD;
      pre-clinical and clinical evidence that the efficacy and safety of budesonide. Thus, outlined&#xD;
      is a single-arm study, which is applied to the study of the group of participants the same&#xD;
      intervention for a certain period and the participants are evaluated for response.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Busonid® is composed of budesonide and has two performances of 200mcg and 400mcg. It is a&#xD;
      corticosteroid hormone with topical anti-inflammatory activity. The slow and continuous&#xD;
      release of budesonide in the airways due to their esterification and their short plasma half&#xD;
      life increases the selectivity of the corticosteroid to the airways, in patients with asthma,&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids have a broad spectrum of anti-inflammatory effects, such as reducing&#xD;
      the number of inflammatory cells in the lungs and inhibiting the synthesis and release of&#xD;
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators.&#xD;

    <description>It´s a capsule with inhalatoin powder composed of budesonide 200mcg or 400mcg. The experimental drug will be dispensed in a cartridge containing 60 capsules of 200 mcg or 400 mcg and an inhaler. It should be stored at room temperature (between 15 and 30°C) and protected from moisture.&#xD;
Regarding the dosage, the 80 study participants will perform an inhalation 200mcg every 12 hours (400 mcg / day). During follow-up visits (V1 and V2) the attending physician will assess the need for increased PSI dose to 400 mcg every 12 hours (800mcg / day). Study participants should rinse the mouth with water and / or brush your teeth immediately after use of the drug.&#xD;
The duration of treatment may be 12 weeks.</description>
