  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine how specific dietary control alters the&#xD;
      microbiome composition to effect clinical outcome measures in a longitudinal study of&#xD;
      individuals with bipolar disorder. Our central hypothesis is that a low carbohydrate (CHO) /&#xD;
      high polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) diet will increase the fractional representation of specific&#xD;
      butyrate producing members of the Firmicutes phylum in the gut microbiome, which will&#xD;
      attenuate host inflammation, improve sleep quality and reduce anxiety in bipolar patients.&#xD;
      The rationale for the proposed research is to take the first step in a continuum of studies&#xD;
      to develop personalized novel approaches to treat mood disorders, including the need to&#xD;
      address gut dysbiosis, which often co-occurs with mental illness. The investigators will test&#xD;
      our hypothesis and achieve the objective of this proposal with the following Specific Aims:&#xD;
      1) Determine the taxonomical change in the stool microbiome following a low CHO / high PUFA&#xD;
      diet; and 2) Determine the changes in sleep quality, anxiety, and depression following a low&#xD;
      CHO / high PUFA diet. These aims will be achieved using the unique resources at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan, including the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory for dietary&#xD;
      intervention, the Host-Microbiome Laboratory for microbial assays, and the ongoing Prechter&#xD;
      Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder. At the end of the proposed studies the investigators&#xD;
      expect to set the stage for future studies to assess neurochemical mechanisms. These data&#xD;
      will provide a greater understanding of the mechanism by which diet controls the specific&#xD;
      microbes in the gut microbiome to affect mood disorders and gut dysbiosis and improve&#xD;
      response to psychiatric treatment paradigms.&#xD;

      RECRUITING AND INCENTIVIZING RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed study, the investigators will recruit research participants from the&#xD;
      Prechter Longitudinal Study of Bipolar Disorder, housed at the University of Michigan under&#xD;
      the direction of Dr. Melvin McInnis, mentor on this application. The Prechter study is in its&#xD;
      10th year with over 1200 participants, including psychiatric and healthy control individuals.&#xD;
      the investigators have successfully recruited from this study in the past to perform an&#xD;
      observational dietary study and single point microbiomic analysis described in the Previous&#xD;
      Work section. The investigators will leverage the infrastructure of the study with 50%&#xD;
      dedicated time for a research assistant to manage recruitment, scheduling, follow up and data&#xD;
      entry duties. The investigators will also leverage 5% dedicated time for the study&#xD;
      coordinator, Gloria Harrington, who oversees all administrative aspects of the Prechter&#xD;
      Study, including assurance of regulatory compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 20 males and 20 females from the Prechter cohort, aged 25-65&#xD;
      with a confirmed diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder from a diagnostic interview for genetic&#xD;
      studies (DIGS), used as the baseline intake instrument for the Prechter study. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be consented and scheduled for an intake interview and assigned a unique&#xD;
      identification number for tracking with a secure laboratory information management system.&#xD;
      Subjects will be offered a monetary incentive of $200, paid in installments after completion&#xD;
      of study milestones activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETERMINING HABITUAL DIETS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine the habitual baseline diets of all subjects using a 3 non&#xD;
      consecutive days over 1 week with an automated online 24-hour diet recall (ASA24 from the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute). Subjects will meet with a certified nutritionist from the&#xD;
      Nutrition Assessment Laboratory in the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan during the consent visit to explain how to use the recall&#xD;
      appropriately. After 1 week, subjects will return for to the MCRU for baseline biological&#xD;
      samples and dietary guidance as detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLLECTING BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES, MORPHOMETRIC DATA AND STANDARD HEALTH MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline visit (following the week involving dietary recalls), all subjects will&#xD;
      donate baseline fasted blood samples for free fatty acid analysis; a urine sample for&#xD;
      analysis of oxidative stress markers; and have their height, weight, waist and hip&#xD;
      circumference, and blood pressure recorded and be asked to complete the interviewer guided&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression scale questionnaire, the Young Mania Rating Scale questionnaire and the&#xD;
      Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants will also complete a brief 25-35 minute&#xD;
      neuropsychological test battery during their baseline and final visit. Subjects will also&#xD;
      return a stool sample, which will be collected at home with a supplied collection kit.&#xD;
      Subjects will repeat all procedures at the end of the 1st and 4th week of the dietary&#xD;
      protocol. These procedures as well as the dietary interviews will occur in the Michigan&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit at the University of Michigan, staffed with phlebotomists, nurses,&#xD;
      nutritionists and technicians with expertise in all proposed procedures; and equipment needed&#xD;
      to process the samples. Finally, subjects will be asked about all prescription and&#xD;
      non-prescription medications taken over the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIETARY INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the diet intervention, subjects will be guided by a certified nutritionist to achieve a&#xD;
      target macronutrient composition (by total calorie contribution) of 15% protein, 45%&#xD;
      carbohydrate, 40% fat, with &lt;10% saturated fat, ~15% PUFA and ~15% monounsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (MUFA). Specific targeted profiles are given in Table 4. For reference, The&#xD;
      investigators also show the cognate values attained from a 7-day observational study of 91&#xD;
      individuals with bipolar disorder described above. Comparing the target and previously&#xD;
      determined habitual values from the same population, the major change to the diet will be a&#xD;
      near doubling of PUFA intake and a small increase in MUFA intake, at the expense of reducing&#xD;
      carbohydrates and saturated fat, which is a realistic and achievable goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will achieve the diet with specific menus, considering personal preferences&#xD;
      gleaned from the habitual diet analysis described. The investigators will provide subjects&#xD;
      with specific cooking oils for addition to foods prepared at home, to achieve the oleic&#xD;
      (OLA), LA and Î±-linolenic (LNA) targets; and fish-oil supplements to achieve the DHA and EPA&#xD;
      targets. Subjects will also be provided a list of foods to eat and avoid (tailored from their&#xD;
      habitual diet records), as well as several menu items from chain restaurants to eat for meals&#xD;
      unavoidably eaten away from home. Subjects will be trained to report on their diets using the&#xD;
      ASA24. Records will be reviewed at least weekly by research staff and assessed for deviation&#xD;
      from the diet outside of threshold ranges (as average daily intake) of at least 12% PUFA and&#xD;
      no more than 50% carbohydrate. In parallel to this project the investigators will develop&#xD;
      python scripts to extract data to automate the process, however, the investigators will not&#xD;
      depend on success of that goal in order to meet the objectives of this project. Values&#xD;
      falling outside the set thresholds will be brought to the subjects' attention with&#xD;
      suggestions for correction. Importantly, since plasma LA correlates strongly with dietary&#xD;
      intake, objective measures of dietary adherence to PUFA intake will be available upon&#xD;
      completion of free fatty acid analysis from fasting blood samples, which can be leveraged as&#xD;
      covariates in statistical models. Finally, the investigators will avoid November - January&#xD;
      for the dietary interventions, as diets tend to be non-habitual during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 4-week dietary manipulation, subjects will be encouraged to maintain the high&#xD;
      PUFA diet for 6 months. Due to limited resources, The investigators will not continue to&#xD;
      collect stool samples following the 4-week period (although other funding will be pursued to&#xD;
      do so). However, the investigators will continue to encourage subjects to use the ASA24&#xD;
      weekly. The investigators will also continue to monitor self-report measures as a component&#xD;
      of the longitudinal study, requiring no additional resources from this application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr.Evans (Principal Investigator) has established a good relationship with the research staff&#xD;
      in the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory (NAL) during past studies, described above, and has&#xD;
      developed the plans for the proposed dietary manipulation with Theresa Han-Markey, RD,&#xD;
      Bionutrition Manager of the NAL, who's services are budgeted into the proposed study. Dr.&#xD;
      Evans has also recently completed formal training in nutritional sciences as a component of a&#xD;
      K01 career development award and will be intimately involved in the dietary studies.&#xD;
      Furthermore, Dr. Charles Burant, Director of the Nutrition and Obesity Research Center and&#xD;
      previous mentor for Dr. Evans K01 award, will consult on these studies (see letter of&#xD;
      support).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERROGATING THE TAXONOMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE STOOL MICROBIOME&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home OmniGene Gut stool collection kits from DNA Genotek (Ottawa, CA) will be used to collect&#xD;
      samples at baseline, week 1 and week 4 of the dietary period. These kits were used&#xD;
      successfully to generate preliminary data describe above, and have the advantage of&#xD;
      maintaining sample DNA stability for 14 days without freezing. Subjects will return the&#xD;
      completed kits at the scheduled study visits. Methods for identifying microbial complements&#xD;
      in the samples have been previously described in a publication by the HMI Laboratory at the&#xD;
      University of Michigan. Briefly, microbial DNA will be extracted from stool samples and&#xD;
      processed for 16S ribosomal sequencing using a dual-indexing sequencing strategy. Sequencing&#xD;
      will be done on the Illumina MiSeq platform, according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene will be done using an SOP (www.mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP) to&#xD;
      process the MiSeq data. Sequence classifications will be determined by comparing sequences to&#xD;
      the Ribosomal Database Project and sequences will be clustered into OTUs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLLECTION OF SELF-REPORTED HEALTH MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal participants currently complete self-rated questionnaires by mail every 2&#xD;
      months. For the current study the investigators use average responses previously collected as&#xD;
      baseline measures and new responses collected at the completion of the diet period as outcome&#xD;
      measures. These questionnaires include the PHQ-9, the PSQI, the LFQ, the Altman Self-Rating&#xD;
      Mania Scale (ASRM), the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF-12), and the Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder Assessment (GAD-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis has 2 major phases. The first is generating normalized summary scores from the&#xD;
      various measures. The second is using statistical models to test for main effects of diet.&#xD;
      Summary of questionnaire scores and anthropomorphic measures are standard and not further&#xD;
      detailed here. Summary of microbiomic data sets will be done as described above and OTUs&#xD;
      output in 2 ways: 1) as a fractional representation table, where each OTU is expressed as a&#xD;
      fraction of the total OTUs per sample; and 2) as total sequence counts, where each OTU is&#xD;
      represented as total abundance. Both will be tested in statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second phase the investigators will use two main statistical models: 1) regression&#xD;
      analyses to test for main effects of diet on OTU level microbiome data and self-reported&#xD;
      burden of disease measures, adjusting for age, sex and BMI; and 2) structured equation&#xD;
      modeling analysis to test for mediation effects of OTUs on the relationship between diet and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. The investigators will achieve the latter approach as diagrammed in Figure&#xD;
      2. Main effect of diet will be tested on plasma PUFA (primarily LA), microbiome OTUs, and&#xD;
      self-reported health measures, depicted by the dotted line. The cross-lag model, using SEM,&#xD;
      will test for statistically significant reciprocal effects, shown by the bold arrows. For&#xD;
      example, the investigators will test if increase in plasma LA accounts for the effect (fully&#xD;
      or partially) in changes in microbiome OTUs, and if changes in OTUs account for effects on&#xD;
      self-reported outcome measures.&#xD;
