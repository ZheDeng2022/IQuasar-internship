      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the natural history of Canavan disease&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, families of subjects will fill out a Canavan Patient Survey which asks&#xD;
      questions about disease development, symptoms and progression. Patients will be seen in Dr.&#xD;
      Eichler's Leukodystrophy clinic for standard of care appointments. These appointments will be&#xD;
      scheduled every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect MRI images and reports that have already been done or&#xD;
      which will be done during participation in the study on a clinical basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS (GUID):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient Global Unique Identifier (GUID) will be used as the identifier for individuals&#xD;
      participating in the study in NeuroBANK™. The GUID is an 11-character string that is&#xD;
      generated using encryption technology and algorithms licensed by the NCRI from the National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GUID is generated on a secure website that utilizes 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Of&#xD;
      note, this website is not linked to NeuroBANK™. The GUID is generated using an irreversible&#xD;
      encryption algorithm - it accepts twelve identifying data elements, (e.g. last name at birth,&#xD;
      first name at birth, gender at birth, day, month and year of birth, city and country of&#xD;
      birth, etc.), and produces a unique random-generated character string, or GUID. No&#xD;
      identifying information is stored in the system; it is simply used to generate the GUID. If&#xD;
      the same information is entered again, the same GUID will be returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GUID is entered into NeuroBANK™ when the patient is being created in the system. As the&#xD;
      same patient may participate in multiple studies, NeuroBANK™ will also allow capturing a&#xD;
      study-specific ID for the patient. For more information about NeuroBANK™ or the GUID, please&#xD;
      go to: www.neurobank.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCRI Data Management Team is trained and knowledgeable regarding confidentiality and&#xD;
      integrity of data. They will be responsible for all aspects of data procedures. Alex Sherman&#xD;
      is the ALD Connect network strategist and member of the NEALS ALS consortium. He is the&#xD;
      director of Strategic Development and Systems of NCRI, serves on the Executive Committee of&#xD;
      the ALS Research Group, and is one of the leaders of the NEALS ALS Consortium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Quality Checks, Logic Checks and Queries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data Manager (DM) at the Neurological Clinical Research Institute (NCRI) at the&#xD;
      Massachusetts General Hospital will conduct monthly Data Quality Checks, Logic Checks, and&#xD;
      internal data quality audits. Data field queries will be resolved in an established workflow&#xD;
      according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The queries may be created either at&#xD;
      the point of entry during the data entry process, manually by the NCRI DM, or as the result&#xD;
      of executing monthly Logic Checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-Specific Database Backup and Maintenance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCRI personnel will be responsible for the database backups that will be conducted daily.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, a separate copy of the backup in the encrypted compressed format will be&#xD;
      maintained and saved by the System Analysts. The backups will be saved on a separate computer&#xD;
      partition in a password-protected compressed format and also will be burnt into DVD medium&#xD;
      and stored in a secure location.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a confirmed diagnosis of Canavan Disease as defined by elevated&#xD;
             NAA levels, decreased ASPA activity, or mutations in the ASPA gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The PI will assess whether it is in the best interest of the patient to exclude them&#xD;
             from the study for their own comfort and well being. In cases where the PI deems it&#xD;
             appropriate, severely affected patients will be excluded&#xD;
