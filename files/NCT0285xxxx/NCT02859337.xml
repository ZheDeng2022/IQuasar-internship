  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese women are significantly more likely than their normal BMI counterparts to experience&#xD;
      failure of orally-dosed emergency contraceptives. Our preliminary data provides evidence for&#xD;
      testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to provide improved efficacy from&#xD;
      orally-dosed emergency contraceptives in obese women. More data is needed regarding emergency&#xD;
      contraception containing ulipristal acetate. The overall project will be focused on both&#xD;
      levonorgestrel (LNG) - and ulipristal acetate (UPA)-containing emergency contraception but&#xD;
      this protocol registration is for the UPA aspect of the study procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergency contraception (EC) provides a woman with an additional line of defense against&#xD;
      unintended pregnancy following an act of unprotected intercourse. Orally-dosed EC works by&#xD;
      delaying ovulation and reduces the risk of pregnancy for a single act of unprotected&#xD;
      intercourse by 50-70%. Unfortunately, obese women are significantly more likely than their&#xD;
      normal BMI counterparts to experience failure of orally-dosed EC and in some instances EC is&#xD;
      equivalent to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary data provides evidence for testing a dose escalation strategy in an effort to&#xD;
      provide improved efficacy from orally-dosed EC in obese women. We hypothesize that increasing&#xD;
      the dose of orally-dosed EC agents will normalize the pharmacokinetics resulting in the&#xD;
      expected treatment effect (delay in follicle rupture) in obese women. In the overall&#xD;
      proposal, we plan to perform detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies of&#xD;
      UPA-based EC in obese women and expand upon our preliminary findings of LNG-based EC. This&#xD;
      protocol registration is for the UPA aspect of the study procedures focused on the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of UPA and will include a dose escalation intervention.&#xD;
