  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort of 250 patients with solid tumours included in phase I clinical trials&#xD;
      of targeted agents will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with MTA in mono therapy or in&#xD;
      association with chemotherapy or other targeted agents in 4 large phase I centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from trials investigating chemotherapy alone will not be included. Quality of life&#xD;
      will be assessed during the treatment period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of phase I dose finding studies is to identify the recommended phase II&#xD;
      dose. The primary endpoint is the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) which is generally measured&#xD;
      using the NCI common toxicity criteria (NCI-CTCAE) graded scale. This scale, developed for&#xD;
      the investigation of cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a limited number of cycles&#xD;
      including rest period, is well adapted to identify the drug effect on organ dysfunction and&#xD;
      life threatening events. However it may be less relevant to reflect the patient's feeling&#xD;
      regarding the tolerability of the treatment under study resulting in over or under estimation&#xD;
      of these toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, targeted therapies and more specifically the ones administered orally are given&#xD;
      over long periods often with continuous schedules. Moderate toxic side effects lasting over a&#xD;
      long period are usually not considered as DLT. The health related quality of life of patients&#xD;
      as well as other patient reported outcome including symptom scale in addition to usual NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE scale could be a relevant variable to detect intolerable treatments. It has not been&#xD;
      studied prospectively to date in phase I trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort of 250 patients with solid tumours included in phase I clinical trials&#xD;
      of targeted agents will be enrolled. Patients will be treated with MTA in mono therapy or in&#xD;
      association with chemotherapy or other targeted agents in 4 large phase I centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from trials investigating chemotherapy alone will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in a phase I trial will be requested to fill in&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a questionnaire of health related quality of life (the EORTC PAL 15 questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a questionnaire of symptoms (MDASI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a questionnaire on symptoms specific of MTA at baseline and at each cycle of treatment&#xD;
           and 6 weeks after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor of the therapeutic phase I trials will be informed that the present research is&#xD;
      running and that it will not interfere with their investigational protocol. Each phase I&#xD;
      center has the latitude to propose or not the health-related quality of life research to&#xD;
      patients included in a given phase I trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Patient interviews : qualitative comparison versus EORTC PAL 15 questionary</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>Identify if some dimensions of the quality of life affected by the treatment are not captured by the EORTC PAL 15 questionaries.&#xD;
Interviews will be realized on a sub sample of patients. An explorative qualitative research could evaluate patients' experience of the impact, burden, tolerability or acceptability of phase I anti-cancer drug trials addressing patients' perception of symptoms, functioning and overall quality of life. Interviews results contrasted with the PAL15 questionnaires will enable to determine whether a QoL questionnaire dedicated to phase I trials is necessary and what are the main components felt essential to the patients.</description>
