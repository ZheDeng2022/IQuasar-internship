  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating a smoking&#xD;
      cessation intervention for cigarette smokers enrolled in an outpatient program for opioid&#xD;
      dependence. The secondary purpose was to compare treatment effects as a function of phase in&#xD;
      the outpatient program: 0-90 days (weekly attendance), 90 days-1 year (biweekly attendance),&#xD;
      and more than 1 year (monthly attendance).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco smoking rates are substantially higher among individuals with substance use disorders&#xD;
      (SUDs), relative to individuals in the general population (e.g., 97% vs. 19%, respectively).&#xD;
      Yet most treatment programs for SUDs fail to address the use of tobacco among patients, and&#xD;
      integration of smoking cessation treatment with SUD treatment may improve outcomes for both&#xD;
      drugs. The question remains, however, whether to implement a smoking cessation component&#xD;
      immediately or only after a patient is stabilized on their SUD pharmacotherapy. Existing&#xD;
      research that directly addresses this factor is limited and findings are mixed. Therefore,&#xD;
      the purpose of this study was to compare drug use outcomes among patients at three different&#xD;
      stages of their SUD treatment: 0-90 days (weekly clinic attendance), 90 days-1 year (biweekly&#xD;
      clinic attendance), and more than 1 year (monthly clinic attendance) of consistent abstinence&#xD;
      from illicit drugs. Smokers currently in treatment for opioid dependence, at the WVU&#xD;
      Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment (COAT) program, were recruited to participate in&#xD;
      this 12-week study. Our goal was to complete 20 patients from each of the three COAT&#xD;
      treatment groups. During the 12-week intervention period, individuals continued to attend&#xD;
      their regular COAT clinic appointments while following a standard varenicline (ChantixÂ®)&#xD;
      dosing regimen and responding to questions daily via text messaging (e.g., adherence to&#xD;
      varenicline, use of tobacco, tobacco withdrawal side effects, etc.). The primary outcomes are&#xD;
      those relevant to feasibility: 1) recruitment, randomization, and retention, 2) adherence to&#xD;
      medication regimen, and 3) compliance with responding to text message-based questions.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include a comparison of the three COAT treatment groups on 1) relapses for&#xD;
      all substances, 2) the proportion of smokers abstinent at each assessment (confirmed with&#xD;
      expired air carbon monoxide samples), 3) days until successful cigarette quit day, 4)&#xD;
      substance withdrawal and medication side effect symptoms, 5) motivation to quit tobacco, and&#xD;
      6) cigarette quit attempts.&#xD;

    <measure>Recruitment, Assignment to Treatment, and Retention Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For primary feasibility outcomes, recruitment, assignment to treatment, and retention rates were analyzed using descriptive statistics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Days on Which Participants Experienced Each Reason for Attrition</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Drug withdrawal and medication side effect ratings were assessed as potential reasons for attrition. This assessment was completed by calculating the mean percentage of days, out of the first four weeks, during which effects were reported by participants who completed the entire 12-week protocol versus participants that dropped out. We limited this analysis to the first four weeks.</description>

    <description>Medication non-adherence rates: The number of study days on which participants a) self-reported not taking the medication (i.e. provided a response of &quot;no&quot;) or b) had a missing medication response (i.e. provided no response) via text message.&#xD;
Text-messaging non-adherence rates: The number of study days in which participants failed to respond to one or more assessments measured via text message.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Cigarette Smoking Quit Attempts and Actual Quit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A quit attempt was defined as at least one study day on which 0 cigarettes smoked was reported via text message. Actual quit rates were determined by biochemically verified cigarette abstinence, which was an expired air carbon monoxide reading of &lt; 8 parts per million (ppm).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarettes Smoked Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Relapse for Illicit Drugs (Opioids, Cocaine, THC, Etc)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse was determined by semi-quantitative urine testing (positive vs negative result). Positive results for illicit drugs were assessed separately (opioids, cocaine, THC, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and atypical antipsychotics).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Readiness to Quit Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Readiness to Quit Ladder was administered to participants at each of their in-person study visits, for a total of 4 data collections. Participants were asked to indicate their readiness to quit smoking on a scale ranging from 0 (I have no interest in quitting smoking) to 10 (I have already quit smoking).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants That Moved in Stage of Change for Quitting Smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated one of the following stages of change at each of their four in-person study visits: Precontemplation (no plans to quit smoking), Contemplation (plans to quit smoking in the next 6 months), Preparation (plans to quit smoking in the next 30 days), Action (currently engaging in quitting smoking), or Maintenance (quit smoking more than 6 months ago).&#xD;
Data were quantified by determining the number of participants who moved towards quitting (i.e., moved up one or more stages), the number of participants who moved away from quitting (i.e., moved down one or more stages), and and the number of participants who remained in the same stage.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the study's pilot nature, the sample size is relatively small and statistical power is relatively low. High rates of participant dropout were observed, possibly due to medication side effects or the burden of daily assessments for 12 weeks.</limitations_and_caveats>
