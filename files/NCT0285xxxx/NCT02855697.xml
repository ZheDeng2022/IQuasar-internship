  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, significantly improve progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      participants with recurrent, platinum-sensitive high-grade serous/endometrioid ovarian cancer&#xD;
      (HGS/EOC), who harbour a germline mutation in BRCA 1 or 2 genes. Despite some of the most&#xD;
      impressive hazard ratios seen in ovarian oncology, such improvements in PFS have not&#xD;
      translated into improved overall survival (OS) advantage potentially because maintenance poly&#xD;
      ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) are only being administered during a single&#xD;
      remission. Here the investigators will test the feasibility of administering a second course&#xD;
      of olaparib in participants who have recurrent platinum-sensitive HGS/EOC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer presents in most participants at an advanced stage when curative&#xD;
      surgery is not possible because of extensive pelvic, abdominal or distant metastases.&#xD;
      Immediate or delayed surgery combined with platinum-based chemotherapy are the standards of&#xD;
      care but even with complete surgical cytoreductive techniques and the prescription of&#xD;
      combination platinum-based chemotherapy, the 5 year survival rate remains approximately 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of ovarian cancers harbour defects in HR. Defects in the pathway can arise&#xD;
      as a result of genomic or epigenetic events in any one of up to 33 genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I and II clinical trials with the PARPi, olaparib, have shown promising results in BRCA&#xD;
      mutated (BRCAm) recurrent EOC and in a proportion of HGSOC participants with wild type&#xD;
      germline BRCA (BRCA wt). Additionally the favourable toxicity profile of olaparib has&#xD;
      prompted the long-term use of PARPi as a maintenance strategy. The results of a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial of olaparib maintenance therapy showed an&#xD;
      improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and time to progression in participants with&#xD;
      recurrent platinum-sensitive HGSOC6. Recent data have confirmed that the increase in median&#xD;
      PFS is most marked in BRCAm participants who received olaparib as maintenance treatment&#xD;
      compared with the BRCAm participants who received placebo treatment (11.2 vs 4.3 months&#xD;
      respectively; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.31; p&lt;0.00001). These studies were performed with the&#xD;
      original capsule formulation of olaparib at a dose of 400mg bd.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study The improvement in PFS with maintenance olaparib in participants&#xD;
      with germline BRCA-mutation (g-BRCAm), although particularly striking, has not translated&#xD;
      into improved overall survival, presumably because subsequent salvage therapy obscures this&#xD;
      effect. Emerging data indicate that a significant proportion of BRCAm HGSOC participants&#xD;
      retain sensitivity to platinum agents or other chemotherapies following progression on&#xD;
      olaparib. Thus it is appropriate to offer further platinum-containing therapy to participants&#xD;
      whose disease progresses more than 6 months after previous platinum therapy. In those whose&#xD;
      disease benefits from further platinum chemotherapy, a further course of olaparib might&#xD;
      consolidate the gains from the first course of olaparib, improving PFS to the point that OS&#xD;
      is increased as well. However, to date no trial has tested the feasibility of successive&#xD;
      treatments with 2 or more courses of maintenance olaparib and this issue will be addressed&#xD;
      here, in participant who harbour a germline BRCA defect and whose disease has recurred and&#xD;
      which is at least stabilised by subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional testing remains the gold standard test for HR status and has greater predictive&#xD;
      accuracy than non-functional tests. The Rad51 functional assay involves the recognition of&#xD;
      completion of HR by the formation of Rad51 foci in viable cells that have undergone DNA&#xD;
      damage, recognised by γH2AX focus formation. The assay is robust and reproducible but&#xD;
      requires viable cells derived from either participant ascites or solid tumour deposits.&#xD;
