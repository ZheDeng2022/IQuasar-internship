      This research trial studies cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      in blood from patients with prostate cancer that does not respond to hormone therapy and has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body. Studying samples of blood from patients with prostate&#xD;
      cancer may help doctors to learn more about the changes that occur in tumor cells over time&#xD;
      and how they become resistant to anti-cancer drugs.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To document the appearance of androgen receptor isoform splice variant 7 (AR-V7)&#xD;
      expression over the course of therapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether detectable AR-V7 is associated with a shortened duration of&#xD;
      treatment benefit of abiraterone or enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine how the presence and expression level of AR-V7 impacts response to docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine at what point AR-V7 arises during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and how&#xD;
      its presence and expression corresponds to castration resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if androgen receptor isoform splice variants (AR-Vs) other than AR-V7 play a&#xD;
      role in resistance and / or response to the therapies explored in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if, in patients who do not express mutations in androgen receptor (AR),&#xD;
      other genetic alterations are associated with treatment outcomes to the therapies explored in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood collection every 4-12 weeks during ADT, abiraterone and / or&#xD;
      enzalutamide and docetaxel. Patients switched from ADT to either abiraterone or enzalutamide&#xD;
      during the study will undergo phlebotomy every 6-12 weeks. Samples are analyzed for cell-free&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (cfRNA), cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA), AR-V7, and other AR-Vs via&#xD;
      quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 3 years.&#xD;

    <description>Each of the 4 longitudinal cohorts will be analyzed separately (at least initially). Kaplan-Meier-like curves (likely adjusted for interval censoring) will be used to display the development of AR-V7 positivity. To complement the analysis of Cohort A, an exact logistic regression analysis will be used with the data from Cohort X with AR-V7 splice variant positivity as the dependent variable and time since start of ADT as the independent variable. Logistic regression will be used to assess the association between AR-V7 status at start of treatment and overall response to treatment.</description>

    <description>Detectable AR-V7 will be associated with a shortened duration of treatment benefit (ADT, abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel). Each of the 4 longitudinal cohorts will be analyzed separately (at least initially). A regression analysis based on the Cox proportional hazards model (if proportional hazards holds) will be used to assess the association between AR-V7 and time to new treatment. Initially, only the baseline AR-V7 status will be used. Next, AR-V7 will be included as a time dependent covariate; the model used may be modified to accommodate competing risks (if too many switch treatment p</description>
