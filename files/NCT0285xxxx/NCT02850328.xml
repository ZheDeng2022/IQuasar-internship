      The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability of high-load resistance training as a&#xD;
      countermeasure for long term space flights, the current project has two scientific goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to perform a deeper examination of muscle function and MVC in&#xD;
      weightlessness (parabolic flight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to gather further insight into the underlying mechanisms and&#xD;
      structures based on investigations targeting the neuromuscular and musculotendinous systems&#xD;
      and their interaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The findings from water immersion indicated that some motor tasks, such as plantarflexion&#xD;
      (25), but not others, such as the leg-press (7), appear to be affected. Thus, it would be&#xD;
      relevant to test a number of motor tasks and body regions. On the other hand, parabolic&#xD;
      flight requires that methodologies can be performed in a quick efficient fashion. Hence, we&#xD;
      propose examining ankle plantarflexion, leg-press and grip-force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that plantarflexion MVC will be reduced in the microgravity phase&#xD;
      of parabolic flight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary parameters will be assessed parameters of muscle function that can be easily&#xD;
      implemented in parabolic flight, such as electromyography and ultrasound measurements of the&#xD;
      musculotendinous unit. To assess the muscular system more deeply, for plantarflexion&#xD;
      superimposed twitches will be performed (16) during MVC and at rest. An additional&#xD;
      experimental condition placing foam (unstable surface; standard size) under the foot during&#xD;
      plantarflexion will be included. This approach increases the challenge for the neuromuscular&#xD;
      control system and, under such conditions, MVC is reduced (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These secondary investigations, which do not prohibitively complicate the practical&#xD;
      implementation of the project, will help to understand what is happening in the musculature&#xD;
      should we indeed find impediments of muscle force generation in microgravity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the applicability of high-load resistance training as a&#xD;
      countermeasure for long term space flights, the current project has two scientific goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to perform a deeper examination of muscle function and MVC in&#xD;
      weightlessness (parabolic flight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to gather further insight into the underlying mechanisms and&#xD;
      structures based on investigations targeting the neuromuscular and musculotendinous systems&#xD;
      and their interaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main judgment criteria is the MVC tested during three different tasks: (1) leg press, (2)&#xD;
      plantarflexion and (3) grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary criteria, we will assess parameters of muscle function that can be easily&#xD;
      implemented in parabolic flight:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of force development&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electromyographic activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound measure: fascicle length and pennation angle of the gastrocnemius medialis&#xD;
           muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superimposed twitch torque (M-waves at rest and V-waves in MVC conditions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum voluntary activation capacity (%VA): %VA = (1-[torque superimposed twitch/torque&#xD;
           resting twitch])*100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that plantarflexion and knee extension force generation capacity&#xD;
      will be reduced, but not grip-force, in the microgravity phase of parabolic flight.&#xD;

    <description>Short duration electrical will be delivered and the resulting EMG will be recorded. Intensity of electrical stimulation will be progressively increased until we observed a maximal EMG response.&#xD;
Finally an ultrasound probe (similar to that used for prenatal diagnostic imaging) will be fixed behind your calf in order to visualize muscle.</description>
