      This trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of PfSPZ Vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy Equatoguinean adults, adolescents, children and infants who receive doses of&#xD;
      0.9x10^6, 1.8x10^6 or 2.7x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine via direct venous inoculation (DVI) compared&#xD;
      with control groups receiving normal saline (NS) placebo by DVI. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      also assess a second PfSPZ-based vaccination approach known as PfSPZ-CVac- the administration&#xD;
      of non-irradiated, infectious PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) (1x10^5 PfSPZ) under anti-malarial&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis (chloroquine) in younger adults ages 18 to 35 years for safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI).&#xD;

      EGSPZV2 is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study is to take&#xD;
      place at the Baney Temporary Research Facility (BTRF) located in Baney City. One hundred and&#xD;
      thirty-five healthy male and female; adults, adolescents, children and infant volunteers,&#xD;
      aged from 6 months to 65 years who live in the Baney district and Malabo city on Bioko Island&#xD;
      will be enrolled based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria implemented according&#xD;
      to international ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of seven groups (Group 1a: younger adults, ages 18-35; Group 2: older&#xD;
      adults, ages 36-65; Group 3: adolescents, ages 11-17; Group 4: older children, ages 6-10;&#xD;
      Group 5: younger children, ages 1-5; Groups 6a/b: infants, ages 6 months - 11 months) of&#xD;
      volunteers. Vaccination will begin in Group 1a (younger adults), with three doses of 2.7x10^6&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine given eight weeks apart by DVI. An eighth group (Group 1b: younger adults, ages&#xD;
      18- 35), will be uniquely immunized with the comparator vaccine PfSPZ Challenge given under&#xD;
      chloroquine prophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac approach), rather than with PfSPZ Vaccine. A single&#xD;
      PfSPZ-CVac younger adult group (group 1b) is included to provide a direct comparison with&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine (group 1a) for the ability to protect against CHMI. Each of the first two&#xD;
      groups (1a and 1b) will have 20 participants receiving either PfSPZ Vaccine or PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge and 6 participants receiving NS placebo by DVI, with treatment allocation&#xD;
      randomized and double-blind. Volunteers in Group 1b will receive vaccinations 8 weeks after&#xD;
      the initial vaccination of Group 1a. Volunteers in Group 1 (younger adults) will receive CHMI&#xD;
      between 10 and 14 weeks post last vaccination (with a window of +/- 7 days on each side) and&#xD;
      will be followed for 8 weeks following CHMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (older adults) will receive three doses of 2.7x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine. Group 2 will&#xD;
      consist of 12 participants receiving PfSPZ Vaccine and 4 participants receiving NS placebo by&#xD;
      DVI, given eight weeks apart. Group 3, 4, 5 and 6b will each have 12 participants receiving&#xD;
      three doses of 1.8x10^6 PfSPZ Vaccine and 4 participants receiving NS, also given eight weeks&#xD;
      apart. Group 6a will consist of 3 volunteers who will receive a single dose of 9.0 x10^5&#xD;
      PfSPZ Vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential age groups will be staggered to allow assessment of safety and tolerability before&#xD;
      further age de-escalation. To assure safety, vaccinations will start in younger adults and&#xD;
      will progress to younger and older age groups using staggered start dates at approximately&#xD;
      weekly intervals. Age escalation and initial age de-escalation will take place at the same&#xD;
      time, hence Group 2 and 3 will be vaccinated at the same time. Progressively younger age&#xD;
      groups will then be immunized. The decision to proceed with each of these steps will be made&#xD;
      by the study team after a review of safety data from the previously vaccinated group(s).&#xD;
      Three Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) meetings are scheduled to review data prior to&#xD;
      initiating the younger children and infant groups.&#xD;
