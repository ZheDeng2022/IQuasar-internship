      This phase Ib trial studies the dose and schedule of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places&#xD;
      in the body. 177Lu-PSMA-617 carries a radioactive component which attached to the prostate&#xD;
      specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor found on tumor cells. Its radiation component&#xD;
      destroys the tumor cell. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may&#xD;
      help the body?s immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving 177Lu-PSMA-617 and pembrolizumab may work better at treating&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule of lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617&#xD;
           (177Lu-PSMA-617) in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic&#xD;
           castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC). (Part A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
           (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. (Part B (Dose Expansion))&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To characterize the safety profile of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the median duration of response by RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the proportion of patients who experience &gt;= 50% decline from baseline in&#xD;
           serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the median PSA progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine the median time to symptomatic skeletal related event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine the 6 month radiographic progression-free survival rate and median&#xD;
           radiographic progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine the median overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the lesion-specific response rate by baseline PSMA avidity on gallium Ga&#xD;
           68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To quantify the change from baseline in T cell repertoire, circulating T cell subsets,&#xD;
           tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry after&#xD;
           one priming dose of Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the relationship between timing of the 177Lu-PSMA-617 priming dose with&#xD;
           initiation of pembrolizumab with respect to immunologic, safety, and efficacy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To descriptively characterize the patterns of uptake on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET at the time of&#xD;
           disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To explore relationship between tumor genomic profile with clinical outcomes including&#xD;
           response rate and progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To explore the relationship between tumor dosimetry with objective response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE 1: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 intravenously (IV) over 20-30 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1. Beginning in cycle 2, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE 2: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 IV over 20-30 minutes and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHEDULE 3: Starting day -21, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes. Patients&#xD;
      also receive lutetium Lu 177-PSMA-617 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all schedules, treatment with pembrolizumab repeats every 21 days for up to 35 cycles (2&#xD;
      years) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve&#xD;
      stable disease (SD) or better may receive 17 additional cycles (approximately 1 year) of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days.&#xD;
