  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well proton beam radiation therapy compared with intensity modulated&#xD;
      photon radiotherapy works in treating patients with stage I-IVA esophageal cancer. Proton&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy uses a beam of protons (rather than x-rays) to send radiation inside&#xD;
      the body to the tumor without damaging much of the healthy tissue around it. Intensity&#xD;
      modulated photon radiotherapy uses high-energy x-rays to deliver radiation directly to the&#xD;
      tumor without damaging much of the healthy tissue around it. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      proton beam therapy or intensity modulated photon radiotherapy will work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if overall survival (OS) is improved with proton beam radiation therapy (PBT)&#xD;
      treatment as compared to intensity modulated photon radiation therapy (IMRT) as part of&#xD;
      planned protocol treatment for patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if OS with PBT is non-inferior to IMRT as part of planned protocol treatment&#xD;
      and that there will be less grade 3+ cardiopulmonary toxicity with PBT than with IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the symptom burden and impact on functioning of patients between treatment&#xD;
      modalities based on Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) measures of symptoms using MD Anderson&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      (PROMIS)-Fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) using EuroQol five-dimensional&#xD;
      questionnaire (EQ5D) as a health outcome between PBT and IMRT, if the protocol primary&#xD;
      endpoint is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the pathologic response rate between PBT and IMRT. IV. To assess the&#xD;
      cost-benefit economic analysis of treatment between radiation modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To compare the length of hospitalization after protocol surgery between PBT and IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare the incidence of grade 4 lymphopenia during chemoradiation between PBT and&#xD;
      IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To compare lymphocyte nadir at first follow-up visit after completion of chemoradiation&#xD;
      between PBT &amp; IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To estimate the locoregional failure, distant metastatic free survival, and&#xD;
      progression-free survival of patients treated with PBT versus IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To compare incidence of both early (&lt; 90 days from treatment start) and late (≥ 90 days&#xD;
      from treatment start) cardiovascular and pulmonary events between PBT versus IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. To compare the Total Toxicity Burden (TTB) of IMRT versus PBT based on a composite index&#xD;
      of 9 individual cardiopulmonary toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect biospecimens for future analyses, for example to assess cardiac and&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers in association with treatment complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients undergo PBT over 28 fractions 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36&#xD;
      while undergoing PBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients undergo IMRT over 28 fractions 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 while undergoing&#xD;
      IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups, within 4-8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy,&#xD;
      patients may undergo an esophagectomy per physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years&#xD;
      and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
