      Post-authorisation / after Conformité Européene (CE) marking Coroflex® ISAR NEO is a drug&#xD;
      eluting stent system which is an improved version of the predecessor device Coroflex® ISAR&#xD;
      which was extensively studied in the ISAR 2000 Registry. The rationale of this observational,&#xD;
      post-market, single-armed study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of Coroflex® ISAR NEO,&#xD;
      also as part of the manufacturer's post-market surveillance obligations in particular for the&#xD;
      re-certification of the device.&#xD;

MI is defined as a new event documented with elevated cardiac enzymes during the follow-up. Elevated enzyme levels during the hospital stay are not considered as a new event.</description>

        The investigator of each study site has the responsibility of screening all potential&#xD;
        patients and selecting those who fulfil the inclusion criteria of this study protocol.&#xD;
        Therefore, at each site a study with similar inclusion criteria cannot be conducted while&#xD;
        the recruitment of this study is in progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Screening will be performed during the physical examination to verify the &quot;patient related&#xD;
        enrolment criteria&quot;. The second part of the screening procedure will be completed during&#xD;
        the diagnostic angiography to verify that the target lesion fulfils all &quot;lesion related&#xD;
        enrolment criteria&quot;.&#xD;
