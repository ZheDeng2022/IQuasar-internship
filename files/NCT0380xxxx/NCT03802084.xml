      This is a phase I/II, open-label, non-randomized, multicentre study to evaluate the clinical&#xD;
      activity of vactosertib plus imatinib in desmoid tumor. Based on the background, TGF-β&#xD;
      inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for desmoid tumor and convey significant&#xD;
      implications for the clinical development. Therefore, investigator will conduct the phase II&#xD;
      trial of vactosertib in combined with imatinib in desmoid tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis) is a mesenchymal neoplasm associated with mutations,&#xD;
      resulting in -catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. It is composed of a clonal&#xD;
      proliferation of mesenchymal, fibroblast-like cells occurred sporadic or as a part of&#xD;
      familial adenomatosis polyposis. This tumor has high local recurrence rate after complete&#xD;
      excision (~40%). Therefore, although lacking metastatic capability, patients experience&#xD;
      repeated recurrence with attendant severe morbidity. Various systemic therapy using NSAID,&#xD;
      cytotoxic agent (doxorubicin and vinblastine), biologic agents (tamoxifen, low-dose&#xD;
      interferon), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib) are recommended with modest activity.&#xD;
      Among them, imatinib has shown promising activity and approved as standard treatment for&#xD;
      desmoid tumor. However, still there is modest response (10-15% responses) and further&#xD;
      combination strategy is warranted to improve antitumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of cytokines has 33 members in humans,&#xD;
      including TGF-β isoforms, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), and growth and&#xD;
      differentiation factors (GDFs). These factors regulate growth, survival, differentiation and&#xD;
      migration of cells, and have important roles during embryonal development and in the control&#xD;
      of adult tissue homeostasis. During carcinogenesis, TGF-β has a dual role; initially it&#xD;
      suppresses tumorigenesis by inducing growth arrest and promoting apoptosis, however, in&#xD;
      advanced cancers, where TGF-β often is overexpressed. In addition, TCGA (the cancer genome&#xD;
      atlas) pan-cancer also demonstrated high expression of TGF-β responsive signature in desmoid&#xD;
      tumor. Regarding the combination, TEW-7197 (vactosertib), a TGF-β inhibitor and imatinib&#xD;
      demonstrated synergistic effect in vitro and xenograft model. Compared to imatinib alone,&#xD;
      administration of imatinib plus vactosertib to mice significantly delayed disease relapse and&#xD;
      prolonged survival. Collectively, these results indicate that vactosertib may be a promising&#xD;
      candidate for a new therapeutic strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the background, TGF-β inhibition as a potential therapeutic target for desmoid tumor&#xD;
      and convey significant implications for the clinical development. Therefore, investigator&#xD;
      will conduct the phase II trial of vactosertib in combined with imatinib in desmoid tumor.&#xD;
