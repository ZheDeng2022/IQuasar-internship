  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a very common disease and is considered&#xD;
      &quot;the silent killer&quot;. Hypertension is responsible for at least 45% of deaths due to heart&#xD;
      disease, and 51% of deaths due to stroke. Hypertension plays a part in the worry of heart&#xD;
      disease, stroke and kidney failure and premature mortality and disability. If hypertension&#xD;
      goes uncontrolled, in the long term, it will cause serious complications, most of which will&#xD;
      necessitate costly interventions to be solved and managed. Apparently, these interventions&#xD;
      may include cardiac bypass surgery, carotid artery surgery and dialysis, draining individual&#xD;
      and government budgets. Recent studies show that hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa) tea can lower&#xD;
      blood pressure as effectively as some standard anti-hypertensive drugs can. Hibiscus is&#xD;
      widely consumed around the world as a ruby-colored, lemony beverage. Hibiscus is safe and,&#xD;
      unlike most blood pressure drugs, rarely causes side effects. All of the studies the&#xD;
      investigators found in the literature were either underpowered or inconclusive. All of these&#xD;
      studies recommended further studies with bigger samples to accurately assess the effect of&#xD;
      hibiscus sabdariffa on blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of a large-scale study assessing the effectiveness of Hibiscus&#xD;
      sabdariffa on lowering blood pressure in individuals with elevated blood pressure.&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will daily consumption of 240 ml of Hibiscus sabdariffa reduce blood pressure in individuals&#xD;
      with elevated blood pressure?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To conduct a feasibility study investigating the effect of daily consumption of 240&#xD;
      ml of Hibiscus sabdariffa on blood pressure in individuals with elevated blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To investigate the effect of daily consumption of 240 ml of Hibiscus sabdariffa on&#xD;
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To investigate the effect of daily consumption of 240 ml of Hibiscus sabdariffa on&#xD;
      sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: To investigate the effect of daily consumption of 240 ml of Hibiscus sabdariffa on&#xD;
      stress levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open-label randomized controlled trial. The intervention arm is going to&#xD;
      receive a 240 ml serving of hibiscus sabdariffa (sour tea) 1 time a day. The control arm will&#xD;
      not have a placebo; hence, &quot;open-label&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use simple randomization in this trial. Each participant will have an&#xD;
      assigned code number, which will be generated by a computer program, and then these numbers&#xD;
      will randomly be placed into one of the two study arms by the same computer program. The&#xD;
      participants will know to which study arm they belong to once the trial is officially&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in Sulaiman Al-Rajhi Colleges (SRC) in Al-Qassim Region, Kingdom&#xD;
      of Saudi Arabia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will drink hibiscus sabdariffa 1 time a day for 3 months. Hibiscus sabdariffa&#xD;
      will be given to the participants in the form of boxes filled with small paper bags filled&#xD;
      with the herb (just like teabags). The participant will immerse the teabag in 240 milliliters&#xD;
      of cold drinking water (the same volume as in a regular paper cup used for tea) and let it&#xD;
      settle for 2-3 minutes before drinking it. This will be done 1 time a day for 3 whole months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be given a month's supply on the first day of the trial, and additional&#xD;
      supply will be given during the follow-up visits. Reminder text messages (SMS) will be sent&#xD;
      regularly (every 2-3 days) to the participant to remind the participants of drinking the&#xD;
      hibiscus. Regarding the study outcomes, the participant's blood pressure will be measured&#xD;
      using a standardized manual sphygmomanometer at the times of measurement. Regarding the blood&#xD;
      LDL levels, the participant will have a blood sample withdrawn and analyzed for LDL levels at&#xD;
      the times of measurement. Regarding sleep quality and stress levels, the participant will&#xD;
      fill out the respective questionnaires at the times of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before initiating the trial, each participant will have the details of the trial, the&#xD;
      benefits and risks of the intervention, and the possible outcome of the trial explained to&#xD;
      the participants by one of the study investigators. To insure adherence to the intervention,&#xD;
      participants in the intervention group will be sent either a text message (SMS) or an e-mail&#xD;
      reminding the participants to take the hibiscus tea. The option of either SMS or e-mail&#xD;
      depends upon the participant's preference. Any questions or concerns from the side of the&#xD;
      participants will be cleared up before initiating the trial and during upcoming follow-up&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple randomized controlled trials showed that ingestion of hibiscus tea significantly&#xD;
      lowered blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Moreover, some studies showed that ingestion&#xD;
      of hibiscus tea lowered LDL levels in addition to other positive changes in blood lipid&#xD;
      profiles of patients. The investigators also want to assess if there is an effect of&#xD;
      ingestion of hibiscus tea on sleep quality and stress levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is based on feasibility trial, to test whether this can be done, not on sample&#xD;
      size statistics. Also, the target population is pre-hypertensive individuals in a university&#xD;
      setting (this includes students, teaching staff, administration staff, and workers). Since&#xD;
      there is a definite effect of hibiscus on blood pressure, the investigators recognized that&#xD;
      the investigators need a relatively small sample size for the investigators' trial. 40&#xD;
      subjects (randomized into two arms of 20 subjects each) is the required number of&#xD;
      participants for the study in order to not comprise the statistical significance and power of&#xD;
      the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigators will invite subjects to participate in the study via sending&#xD;
      e-mails to all university individuals. Individuals willing to participate in the trial will&#xD;
      sign up to participate in the trial using an online registration form. The investigators used&#xD;
      the definition of elevated blood pressure (pre-hypertension) given by the 2017 American Heart&#xD;
      Association Guidelines: &quot;Elevated blood pressure (pre-hypertension): Systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      [SBP] between 120-129 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] less than 80 mm Hg.&quot; (15) The&#xD;
      investigators also used the definition of essential hypertension given by the 2017 American&#xD;
      Heart Association Guidelines: &quot;Hypertension Stage I: Systolic blood pressure [SBP] 130 - 139&#xD;
      mm Hg OR diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 80 - 89 mm Hg. Hypertension Stage II: Systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure [SBP] at least 140 mm Hg OR diastolic blood pressure [DBP] at least 90 mm Hg&quot; (15)&#xD;
      The target population is individuals with elevated or Stage I hypertensive levels of blood&#xD;
      pressure. This means the investigators will be recruiting individuals with a systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure of 120 - 139 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure of 80 - 89 mm Hg. After being&#xD;
      recognized as eligible participants via the inclusion / exclusion criteria, these&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure (the primary outcome) will be measured regularly during the trial;&#xD;
      specifically, at the start of the trial, at 1 month after the official start, at 2 months&#xD;
      after the official start, and at 3 months after the official start (at the end of the trial).&#xD;
      Measurement will be done during curricular activity hours in the university clinic, on&#xD;
      multiple days of each measurement week (to accommodate for the schedule differences of&#xD;
      participants). The study investigators will measure each participant's blood pressure using a&#xD;
      standardized sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-density lipoprotein [LDL] (a secondary outcome) will be measured twice during the trial;&#xD;
      specifically, once at the official start of the trial, and once at 3 months after the&#xD;
      official start (at the end of the trial). A blood sample will be drawn from the participant&#xD;
      by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep quality and stress levels (secondary outcomes) will be measured twice during the trial;&#xD;
      specifically, once at the official start of the trial, and once at 3 months after the&#xD;
      official start (at the end of the trial). The participant will fill out a validated&#xD;
      questionnaire form regarding sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [PSQI]) and&#xD;
      another form regarding stress levels (the Depression, Anxiety, &amp; Stress Scales [DASS] AND the&#xD;
      Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during each measurement point, the study investigators will inquire about the&#xD;
      participants' adherence to the intervention and will ask about any possible adverse effects&#xD;
      caused by the intervention. Time will be given to clear up any concerns or questions the&#xD;
      participants may have regarding the trial or its details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For follow-up, the participants will visit the study investigators at the official start of&#xD;
      the trial, at 1 month after the official start, at 2 months after the official start, and at&#xD;
      3 months after the official start (at the end of the trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the collected data using the IBM SPSS Statistics software. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the latest version (Version 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyze the difference between the mean blood pressures of the&#xD;
      intervention group prior to taking the hibiscus tea and the mean blood pressures of the&#xD;
      intervention group after taking the hibiscus tea (at the end of the trial) using the paired&#xD;
      t-tests. The investigators will analyze the difference between the mean blood pressures of&#xD;
      the control group and the mean blood pressures of the intervention group (both before and&#xD;
      after the intervention) using the unpaired t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, the difference between LDL levels of the control group and LDL levels of the&#xD;
      intervention group will be analyzed via the unpaired t-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The differences in sleep quality and stress levels between the control group and the&#xD;
      intervention group will be analyzed using paired t-tests. The differences in sleep quality&#xD;
      and stress levels in the intervention group before and after the intervention will be&#xD;
      analyzed using paired t-tests as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be offered to every participant. The purpose of the study will be&#xD;
      explained to all the participants and the investigators will ensure strict confidentiality&#xD;
      and anonymity before proceeding with the study. The participants will be placed individually&#xD;
      in the university clinic and only the investigators will record the results in order for the&#xD;
      data collected to be totally confidential.&#xD;

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) contains 19 self-rated questions and 5 questions rated by the bed partner or roommate (if one is available). Only self-rated questions are included in the scoring. The 19 self-rated items are combined to form seven &quot;component&quot; scores, each of which has a range of 0-3 points. In all cases, a score of &quot;0&quot; indicates no difficulty, while a score of &quot;3&quot; indicates severe difficulty. The seven component scores are then added to yield one &quot;global&quot; score, with a range of 0-21 points, &quot;0&quot; indicating no difficulty and &quot;21&quot; indicating severe difficulties in all areas.</description>

    <description>The investigators want to see the effect of Hibiscus Sabdariffa on the stress levels of participants in the intervention group.&#xD;
The DASS is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress.&#xD;
The DASS is composed of three 14-item subscales, for a total of 42 questions. DASS scores can be 0-42 on each subscale. Total score is calculated by summing the scores for each subscale.&#xD;
For each of the three subscales, a higher score indicates a more severe negative emotional state.</description>
