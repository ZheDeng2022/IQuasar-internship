  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NBM-BMX is a new small molecule chemical entity being developed as a potential anti-cancer&#xD;
      therapeutic by NatureWise. NBM-BMX is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and has been&#xD;
      shown to be particularly active against HDAC8. The objectives of this study are to determine&#xD;
      the safety profile of NBM-BMX, including identification of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).&#xD;

             embolus. However, upon agreement between the investigator and medical monitor, the&#xD;
             6-month post-event-free period for a subject with a pulmonary embolus can be waived if&#xD;
             due to advanced cancer. Appropriate treatment with anticoagulants is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. NYHA Class III or IV heart failure and known history of QTc prolongation or Torsade de&#xD;
             Pointes.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Hypertension that cannot be controlled by medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Current treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low dose warfarin up to 2 mg PO&#xD;

             immunosuppressant agent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Pregnancy or breastfeeding. Female subjects must be surgically sterile or be&#xD;
             postmenopausal, or must agree to the use of effective contraception during the period&#xD;
             of therapy. All female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to enrollment. Male subjects must be surgically&#xD;
             sterile or must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The&#xD;
             definition of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or a designated associate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric conditions or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormalities that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator and/or medical&#xD;
             monitor, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration,&#xD;
             which would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
