  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, propofol-controlled phase III clinical&#xD;
      trial. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety between propofol and&#xD;
      HSK3486 for the induction of general anesthesia in elective surgery subjects, so as to&#xD;
      provide reference for marketing registration of HSK3486.&#xD;
