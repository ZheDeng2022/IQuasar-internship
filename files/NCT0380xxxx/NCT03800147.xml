    <textblock>
      Recent experiments in the lab of Prof. WD Hardt revealed, that in mice, 24 h exposure to a&#xD;
      high-fat diet results in a breakdown of colonization resistance against Salmonella&#xD;
      typhimurium. Mechanistic experiments identified bile acids as the mediator for reduced&#xD;
      colonization resistance. Exposure to a high fat diet leads to increased bile acid secretion&#xD;
      which in turn modify the intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now the aim to verify the results of this study in human healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      nutritional habits of all participants will carefully be evaluated. In the intervention&#xD;
      phase, participants will be exposed to either high-fat or low-fat diet and a controlled dose&#xD;
      of the non-pathogenic bacteria E. coli Nissle. E. coli Nissle is the active compound for&#xD;
      &quot;Mutaflor®&quot; and other probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enumerate E. coli Nissle counts in the stool after Mutaflor ingestion and to&#xD;
      quantify other changes of the human microbiota. The hypothesis is that a high-fat diet leads&#xD;
      to increased bile acid secretion results in favorable growth conditions for E. coli Nissle,&#xD;
      resulting in high bacterial counts in the stool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infectious diarrhea causes substantial morbidity in Western countries and the developing&#xD;
      world and leads to the use of considerable health resources. Antibiotic resistance continues&#xD;
      to increase, potentially leading to a decrease in therapeutic options in the future.&#xD;
      Important pathogens include Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) and pathogenic&#xD;
      Escherichia coli (E. coli) which are genetically closely related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human intestine has considerable colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens.&#xD;
      This resistance is largely mediated by the gut microbiota. Therefore, previous exposure to&#xD;
      antibiotics or immunosuppression leading to a breakdown of the intestinal defense systems&#xD;
      increase the risk for subsequent infection with S. typhimurium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The composition of the human microbiome undergoes dramatic changes upon exposure to various&#xD;
      factors including nutrition, physical activity, drugs and much more. Most studies focused on&#xD;
      long-term exposure to various factors; however, since bacterial growth is rapid (doubling&#xD;
      time of S. typhimurium under optimal conditions = 20min), even short-term variations in the&#xD;
      environment could dramatically influence the human microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lab of Prof. WD Hardt, a mouse model of S. typhimurium enterocolitis has been&#xD;
      established. Since most mouse strains are resistant against colonization with S. typhimurium,&#xD;
      pretreatment with antibiotics is a requirement for induction of S. typhimurium enterolitis.&#xD;
      However, recent experiments in the Hardt lab revealed, that in mice, 24 h exposure to a&#xD;
      high-fat diet also results in a breakdown of colonization resistance, leading to Salmonella&#xD;
      enterocolitis upon S. typhimurium infection. The same is true for E. coli strains. Subsequent&#xD;
      experiments demonstrated that exposure to fatty acids is sufficient to overcome colonization&#xD;
      resistance. Mechanistic experiments identified fat-elicited bile-release as the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism: Exposure to a high fat diet leads to increased bile acid secretion; S. typhimurium&#xD;
      can tolerate 10-fold higher bile acid concentrations than commensal bacterial, leading to a&#xD;
      growth advantage of S. typhimurium compared to competing bacteria (WD Hardt et al.,&#xD;
      unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to verify the results of this study in human healthy volunteers. The&#xD;
      nutritional habits of all participants will be carefully evaluated. In the intervention&#xD;
      phase, participants will be exposed to either high-fat or low-fat diet and a controlled dose&#xD;
      of the non-pathogenic bacteria E. coli Nissle. E. coli Nissle is the active compound for&#xD;
      &quot;Mutaflor®&quot; and other probiotics. E. coli Nissle has therapeutic effects for the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases. In contrast to other non-pathogenic E. coli&#xD;
      strains, it exhibits a specific pattern of fitness factors but lacks prominent virulence&#xD;
      factors. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated both, protective effects against&#xD;
      infection with intestinal pathogens as well as potent immunomodulatory properties. Growth of&#xD;
      E. coli Nissle in the human gut resembles growth of S. typhimurium. Both bacteriae also share&#xD;
      metabolic requirements for intestinal growth. Therefore, growth E. coli Nissle in the human&#xD;
      intestine can be used as a marker for growth of E. coli strains, Salmonella typhimurium and&#xD;
      related pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enumerate E. coli Nissle counts in the stool after Mutaflor ingestion and to&#xD;
      quantify other changes of the human microbiota. The hypothesize is that a high-fat diet,&#xD;
      leading to increased bile acid secretion results in favorable growth conditions for E. coli&#xD;
      Nissle, resulting in high bacterial counts in the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the study will help improving the understanding of the consequences of&#xD;
      nutritional composition on the vulnerability of the human organism to bacterial infections.&#xD;
      Such an improved understanding might enable designing preventive measures for the growth of&#xD;
      unwanted E. coli strains (e.g. ESBL, pathogenic) or S. typhimurium infection and/ or a severe&#xD;
      disease course and might ultimately help limiting antibiotic use and the evolution of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant pathogens.&#xD;
