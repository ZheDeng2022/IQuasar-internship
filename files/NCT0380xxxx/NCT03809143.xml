  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite research demonstrating the efficacy of buprenorphine (BPN), effectiveness in&#xD;
      real-world settings has been limited by shorter retention than for methadone, and the need&#xD;
      for daily or near-daily dosing (frequently supervised in Australia). Newly developed&#xD;
      sustained-release BPN formulations could provide rapid onset and sustained release of BPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current formulations include six-monthly implants, and once-weekly or once-monthly&#xD;
      injections, removing the need for frequent clinic or pharmacy attendance. Improved medication&#xD;
      adherence may result in improved patient outcomes and fewer unintended consequences such as&#xD;
      diversion, but more data are needed in real-world settings. These innovations have the&#xD;
      potential to dramatically change the treatment settings and options for people who are opioid&#xD;
      dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the patient outcomes following the implementation of a monthly BPN&#xD;
      depot injection for the treatment of opioid dependence in community-based treatment settings&#xD;
      with a focus on opioid and other illicit drug use, adherence and retention, and participants'&#xD;
      experiences of the implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is effective for opioid dependence and newer extended-release&#xD;
      buprenorphine (BUP-XR) injections represent a significant development. The Community&#xD;
      Long-Acting Buprenorphine (CoLAB) study aims to evaluate client outcomes among people with&#xD;
      opioid dependence receiving 48 weeks of BUP-XR treatment, and examines the implementation of&#xD;
      BUP-XR in diverse community healthcare settings in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoLAB study is a prospective single-arm, multicentre, open-label trial of monthly BUP-XR&#xD;
      injections in people with opioid dependence. Participants are being recruited from a network&#xD;
      of general practitioner and specialist drug treatment services located in the states of New&#xD;
      South Wales, Victoria and South Australia in Australia. Following a minimum 7 days on 8-32mg&#xD;
      of sublingual buprenorphine (+/- naloxone), participants will receive monthly subcutaneous&#xD;
      BUP-XR injections administered by a healthcare practitioner at intervals of 28 days (-2/+14&#xD;
      days). The primary endpoint is participant retention in treatment at 48 weeks after treatment&#xD;
      initiation. Secondary endpoints will evaluate dosing schedule variations, craving,&#xD;
      withdrawal, substance use, health and well-being, and client-reported treatment experience.&#xD;
      Qualitative and costing sub-studies will examine implementation barriers and facilitators at&#xD;
      the client and provider level.&#xD;
