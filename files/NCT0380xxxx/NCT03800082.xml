  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this program of research is to develop and systematically evaluate an&#xD;
      integrated smartphone and web-based intervention (at heart [formerly called HEARTPA♀N]) to&#xD;
      provide evidence-informed symptom triage and self-management support to reduce pain and&#xD;
      increase health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in women with heart disease. The&#xD;
      investigators will use the individual and family self-management theory, mobile device&#xD;
      functionality and the pervasive information architecture of mHealth interventions, and follow&#xD;
      the sequential phased approach recommended by the Medical Research Council (MRC) to develop&#xD;
      at heart (progressive WebApp). Funding was received from the Canadian Institutes of Health&#xD;
      Research to develop the architecture and conduct usability testing (Phase 2, complete) to&#xD;
      ensure it is easy to use, efficient and satisfying to operate. In Phase 3 (current proposal),&#xD;
      feasibility in terms of implementation (accrual rates, acceptability and level of engagement)&#xD;
      and initial estimation of effectiveness outcomes (estimates of magnitude of effect) will be&#xD;
      evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT). The Phase 3 pilot study will enable&#xD;
      the investigators to refine the prototype, inform the methodology, and calculate the sample&#xD;
      size for a larger multi-site RCT (Phase 4, future work).&#xD;

      Phase 3 (Study 3): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of the at heart (formerly called&#xD;
      HEARTPA♀N) Intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The at heart intervention is the first of its kind; there are no previous trials of the&#xD;
      efficacy of such an intervention to decrease pain and improve HRQoL in women with heart&#xD;
      disease. The investigators will undertake a process and preliminary effect evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention for women with heart disease, as guided by the MRC framework. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine the feasibility of implementing an RCT of the intervention. A&#xD;
      process evaluation will be conducted to examine: 1) the feasibility of randomization,&#xD;
      recruitment and retention, 2) acceptability and barriers to implementing the intervention&#xD;
      (including the symptom triage algorithms), and 3) the extent of engagement with the&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will also undertake a preliminary efficacy evaluation of the&#xD;
      primary outcomes. Based on the investigator's theorized mechanism of change, they hypothesize&#xD;
      that the intervention will reduce pain and improve HRQoL (primary outcomes). The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the variability and sensitivity to change for both outcomes. Prior&#xD;
      to conducting a full scale RCT of a complex intervention, such as at heart, the MRC&#xD;
      recommends that a pilot trial be performed. Results from this pilot trial will inform the&#xD;
      success of a future RCT in three ways: 1) help determine sample size calculation for the&#xD;
      full-scale trial, 2) test procedures (recruitment, randomization, follow-up), which will make&#xD;
      up the design of the full-scale trial, and 3) test feasibility of implementing the&#xD;
      intervention, particularly by estimating rates of recruitment and retention. Triage&#xD;
      algorithms and self-management interventions will be developed using a strong theoretical&#xD;
      framework, informed by needs assessments and a comprehensive integrated mixed methods&#xD;
      systematic review, with preliminary acceptability and usability testing by end-users. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate minimal risk to safety but will track adverse events using the&#xD;
      Adverse Event Form. Moreover, latest WebApp technologies have been integrated through the use&#xD;
      of a Chatbot named 'Holly'.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (recruitment, retention, engagement)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A process evaluation will be used to assess the feasibility of the implementation of the intervention. The PC will track any issues or difficulties encountered during trial implementation, such as problems using the app. Engagement will be assessed using Google Analytics, which will track patterns of app and website usage. Engagement with the app diary will be defined as 100% with daily entries for 3 months. Engagement with goal setting will be defined as 100% when 12 goals are identified over the 3-month period. Criteria for implementation success: recruitment rates &gt; 70%, retention &gt; 85%, minimal technical difficulties reported by &lt; 10%, engagement &gt; 80%, and minimal missed responses. Prevalence of refusal, retention, engagement and technical difficulties reported will be calculated with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility (acceptability, satisfaction)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will also assess acceptability and satisfaction in all participants in the intervention group using a modified Acceptability e-Scale (AES). The modified AES includes 9 items, each with a 5-point Likert response. Higher scores represent better acceptability/satisfaction. Responses are summed and averaged. Criteria for implementation success: AES mean summary score &gt; 4.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain (Brief Pain Inventory)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A preliminary efficacy evaluation will also be undertaken focusing on the outcomes of pain. Pain will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), which rates pain severity and the degree to which pain interferes with mood, sleep, and other physical activities such as work, social activity and relations with others. We will investigate the variability and sensitivity to change for pain (T2-T1). We will calculate the number of participants who report clinically meaningful decreases in pain, which has been defined for the BPI-SF as a two-point difference in worst pain. Variability will be estimated using the mean/median scores and standard deviation, in each group separately, at pre and post-test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A preliminary efficacy evaluation will also be undertaken focusing on the outcomes of HRQOL. HRQOL will be measured using the SF-36v2TM, which contains 36 items and yields a score for each of the 8 domains of health: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health (role-physical), bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems (role emotional), and mental health. We will investigate the variability and sensitivity to change for HRQOL (T2-T1). Sensitivity to change will be assessed by determining the number of participants who had a clinically meaningful increase in HRQOL: ≥ 15 points in physical functioning, general health and mental health; ≥ 16.7 in role emotional functioning; ≥ 18.5 points in role physical functioning and vitality; ≥ 20 points in bodily pain; and ≥ 25 points in social functioning.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to the treatment group will also learn how to use the progressive WebApp intervention. The intervention will be delivered on restricted password-protected applications that will permit tracking of adherence (number of logins to app and website using Google Analytics). Participants will be encouraged to log-in regularly to the progressive WebApp (via automated alerts) over the 3-month period to complete a Heart and/or Wellness Check. A Chatbot named 'Holly' will assist women with log-in and maintaining health and wellness. Participants will be directed to the PC for technical problems.</description>
