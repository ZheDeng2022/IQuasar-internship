    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study exploring a broadened use of ulipristal acetate as a&#xD;
      cervical preparation agent for second trimester surgical abortion. Specifically, this pilot&#xD;
      study will test the feasibility of using ulipristal as a pharmacologic cervical preparation&#xD;
      with adjunct misoprostol prior to surgical abortion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Second trimester abortion comprises &lt;10% of all induced abortions in the United States but&#xD;
      there is still an important need to provide this service to women. Prior to dilation and&#xD;
      evacuation (D&amp;E), adequate preparation of the uterine cervix is an important part of&#xD;
      preventing complications of the procedure. Commonly, this is done using osmotic dilators that&#xD;
      are placed into the uterine cervix but cervical preparation can also be achieved using&#xD;
      medications alone. Mifepristone is commonly used for this purpose but its use is regulated&#xD;
      and often restricted due to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. The&#xD;
      objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of using ulipristal, an oral&#xD;
      medication similar to Mifepristone, as a medical form of cervical preparation prior to&#xD;
      surgical abortion.This is a prospective cohort study investigating the use of ulipristal&#xD;
      acetate (UPA) for pharmacologic cervical preparation with adjunct misoprostol prior to second&#xD;
      trimester surgical abortion among women who are 16 to 18 6/7 weeks gestational age. Due the&#xD;
      mechanism of action of UPA as a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) being&#xD;
      similar to that of mifepristone, a medication known to be effective for cervical preparation,&#xD;
      the investigators seek to describe the use of another SPRM for this same purpose. The&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a pilot study assessing the feasibility of using UPA for cervical&#xD;
      priming and report descriptive measures of its use. Per clinic protocols, patients over&#xD;
      16-weeks gestation attend a consult and cervical preparation appointment the day prior to&#xD;
      their procedure. Eligible patients will be offered enrollment. Subjects will receive UPA 90mg&#xD;
      one day prior to their procedure and no osmotic dilators. All subjects will receive&#xD;
      pre-procedure misoprostol (600mcg 90 minutes prior to procedure). The investigators will&#xD;
      observe patients through their planned procedure and report descriptive measures of its use.&#xD;
