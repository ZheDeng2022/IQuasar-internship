  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction of labor is a frequently planned obstetric procedure. Induction for women with an&#xD;
      unfavorable cervix (bishop score &lt;6) increases the risk of cesarean section. This risk may be&#xD;
      reduced by ripening or softening the cervix before the induction of labor. This protocol&#xD;
      outlines a randomized trial of 200 women evaluating the placement and use of Cervidil to the&#xD;
      post vaginal fornix to soften the cervix in preparation for induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is looking at inpatient vs outpatient pre-induction cervical ripening using&#xD;
      Cervidil and the effects on (1) maternal and newborn outcomes including time of admission to&#xD;
      delivery, (2) system healthcare cost, (3) cost to patient, and (4) patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize when compared to patients admitted to the hospital for cervical&#xD;
      ripening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. From the time of admission, patients in the outpatient cervical ripening arm will&#xD;
           progress to complete cervical dilation in less time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The total overall cost of care for the encounter will be reduced for the group in the&#xD;
           outpatient cervical ripening arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients in the outpatient cervical ripening arm will have more overall satisfaction.&#xD;
