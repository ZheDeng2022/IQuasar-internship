  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 78 million adults in the U.S. are obese. Bariatric surgery is the only modality&#xD;
      that results in sustained weight loss along with reversal of diabetes mellitus, and a&#xD;
      decrease in cardiovascular events. Obesity is associated with increased sympathetic nervous&#xD;
      system (SNS) activity that contributes to blood pressure regulation; sympathetic&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor activity is maximally activated upon standing and is fundamental for the&#xD;
      maintenance of orthostatic tolerance. After bariatric surgery, there is a significant and&#xD;
      sustained reduction in SNS activity at three and six months after the procedure, which is&#xD;
      related to weight loss. Recently, multiple retrospective studies have reported an orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance (OI) syndrome after bariatric surgery characterized by chronic pre-syncopal&#xD;
      symptoms, syncope and orthostatic hypotension. In the Vanderbilt University Medical Center&#xD;
      bariatric surgical center, 741 post-bariatric surgery patients reported OI symptoms, 98&#xD;
      (13.2%) of these patients, progressed to chronic OI and in17 cases, the OI was so disabling&#xD;
      that patients initiated treatment with pressor agents. More than 50% of OI cases in the&#xD;
      cohort developed the condition during a weight-stable period. Hence, investigators propose&#xD;
      the novel hypothesis that after bariatric surgery, the persistent reduction in SNS activity&#xD;
      contributes to impaired orthostatic tolerance, which is independent of weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Considering that SNS vasoconstrictor activity depends on synaptic norepinephrine&#xD;
      concentrations, investigators propose a proof-of-concept study to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor, atomoxetine, which increases synaptic&#xD;
      norepinephrine concentrations, will improve post-bariatric OI. Understanding the changes in&#xD;
      SNS activity and its contribution to orthostatic tolerance after bariatric surgery is of&#xD;
      utmost importance to unravel the mechanisms of a novel and unrecognized syndrome,&#xD;
      post-bariatric OI. In 2014, nearly 200,000 individuals in the US underwent bariatric surgery,&#xD;
      and the number of bariatric surgery procedures is expected to increase by 22% each year. It&#xD;
      is projected, therefore, an increase in the incidence of post-bariatric OI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) will&#xD;
      be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OI is a chronic and disabling condition; treatment is challenging because current therapies&#xD;
      have debatable efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed application will not only provide central knowledge on the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      this new syndrome but also will fill an unmet therapeutic need by repurposing NET inhibitors&#xD;
      for the treatment of OI.&#xD;
