  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that aims to determine the effectiveness of a tetravalent&#xD;
      dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) when given through a community-based immunization program against&#xD;
      hospitalized and /or severe virologically confirmed dengue.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a matched case-control study. Cases will be children who are admitted with a clinical&#xD;
      suspicion of dengue at the study hospitals and were eligible to have received the dengue&#xD;
      vaccine during the mass immunization. The outcome of interest is hospitalized and/or severe&#xD;
      virologically-confirmed dengue and the exposure is receipt of the dengue vaccine. Each case&#xD;
      will be matched to two controls who were also eligible to have received the dengue vaccine&#xD;
      and lives in the same area as the case. Cases and controls will be matched by age and sex.&#xD;

      Any leftover sera will be used for future studies and stored at UPM-NIH for fifteen (15)&#xD;
      years after the end of this study. Future studies using the sera will undergo appropriate&#xD;
      ethical reviews as required. After this period, specimens will be destroyed according to&#xD;
      local guidelines. Additional consent will be obtained from the parent for storage and future&#xD;
      use of these samples. Only the Principal Investigator and designated study personnel will&#xD;
