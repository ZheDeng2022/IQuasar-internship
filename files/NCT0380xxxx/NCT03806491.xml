  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are prevalent among Veterans and result in significant physical&#xD;
      and psychological burden. Among those who receive treatment for AUDs, 1 in 3 relapses to&#xD;
      problematic drinking within one year of treatment. Thus, additional strategies are needed to&#xD;
      enhance alcohol treatment outcomes. One promising approach involves providing concurrent&#xD;
      treatment for a common complaint - difficulty falling or staying asleep. Up to 74% of&#xD;
      Veterans seeking treatment for AUD report co-occurring symptoms of insomnia. Given the&#xD;
      negative impact of insomnia on attention and emotion regulation, insomnia symptoms may&#xD;
      decrease patients' abilities to attend to alcohol treatment and manage negative emotions that&#xD;
      lead to craving and relapse. Moreover, approximately 50% of individuals with AUDs report&#xD;
      using alcohol to help them sleep, making relapse more likely for those with no other tools or&#xD;
      skills to help them sleep. Indeed, sleep disturbance has been identified as a risk factor for&#xD;
      relapse among individuals in alcohol treatment. Thus, effective treatment of sleep problems&#xD;
      may enhance alcohol treatment. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been&#xD;
      effective in reducing insomnia severity in individuals with AUDs; however, no investigations&#xD;
      have examined the efficacy of CBT-I delivered concurrently with AUD treatment to determine&#xD;
      its impact on treatment outcomes. This R21 aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and initial efficacy of a CBT-I supplement to ongoing alcohol treatment. A randomized pilot&#xD;
      trial with 80 Veterans who meet diagnostic criteria for AUD and Insomnia Disorder will be&#xD;
      conducted. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for&#xD;
      Insomnia (CBT-I) or minimal treatment (educational handout only; EDU) in addition to alcohol&#xD;
      treatment as usual. Outcomes will be assessed at the end of the active intervention period (6&#xD;
      weeks) and 6 weeks post-intervention. Preliminary process outcomes include&#xD;
      recruitment/retention rates and treatment satisfaction (feasibility and acceptability,&#xD;
      respectively). Primary outcomes are insomnia severity, percentage of heavy drinking days, and&#xD;
      alcohol-related problems; and we plan to examine post-treatment changes in insomnia severity&#xD;
      as a mediator of treatment effects on alcohol use outcomes. We will also assess treatment&#xD;
      effects on a variety of secondary clinical and mechanistic outcomes (e.g., PTSD symptoms,&#xD;
      attention, working memory, treatment-related learning). Multiple imputation will be used for&#xD;
      missing data, and analyses will be intent-to-treat.&#xD;

    <measure>Insomnia severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI); ISI will be used as a 7-item measure of insomnia severity in the past two weeks. Items assess difficulty falling or staying asleep, satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, the extent to which others notice their sleep problems, and worry/distress related to sleep problems. Response options range from 0 (not at all worried) to 4 (very much worried), with possible total scores ranging from 0 to 28. Participants scoring 10 or higher will be classified as screening positive for insomnia (Morin et al., 2011).114 Notably, self-report is the recommended method of assessment for symptoms of insomnia in adults (Schutte-Rodin et al., 2008).</description>

    <description>Assessed using the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (PCL-5); PCL-5 is a 20-item measure of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). On a scale of not at all (0) to extremely (4), participants indicate how frequently in the past month they were bothered by stressful experiences such as disturbing dreams, hyper-alertness, strong negative beliefs, and irritability. PCL-5 is scored by summing the responses. Possible scores range from 0-80, where higher scores indicate higher PTSD severity. Symptoms may also be gleaned into clusters of Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative alterations in cognition/mood, and Alterations in arousal/reactivity.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); PHQ-9 will be used as a 9-item measure of depressed mood and functioning that has demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity across adult samples. Participants will indicate how many days in the past two weeks (not at all, several days, more than half the days, or every day or nearly every day) they have experienced each problem. Scores will be summed and classified as minimal symptoms of depressed mood (&lt;10), moderate levels of depressed mood (10-14), high levels of depressed mood (15-19), or very high levels of depressed mood (20-27)</description>

    <measure>Alcohol craving</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS); The Penn Alcohol Craving Scale is a 5-item measure of alcohol craving in the past week. Participants rate the intensity, frequency, and duration of cravings, as well as their ability to resist acting on those cravings and their overall &quot;average alcohol craving&quot; for the past week. This measure has demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity (Flannery, Volpicelli, &amp; Pettinati, 1999)</description>

    <measure>Delay discounting</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ); The MCQ (Kirby, Petry, &amp; Bickel, 1999) will be used as a self-report measure of delay discounting. In 27 trials, participants will be asked to choose between a smaller, immediate reward or a larger, delayed reward. For example, &quot;Would you prefer $54 today or $55 in 117 days?&quot; Data will be used to calculate participants' discounting-rate parameter (k).</description>

    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to post-treatment (week 6) to follow up (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the 20-item UPPS-P Impulsive Behaviors Scale; UPPS is a 20-item measure of impulsivity and self-control. Participants indicate on a scale of not at all (0) to very (4) if statements such as &quot;I like to stop and think things over before I do them,&quot; &quot;When I am upset I often act without thinking,&quot; and &quot;I have a reserved and cautious attitude towards life&quot; are representative of him/her. Scoring is completed by summing items in the five subscales (sensation seeking, premeditation, perseverance, positive/negative urgency).</description>

    <description>Study therapists will follow the 2014 CBT-I in Veterans manual developed by leading researchers in the behavioral sleep medicine field. Intervention components include (1) sleep hygiene: limiting naps; avoiding caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, and rich/heavy foods before bedtime; exercising; establishing a bedtime routine; and creating a comfortable sleep environment; (2) sleep restriction: limiting time in bed in order to improve sleep efficiency, or the percentage of time in bed that is actually spent sleeping; time in bed will be titrated each week based on sleep efficiency; (3) stimulus control: strengthening association between bedroom and sleep to decrease conditioned arousal; (4) relaxation: diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and visual imagery to reduce arousal; and (5) cognitive therapy: identifying and challenging thoughts that interfere with sleep.</description>
