  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence to show that mindful meditation has a positive impact on health. To date,&#xD;
      all the studies done to investigate the effect of mindfulness on pregnancy outcomes have been&#xD;
      done through a traditional 8-10 weeks mindfulness classroom program with some home practice.&#xD;
      This time-intensive classroom training may be expensive and not convenient for many busy&#xD;
      pregnant women. This study will investigate the use of a smartphone app-based intervention to&#xD;
      determine if it has the potential to make mindfulness training more accessible, acceptable,&#xD;
      and convenient to a larger number of pregnant women. The use of an app as opposed to&#xD;
      traditional structured classes may increase a woman's ability and willingness to practice&#xD;
      mindfulness because the app can be used almost anywhere and at any time. This pilot study&#xD;
      aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a smartphone mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      application for pregnant women. As well, this study will compare the pregnancy outcomes of&#xD;
      women who use the app to those women who do not use the app.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised controlled trial to study the effect of the use of a mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation app on pregnancy outcomes. This study will measure how often the app is used, as&#xD;
      well as indicators of maternal health such as sleep, stress, depression, anxiety and other&#xD;
      perinatal outcomes (premature delivery, diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes),&#xD;
      high blood pressure in pregnancy (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy), inadequate growth of&#xD;
      the baby inside the womb (fetal growth restriction), bleeding in later pregnancy, mode of&#xD;
      delivery, pain relief during delivery, length of stay for mother and baby in the hospital,&#xD;
      admission of baby in ICU, pain relief medication requirement after delivery, and&#xD;
      breastfeeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to either group A (the experimental group) or group B&#xD;
      (the control group). All participants will be given a an actigraph to measure sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Group A will be given a free subscription to a mindfulness meditation app for&#xD;
      six months. They will also be given a general pregnancy sleep leaflet. Participants assigned&#xD;
      to Group B will be given the general pregnancy sleep leaflet only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 3 visits associated with this study. At each of the 3 visits, participants will&#xD;
      be given four questionnaires to complete - the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Perceived&#xD;
      Stress Questionnaire, Beck's Anxiety Inventory, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.&#xD;
      Participants in Group A will also be asked to complete a fifth survey at their post-partum&#xD;
      visit. This survey will collect information on how easy it was to use the mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on delivery outcomes will also be collected. This information will include things&#xD;
      such as any complications that occur during delivery, baby's birth weight and Apgar score,&#xD;
      any complications with baby's health, method of delivery, and pain medications used during&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>PSQI will be completed at 3 time-points: &lt;= 20 weeks gestation, 35-40 weeks gestation, 6 weeks post-partum.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate the frequency of sleep disturbances on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = &quot;Not during the past month&quot;; 1 = &quot;Less than once a week&quot;; 2 = &quot;Once or twice a week&quot;; 3 = &quot;Three or more times a week&quot;. Scores will be tallied. A score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality. Scores will be compared across 3 time-points.</description>

    <description>This scale measures post-natal and prenatal depression by asking participants to rate how they have felt emotionally during the last 7 days. Various 4-point Likert scales are used to measure the frequency of occurance (e.g. 0 = No never, 1 = Not very often, 2 = Yes, some of the time, 3 = Yes, most of the time). Scores will be tallied to measure level of depression. Higher scores indicate higher levels of post-natal depression. Scores will be compared across 3 time-points.</description>

Scores will be tallied to indicate severity of anxiety. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. Scores will be compared across 3 time-points.</description>
