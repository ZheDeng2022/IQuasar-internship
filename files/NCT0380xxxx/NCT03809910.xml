    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of a prototype power toothbrush (PTB) versus&#xD;
      a manual toothbrush in healthy, right-handed manual toothbrush (MTB) participants with no&#xD;
      signs of periodontal disease or excessive recession to remove dental plaque after a single&#xD;
      tooth brushing event. Prior to each treatment visit, participants will abstain from oral&#xD;
      hygiene for a period of 12 hours preceding a pre-brushing dental plaque evaluation.&#xD;
      Participants will then brush once under supervision for 2 minutes in 'Gum line' mode and&#xD;
      1-minute in 'Interdental' mode after which re-disclosing and a post-brushing plaque&#xD;
      assessment will be carried out.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory, randomized, single center, 4-treatment, 3-period, partial&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy participants with no signs of periodontal disease or excessive&#xD;
      recession, to assess a prototype PTB in removing dental plaque after a single brushing event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening visit, following provision of written informed consent, participants will be&#xD;
      provided PTB training to familiarize themselves with how the different modes and different&#xD;
      PTBs operate. Eligible participants will be provided with a washout fluoride toothpaste and&#xD;
      toothbrush for use at home during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be scheduled to attend appointment after a minimum of 3 days. For each&#xD;
      treatment visit, participants must abstain from oral hygiene for a period of 12hours,&#xD;
      immediately preceding the pre-brushing dental plaque evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will undergo an oral soft tissue (OST) examination followed by plaque&#xD;
      disclosing and a pre-brushing dental plaque assessment using the Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque&#xD;
      Index (RMNPI) index. In in periods 1 and 2, participants will be randomized to the study&#xD;
      treatment sequence with the prototype PTB and MTB used in a crossover manner and participants&#xD;
      will then brush under supervision followed by disclosing and post-brushing plaque&#xD;
      assessments. Participants assigned to the prototype PTB, it will be used for 2 minutes in&#xD;
      'Gum line' mode brushing and 1-minute brushing in 'Interdental' mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then brush once (1.3 grams [g] Â± 0.1 g of assigned toothpaste), under&#xD;
      supervision of study staff after which disclosing, and a post-brushing plaque assessment will&#xD;
      be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to brush with the washout paste following the post assessment&#xD;
      plaque assessments. A minimum of three days washout period will follow each treatment period&#xD;
      during which period Participants will brush with a standard washout toothpaste&#xD;

    <description>Change in plaque removal efficacy from pre-brushing to post-brushing in whole mouth (sites A to I) was assessed using RMNPI score, when prototype PTB used in the 'Gumline' mode versus a reference MTB after a single brushing event.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at single center in Canada. A total of 40 participants were screened, of whom 39 were randomized for treatment and 1 withdrew consent prior to randomization.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants received 4 treatments in 3 periods: 1. Prototype power toothbrush (PTB) in 'Gumline' mode, 2. Prototype PTB in 'Combined' mode ('Gumline' mode followed by 'Interdental' mode), 3. Reference manual toothbrush (MTB), 4. Reference PTB</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Sequence A-B-C</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to this group brushed their teeth as follows in supervision of study staff during site visit: Prototype PTB (A) in Period 1 (for 2 timed minutes [min] in 'Gumline' mode and 1 timed min in 'Interdental' mode) followed by Reference MTB (B) in Period 2 (for 1 timed min) and Reference PTB (C) in Period 3 (for 2 timed min). Clinical assessments were performed after 'Gumline' mode and 'Interdental' mode in same treatment period. Each treatment period was followed by a minimum of 3-days washout period and prior to each site visit, participants abstained from all oral hygiene for at least 12 hours. Participants received a fluoride toothpaste and manual toothbrush to use at home during washout period, recorded each brushing occasion (at home) and time of their last brushing prior to their next scheduled appointment on their diary. Overall study duration from first subject first visit (FSFV) to last subject last visit (LSLV) was 32 days.</description>

        <title>Change in Whole Mouth Rustogi Modified Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI) Score From Pre-Brushing to Post-Brushing (When Prototype Power Toothbrush [PTB] Was Used in 'Gumline' Mode vs a Reference Manual Toothbrush [MTB])</title>
        <description>Change in plaque removal efficacy from pre-brushing to post-brushing in whole mouth (sites A to I) was assessed using RMNPI score, when prototype PTB used in the 'Gumline' mode versus a reference MTB after a single brushing event. Dental plaque was assessed on all teeth excluding third molars (Universal Numbering System teeth 2 to 15, and 18 to 31), crowns, and surfaces with cervical restorations for a maximum of 28 eligible teeth. Plaque was assessed on one of the following score: 0 represents no dental plaque and 1 represents plaque present in the measured segment of the tooth; where lower score represents the better plaque removal efficacy. Change from pre-brushing = (post-brushing score - pre-brushing score).</description>

        <title>Change in Proximal RMNPI Score From Pre-Brushing to Post-Brushing (When Prototype PTB Was Used in 'Gumline' and 'Combined' Modes Versus a Reference PTB)</title>
        <description>Change in plaque removal efficacy from pre-brushing to post-brushing at the proximal tooth areas (referred to as proximal score-sites D and F) was assessed using RMNPI score, when prototype PTB used in the 'Gumline' and 'Combined' mode versus a reference PTB after a single brushing event. Dental plaque was assessed on all teeth excluding third molars (Universal Numbering System teeth 2 to 15, and 18 to 31), crowns, and surfaces with cervical restorations for a maximum of 28 eligible teeth. Plaque was assessed on one of the following score: 0 represents no dental plaque and 1 represents plaque present in the measured segment of the tooth; where lower score represents the better plaque removal efficacy. Change from pre-brushing = (post-brushing score - pre-brushing score).</description>

        <population>mITT Population included all randomized participants who had received at least one dose of study products (supervised brushing in study period 1, 2 or 3) and had provided at least one post-brushing assessment of efficacy.
