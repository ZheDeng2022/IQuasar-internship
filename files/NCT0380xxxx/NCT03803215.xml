      The study aims at assessing that theophylline is effective in patients with no prodromes,&#xD;
      normal heart and with low values of plasmatic adenosine compared with a propensity-score&#xD;
      matched untreated control population who have received an implantable cardiac monitor (ICM)&#xD;
      for diagnosis of unexplained or atypical reflex syncope.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Theophylline has been used for 3 decades in ordinary medical practice to tentatively prevent&#xD;
      syncopal recurrences in patients affected by neurally-mediated syncope. Observational studies&#xD;
      report a recurrence rate with this drug ranging between 12% and 22%. Theophylline was much&#xD;
      more effective in selected patients with syncope without prodromes and normal heart who had&#xD;
      ECG documentation of long pauses at the time of syncopal attack and low values of baseline&#xD;
      plasmatic adenosine. Since theophylline is a non-selective antagonist of purinergic&#xD;
      receptors, it has been hypothesized that purinergic receptors are involved in the mechanism&#xD;
      of syncope in such patients. Conversely, theophylline was suspected to be ineffective (or&#xD;
      less effective) in patients affected by other forms of neurally-mediated syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims at assessing that theophylline is effective in patients with no&#xD;
      prodromes, normal heart and with low values of plasmatic adenosine compared with a&#xD;
      propensity-score matched untreated control population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter, non interventional study, verified by ICM, with 2 predefined&#xD;
      subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup #1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low adenosine group: Patients with Low Adenosine values (&lt;0.40 μmol/L)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal/high adenosine (≥0.40 μmol/L) group: any other patient Subgroup #2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with no prodromes or very short prodromes (≤5 sec), normal heart and normal ECG&#xD;
           (No prodrome group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other form of atypical neurally-mediated syncope with prodromes &gt;5 sec. Remote or&#xD;
           in-hospital periodic follow-up will be done according to centre's clinical practice for&#xD;
           ICM monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up until the first primary endpoint event with a maximum follow-up&#xD;
      of 24 months since start of theophylline treatment.&#xD;
