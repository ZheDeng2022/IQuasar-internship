      The goal of this study is to figure out the best doses for two antibiotics (called cefadroxil&#xD;
      and cephalexin) when they are used to treat bone, joint, or muscle infections in children. In&#xD;
      order to do this, the study will collect data about children admitted to Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Colorado who have these types of infections. During the study, these patients will receive&#xD;
      doses by mouth of each of these antibiotics, in addition to an IV antibiotic (given through a&#xD;
      vein) used to treat their infection. After the dose of the first antibiotic, blood samples&#xD;
      will be drawn every few hours to measure how much of the drug is still in their body, until&#xD;
      it is all gone. After the first antibiotic is out of the patient's body, the same will be&#xD;
      done for the second antibiotic. Measurements, in the lab, of how much of these antibiotics&#xD;
      are needed to kill the most common bacteria causing these infections, which is a type of&#xD;
      &quot;Staph&quot; bacteria called &quot;MSSA&quot;, will be taken. Finally, the blood levels of the antibiotics&#xD;
      and the information from the lab tests about the Staph bacteria will be used to calculate how&#xD;
      much and how often of the antibiotic should be given to children with bone, joint, or muscle&#xD;
      infections. Currently, these types of infections are treated with an antibiotic that children&#xD;
      have to take four times every day. The goal of this study is to find an antibiotic that&#xD;
      children can take only two or three times per day.&#xD;

      This study aims to shift the current treatment paradigm for the use of oral first-generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins in pediatric musculoskeletal (MSK) infections. Optimizing treatment for MSK&#xD;
      infections is particularly important, as osteomyelitis is one of the most common severe&#xD;
      infections affecting children. Treatment for these infections has markedly improved over the&#xD;
      last few decades, but significant morbidity is still seen, including the possibility of&#xD;
      permanent disability due to pathologic fracture, growth arrest, and joint destruction. To&#xD;
      avoid these long term sequelae and recrudescent infection, early diagnosis, appropriate&#xD;
      therapy, and prolonged treatment courses (typically 4-6 weeks, or longer) are essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used antibiotic for MSK infections is cephalexin, a first-generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin. It is well tolerated, provides good tissue penetration, and has a preferred&#xD;
      spectrum of activity for typical MSK pathogens, including methicillin susceptible&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Despite cephalexin's widespread use, its most significant&#xD;
      disadvantage is its short plasma half-life. Because of this, cephalexin is traditionally&#xD;
      dosed four times daily (QID) for serious infections like osteomyelitis. However, this dosing&#xD;
      frequency, especially for prolonged treatment courses, proves difficult for both patients and&#xD;
      their families. Concern about poor adherence drives some providers to prolong IV therapy or&#xD;
      dose cephalexin three times daily (TID), though there are insufficient&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) or outcome data to support TID dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cefadroxil, another first-generation cephalosporin, is an appealing alternative to cephalexin&#xD;
      due to its longer half-life. Because of this, the investigators hypothesize that cefadroxil&#xD;
      could be used effectively in pediatric patients with MSK infections with a more convenient&#xD;
      dosing schedule than cephalexin. While cephalexin is typically dosed 3-4 times per day,&#xD;
      cefadroxil could likely be dosed 2-3 times per day, even for serious infections like&#xD;
      osteomyelitis. However, cefadroxil is rarely prescribed to children due to a lack of&#xD;
      pediatric PK/PD data to guide dosing. Our study aims to address this unmet need and help&#xD;
      physicians use these existing drugs in smarter and more effective ways in pediatric MSK&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use a Population PK approach to define comparative PK parameters of cefadroxil and&#xD;
           cephalexin in pediatric patients with MSK infections (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis,&#xD;
           pyomyositis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish reference MIC ranges for both cefadroxil and cephalexin against MSSA isolates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform pharmacodynamic modeling (Monte Carlo simulation) based on the above PK&#xD;
           parameters and MIC data to evaluate the expected PK/PD target attainment of cefadroxil&#xD;
           and cephalexin at different dosing intervals: cephalexin given as 3 vs. 4 divided doses&#xD;
           per day; cefadroxil given as 2 vs. 3 doses against a range of MICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, patients with MSK infections admitted to Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Colorado (CHCO) will be enrolled in this study and sequentially given doses of both&#xD;
      cefadroxil and cephalexin. After each oral dose, serum levels of the antibiotic will be&#xD;
      measured at set time points until the drug is expected to be fully cleared. They will then&#xD;
      receive the second antibiotic after a 24-hour washout period. MIC ranges will be measured&#xD;
      based on banked MSSA isolates. Based on these study-derived PK and MIC data, adequacy of the&#xD;
      studied cephalexin and cefadroxil dosing regimens will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study is able to confirm a favorable PK/PD profile for twice daily (BID) and/or three&#xD;
      times daily (TID) cefadroxil dosing in children, even for severe infections, it could have an&#xD;
      immediate impact on prescribing habits. Less frequent dosing would be an improvement over the&#xD;
      current standard of care, allowing for easier medication administration, improved adherence,&#xD;
      and increased provider confidence for early transition to oral therapy, which are all&#xD;
      essential for optimal treatment of pediatric MSK infections.&#xD;
