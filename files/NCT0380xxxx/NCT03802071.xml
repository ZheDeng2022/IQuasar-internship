      The yearly incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) in the USA is roughly 11,280 cases, and&#xD;
      metastatic STS have a median overall survival of about 12 months. Sarcomas of the soft tissue&#xD;
      are a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal origin that originate in&#xD;
      connective tissue. Local control with wide surgical resection with or without adjuvant&#xD;
      radiation has a success rate of close to 90%. However, approximately 40% to 50% of patients&#xD;
      with a large (&gt;5 cm), deep, high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma eventually develop distant&#xD;
      metastases, primarily in the lung. Therefore, overall survival of metastatic STS remained&#xD;
      still poor, less than 1 year. Therefore, current clinical trials with various targeted agents&#xD;
      are ongoing add on the doxorubicin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator planned to conduct the phase I/II trial of durvalumab in combination with&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy, doxorubicin for metastatic/recurred sofe tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

      remained still poor, less than 1 year. Therefore, current clinical trials with various&#xD;
      targeted agents are ongoing add on the doxorubicin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits binding of PD-L1. For this&#xD;
      orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 may be a promising strategy and favorable toxicity may warrant&#xD;
      further combination. For this orphan tumor, STS, PD-L1 targeting may be a promising strategy&#xD;
      and favorable toxicity may warrant further combination. Regarding anti-PD-L1 treatment in&#xD;
      STS, in phase I trial with human monoclonal antibody to PD-L1, MPDL3280A, one heavily treated&#xD;
      synovial sarcoma patients demonstrated partial responses. In recent phase II study of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, PD-1 inhibitor in advanced STS among the 40 STS cases (17.5%) had responses (1&#xD;
      complete response and 6 partial response). Based on the study, pembrolizumab monotherapy was&#xD;
      approved for previously treated STS in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, various clinical trials are ongoing immune checkpoint inhibitor with PDGFR&#xD;
      inhibitors [axitinib for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pazopanib for RCC and STS, Sorafenib for&#xD;
      RCC, and liver cancer, sunitinib for RCC, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer].&#xD;
