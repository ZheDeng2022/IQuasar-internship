    <intervention_name>IntelliSpace Cognition (ISC)</intervention_name>
    <description>Philips ISC is a Class-II Medical Device in the US and provides objective data regarding cognition via scoring algorithms that HCPs can use to inform diagnostic decision making and treatment planning. It enables tracking cognition over time and offers the possibility of new outcome measures. ISC can be used in a variety of healthcare environments such as neurology and neuropsychology practices.</description>
