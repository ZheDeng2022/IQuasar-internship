  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult participants (18-64 years old) with HIV-1 Infection on ART with a CD4 T cell count ≥&#xD;
      350 cells/mm3 and viral suppression for ≥ 24 months will be enrolled on this study.&#xD;
      Participants will receive two series of combination therapy consisting of one (1) intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) dose of VRC-HIVMAB075-00-AB (VRC07-523LS) followed by 10 oral (PO) doses of Vorinostat&#xD;
      (VOR) taken every 72 hours. Each series will last approximately 1 month and the two series&#xD;
      will be separated by at least one month. Combination ART is maintained throughout the study.&#xD;
      Participants will be on this study for approximately 28 weeks (or about 7 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of two series of a VRC07-523LS infusion followed by multiple oral&#xD;
           doses of VOR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if combining VRC07-523LS and VOR can have an impact on non-active HIV virus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-site, open-label study to evaluate the effects of VOR given in&#xD;
      combination with VRC07-523LS on persistent HIV-1 Infection in HIV-infected individuals&#xD;
      suppressed on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with VRC07-523LS and VOR will be safe&#xD;
      and well-tolerated by HIV-1-infected participants suppressed on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 1, all participants will undergo study screening and enrollment. Participants will&#xD;
      complete a baseline Leukapheresis (#1). In order to advance to Step 2, participants must be&#xD;
      found to have a baseline measurement of the frequency of resting CD4 T cell infection ≥ 0.3&#xD;
      infectious units per million (IUPM) determined by Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA)&#xD;
      (lower limit of detection is 0.03 IUPM), as a further decrease from this low frequency of&#xD;
      infection cannot be definitively measured given the QVOA assay threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These criteria assure that eligible enrolled participants will have a measurable endpoint,&#xD;
      thus decreasing risk of study participation for participants who would not have a measurable&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants progressing to Steps 2 and 3 will receive two series of a single VRC07-523LS&#xD;
      infusion followed by multiple doses of VOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first series (Step 2), participants will receive one VRC07-523LS 40 mg/kg infusion&#xD;
      (infusion #1) on Day 0 followed by the 1st dose of VOR 400 mg PO taken at home on Day 2.&#xD;
      Participants will take VOR 400 mg PO every 72 hours for a total of 10 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second series (Step 3), participants will receive one VRC07-523LS 40 mg/kg infusion&#xD;
      (infusion #2) on Day 60 followed by the 1st (of the 2nd series of VOR) dose of VOR 400 mg PO&#xD;
      on Day 62. As in the previous Step, participants will take VOR 400 mg PO every 72 hours for a&#xD;
      total of 10 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4 consists of 2 visits. The post-study treatment leukapheresis (#2) will be completed 5&#xD;
      - 8 weeks after the 2nd VRC07-523LS infusion. The End of Study Visit (EOS) will be scheduled&#xD;
      to 2 - 4 weeks following the final leukapheresis (#2) visit.&#xD;
