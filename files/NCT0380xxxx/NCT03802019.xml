    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of changes in cigarette package color on&#xD;
      smoking behaviors, harm exposure, and risk perceptions when using low nicotine content (LNC)&#xD;
      cigarettes.&#xD;

      This project will utilize a randomized, parallel-design trial to examine the effects of low&#xD;
      nicotine content (LNC) cigarette packaging on smoking behaviors, harm exposure, risk&#xD;
      perceptions, and subjective ratings of cigarettes. The investigators will aim to recruit and&#xD;
      randomize 500 daily smokers (~250 male, ~250 female) in a 35-day protocol. After completing a&#xD;
      5-day baseline period of smoking their own brand, participants will be randomized to a 30-day&#xD;
      experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control), or LNC&#xD;
      cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (gray packaging); red,&#xD;
      or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend 5 in-person sessions at the Center for Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Research on Nicotine Addiction (CIRNA) on Days 0, 5, 10, 20 &amp; 35. At Intake and Days 15, 25&#xD;
      and 30 participants will complete sessions with research staff remotely (i.e. by video call).&#xD;
      Sessions will occur every 4-6 days, for a total of 5 in-person and 4 remote sessions across&#xD;
      35 days.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This project will recruit current, daily cigarette smokers to a 35-day, randomized, controlled, parallel design protocol. After a 5-day period of smoking their own preferred brand cigarettes, participants will be randomized to a 30-day experimental period when they will receive either their own preferred brand (control group), or LNC cigarettes in one of four types of packaging: standard investigational (current gray packaging); red, or blue (tobacco industry strategy); or plain packaging (tobacco control strategy), for 30 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants will be informed that they will be supplied with study cigarettes with a low nicotine content, but will be blinded to the exact nicotine content and unaware that all packages will contain the same type of low nicotine content cigarette.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Daily Cigarette Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Daily cigarette consumption will be assessed by participant self-report and verified through collection of spent filters for all cigarettes smoked throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Puff Volume/Puff Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Total puff volume/puff duration (the sum of all puff volumes/duration per cigarette) will be collected for each cigarette smoked during each laboratory session using a standardized video scoring procedure. Total puff volume will be assessed for each cigarette smoked at in-person and remote sessions throughout the entire 35-day study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 5, 10, 20 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess CO (measured in parts per million [ppm]), a measure of toxicant exposure, at the onset of each session, as well as before and after each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session. CO collected at the onset of each session represents daily exposure, while CO boost - the change in CO values before and after smoking a cigarette - estimates smoke exposure due to smoking an individual cigarette.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Nicotine Equivalents</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at Day 5 and Day 35 will be assessed for changes in total nicotine equivalents, nicotine plus its primary metabolites, across the experimental study period (Days 5-35). Total nicotine equivalents will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total NNAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 5 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Urine collected at D5 and D35 will be assessed for changes in NNAL, a biomarker of carcinogen exposure, across the experimental study period (Days 5-35). Total NNAL will be measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng per mL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Cigarette Ratings (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] of Cigarette Characteristics)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 5, 10, 20 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will provide subjective ratings of each cigarette smoked during each in-person laboratory session using a 14-item, 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) of cigarette characteristics. Anchors are item-specific (e.g., taste: 0 = &quot;very bad,&quot; 100 = &quot;very good&quot;), with lower scores indicating less favorable ratings.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Risk Beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 5, 20, and 35</time_frame>
    <description>To assess risk beliefs about the assigned cigarettes, the investigators will use an 8-item, 5-point scale (1 = definitely untrue; 5 = definitely true) including previously validated items (i.e., &quot;Compared to your own cigarettes, the cigarettes you are currently smoking: are lower in nicotine&quot;). The Cigarette Risk Beliefs questionnaire will be administered at Session 1 (Day 0) before the lab cigarette (18-item baseline version), Session 2 (Day 5) before lab cigarette 1 and 2, Session 5 (Day 20) before the lab cigarette, and Session 8 (Day 35) before the lab cigarette.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Craving (Questionnaire on Smoking Urges [QSU])</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 5, 10, 20 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarette craving at the onset of each in-person session. Craving will be assessed using a summary score and two factor subscales (i.e., desire to smoke and craving due to anticipation of negative affect relief) from a 32-item Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU). Participants will respond to each item along a 7-point scale (1=Strongly disagree; 7=Strongly agree).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette Withdrawal (Withdrawal Symptom Checklist [WSC])</measure>
    <time_frame>: Days 0, 5, 10, 20 and 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report cigarette withdrawal at the onset of each in-person session. Withdrawal will be assessed using a summary score from the 20-item (21 items at Session 1 [Day 0]) revised version of the Withdrawal Symptom Checklist with a one-week frame of reference (WSC-W). Specifically, participants will respond regarding to how they felt in regards to each potential withdrawal symptom along a 4-point scale (0=Not Present; 3=Severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Puff Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be video recorded while smoking each lab cigarette in order to collect smoking topography data. During remote sessions, participants will be asked to record a video of their smoking to collect smoking topography data. We have previously used a procedure where we score digital files (video recorded) smoking sessions that has good reliability and consistency (ICCs &gt;.55) for number of puffs taken, interpuff interval, total time lit, and amount smoked (by mass and length), and propose to quantify cigarette smoking behavior using the same procedures.</description>
