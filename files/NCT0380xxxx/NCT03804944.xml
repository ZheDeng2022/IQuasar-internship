  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly diagnosed post-menopausal women with clinical stage II-III, HR+HER2- breast cancer are&#xD;
      eligible to a randomized trial, concurrently open at five US academic institutions. Patients&#xD;
      receiving 4 months of standard neoadjuvant hormonal therapy with letrozole are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of 4 arms of a trial testing focal hypo-fractionated RT alone or with&#xD;
      immunotherapy combinations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be on the study for a total of 5 months, this includes 4 months on active study&#xD;
      intervention, with breast surgery at week 16 and one month follow up period, after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of these 4 arms - 1. Anti-PD1 antibody&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (Keytruda, Merck) will be infused day 12, at the standard dose of 200 mg IV&#xD;
      over 30 minutes, repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      2. FLT3L (CDX-301, the recombinant human protein by Celldex) will be self-administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously, in 5 consecutive daily injections, week 1, day 1-5. 3. For all arms radiation&#xD;
      therapy to the breast tumor will begin on week 2 (Day 8,10,12), at dose of 8 Gy x 3&#xD;
      fractions, every other day. 4. Letrozole (Femara ®, Novartis) 2.5 mg tabs, once a day, daily&#xD;
      for 4 months, until surgery, and thereafter is decided by the treating physician.&#xD;
