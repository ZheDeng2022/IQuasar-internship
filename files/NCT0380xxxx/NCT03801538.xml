      HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with low Level HBsAg were enrolled. After&#xD;
      giving informed consent, patients were treated with nucleoside analog(s) (NAs) once a day and&#xD;
      weekly subcutaneous injections of peginterferon alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or peginterferon&#xD;
      alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week for 12 weeks. At week 12, the decrease of HBsAg was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ①If the decrease of HBsAg is more than 50% compared to baseline level. NAs was stopped,&#xD;
      patients were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week. Treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(&lt;0.05 IU/ mL).&#xD;
      Depending on the decline of HBsAg level, treatment was either continued for a prolonged&#xD;
      period (no more than 96 weeks) until the endpoint was achieved, or terminated in week 96.&#xD;
      After treatment, all patients were followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ②If the decrease of HBsAg is less than 50% compared to baseline level. The combination&#xD;
      therapy of NAs and peginterferon alfa was extended to week 24. Then, the decrease of HBsAg&#xD;
      was evaluated again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the decrease of HBsAg is more than 50% compared to baseline level. NAs was stopped,&#xD;
      patients were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week. Treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(&lt;0.05 IU/mL).&#xD;

&#xD;
      If the decrease of HBsAg is less than 50% compared to baseline level. Peginterferon alfa was&#xD;
      stopped, patients were treated with NAs once a day and then followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who maintained the original NAs treatment served as a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that more than 400 million people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)&#xD;
      globally. HBeAg-negative CHB patients with low Level HBsAg were enrolled in the out-patient&#xD;
      department of Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Wuhan Union Hospital.&#xD;
      All of them were HBsAg positive and anti-HBs negative for more than 6 months with HBV DNA&lt;100&#xD;
      IU/mL and HBsAg levels &lt;1000 IU/mL. All patients did not have other liver diseases and&#xD;
      contraindications for interferon therapy. After giving informed consent, patients were&#xD;
      treated with nucleoside analog(s) (NAs) once a day and weekly subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or peginterferon alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week for 12&#xD;
      weeks. At week 12, the decrease of HBsAg was evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ①If the decrease of HBsAg is more than 50% compared to baseline level. NAs was stopped,&#xD;
      patients were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week. Treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(&lt;0.05 IU/ mL).&#xD;
      Depending on the decline of HBsAg level, treatment was either continued for a prolonged&#xD;
      period (no more than 96 weeks) until the endpoint was achieved, or terminated in week 96.&#xD;
      After treatment, all patients were followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ②If the decrease of HBsAg is less than 50% compared to baseline level. The combination&#xD;
      therapy of NAs and peginterferon alfa was extended to week 24. Then, the decrease of HBsAg&#xD;
      was evaluated again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the decrease of HBsAg is more than 50% compared to baseline level. NAs was stopped,&#xD;
      patients were treated with weekly subcutaneous injections of alfa-2a 180 micrograms/week or&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2b 180 micrograms/week. Treatment endpoint was HBsAg loss(&lt;0.05 IU/mL).&#xD;

&#xD;
      If the decrease of HBsAg is less than 50% compared to baseline level. Peginterferon alfa was&#xD;
      stopped, patients were treated with NAs once a day and then followed up for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of other immune suppressive or regulatory drugs and other antiviral drugs was&#xD;
      prohibited during the course of the study. In this study, HBsAg loss(&lt;0.05 IU/mL) was defined&#xD;
      as treatment endpoint. Anti-HBs positive(&gt;10 milli-International unit)(mIU/mL) was defined as&#xD;
      seroconversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who maintained the original NAs treatment served as a control group.&#xD;
