    <textblock>
      The study design is a phase II interventional trial for women with biopsy proven high-grade&#xD;
      cervical dysplasia. The study is an open label study and randomized. The study will have two&#xD;
      arms. Patients will be randomized to both arms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-grade cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II/III), is both&#xD;
      detectable and quantifiable, which presents many opportunities for evaluation or early&#xD;
      treatment, intervention and eventually, for cancer prevention. High-grade dysplasia is&#xD;
      typically detected during cervical cancer screening with a pap smear. To determine the&#xD;
      pathologic response rate of high grade cervical dysplasia with PD-1 checkpoint modulation&#xD;
      with Nivolumab.This is a randomized phase II trial with two experimental arms (1 dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab and 3 doses of nivolumab).&#xD;

                  1,500/mcl. Platelets greater than or equal to100, 000/mcl. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Renal function: creatinine less than or equal to institutional upper limit normal&#xD;
                  (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault) â‰¥ 50 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5xULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/=50 mL/min (using&#xD;
                  the Cockcroft-Gault formula)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female CrCl = (140-age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85 72 x serum creatinine in&#xD;
                  mg/dL&#xD;
