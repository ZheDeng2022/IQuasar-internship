  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate a treatment approach for alcohol use disorder (AUD)&#xD;
      using a novel form of brain stimulation called deep repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS). The investigators will be targeting frontal regions of the brain that are&#xD;
      important for memory and decision making. These brain regions have been shown to be impaired&#xD;
      in patients with AUD. Previous studies have mostly used rTMS to a different frontal brain&#xD;
      region that is not as deep. These studies have shown that rTMS can reduce craving for&#xD;
      alcohol, but there is a lack of research showing that rTMS impacts alcohol consumption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to examine the effect of rTMS on alcohol drinking behavior in an observed&#xD;
      laboratory setting. Participants with AUD will be recruited and admitted to the inpatient&#xD;
      unit for the whole study. After a brief detoxification period, they will receive 3 weeks of&#xD;
      rTMS while in the research unit. Before and after the 3 weeks of stimulation, participants&#xD;
      will participate in a decision-making experiment where they can choose to have an alcoholic&#xD;
      drink or the equivalent amount of money that the drink would cost (alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration sessions). The investigators will examine their response to alcohol, as&#xD;
      well as their performance on tasks that relate to impulsivity and memory. Participants will&#xD;
      also undergo an MRI scan (with spectroscopy) before and after the stimulation period to look&#xD;
      at changes in the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain. Participants will then meet with a&#xD;
      study physician for 6 weeks after the study for assessments of alcohol use and medical&#xD;
      management sessions.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This AUQ (Bohn et al. 1995) is an 8-item self report questionnaire where participants rate a seven-point Likert scale with responses ranging from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;, and a total score is derived from the sum of these items following reverse scoring of two items. A lower score is a better outcome which represents less desire to drink. Scores range from 8-56.</description>
