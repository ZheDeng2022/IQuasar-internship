    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized comparison of two methods of catheter ablation of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation: Radiofrequency ablation which is the standard of care will be compared&#xD;
      to Cryoballoon ablation to perform pulmonary vein isolation. Primary endpoint for the&#xD;
      randomized comparison is the number of pulmonary veins that remain isolated on follow up&#xD;
      investigation. All patients will receive an implantable loop recorder to monitor clinical&#xD;
      response and identify patients who benefit the most from durable pulmonary vein isolation.&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a follow-up invasive assessment of pulmonary vein isolation, and&#xD;
      veins with reconnection will be re-isolated to determine if this strategy alters clinical&#xD;
      long-term outcome of ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder and carries considerable&#xD;
      mortality, morbidity and socio-economic costs in western societies. Treatment options include&#xD;
      anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolisms, antiarrhythmic or heart rate limiting drugs to&#xD;
      control symptoms, and catheter or surgical ablation to potentially eliminate sources of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation. Curative treatment is difficult, but ablation has been shown to be&#xD;
      superior to anti-arrhythmic drug treatment in the prevention of recurrent symptomatic atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in selected patients. The highest success rates are achieved in patients with&#xD;
      self-limiting episodes (paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, PAF), where data from randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials such as the recent MANTRA-PAF trial suggests ablation as a reasonable first&#xD;
      line treatment option. Almost anticipatory to these recent studies, there has been an&#xD;
      exponential growth in ablation procedures, which over the past decade has been offered&#xD;
      increasingly to patients without prior antiarrhythmic drug treatment. The therapeutic concept&#xD;
      for ablation is elimination of triggers of PAF by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI): Focal&#xD;
      triggers of atrial fibrillation are primarily located around the ostia of the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      draining into the left atrium, and the cornerstone of standard ablation strategies is to form&#xD;
      an encircling lesion around the pulmonary vein to isolate the trigger areas, thereby&#xD;
      preventing triggering of atrial fibrillation. However, success rates remain far below those&#xD;
      achieved with ablation of other types of arrhythmias, and results of long-term follow up has&#xD;
      shown annual rates of recurrence in the order of 5-10% even in patients with initially&#xD;
      successful ablation, leading to long term cure rates at or well below 50%. This highlights&#xD;
      the need for more effective ablation strategies to achieve better long-term cure rates for&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet this need, there has been a continuing development of ablation strategies and methods&#xD;
      of ablation, including technologies for robotic steering of catheters and technologies to&#xD;
      sense contact force between the ablation catheters and the heart to improve lesion formation.&#xD;
      Cryoballoon ablation is emerging as a safe, efficacious and simple method to isolate&#xD;
      pulmonary veins by a freeze-thaw lesion around the ostia, and seems to be the most promising&#xD;
      alternative to radiofrequency (RF) ablation for atrial fibrillation. The latter is a complex&#xD;
      procedure involving the use of electroanatomical computer mapping systems to generate&#xD;
      three-dimensional models of the left atrium in each patient, and has a very long learning&#xD;
      curve for operators. In contrast, cryoballoon ablation is achieved with a compliant balloon&#xD;
      placed over a guiding catheter in the pulmonary vein ostia and designed for single shot&#xD;
      isolation of each vein, without the use of a mapping system and with relatively short&#xD;
      learning curves. However, there has been no direct comparison of the two methods in a&#xD;
      randomized study, such as the one we are now proposing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying cause for recurrences of atrial fibrillation after ablation is presumed to be&#xD;
      recovery of electrical connection to the pulmonary veins. This presumption is based on the&#xD;
      finding of a high rate of reconnected pulmonary veins in patients with clinical recurrence&#xD;
      undergoing a second ablation procedure, but whether it exceeds that found in patients without&#xD;
      recurrence has not been systematically investigated in order to provide proof of concept. One&#xD;
      problem in this regard, is the difficulty in assessing the true occurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation since many episodes, particularly after ablation, are known to be asymptomatic&#xD;
      and self limiting. This problem can now be overcome by continuous monitoring of the heart&#xD;
      rhythm with a small subcutaneously implantable cardiac monitor which has been shown to&#xD;
      reliably detect episodes of atrial fibrillation and determine the time spent in atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (&quot;AF burden&quot;) This also raises the possibility that pre-ablation monitoring in&#xD;
      the individual patient can identify specific patterns of atrial fibrillation that is either&#xD;
      amenable or resistant to curative ablation, thereby improving patient selection for catheter&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A considerable proportion of patients have to undergo more than one ablation procedure within&#xD;
      the first year to achieve freedom from atrial fibrillation (30-50% depending on a number of&#xD;
      clinical factors). Re-isolation of the pulmonary veins will eliminate atrial fibrillation in&#xD;
      about 50-60% of these patients, but even so, as with initially successfully ablated patients&#xD;
      there is a long-term recurrence rate. Whether this pattern of short and long-term&#xD;
      recurrences, that carries considerable morbidity, socioeconomic costs and loss of quality of&#xD;
      life, could be avoided by a routine strategy with a second ablation procedure with&#xD;
      consolidating pulmonary vein isolation has not been investigated. Our study will provide&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating data on this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, several key questions regarding ablation for atrial fibrillation lack definitive&#xD;
      answers, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the best method for achieving durable pulmonary vein isolation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is durable isolation of all pulmonary veins necessary and sufficient to eliminate atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation in all patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do we select the patients that will benefit most from PV isolation? Specifically,&#xD;
           can continuous pre-ablation monitoring identify patients that are likely to have either&#xD;
           excellent or little effect of ablation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Could early re-isolation of pulmonary veins improve long-term results, even in patients&#xD;
           without early recurrences of AF?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of the present study proposal is to provide answers to these questions by&#xD;
      using an implantable cardiac monitor implanted 1 month prior to ablation to assess the effect&#xD;
      of PVI in patients with paroxysmal AF, randomized to either best radiofrequency ablation&#xD;
      (using a 3D mapping system with contact force sensing technology and irrigated tip catheters)&#xD;
      or Cryoballoon ablation using a new generation of the cryoballoon catheter. The outcome of&#xD;
      ablation will be assessed by 1) The number of completely isolated pulmonary veins at a&#xD;
      planned 2nd procedure 4-6 months after the initial procedure and 2) reduction in AF burden&#xD;
      pre- vs post ablation. All patients will thus undergo a second procedure (either a clinically&#xD;
      indicated re-ablation procedure or a planned invasive study) no earlier than 4 months and no&#xD;
      later than 6 months after the initial procedure. In agreement with current standards, the&#xD;
      study will utilize a 3 month blanking period after the first ablation (during which&#xD;
      recurrences can be a nonspecific consequence of ablation and are therefore not counted as&#xD;
      therapy failure). Pulmonary veins that are found to be re-connected during the 2nd procedure&#xD;
      will be isolated irrespective of symptom status and arrhythmia occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because this study design is tightly controlled and patients burdened with direct, invasive&#xD;
      outcome measures, we have the opportunity and the obligation to maximize the scientific&#xD;
      benefit of the study by analyzing data in several strata by pre-specified subprotocols in an&#xD;
      embedded 2-in-1 study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed according to randomization status of the patient (i.e.&#xD;
      intention-to-treat), to achieve the primary study objective of comparing the two methods of&#xD;
      ablation; and subsequently according to pulmonary vein isolation status (irrespective of&#xD;
      randomization) to achieve the study objectives of determining the effect of durable pulmonary&#xD;
      vein isolation on the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Finally, the whole cohort will be&#xD;
      followed for two years to determine mid- to long-term effects of repeated PV isolation on AF&#xD;
      burden.&#xD;
