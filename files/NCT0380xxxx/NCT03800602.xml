  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and metformin work in treating patients with&#xD;
      microsatellite stable (MSS) stage IV colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous&#xD;
      treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread. Metformin is an antidiabetic drug that and may reduce the risk of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer development in patients. Giving nivolumab and metformin may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with refractory microsatellite metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on the overall response rate&#xD;
      (ORR) as assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival, and biochemical response (CEA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the effect of nivolumab and metformin combination on immune and metabolic&#xD;
      biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment and systemic circulation (pre and post treatment&#xD;
      paired biopsies required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive metformin PO BID starting on day 1. After 14 days of metformin only period&#xD;
      patients also receive nivolumab IV every 4 weeks starting on day 15. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      consent withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 30 and then periodically&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
