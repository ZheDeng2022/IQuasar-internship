&#xD;
        Histological or cytological diagnosis of Squamous non-small cell Lung cancer;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC(stage IIIB/IV or recurrent NSCLC that do not meet the&#xD;
        criteria for radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy，Tumor stage will be classified according&#xD;
        to UICC/AJCC staging system version 8).Participants has received at least two previous&#xD;
        chemotherapy regimens for treatment failure (including disease progression and unacceptable&#xD;
        toxic and side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: a. first-line chemotherapy must be a platinum-containing two-drug regimen;b. Prior&#xD;
        adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is permitted.If recurrence or metastasis occurs during or&#xD;
        within 6 months after the completion of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it is considered&#xD;
        that adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a first-line systemic chemotherapy failure for&#xD;
        advanced disease.&quot; According to RECIST 1.1 , patients must have at least one measurable&#xD;
        lesion that can be accurately assessed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than/equal to 1.5×l09/L; Platelets greater&#xD;
        than/equal to 75×109/L; Hemoglobin greater than/equal to 80g/L; Aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
        (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than/equal to 3 times ULN, or less than/equal to&#xD;
        5 times ULN if known liver metastases; Total bilirubin less than/equal to 1.5 within&#xD;
        institutional limit of normal (ULN); Serum creatinine less than/equal to 1.5 times ULN;&#xD;

&#xD;
        Symptomatic metastatic central nervous system and/or cancerous meningitis.(After treatment&#xD;
        for brain metastasis, disease should be stable and last for at least 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
        first study administration, not requiring for steroid or anticonvulsant therapy,Subjects&#xD;
        with stable neurological symptoms may be enrolled ).For stable asymptomatic brain&#xD;
        metastases that have been treated with radiotherapy, at least one other site besides the&#xD;
        brain metastasis can be measured ,The subject can be enrolled, but the interval between the&#xD;
        last radiotherapy should be more than 4 weeks..&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subject receiving bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment for bone metastases was initiated&#xD;

        treatment prior to study and showing stable time less than 28 days,the subject is allowed&#xD;
        to use it.) If the ongoing bisphosphonate therapy dose is considered to be increased or&#xD;
        bisphosphonate therapy is initiated due to the aggravation of bone pain, researchers should&#xD;
        confirm whether the subject has PD according to the RECIST1.1 version.&#xD;
&#xD;
