    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy is an essential component of the management of patients with acute circulatory&#xD;
      failure. Nevertheless, unnecessary administration of fluids in non-responders is harmful.&#xD;
      Thus, the concept of fluid responsiveness has been suggested to guide fluid administration in&#xD;
      critically ill patients to avoid either over or under-transfusion. The aim of this work is to&#xD;
      investigate the ability of peripheral perfusion index to predict the hemodynamic response to&#xD;
      mini-fluid challenge in patients with septic shock .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The concept of fluid responsiveness has been suggested to guide fluid administration in&#xD;
      critically ill patients to avoid either over or under-transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several methods have been suggested to detect fluid responsiveness. Mini fluid challenge with&#xD;
      concomitant monitoring of stroke volume is one of the most robust methods for pre-load&#xD;
      challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main foreshortening of mini fluid challenge method is the need for a real-time cardiac&#xD;
      output monitor, to track the instantaneous change of stroke vole with changing body position.&#xD;
      Finding a surrogate to cardiac output to trace the effect of mini fluid challenge would make&#xD;
      the test more applicable without the need for advanced hemodynamic monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing interest in the use of perfusion indices in assessment of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness. Perfusion indices are measures for adequacy of oxygen delivery in peripheral&#xD;
      tissues; thus, they were hypothesized to be possible surrogates of cardiac output. Peripheral&#xD;
      perfusion index represents &quot;the ratio between the pulsatile and non-pulsatile component of&#xD;
      the light reaching the pulse oximeter&quot; . Peripheral perfusion index has been considered as a&#xD;
      numerical non-invasive measure for peripheral perfusion. PPI has the advantage over other&#xD;
      perfusion indices that it a non-invasive, user-friendly monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to investigate the ability of peripheral perfusion index to predict&#xD;
      the hemodynamic response to mini-fluid challenge in patients with septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mini-fluid challenge test will be performed by infusion of 200 mL Lactated Ringer's solution&#xD;
      over 1 minute. Velocity time integral will be monitored using Transthoracic echocardiography&#xD;
      at the left ventricular outflow tract at the apical five-chamber view. Cardiac output will be&#xD;
      calculated, and the patient will be considered fluid-responder if cardiac output increased by&#xD;
      10% after fluid challenge.&#xD;
