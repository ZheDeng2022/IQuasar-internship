    <textblock>
      Damage in vasculitis, as well as in other chronic inflammatory disorders, accrues over time&#xD;
      resulting in impairment of quality of life, development of disability and increased&#xD;
      mortality. For these reasons, damage represents an important outcome to be assessed and&#xD;
      measured both in trials and clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most widely used assessment tool for damage in vasculitis is the Vasculitis&#xD;
      Damage Index (VDI). However, VDI was developed for a no specific type of vasculitis and it&#xD;
      appears to be more suitable for damage assessment in ANCA-associated vasculitis than in&#xD;
      Behçet' disease (BD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BD is a chronic and multisystem inflammatory disorder classified among vasculitides. As well&#xD;
      as in other vasculitides, disease activity and treatment in BD can result in the development&#xD;
      and accumulation of irreversible organ damage, such as blindness, tissue loss and a wide&#xD;
      range of neurologic disorders. Recently the OMERACT has defined the Core Set domain of&#xD;
      Outcome Measures for BD. Despite damage is included in the OMERACT outcome core set for&#xD;
      rheumatic disease, a specific assessment tool for BD is currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate the first tool for describing and measuring&#xD;
      organ damage in patients with Behçet Disease (Behçet's disease Overall Damage index - BODI).&#xD;

      DESIGN OF THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational multicenter study will be developed in 2 subsequent phases, in their turn,&#xD;
      consisting of different steps (figure 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BODI Development 1.1) Development of a preliminary version of BODI (p-BODI) based on&#xD;
           literature review and inspired by pre-existing tools according to OMERACT guidelines;&#xD;
           1.2) Delphi process aimed to review and improve the p-BODI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation of the new tool according to OMERACT filter 2.0 2.1) Application of the BODI&#xD;
           on a multicentre cohort of BD patients. 2.2) Assessment of face, content, construct and&#xD;
           criterion validity, and sensitivity to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3) Assessment of reliability based on scoring exercise on clinical vignettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects involved in the study are experts in the management of BD. They will work in two&#xD;
      different groups having different roles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work and facilitator group (WFG): consisting of 3 Physician from the Coordinating&#xD;
           Centre. The tasks of the WFG are: (a) to review literature and develop a preliminary&#xD;
           version of BODI (p-BODI), including: definition of damage, rules for scoring and&#xD;
           identification of potential items of damage; (b) to coordinate the Delphi process for&#xD;
           editing and optimizing p-BODI; (c) to analyse data from the validation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expert Panel (EP): consisting of multidisciplinary experts in Behçet's disease and&#xD;
           Patient's delegate from different countries. EP members will be selected and invited to&#xD;
           participate in the study by the WFG. The tasks of the EP are to express their opinion on&#xD;
           p-BODI and propose editing for its improvement within a Delphi process;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinicians group (CG): consisting of one Clinician from each Centre, with expertise in&#xD;
           Behçet's disease but not involved in the Delphi process. The tasks of this group are:&#xD;
           (a) to apply the BODI on 30 consecutive patients with BD (10 for Neurologist and&#xD;
           Ophthalmologist) from each Centre involved in the study; (b) to score a set of clinical&#xD;
           vignettes using the BODI, to assess reliability of the instrument; (c) to express an&#xD;
           overall judgement (in an online survey) regarding to general credibility,&#xD;
           comprehensiveness and feasibility of the BODI.&#xD;

&#xD;
      OPERATIVE STUDY DEVELOPMENT AND DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BODI Development 1.1) Development of preliminary version of BODI (p-BODI) based on&#xD;
           literature review and inspired to pre-existing tools A preliminary list of damaged items&#xD;
           with respective definition will be generated after reviewing the literature and&#xD;
           preexisting damage indices (e.g VDI for vasculitides and SLICC damage index (SDI) for&#xD;
           systemic lupus erythematosus).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2) Reviewing and editing of the p-BODI by Delphi process A multi-step Delphi process,&#xD;
           based on reaching experts consensus, will be performed in order to review and refine the&#xD;
           p-BODI and the respective glossary. Through an online survey, each member EP will be&#xD;
           asked to rate: (a) how strongly they agree with the general rules for damage scoring;&#xD;
           (b) how strongly they agree to include the listed damage items within the BODI (e.g. to&#xD;
           which extent do you agree that &quot;Cataract&quot; should be included in the BODI?); (c) how&#xD;
           strongly they agree with the provided item definition. Ratings will be scored on a&#xD;
           5-point Likert scale (5 = strongly agree; 4 = agree; 3 = unsure; 2 = disagree; 1 =&#xD;
           strongly disagree). The EP members will be asked to give considerations and arguments to&#xD;
           support their opinion, especially if they score less than 4. They will also be given the&#xD;
           opportunity to suggest alternative wordings, to suggest additional items, or to make any&#xD;
           other comment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the reviewed p-BODI for the subsequent Delphi round, each issue (scoring rules,&#xD;
           damage items, item definitions) if: (a) ≥80% of EP members scores ≥4: will be included;&#xD;
           (b) 50-79% of EP members scores ≥4: will be included in the second questionnaire after&#xD;
           reviewing according to comments and suggestions provided in the previous round (c) &lt;50%&#xD;
           of EP members scores: will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The WFG has the right to make alternative decisions after reviewing the EP responses&#xD;
           (e.g propose to change an item definition according to a suggestion from the expert&#xD;
           panel, even if the item was scored &gt;4 by ≥80% of EP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           An anonymous feedback report will be provided with the second questionnaire, in order to&#xD;
           offer the opportunity to reconsider and, if appropriate, to change a previous opinion in&#xD;
           light of the anonymous responses and considerations of the other EP members. The panel&#xD;
           members will again be asked to give their opinion on each issue in subsequent rounds&#xD;
           until complete consensus will be achieved (all issues scored ≥4 by ≥80% of EP) and the&#xD;
           definitive version of BODI will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Validation of BODI 2.1) Application of BODI on a multi-center cohort of BD patients Each&#xD;
           CG member will be asked to apply the reviewed version of BODI on a cohort of 30 BD&#xD;
           patients consecutively assessed in their own center. For Neurologist and&#xD;
           Ophthalmologist, the data from 10 consecutive patients will be enough. This is because&#xD;
           Neurologist and Ophthalmologist usually take care of the most severe neuropsychiatric&#xD;
           and ocular cases, which might bias the real prevalence of these manifestations in the&#xD;
           study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter cohort consisting of 200-250 BD patients will be thus set up. Patients will&#xD;
      undergo a routine clinical assessment, as scheduled in their follow-up program. No further&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory or instrumental investigations will be performed in addition to those&#xD;
      provided according to the good clinical practice. Any possible drug administration will be&#xD;
      evaluated independently from the study and according to the good clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria will be: a) BD diagnosis according to ICBD criteria, b) disease duration&#xD;
      ≥12 months), c) age at enrolment ≥ 18 years. For each recruited patient data will be&#xD;
      anonymously collected at the enrolment visit (T0). For patients with more than 5 years of&#xD;
      follow-up at the enrollment time, investigators will be further asked to perform a 5 years&#xD;
      retrospective BODI (Tr5). The following data will be collected (see the attached Case Report&#xD;
      Form):&#xD;
&#xD;
      - T1: demographics and medical history (gender; birthday, onset, diagnosis and enrolment&#xD;
      date; country of origin; ethnicity; comorbidity; smoker status); cumulative clinical&#xD;
      manifestation from onset to enrolment (oral aphthosis, genital aphthosis, skin lesions,&#xD;
      ocular involvement, neurologic lesions, vascular lesions, pathergy test, arthritis,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal manifestations); active clinical manifestations the enrolment visit; ongoing&#xD;
      and past therapy; BD current activity form (BDCAF); BODI; VDI; Physician global assessment&#xD;
      (PGA)on visual analogic scale; Patients global assessment (PtGA) on visual analogic scale;&#xD;
      Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey,&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Tr5 (retrospectively): BODI&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2) Assessment of face, content, construct, criterion validity and sensitivity to change&#xD;
      Validation will be performed according to the principles of OMERACT Filter 2.0, thus&#xD;
      according to the criteria of (A) truth, (B) discrimination and (C) feasibility will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.1. Face validity. Since BODI will be developed through literature review and consensus&#xD;
      between an expert in BD management, face validity criteria should be automatically met.&#xD;
      However, face validity will be further tested by asking each CG member to complete a&#xD;
      questionnaire investigating the suitability of the tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.2. Content validity. To assure content validity, the presence of damage identified by CG&#xD;
      but not classifiable in BODI will be assessed. Content validity will be further tested by&#xD;
      asking each CG member to complete a questionnaire relating to the comprehensiveness of the&#xD;
      instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.3. Construct validity. It will be assessed analyzing the agreement between results of&#xD;
      damage assessment on our validation cohort by BODI and other damage assessment tool. Since&#xD;
      there are no other specific and validate instruments for damage amassment in Behçet disease,&#xD;
      SLICC and VDI will be used as a surrogate. Correlation between the different indices results&#xD;
      will be evaluated by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.4. Criterion Validity. Criterion validity represents the correlation with results of&#xD;
      measurement with the new tool and other long-term outcomes related to the phenomenon we are&#xD;
      measuring. Since we expect that damage correlates with quality of life, disability and&#xD;
      mortality, a correlation between BODI score and SF-36, HAQ and in the future also with&#xD;
      mortality rate will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.1. Reliability. Clinical vignettes will be created from real cases to test the reliability&#xD;
      of the BODI. Thus, inter-observer agreement (kappa) will be assessed by asking a physician&#xD;
      from every center to assess the same clinical vignettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.2. Sensitivity to change. The ability of the BODI to record the accumulation of damage over&#xD;
      time will be examined by determining the change in BODI score over 5 years of follow-up on&#xD;
      the validation cohort. The average increase of BODI score from T1 to T2 will be calculated&#xD;
      and will be tested by the Mann-Whitney test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Feasibility. To test feasibility each CG member will be asked to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      relating to the ease of use, consumption of time and interpretability of the instrument.&#xD;
