  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including among others puerperal&#xD;
      infections and cesarean delivery, and risk rises with increasing body mass index (BMI). Class&#xD;
      III obesity is an indication for delivery by 39 weeks, and these patients have a high rate of&#xD;
      labor induction. In nulliparous women from the general population (obese and non-obese),&#xD;
      labor induction at 39 weeks (compared to expectant management) is associated with less&#xD;
      morbidity and a lower cesarean rate. Antibiotic prophylaxis, standard before cesarean&#xD;
      delivery, is associated with less post-cesarean infection if azithromycin is added to the&#xD;
      standard cefazolin. In this placebo-controlled pilot trial, investigators will estimate the&#xD;
      parameters necessary to calculate the sample size for a planned multicenter clinical trial of&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics administered at the start of labor inductions of morbidly obese&#xD;
      nulliparous women at term.&#xD;

      Investigators will enroll consenting women delivering at The Children's Hospital at OU&#xD;
      Medical Center who meet enrollment criteria. Flyers will be distributed to providers to give&#xD;
      to women who may be eligible for the study at prenatal visits, so that they may review the&#xD;
      information prior to presenting for their induction of labor. Labor induction may be a&#xD;
      scheduled procedure. However, many inductions occur in an unscheduled fashion due to medical&#xD;
      or obstetric indications. Therefore, it is difficult to predict which women will ultimately&#xD;
      require labor induction and at what gestational age they will require it, so it is not&#xD;
      feasible to approach and consent all women during a clinic visit prior to labor induction.&#xD;
      Distribution of flyers will allow patients to have information about the study prior to&#xD;
      presenting for labor induction. Furthermore, unlike women in spontaneous labor, women being&#xD;
      consented just prior to a labor induction are not vulnerable in the same way as one might&#xD;
      consider a patient in labor, since they will not have the distraction and discomfort of&#xD;
      uterine contractions that are presenting in laboring patients.&#xD;
