  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the world's population. According to the WHO, it was one of&#xD;
      the ten most worrying pathologies of the twenty-first century. The situation of psychic&#xD;
      disability that results impacted the entire life course. This disease is characterized by&#xD;
      positive symptoms (delirium, hallucination, psychotic agitation) and negative symptoms and&#xD;
      disorganization (destructuring of thought, language and behavior). Cognitive disorders are&#xD;
      easily measurable in the spectrum of schizophrenia and are quantifiable with some tools to&#xD;
      measure the level of performance of the individual in different areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients apathy is found in one out of two cases (prevalence of 51%), so it is a&#xD;
      widespread negative symptom. Apathy corresponds to a pathology of voluntary action that can&#xD;
      exist in different forms, resulting from the alteration of one or more mechanisms. It is a&#xD;
      predictor of functional outcomes, regardless of positive symptoms or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of people with head injuries have found a link between frontal cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and apathy. The recognition, the identification of the dimensional mechanisms of apathy and&#xD;
      the understanding of the links with cognitive disorders are therefore a major issue in the&#xD;
      improvement of the functional prognosis. Moreover, these mechanisms are currently little&#xD;
      studied in the spectrum of schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently questionnaires to show the presence or absence of apathy, such as the&#xD;
      Apathy Evaluation Scale or the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. However most scales offer a global&#xD;
      apathy score and the proposed treatments are limited due to the difficulty in identifying the&#xD;
      dimensions and understanding of the underlying mechanisms of their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potentiality of apathy to become a source of disability is now widely recognized. It is&#xD;
      therefore important to consider the expression of this handicap in terms of the repercussions&#xD;
      that this disorder may have on the daily lives of patients. There are questionnaires to&#xD;
      measure the functional autonomy of patients with a psychic disorder. Apathy is also an&#xD;
      obstacle to supporting patients in psychiatry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of knowledge and underestimation of apathy and its mechanisms in schizophrenia, in&#xD;
      addition to overworking the psychiatric health sector, favor a drift towards the&#xD;
      institutionalization of the person, with its medico-economic consequences on the system.&#xD;

    <description>The DAS is a self-rated multidimensional apathy measure, consisting of 24 items assessing Executive, Initiation and Emotional dimensions of apathy. Each item was rated on a 4-point Likert scale (Hardlyever, Occasionally, Often and Almost always), the minimum score for each subscale is 0 (least apathy) and the maximum 24 (most apathy), with a total score of 72. The French Dimensional Apathy Scale (f-DAS) was firstly tested on healthy participants. The Cronbach Alpha of f-DAS was 0.71 and reflected an acceptable internal reliability.</description>
