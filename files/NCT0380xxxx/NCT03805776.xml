      World Health Organization report notifies of the escalating global burden of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD), projecting that it will become the major worldwide cause of death and&#xD;
      disability by 2020. The South Asian countries have the highest rates of CVD globally. It is&#xD;
      widely acknowledged that South Asians have 40-60% higher risk of CVD linked to mortality,&#xD;
      compared with other populations. Multiple human population studies have established the&#xD;
      concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as an independent, inverse&#xD;
      predictor of the risk of having a cardiovascular event. Furthermore, HDLs have several&#xD;
      well-documented functions with the potential to protect against cardiovascular disease. This&#xD;
      study trial is designed to find out the role of intermittent fasting to improve the&#xD;
      dyslipidemia and particularly increase the levels of HDL in general population. Investigators&#xD;
      expect that the intermittent fasting will significantly enhance the level of HDL and reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular events in general population.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall lipid profile is important in cardiovascular diseases but particularly serum HDL&#xD;
      levels have long been recognized as an independent inverse prognostic marker of CVD, when the&#xD;
      Framigham study, in 1980s showed that HDL below 40-60mg/dl is of prognostic relevance. A rise&#xD;
      of 1mg/dl in HDL levels is considered to reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) risk to 2-3%.&#xD;
      Even patients with elevated total cholesterol (TC) and LDL, presenting a high HDL are seen to&#xD;
      be protected from atherosclerosis. Multiple human population studies have shown the&#xD;
      concentration of HDL cholesterol as an independent, inverse predictor of the risk of having a&#xD;
      cardiovascular event. Additionally, HDL has several well-documented functions with the&#xD;
      potential to protect against cardiovascular diseases. These include an ability to promote the&#xD;
      efflux of cholesterol from macrophages in the artery wall, inhibit the oxidative modification&#xD;
      of LDL, inhibit vascular inflammation, inhibit thrombosis, promote endothelial repair,&#xD;
      promote angiogenesis, anti-oxidant, enhance endothelial function, improve diabetic control,&#xD;
      and inhibit hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. HDL also exerts direct cardio protective&#xD;
      effect, which are mediated with its interactions with the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have emphasised the high incidence of CVD within the South Asian countries.&#xD;
      The increased risk of cardiovascular events in South Asians at a younger age might be due to&#xD;
      unknown factors affecting plaque rupture, the interaction between prothrombotic factors and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, or may be due to any undiscovered risk factors. Urbanisation and&#xD;
      westernisation is characterised by a distinct increase in the intake of energy dense foods, a&#xD;
      decrease in physical activity, and a heightened level of psychosocial stress, all of which&#xD;
      promote the development of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Most common&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia in South Asians is low HDL-C and high triglycerides. High triglyceride and low&#xD;
      HDL-C levels are metabolically interlinked. This metabolic phenotype is also associated with&#xD;
      increased levels of small LDL particles despite relatively normal levels of LDL-C among South&#xD;
      Asians. This clinical syndrome is accompanied by insulin resistance, a condition frequently&#xD;
      referred to as atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is a common metabolic derangement among Asian.&#xD;
      South Asians not only have lower HDL levels but also have a higher concentration of small,&#xD;
      less-protective HDL particles. One proposed mechanism is presence of dysfunctional HDL&#xD;
      particles. Another potential explanation for the apparent blunted cardioprotection of HDL in&#xD;
      South Asians might be related to HDL particle size. Small particles might be less efficient&#xD;
      in reverse cholesterol transport. In general, HDL particle size tends to be lower in patients&#xD;
      with CHD and those with low HDL-C levels . Alarmingly, an estimated 60-80% of Pakistani&#xD;
      population has been reported to have low HDL. There are a number of non-pharmacological and&#xD;
      pharmacological recommendations for management of low HDL. Non-pharmacological (functional&#xD;
      food) strategies are reported to increase HDL levels around 10-15% and which include regular&#xD;
      exercise , body weight reduction in obese individuals , cessation of cigarette smoking in&#xD;
      smokers and dietary modifications like decrease intake of saturated trans-fatty acids with&#xD;
      increase intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids . There are also a number of&#xD;
      pharmacological agents being considered as therapeutic options but the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety issues limit their use in addition to limited success in improving HDL. IF may be a&#xD;
      dietary method to aid in the improvement of the lipid profile in healthy, obese and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia men and women, reducing total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides and increasing HDL&#xD;
      levels. However, the majority of studies that analyze the IF impacts on the lipid profile and&#xD;
      body weight loss are observational and lack detailed information about diet. Randomized&#xD;
      clinical trials with larger sample size are needed to evaluate the IF effects mainly in&#xD;
      population with dyslipidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent fasting is capable of improving dyslipidemia and particularly enhancement of&#xD;
      serum, HDL which can increase the cardioprotection in high risk general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of intermittent fasting on cholesterol levels specifically on HDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA STORAGE AND MANAGEMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will be given a code number, all data will be saved according to the code&#xD;
      numbers. Privacy will be maintain of each and every participant. Records will be kept&#xD;
      confidential and used only for scientific purposes by authorized personnel. The hard copies&#xD;
      will be kept in locked cupboards and soft data will be managed in password protected&#xD;
      computers. Data will be stored at institutional level for almost 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS AND PUBLICATION PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that Ajwa and intermittent fasting will significantly improve HDL levels&#xD;
      in order to enhance the cardiac protection. This research will help in promoting the&#xD;
      significance of use of functional food and fasting to improve overall health. Investigators&#xD;
      expect at least two publications from this study. The findings of the study will be presented&#xD;
      in international conference and will be published in well reputed journal.&#xD;
