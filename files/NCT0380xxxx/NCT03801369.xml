    <textblock>
      This phase II study assesses the efficacy of the combination of olaparib and durvalumab in&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Olaparib may&#xD;
      stop growth of tumors cells by inhibiting some of the enzymes (ADP ribose polymerase [PARP])&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody, inhibits the growth and spread of&#xD;
      tumors by stimulating the patient's antitumor immune response. Giving olaparib and durvalumab&#xD;
      together may provide an effective method to treat patients with metastatic triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess overall response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess participant benefit from treatment. II. Determine the time to disease progression&#xD;
      following response to study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine time to first disease progression or death of participants enrolled on the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine survival of participants enrolled on the study. V. Assess safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the proposed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Examine response rates depending on tumor characteristics. II. Identify predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. III. Identify emerging mechanism of resistance to&#xD;
      therapy. IV. Determine changes in tumor cells induced by PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single-arm phase II study of olaparib and durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with biopsy proven TNBC will undergo a pre-treatment biopsy, after which they will&#xD;
      receive a 28 days induction treatment of olaparib (oral, twice a day). At the 2 week mark,&#xD;
      patients will then undergo a repeat on-treatment biopsy. Beginning cycle 2, durvalumab will&#xD;
      be administered (intravenously [IV] over 1 hr) every 4 weeks, in addition to olaparib.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients deriving clinical benefit from treatment may, at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion and in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      may continue on therapy beyond the planned 13 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of all on-study procedures, patients will be considered off-treatment and&#xD;
      will be followed every 6 months for disease and survival outcomes up to 1 year. Patients will&#xD;
      be asked to submit an optional tumor biopsy in the event of disease progression.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 5.0. Incidence will be determined for participants with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) that received at least one dose of olaparib and/or durvalumab. The 95% confidence interval will be reported with the point estimate of toxicity rate.</description>

    <description>An estimate of CBR will be measured and reported with 95% exact confidence interval. Participants who achieve a CR, Pr, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 months on the current protocol will be qualified as deriving benefit from therapy, and will count towards the CBR measurement.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) for olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from first treatment with olaparib (i.e., cycle 1 day 1) to the first of either recurrence or relapse (anywhere in the body), or death at time of last follow-up at 12-months. The estimated distribution of the PFS will be plotted using Kaplan Meier curves and reported with median survival and 95% confidence intervals if available.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS) olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from first treatment with olaparib (i.e., day 1) to the date of death or last follow-up at 12 months. The estimated distribution of the OS will be plotted using Kaplan Meier curves and reported with median survival and 95% confidence intervals if available.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR) for olaparib in combination with durvalumab</measure>
    <time_frame>End of treatment (Up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or Pr (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started. The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented. If a participant dies, irrespective of cause, without documentation of recurrent or progressive disease beforehand, then the date of death will be used to denote the response end date.</description>

             surface antigen [HBsAg] result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (positive human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 1/2 antibodies). Participants with a past&#xD;
             or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody&#xD;
             [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Participants positive for hepatitis C&#xD;
             (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV&#xD;
             ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active primary immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first&#xD;
             dose of durvalumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids or&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
             prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid. The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra&#xD;
                  articular injection)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of&#xD;
                  prednisone or its equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan&#xD;
                  premedication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with&#xD;
             the exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis syndrome,&#xD;
             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid&#xD;
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.]). The following are exceptions to this&#xD;
             criterion:&#xD;

                  hormone replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only&#xD;
                  after consultation with the study physician&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with celiac disease controlled by diet alone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
