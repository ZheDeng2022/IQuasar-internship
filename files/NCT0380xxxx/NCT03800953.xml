  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single institutional, single arm, open labeled phase II study to assess the overall&#xD;
      radiographic response of adding Avelumab to chemotherapy and palliative radiotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avelumab belongs to the group of immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapies. Avelumab binds&#xD;
      to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and therefore inhibits binding to its receptor&#xD;
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In the case of avelumab, the formation of PD-1/PDL1 ligand&#xD;
      pairs is blocked and CD8+ T cell immune response should be increased. This study comprises 2&#xD;
      phases, the concurrent immune-chemoradiotherapy (Ave-PF-CRT) phase and the&#xD;
      immune-chemotherapy (Ave-PF) phase. In the immune-chemoradiotherapy phase, patients are&#xD;
      treated with PF-CRT and concomitant Avelumab. In the immune-chemotherapy phase, patients are&#xD;
      treated with PF plus Avelumab. Overall radiological response, time to progression, overall&#xD;
      survival and adverse events will be evaluated. Subjects' health-related quality of life will&#xD;
      be assessed as well.&#xD;

    <description>The self-reported health-related quality of life specific to esophageal cancer is a 44-item functioning scale captured using the Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Esophageal (FACT-E) Traditional Chinese version. Each question uses a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 4, and higher scores indicate better quality of life (0-176 for FACT-E total score). The FACT-E is assessed before treating is given, in the third week of Ave-PF-CRT phase (one cycle, 4 weeks), in the first week of every cycle (4 weeks) during the Ave-PF phase (5 cycles), and in the 2 years.&#xD;
Changes in total score of FACT-E from baseline to each assessment point will be calculated.</description>
