  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to investigate the effects of combined physical-cognitive training on&#xD;
      cognitive function as well as peripheral BDNF level and mitochondrial function of individuals&#xD;
      with MCI. It is hypothesized that: 1) the combined physical-cognitive training program will&#xD;
      be superior to the physical and cognitive training program alone; and 2) the degree of&#xD;
      cognitive improvement will be positively correlated with the improvement of plasma BDNF and&#xD;
      mitochondrial function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that the benefits of combined physical-cognitive training may be&#xD;
      greater than either physical or cognitive training alone. Nevertheless, this synergistic&#xD;
      effect has been demonstrated mainly in cognitively intact older adults. Studies examining the&#xD;
      effects of combined physical-cognitive training in older adults with MCI are scarce and show&#xD;
      mixed results. Moreover, few studies have determined the effects of the combined training on&#xD;
      peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondrial function. Thus, the&#xD;
      present study aims to investigate the effects of combined physical-cognitive training on&#xD;
      cognitive function as well as peripheral BDNF level and mitochondrial function of individuals&#xD;
      with MCI. The present study will provide insight into the interplay among the training&#xD;
      program, peripheral BDNF concentration, mitochondrial function, and cognitive function.&#xD;
      Importantly, the findings will have clinical implication regarding the training program that&#xD;
      is feasible and effective in improving cognitive function of older adults with MCI which&#xD;
      ultimately will have great impact on public health as this population is at high risk of&#xD;
      progression to AD.&#xD;

    <description>Fall risk will be assessed using the physiological profile assessment. The test consists of five sensorimotor and balance measures including visual contrast sensitivity, proprioception, quadriceps muscle strength, hand reaction time, and postural sway. The five PPA components are weighted to compute a composite z-score distribution with high scores indicating increased fall risk.</description>
