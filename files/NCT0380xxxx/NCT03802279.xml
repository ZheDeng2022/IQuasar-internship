  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism is poor and&#xD;
      treatments are only symptomatic. Rhabdomyolysis outbreaks are frequently precipitated by&#xD;
      fever and fasting. They are unpredictable. In spite of the care of patient in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit, the occurrence of renal failure and heart rhythm disorders explains a significant&#xD;
      acute-phase mortality rate. There is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism, in order to&#xD;
      identify specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rhabdomyolyses have few clinical signs outside of access. So there is a&#xD;
      methodological difficulty in following a treatment test. There is an urgency to identify&#xD;
      follow-up parameters in anticipation of new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to validate the hypothesis that effort test and cardiac&#xD;
      function parameters are usable in the treatment monitoring for patients with acute&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis linked to a hereditary disease of metabolism and thus propose the effort test&#xD;
      as an assessment tool for future clinical trials. In order to do so, the correlation between&#xD;
      the results of the effort tests, performed to each patient with rhabdomyolysis related to a&#xD;
      hereditary disease of metabolism, with the severity of the disease will be evaluated. This&#xD;
      study is original because it opens up innovative prospects for monitoring in the field of&#xD;
      hereditary diseases of metabolism, with the identification of new monitoring tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rhabdomyolysis is a poorly known symptom associated with the destruction of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      cells. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolyses is carried when the dosage of muscle enzymes, in&#xD;
      particular creatine phosphate kinase (KPC), is greater than 1000 U/L (normal &lt; 160 U/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rhabdomyolyses may be of viral origin, but fever and viruses are also triggers of genetic&#xD;
      diseases. Also, the incidence of genetic rhabdomyolyses, representing 10 to 15% of all&#xD;
      rhabdomyolyses, is underestimated. Genetic causes are heterogeneous. They are mainly&#xD;
      attributed to hereditary diseases of metabolism, in particular fatty acid oxidation defects,&#xD;
      Lipin-1 deficiency, muscle glycogenoses, TANGO2 deficiency, mitochondrial cytopathies and&#xD;
      calcium channels anomalies of in particular RYR1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whatever the cause, traumatic, infectious or genetic, the rhabdomyolyses cause an alteration&#xD;
      of the metabolism of adenosine triphosphate and a deregulation of the ionic channels, with&#xD;
      the consequences of an intracytoplasmic calcium release and the destruction of muscle cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism is poor and&#xD;
      treatments are only symptomatic. Rhabdomyolysis outbreaks are frequently precipitated by&#xD;
      fever and fasting. They are unpredictable. In spite of the care of patient in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit, the occurrence of renal failure and heart rhythm disorders explains a significant&#xD;
      acute-phase mortality rate. There is an urgent need to understand the pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms of rhabdomyolyses related to hereditary diseases of metabolism, in order to&#xD;
      identify specific treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanism of rhabdomyolyses related to Lipin-1 deficiency has been&#xD;
      identified. Two patients with Lipin-1 deficiency treated in vivo by Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (Plaquenil ®, 6 mg/kg/day by one oral intake) rapidly standardized their serum inflammatory&#xD;
      profile and corrected their clinical phenotype: Plasma creatine phosphokinase levels, Amount&#xD;
      of mitochondrial DNA in plasma, number of myolyses, muscular pain, quality of life. One of&#xD;
      these two patients, suffering from cardiac dysfunction already reported in Lipin-1 deficiency&#xD;
      (left ventricular ejection fraction or LVEF 45%), significantly and durably improved cardiac&#xD;
      function after one month of treatment (LVEF 62%). In addition, his fatigability and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances have dramatically improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruption of mitophagy and immunity could be a common denominator for rhabdomyolyses linked&#xD;
      to hereditary diseases of metabolism, which could, despite their heterogeneity, benefit from&#xD;
      a common therapeutic approach, Now non-existent. There could be a role of inflammation in&#xD;
      rhabdomyolyses outbreaks of metabolic origin and new therapeutic approaches could be imagined&#xD;
      as in the Lipin-1 deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with rhabdomyolyses have few clinical signs outside of access. So there is a&#xD;
      methodological difficulty in following a treatment test. There is an urgency to identify&#xD;
      follow-up parameters in anticipation of new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Lipin deficiency, an anomaly of the effort tests with measurement of oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and cardiac output was characterized. These effort tests were carried out in the&#xD;
      context of care, in order to recognize for a given patient whether the practice of sport is a&#xD;
      factor triggering rhabdomyolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to validate the hypothesis that effort test and cardiac&#xD;
      function parameters are usable in the treatment monitoring for patients with acute&#xD;
      rhabdomyolysis linked to a hereditary disease of metabolism and thus propose the effort test&#xD;
      as an assessment tool for future clinical trials. To date, no tests are available for&#xD;
      clinical trials. In order to do so, the correlation between the results of the effort tests,&#xD;
      performed to each patient with rhabdomyolysis related to a hereditary disease of metabolism,&#xD;
      with the severity of the disease will be assessed, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Metabolic flux on myoblasts, 2) clinical severity (onset of disease, number of&#xD;
      rhabdomyolyses, cardiomyopathy), 3) genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is original because it opens up innovative prospects for monitoring in the field&#xD;
      of hereditary diseases of metabolism, with the identification of new monitoring tools.&#xD;

Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET): left ventricular stroke volume was assessed noninvasively using a thoracic bioelectrical impedance device : maximal stroke volume at the peak of effort will be considered.&#xD;
Peripheral muscle function:&#xD;
CPET: Oxygen uptake (VO2) (and carbon dioxide) output are measured. The slope of the relationship (dQ/dVO2) will be calculated between cardiac output (Q) and VO2 using measurements of Q (using measure of the stroke volume by thoracic bioelectrical impedance device) and VO2 at rest as well as during submaximal and maximal exercise&#xD;
Muscle oxygenation is measured using a near-infrared spectroscopy device.&#xD;
VO2 et Q will be measured : dQ/dVO2 is high in case of oxydation defect; If Q is low because of a concommittant cardiac impairement, the DAV = VO2/Q, and DO = (Q x DAV) / (200 - DAV) will be calculated.</description>
