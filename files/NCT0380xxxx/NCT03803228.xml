      During ovarian stimulation, all the follicles grow under the action of FSH, only the selected&#xD;
      follicles and with the faster growth are taken. However during this stimulation, other&#xD;
      smaller follicles are also recruited and sensitized, which may increase the selection of&#xD;
      follicles available on the follicular wave following. In patients with weak reserve this&#xD;
      potentiation has a great interest, and the sequence of 2 stimulations on the same cycle could&#xD;
      make it possible to obtain a larger number of oocytes and embryos, thus giving a better&#xD;
      chance of delivery than on 2 distinct cycles of stimulation. However, this is preliminary&#xD;
      data that needs to be confirmed with a randomized controlled trial. In this population of&#xD;
      poor prognosis, the use of FSH-associated LH activity may optimize the ovarian response to&#xD;
      stimulation, particularly the combination containing placental HCG (Fertistartkit®) that&#xD;
      obtaining a slightly higher number of oocytes than highly purified HMG (Menopur®).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation is an essential prerequisite for any in vitro fertilization attempt (IVF)&#xD;
      to optimize the chances of delivery per cycle. These depend in the first place on the age of&#xD;
      the patients and secondly on the number of oocytes collected. There is a strong correlation&#xD;
      between these two factors, the ovarian reserve diminishing with age. In older patients or&#xD;
      patients with decreased reserve, however, the number of oocytes collected remains a&#xD;
      prognostic factor for the chances of delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, there is no validated intervention that would bring a significant&#xD;
      interest on the number of oocytes obtained in the group of bad responder patients. However,&#xD;
      it is a very heterogeneous population whose definition has been proposed only recently, the&#xD;
      Bologna criteria and questioned by a new proposal from the Poseidon group. The latter is more&#xD;
      focused on the prognosis of success, differentiating patients with a diminished reserve&#xD;
      (count of antral follicles CFA &lt;5 and / or AMH &lt;1.2 ng / ml) from those with an &quot;unexpected&quot;&#xD;
      bad response. As the profiles are better defined, it is easier to determine the impact of a&#xD;
      strategy in a specific group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent clarifications on the ovarian cycle and folliculogenesis have shown that several waves&#xD;
      of follicular development coexist on the same cycle and that it is perfectly possible to&#xD;
      obtain a follicular development with a luteal phase equivalent oocyte quality, compared to&#xD;
      conventional stimulations performed in the follicular phase. The main constraint of luteal&#xD;
      phase stimulation is the lack of possibility of fresh transfer due to non-synchronization&#xD;
      with the endometrium. This constraint is today secondary given the evolution of conservation&#xD;
      techniques with the development of embryonic and oocyte vitrification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, there is a differential dependence of FSH follicles, their sensitivity&#xD;
      depending on the number of FSH receptors and their duration of exposure to FSH. During&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation, all the follicles grow under the action of FSH, only the selected&#xD;
      follicles and with the faster growth are taken. However during this stimulation, other&#xD;
      smaller follicles are also recruited and sensitized, which may increase the selection of&#xD;
      follicles available on the follicular wave following. In patients with weak reserve this&#xD;
      potentiation has a great interest, and the sequence of 2 stimulations on the same cycle could&#xD;
      make it possible to obtain a larger number of oocytes and embryos, thus giving a better&#xD;
      chance of delivery than on 2 distinct cycles of stimulation. However, this is preliminary&#xD;
      data that needs to be confirmed with a randomized controlled trial. In this population of&#xD;
      poor prognosis, the use of FSH-associated LH activity may optimize the ovarian response to&#xD;
      stimulation, particularly the combination containing placental HCG (Fertistartkit®) that&#xD;
      obtaining a slightly higher number of oocytes than highly purified HMG (Menopur®).&#xD;
