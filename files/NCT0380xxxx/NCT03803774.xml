    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of birinapant when given together&#xD;
      with intensity modulated re-irradiation therapy (IMRRT) in treating patients with head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma that has come back at or near the same place as the original&#xD;
      (primary) tumor (locally recurrent). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as birinapant, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. IMRRT uses thin beams of radiation of&#xD;
      different intensities that are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of&#xD;
      re-irradiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor. Giving birinapant&#xD;
      with IMRRT may lower the chance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma growing or&#xD;
      spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of birinapant concurrent with&#xD;
      intensity modulated re-irradiation therapy (IMRRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with locoregionally recurrent head and&#xD;
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with re-irradiation and birinapant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the local-regional control, progression free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine if FADD and/or BIRC2/3 copy gain in tumor tissue or in the blood are&#xD;
      associated with improved response, locoregional control (LCR), progression-free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the feasibility of detecting effects of birinapant and re-irradiation on pilot&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic markers in tumor tissue, by using microwestern to assess decrease in drug&#xD;
      targets IAP1/2 and increase in apoptosis/necroptosis markers caspase 3 and mixed lineage&#xD;
      kinase domain like pseudokinase gene (MLKL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Explore if mutational load detected with whole exome and ribonucleic acid (RNA)-sequencing&#xD;
      of tumor tissue influences objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore if PD-L1, CD8 T-cell tumor infiltration, TNFalpha, and other immune related&#xD;
      biomarkers in tumor tissue are associated with objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the pharmacokinetics of birinapant in combination with radiotherapy in blood&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore whether specific germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated&#xD;
      with response to birinapant and reirradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of birinapant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning on day 1, patients undergo IMRRT 5 days a week (Monday-Friday). Patients also&#xD;
      receive birinapant intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 2 and 9 of each cycle.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, and at 3, 6, 9, 12,&#xD;
      18, and 24 months until confirmation of disease progression.&#xD;

             birinapant. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligibility for curative-intent surgery, unless the patient is considered a poor&#xD;
             surgical candidate related to resectability, functional outcome, or prefers&#xD;
             non-surgical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  More than 2 lines of palliative systemic therapy (platinum-, taxane- or&#xD;
             cetuximab-based chemotherapy or immunotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to birinapant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because birinapant may have potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             birinapant, breastfeeding should be discontinued prior to enrollment. A negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing potential. Women who are&#xD;
             postmenopausal (age-related amenorrhea &gt;= 12 consecutive months, or who had undergone&#xD;
             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If&#xD;
             necessary, to confirm postmenopausal status, a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level may be included at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             birinapant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring the use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti TNF) therapies, such as&#xD;
             infliximab, or patients who have received treatment with anti-TNF therapies within 5&#xD;
             half-lives of the drug (48 days for infliximab, 55 days for golimumab, 70 days for&#xD;
             certolizumab and adalimumab, and 16 days for etanercept)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous exposure to birinapant&#xD;
