      The aim of the study is to investigate the additional effects of the use of NIV during&#xD;
      exercise within a 3-week PR program on exercise capacity in COPD patients with chronic&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure.&#xD;

      Scientific Background/ Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life and exercise tolerance are commonly reduced in people with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially in people with chronic hypercapnic&#xD;
      respiratory failure (CHRF). Endurance exercise training as part of a pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      (PR) programme is an important treatment for people with COPD and has been shown to improve&#xD;
      quality of life, exercise tolerance and physical activity. However, individuals with CHRF may&#xD;
      have difficulties performing endurance exercise at an adequate training intensity to achieve&#xD;
      the desired physiological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a method of providing breathing support using a ventilator&#xD;
      and is usually delivered via a full face mask. A recent study showed that during a single&#xD;
      exercise session in people with CHRF, NIV dramatically improves exercise tolerance and&#xD;
      reduces breathlessness. Consequently, NIV used over a complete exercise training program may&#xD;
      allow people with COPD and CHRF to exercise at a higher intensity to achieve greater&#xD;
      improvement in exercise tolerance, quality of life and physical activity. So far this has&#xD;
      only been tested in a small number of studies with small numbers of participants, and none&#xD;
      with CHRF. It is currently not known from literature whether the demonstrated benefits of NIV&#xD;
      during exercise training are clinically worthwhile or cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aim of the study is to investigate the additional effects of the use of NIV during&#xD;
      exercise within a 3-week PR program on exercise capacity in COPD patients with chronic&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis It is assumed that a 3-week exercise training program with additional NIV, using&#xD;
      titrated pressures, reduces the work of breathing. With this, it is theorized, COPD patients&#xD;
      with CHRF are able to train for a longer duration and/ or with higher training intensities&#xD;
      over the course of the training program and may achieve better PR outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.0: COPD-Patients with CHRF have the same increase in exercise capacity (endurance cycle&#xD;
      time) when training with additional NIV as without NIV, during a 3-week PR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H.1: COPD-Patients with CHRF have a superior increase in exercise capacity (endurance cycle&#xD;
      time) when training with additional NIV as without NIV, during a 3-week PR program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Objective To determine if NIV during exercise is a useful tool for increasing exercise&#xD;
      tolerance in hypercapnic patients, exercise tolerance (cycle endurance time) will be measured&#xD;
      without NIV at PR admission/ discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Method A total of 26 COPD patient (age: 40-80 years) in GOLD Stages IV&#xD;
      diagnosed with CHRF, already treated with nocturnal NIV and referred for a comprehensive PR&#xD;
      program will be recruited and randomized into two groups: 1) exercise with NIV during&#xD;
      exercise (nocturnal NIV will continue) and 2) control group - exercise without NIV during&#xD;
      exercise (nocturnal NIV will continue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, patients will perform a maximum cardiopulmonary test to determine the Peak Work&#xD;
      Rate (WRpeak). On a separate day, patients will perform a cycle endurance test (CET) at&#xD;
      75%WRpeak without NIV using oxygen as prescribed, if needed. TcPCO2, heart rate and SpO2 via&#xD;
      SenTec will be measured continuously during CET. In addition to the continuously recorded&#xD;
      data, dyspnoea/ respiratory effort/ leg-fatigue (10-point Borg scale), capillary blood gases&#xD;
      and the arterial blood pressure will be taken at the beginning/ end/ recovery/ isotime of the&#xD;
      CET.&#xD;
