      Musculoskeletal disorders(MSD) are one of the most common causes of occupational injuries and&#xD;
      disability in industrialized nations and developing countries .with substantial financial&#xD;
      consequences due to workers' compensation and medical expenses Otolaryngology (pronounced&#xD;
      oh/toe/lair/in/goll/oh/jee) is the oldest medical specialty in the United States.&#xD;
      Otolaryngologists are physicians trained in the medical and surgical management and treatment&#xD;
      of patients with diseases and disorders of the ear, nose, throat (ENT), and related&#xD;
      structures of the head and neck. They are commonly referred to as ENT physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSD were identified as a significant issue for the profession and Research has recognized&#xD;
      that MSD in Otolaryngology contribute considerably to sick leave, reduced productivity and&#xD;
      leaving the profession Because there are few studies available about MSD among Egyptian&#xD;
      otolaryngologists So, the purpose of this study is to investigate musculoskeletal disorders&#xD;
      among Egyptian otorhinlaryngologist and the relationship between the risk factors and the&#xD;
      development of musculoskeletal disorders among Egyptian otolaryngologists&#xD;
