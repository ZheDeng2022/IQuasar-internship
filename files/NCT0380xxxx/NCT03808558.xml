  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective one-arm, two-stage phase 2 trial of TVB-2640 in KRAS mutant NSCLC&#xD;
      patients. 13 patients will be treated with a minimum of 1 cycle of TVB-2640 therapy over 8&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stable disease or partial/complete remissions will continue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints are response rate-RR, disease control rate-DCR, PFS-progression-free survival,&#xD;
      CTCAEv5.0 toxicities, plasma lipid levels, collection of sebaceous secretion via Sebutape,&#xD;
      and 11C-acetate PET tumor imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, 13 patients will be enrolled. If fewer than 2 patients achieve response,&#xD;
      the study will be stopped. If 2 or more patients have a radiographic response, an additional&#xD;
      21 patients will be enrolled , for a total accrual of 34 patients.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Patient has known immunodeficiency virus-HIV or hepatitis B or C infection, as such&#xD;
             patients may be at increased risk for toxicity due to concomitant treatment and&#xD;
             disease-related symptoms may preclude accurate assessment of the safety of TVB-2640.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient has an important medical illness or abnormal laboratory finding that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would increase the risk of participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. History of clinically significant dry eye (xerophthalmia) or other corneal abnormality&#xD;
             or, if a contact lens wearer, does not agree to abstain from contact lens use from&#xD;
             baseline through the last study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patient has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to components of TVB-2640.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patient has a prior history of hypersensitivity, drug/radiation-induced, or other&#xD;
