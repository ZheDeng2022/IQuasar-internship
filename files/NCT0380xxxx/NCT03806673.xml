  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      epidural block is today the most common method of pain relief during labor. With increased&#xD;
      use of epidural analgesia, many women are found in the second or third pregnancy and require&#xD;
      repeated epidural analgesia. But there was a higher incidence of unilateral blockade among&#xD;
      women receiving their repeated epidural which causes patient unsatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: Examination of the performance and outcome of women receiving their first versus&#xD;
      repeated epidural block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: The study included 140 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)&#xD;
      Physical Status II patients (age range 20 to 40 years) and scheduled for normal vaginal&#xD;
      delivery. The patients were divided randomly into two equal groups. Group (A) in which 70&#xD;
      women primipara subjected to their first epidural block while group (B) in which 70 women&#xD;
      multipara subjected to their repeated epidural block. For each patient, the following data&#xD;
      were collected: demographic data, details of labor (gestation, cervical dilatation), visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS) before the epidural and 30 minutes after injection of local anesthetic&#xD;
      and incidence of unilateral block.&#xD;

      This study was performed after obtaining approval from the ethical committee of the Ain Shams&#xD;
      University. Sample of 140 healthy ASA II female patients, 20-40 years of age, scheduled for&#xD;
      normal vaginal delivery. Patients were randomly allocated by computer-generated random number&#xD;
      list into two study groups of 70 patients each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A) in which 70 primipara women subjected to their first epidural block while group (B)&#xD;
      in which 70 multipara women subjected to their repeated epidural block. The study was carried&#xD;
      out between January 2018 and March 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any physical reason for difficult epidural performance e.g.: morbid obesity, or&#xD;
           scoliosis,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe hypertension,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Congestive heart failure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coagulopathy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant hepatic or renal disease,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Or withdrawal of consent. All patients in this study were subjected to a detailed&#xD;
           pre-anesthetic evaluation. All basic investigations according to the hospital protocol&#xD;
           (e.g. serum hemoglobin, platelet count, coagulation profile) were checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's demographic data, details of labor (gestation, cervical dilatation), details of&#xD;
      epidural insertion were recorded by the anesthetist performing the epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was asked to mark a visual analogue scale (VAS) (figure 1) before the epidural&#xD;
      and 30 minutes after injection of local anesthetic. Also incidence of unilateral epidural&#xD;
      block is reported 30 minutes after injection of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure (1): Visual analog scale 2.2 Anesthetic technique On arrival to operation room; 18 g&#xD;
      cannula was inserted then 500 ml of Ringer solution was infused while performing the&#xD;
      epidural.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic monitors including automatic blood pressure measurements, five lead ECG monitor, and&#xD;
      finger pulse oximetry were applied to all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard procedure was followed for epidural insertion and establishment of block. With the&#xD;
      patient in the sitting position the midline approach was used using 16-g Tuohy needle and the&#xD;
      epidural space was identified by loss of resistance to air, as is our routine practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the epidural space was reached, Bupivacaine 0.25% plain, was given in three 5 ml&#xD;
      increments at five-minute intervals, the first administered through the needle while the&#xD;
      patient is in sitting position, and then through the catheter with the patient in supine&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-orifice catheters were inserted and fixed to a standard 4 cm extra to the distance&#xD;
      between the skin and epidural space. At the time of insertion of the catheter the patient was&#xD;
      asked to report any pain or tingling experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operator recorded the ease of insertion of the catheter (difficult or easy) and the&#xD;
      occurrence of blood in needle or catheter. Epidurals were performed by the same anesthetists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30 min after injection of bupivacaine, the second VAS was completed and the level of&#xD;
      blockade checked by cold sensation test. If an inadequate level was noted (less than T10),&#xD;
      the pain score remained high or increased, or the patient complained of poor pain relief she&#xD;
      was asked to describe the site and type of pain experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A unilateral block was defined as the description by the patient of worse pain on one side&#xD;
      than the other, or pain on one side only, combined with either a 30-min pain score minimally&#xD;
      changed or increased from time zero or a low level of blockade on the painful side, or both.&#xD;
      If unilateral or inadequate block occurred the catheter was withdrawn 0.5-1 cm and a further&#xD;
      5 ml bupivacaine 0.25% was administered with the patient lying on the unblocked side. If the&#xD;
      block was still inadequate, epidural fentanyl 50 microgram was given and if still inadequate&#xD;
      the catheter was removed and a second epidural catheter inserted in another interspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of repeat injections of bupivacaine and length of time between epidural insertion&#xD;
      and delivery were noted, as well details of previous epidurals in the multiparous women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To show a difference in the incidence of unilateral block between the two groups with p-value&#xD;
      &lt; 0.05 and power 80%, we needed at least 60 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data was done by IBM computer using SPSS (statistical program for social science,&#xD;
      version 16) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of quantitative variables as mean Â± SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of quantitative variables as number and percentage. Statistical analysis was&#xD;
           performed using statistical tests included Student's t-test, Chi square test and table&#xD;
           analysis. P value &lt;0.05 is considered significant.&#xD;
