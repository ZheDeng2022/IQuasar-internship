    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study conducted on 60 healthy primiparous mothers with insufficient&#xD;
      lactation. The participants were divided randomly into three equal groups, Group (A) control,&#xD;
      Group (B) received low power He-Ne laser beam on both breasts and Group (C) received faradic&#xD;
      current stimulation at Spleen 6, Liver 3 and Small Intestine 1 acupuncture points on both&#xD;
      sides, all participants received 10 mg domperidone 3 times a day and advice about lactation,&#xD;
      nutrition and fluid intake. Evaluation was done before and after the treatment program&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women in Group (A) acted as a control group and only received medical treatment in the form&#xD;
      of 10 mg domperidone 3 times a day after meals) and advice about lactation, nutrition and&#xD;
      fluid intake all through the treatment period (4 weeks) Each woman in group (B) lied in&#xD;
      supine lying position on the treatment plinth wearing the protective eyewear as precautionary&#xD;
      measures for her safety and exposing her breast out of her clothes then the breast was&#xD;
      cleaned by alcohol. The laser apparatus was directed perpendicularly over the treated breast&#xD;
      at a distance 50 cm from it, all metal objects must be removed from the range of action of&#xD;
      laser (i.e. necklaces). The laser scan beam was adjusted to the size of the treated breast&#xD;
      for 10 minutes with wave length 632.8 nm and power output 25 mw after the end of treatment&#xD;
      session the machine switched off automatically then, it was adjusted again to start&#xD;
      irradiation by the same procedures for the other breast. The mother had one session every&#xD;
      other day, three sessions weekly for four weeks. (Total 12 sessions). He-Ne laser (Bravo&#xD;
      TrezaSerie) device was used. The equipment was designed in compliance with international&#xD;
      technical standards UNI EN ISO 9002 and En 46002 and complies with the safety requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (B) had received 12 sessions of irradiation by low power He-Ne laser beam on both sides&#xD;
      of the breasts 10 minutes on each side. One session every other day, three sessions weekly&#xD;
      for four weeks beside the medical treatment (10 mg domperidone 3 times a day after meals) and&#xD;
      advice about lactation, nutrition and fluid intake all through the treatment period Group (C)&#xD;
      women were treated by faradic stimulation (Body shaping System, model B-333, made in China) ,&#xD;
      at the following acupuncture points on both sides: Spleen 6 (Sanyinjiao), Liver 3 (Taichong)&#xD;
      and Small Intestine 1 (Shaoze) using surface electrodes in addition to medical treatment (10&#xD;
      mg domperidone 3 times a day after meals) and advice about lactation, nutrition and fluid&#xD;
      intake allthrough the treatment period&#xD;
&#xD;
      SP-6 Acupuncture Point lies on the inner leg aspect about 3 cm higher than the medial&#xD;
      malleolus, along the posterior tibial border. Fig. (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIV-3 Acupuncture Point is the one that lies in the depressed area between the 1st 2&#xD;
      metatarsal bones proximal to the metatarsophalangeal joints on the dorsal foot aspect Fig.&#xD;
      (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SI.1 Acupuncture point is located on the little finger, ulnar to the distal phalanx, at the&#xD;
      intersection of the vertical line of ulnar border of the nail and the horizontal line of the&#xD;
      base of the little fingernail. Fig. (2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each woman in group (C) was asked to be in a long sitting or half lying position, When the&#xD;
      points were located, the electrodes were fastened securely with an adhesive tape or an&#xD;
      elastic band to ensure good contact between the skin and the electrode over the acupuncture&#xD;
      points. The intensity control of the stimulator was slowly increased until the patient could&#xD;
      just feel the stimulation. The session lasted for 30 minutes. One session every other day, 3&#xD;
      sessions weekly for 4 weeks. (Total 12 sessions).&#xD;
