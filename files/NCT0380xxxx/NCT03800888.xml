  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With an estimated 60,000 people diagnosed with TB (Tuberculosis) annually, Uganda holds the&#xD;
      16th position of the 22 countries with highest cases of TB in the world. The Uganda national&#xD;
      target of utilizing the DOTS (Direct Observed Treatment Short Course) to successfully treat&#xD;
      85% of patients diagnosed with TB has not been met. Currently, the country only detects 49.6%&#xD;
      TB case detection, of which it successfully treats 73%. The DOTS strategy has suffered many&#xD;
      socioeconomic challenges, which have resulted into its abandonment by many of the Ugandan&#xD;
      hospitals. Poor TB medication adherence greatly attribute to the many cases of TB in Uganda.&#xD;
      Causes of non-adherence to TB medication include lack of patient follow-up, patients' lack of&#xD;
      transport to go to the clinics to pick up drugs, patients' forgetfulness. There is evidence&#xD;
      that real time adherence monitoring linked with SMS reminders and social support&#xD;
      notifications can address barriers to sustained ART (antiretroviral therapy) adherence. Such&#xD;
      novel interventions addressing TB medication adherence challenges in low resource settings to&#xD;
      date are limited. The prevailing SMS-based studies for TB medication adherence report mixed&#xD;
      results, do not strategically link interventions with missed doses, and have largely been&#xD;
      implemented in developed countries. To date, little is known about the use of real-time&#xD;
      adherence monitoring technologies for TB medication adherence in resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research is to investigate the use of real time adherence monitoring&#xD;
      technology linked with SMS reminders and notifications for TB medication adherence in rural&#xD;
      southwestern Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will develop and quantitatively test a real-time adherence monitoring&#xD;
      intervention with 60 individuals initiating TB treatment, and 40 social supporters. The&#xD;
      investigator will randomize participants (1:1:1) to the following arms: 1) Fixed and linked&#xD;
      SMS reminders, 2) SMS notifications to social supporters, and 3) no SMS (control). All&#xD;
      participants will have adherence monitored in real-time for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has three major aims (Aims 1, 2 and 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Carry out a formative qualitative study to assess barriers and facilitators to TB&#xD;
      medication adherence, and identify optimal SMS reminders, notifications, and initial&#xD;
      feasibility of real time adherence monitoring. 35 TB patients will be recruited from the TB&#xD;
      clinic in Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), and up to 15 social supporters specified&#xD;
      by the TB patients (one per TB patient). Drawing from technology adoption and behavioral&#xD;
      change models, the investigator will use semi-structured interviews to assess the initial&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, as well the barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      TB medication adherence, and how they can be addressed using the proposed intervention. The&#xD;
      purpose will be to inform the development the technology necessary to conduct a real-time&#xD;
      intervention involving a wireless monitor and SMS reminders and notifications (Aim 2 and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Develop a TB medication adherence intervention based on SMS reminders (fixed and/or&#xD;
      linked to real-time detection of missed doses) and assess its acceptability, feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary impact on adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will use real-time electronic adherence monitoring (i.e., Wisepill) to&#xD;
      follow 60 TB-infected individuals initiating TB treatment in Mbarara Regional Referral&#xD;
      Hospital (MRRH) for six months. Using a 1:1:1 manner, participants will be randomized to one&#xD;
      of the following three study arms (details of each intervention will be informed by the data&#xD;
      collected in Aim 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention Arm A: SMS reminders on a fixed schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Arm B: SMS reminders linked to missed doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control: No SMS reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative interviews to understand the patients experiences with Wisepill adherence&#xD;
      monitoring and the SMS reminders will be carried out, depending on the study arm to which&#xD;
      they are assigned. The first set of interviews for Arms A and B will be conducted at the end&#xD;
      of Month 3 of the study. The second set of interviews is planned to be conducted within two&#xD;
      weeks after the first 24+ hour lapse in Wisepill signal for the participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arms (A and B). If there is no 24+ hour lapse, the interview will take place at&#xD;
      the end of the study. The control participants in Arm C's interview will occur at a&#xD;
      convenient time during Months 3-6. The effect sizes will be estimated by comparing adherence&#xD;
      at the end of six months between each intervention group and the control group. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be percent adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment outcomes will be defined according to WHO definitions, where cure and completed&#xD;
      treatment are defined as successful treatment outcomes (WHO 2014). Unsuccessful treatment&#xD;
      outcomes for active TB treatment will include death ascertained from hospital death registry,&#xD;
      treatment failure (sputum smear positive at 6 months) and loss to follow-up. Treatment&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared for both intervention and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Develop a social support intervention linked to real-time adherence monitoring and&#xD;
      assess its acceptability, feasibility and preliminary impact on adherence. Members of&#xD;
      pre-existing social support networks for the same 40 TB-infected individuals in the two&#xD;
      intervention arms described in Aim 2 above will be recruited to receive real-time SMS&#xD;
      notification of sustained non-adherence (i.e., gaps of &gt;24 hours) over the latter four months&#xD;
      of follow-up. The investigators will continue to follow the 20 TB-infected individuals in the&#xD;
      control group (i.e., electronic monitoring alone) to estimate the effect size of the&#xD;
      intervention on adherence at the end of the six-month period. Qualitative interviews to&#xD;
      understand the experiences of participants in each study arm and the social supporters with&#xD;
      special emphasis on understanding mechanisms of effects of the SMS reminders, forms and&#xD;
      dynamics of support, experiences with the SMS reminders/notifications, and technical problems&#xD;
      encountered will be conducted. The results of Aim 3 will be used to determine the types of&#xD;
      SMS (fixed versus linked SMS), and the nature of social support that shows the most promise&#xD;
      for real time intervention on anti-TB medication adherence and cure.&#xD;
