  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect quantitative data related to developing and testing a&#xD;
      couple-based intervention (CBI) for HIV-positive women's medication adherence in the region&#xD;
      of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The CBI, called START (Supporting Treatment for&#xD;
      Anti-Retroviral Therapy) Together, will be a manualized intervention focused on women's ART&#xD;
      adherence and enhancing the couple's communication and problem-solving behavior. The study&#xD;
      focuses on implementation outcomes (feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity) and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy outcomes (women's ART adherence, men's engagement in HIV care, and the couple's&#xD;
      relationship functioning), which will be compared to a control condition of referrals to&#xD;
      usual HIV care.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      South Africa (SA) has one of the highest global HIV burdens with clear gender disparities.&#xD;
      For men, 57% of HIV-related deaths occur among persons who have never sought HIV care. Women,&#xD;
      in comparison, have high rates of HIV testing and are linked to care through antenatal&#xD;
      services, but only 45% are virally suppressed on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, tailored&#xD;
      interventions for HIV are needed. In order to end the AIDS epidemic, the ambitious &quot;90-90-90&quot;&#xD;
      goal was developed by UNAIDS to test, treat, and maintain medication adherence for 73% of&#xD;
      HIV-positive individuals. Separate gender-specific interventions have been developed along&#xD;
      the HIV care cascade to treat the different needs of men and women. However, no study to date&#xD;
      has used one intervention to concurrently meet the unique HIV-related needs for women and&#xD;
      men. Couple-based interventions (CBIs) can achieve this goal. CBIs are more efficacious than&#xD;
      interventions delivered to individuals in enhancing a number of HIV protective behaviors. HIV&#xD;
      is also primarily transmitted in the context of stable heterosexual relationships in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa; about 50% of new infections occur in serodiscordant relationships, making&#xD;
      the use of a CBI especially relevant. The purpose of this study is to strengthen the HIV care&#xD;
      cascade in SA by developing a CBI that concurrently addresses the needs of women and men to&#xD;
      meet the UNAIDS' HIV goals. This study will be conducted in the province of KwaZulu-Natal,&#xD;
      SA. HIV-positive women who are in a heterosexual relationship and non-adherent to ART will be&#xD;
      recruited to participate in the study with their male partners. Twenty couples will be&#xD;
      recruited and randomized to either receive the START Together program or to the control&#xD;
      condition and followed for 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
