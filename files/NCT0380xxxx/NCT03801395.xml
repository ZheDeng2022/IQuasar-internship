    <textblock>
      This is a new gene discovery program for individuals with PCD who do not have a specific&#xD;
      genetic etiology identified. Research procedures involve a single blood draw from the&#xD;
      affected individual and from unaffected family members in an effort to identify new genetic&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to better define how the genes that cause primary ciliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia (PCD) are related to the clinical symptoms of individuals with PCD. PCD is a rare&#xD;
      disease that affects the function of motor cilia throughout the body. This results in a&#xD;
      variety of clinical symptoms, but chief among them are a chronic wet cough, recurrent&#xD;
      sinusitis, and frequent pneumonia. These clinical symptoms can result in further structural&#xD;
      lung disease, including bronchiectasis, with eventual worsening of lung function. The&#xD;
      treatment for this condition largely focuses on augmenting airway clearance and appropriate&#xD;
      use of antimicrobial therapies, in conjunction with monitoring for evidence of pulmonary&#xD;
      impairment. Thus, it is important to identify and diagnose individuals with PCD early in&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Making a diagnosis of PCD can be difficult as their is some overlap of the clinical symptoms&#xD;
      with other conditions and there are limitation in the current diagnostic testing modalities.&#xD;
      Historically, the diagnosis has been made by identification of structural abnormalities in&#xD;
      cilia by electron microscopy (ciliary biopsy). However, this testing has limitations&#xD;
      secondary to the somewhat invasive nature of the procedures and often inconclusive results&#xD;
      secondary to sampling challenges (getting enough cilia). Furthermore, a normal ciliary biopsy&#xD;
      result does not rule-out PCD as it is now known that there are individuals with PCD who have&#xD;
      ciliary dysfunction secondary to ciliary abnormalities that are not routinely identified on&#xD;
      standard electron micrograph. Genetic testing for PCD is available, but current testing only&#xD;
      accounts for about 60-65% of the PCD population. Thus normal results in this regard do not&#xD;
      rule-out PCD either. Nasal nitric oxide (nNO) testing is an emerging research-based testing&#xD;
      that is being used more frequently to identify individuals with PCD. More specifically, it&#xD;
      has been frequently observed that individuals with PCD have low levels of nitric oxide in&#xD;
      their sinus cavities. Measuring a low level of nitric oxide of multiple different occasions&#xD;
      has proven to have diagnostic utility in an individual with a clinical symptom history&#xD;
      consistent with PCD. While nNO testing is helpful for identifying individuals likely to have&#xD;
      PCD, this testing does not give further information as to reason for ciliary dysfunction.&#xD;
      Current testing availability has resulted in a group of individuals who are being managed as&#xD;
      &quot;probable PCD&quot; which is defined by having clinical symptoms consistent with PCD (such as&#xD;
      year-round wet cough and rhinitis) at least two separate positive (low value) nNO testing&#xD;
      results, but negative PCD genetics and a non diagnostic ciliary biopsy. While these&#xD;
      individuals are often managed the same as other individuals with more defined PCD, including&#xD;
      augmentation of airway clearance therapies, in order for more specific care to be applied in&#xD;
      the future it is important to better define the ciliary structural reason for their clinical&#xD;
      symptoms. This could also be described as needing to better understand the genotype-phenotype&#xD;
      of all individuals with PCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation seeks to better define the genotypic-phenotypic relationship of&#xD;
      individuals by initially focusing on new gene discovery in individuals with probable PCD.&#xD;
      More specifically, through whole-exome evaluation of individuals with probable PCD and&#xD;
      unaffected first-degree relatives, we will focus on identifying new mutations in ciliary&#xD;
      structural proteins and other related pulmonary genes. New gene targets will then be further&#xD;
      studied through analysis of ciliary structure and function.&#xD;
