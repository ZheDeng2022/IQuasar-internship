      This is a pilot study of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a brief,&#xD;
      one-session intervention for a diverse sample of 44 young adults who report alcohol binge&#xD;
      drinking or marijuana use in the past month. The proposed study will utilize a two-group&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Participants will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      interventions conditions: 1) Narrative-based Therapeutic Assessment (NbTa) or 2) Health&#xD;
      Education (HE) control condition. Participants will be assessed on their 7- and 30-day&#xD;
      alcohol and marijuana use at baseline and at 6 month follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a preliminary examination of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness&#xD;
      of a brief, one-session intervention for a diverse sample of young adults who report alcohol&#xD;
      binge drinking or marijuana use in the past month. The proposed study will utilize a&#xD;
      two-group pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two interventions conditions in a 1:1 distribution using a standard urn randomization&#xD;
      technique stratified by gender and substances used in the past month only, alcohol AND&#xD;
      marijuana). Participants will be randomized to either: 1) Narrative- based Therapeutic&#xD;
      Assessment (NbTa) or 2) Health Education (HE) control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Recruiment Potential participants will be recruited using an IRB approved flyer posted&#xD;
      at locations in the greater Houston area that are likely to be frequented by our target young&#xD;
      adult population (e.g. college campuses, gyms, coffee shops, grocery stores, etc). Potential&#xD;
      participants will also be recruited through online advertising, as well as through email and&#xD;
      social media advertisements. Individuals that are interested in participating in the study&#xD;
      will call the study phone number. Participants will also have the opportunity to contact the&#xD;
      study via a secure email address.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival at the study site, the RA will greet the participant and begin the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Process. The RA will provide the participant with a verbal and written overview of&#xD;
      the study including aims, risks, compensations, and all study procedures. The RA will provide&#xD;
      each potential participant with the opportunity to ask questions about the study. The RA will&#xD;
      emphasize the voluntary nature of the study and tell participants that they may withdraw at&#xD;
      any time during the study. Potential participants will be given as much time as needed to&#xD;
      review the written (Informed Consent Document [ICD]) and will be given a copy for their&#xD;
      records. The ICD will include the contact information of the PI as well as the UH IRB.&#xD;
      Participants that agree to participate will sign the ICD and the RA will document the entire&#xD;
      process. After Informed Consent has been obtained, the participant will be rescreened in&#xD;
      order to verify that participants continue to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility has been re-established the RA will provide participants with a computer&#xD;
      tablet that participants will be instructed to use to complete the study questionnaires. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be administered using Qualtrics and the data will be stored on a secure&#xD;
      server with firewall and password protection maintained by the College of Education's Center&#xD;
      for Information Technology in Education. While the participant completes the questionnaires&#xD;
      on the tablet the RA will be available for questions or concerns. Participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to complete the questionnaire to the best of their ability. Participants will also&#xD;
      be told that if they do not feel comfortable with any questions, they may skip them.&#xD;
      Participants will be offered bottled water and will be able to take bathroom breaks as needed&#xD;
      during the assessment. A full list of measures is provided in Appendix 2 with the timepoint&#xD;
      to be given. The Investigative team has conducted two pilot mock completions of the&#xD;
      assessment battery and it takes approximately 1 to 1.5 hours to complete the baseline&#xD;
      assessment and 30-45 minutes to complete the follow-up assessment. After completing the&#xD;
      questionnaires, participants will complete two biological tests to confirm their&#xD;
      self-reported substance use. First, participants will be asked to provide a urine sample. The&#xD;
      RA will provide the participant with a collection cup and instructions for the participant to&#xD;
      collect the sample. Participants will not be directly observed while providing the urine&#xD;
      sample. The RA will wait outside of the bathroom with an nondescript collection bin. The&#xD;
      urine sample cup is equipped with built-in tests for the thirteen most common substances used&#xD;
      including alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs. The test cup will indicate a positive or&#xD;
      negative result for each substance tested and the RA will document the result and discard the&#xD;
      collection cup. The sealed cup containing the urine sample can be discarded in the restroom&#xD;
      and is not considered a biohazard. It will not contain any identifying information on it and&#xD;
      the test strips become unreadable within 20 minutes. Once the urine sample results are&#xD;
      documented, the RA will collect a sample of expired carbon monoxide using a Bedfont Micro+&#xD;
      SmokerlyzerÂ®. This test measures the level of carbon monoxide, which is an indicator of&#xD;
      combustible smoking including marijuana and tobacco use. The collection of this sample will&#xD;
      involve participants taking a deep breath, holding it for 15 seconds, and exhaling into a&#xD;
      handheld electronic device. The report will range from 0-500ppm, and the sensor is accurate&#xD;
      by 1ppm. The RA will document the results on a CO test results form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the two biological tests have been completed, the RA will schedule the participant's&#xD;
      6-month follow-up visit. The RA will remind participants about the expected duration of the 6&#xD;
      month Follow-Up Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The RA will then escort the participant to the interventionist's office and will&#xD;
      introduce the participant and the interventionist to one another. Once the RA has left, the&#xD;
      interventionist will open the presequenced randomization envelope and document the&#xD;
      participant's study group. The interventionist will inform the participant of the group they&#xD;
      have been randomized to. Participants randomized to the NbTa intervention condition will&#xD;
      receive a 45-minute Narrative-Based Therapeutic Assessment intervention session. Those&#xD;
      randomized to the Health Education control condition will receive a time-matched intervention&#xD;
      session that will involve the viewing of health-related educational videos with a brief&#xD;
      discussion. The investigative team has used the Health Education Intervention as a control&#xD;
      group intervention in a previous trial of substance users (de Dios, Cano, Vaughan, Childress,&#xD;
      McNeel, &amp; Niaura, Under Review). All NbTa sessions will be audio/video recorded and this data&#xD;
      will be stored on a secure password protected institutional server. The Health Education&#xD;
      sessions will not be audio/video recorded. Participants may choose not to be audio/video&#xD;
      recorded for any reason. The recordings are not a condition of participation. For the&#xD;
      delivery of both interventions, manuals will be used to ensure standardization of&#xD;
      intervention delivery as well as provide a basis for evaluating interventionist adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completing the intervention session, participants will complete the SSSE to rate their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the content of the session.&#xD;

    <description>The NbTa interventiom will guide participants through an exploration of their human experience through stories and narratives. The interventionist will facilitate a collaborative process by which participants will explore the unique themes and meanings of their personal narrative (Parry &amp; Doan, 1994) with respect to alcohol and drug use. In addition, participants will also be guided towards considering the re-authorship of personal narratives. The techniques utilized in NbTa aim to dislodge problem saturated narratives and derive more complete personal narratives and meanings (White &amp; Epston, 1990).</description>
