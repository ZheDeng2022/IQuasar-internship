  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disorder associated with a&#xD;
      decreased ability of the skin to function as an efficient immunological barrier. The disease&#xD;
      is now two to three times more prevalent in children than it was just four decades ago. It is&#xD;
      manifested by eczematous skin lesions associated with severe itch, leading to a significant&#xD;
      impairment in quality of life. Of additional importance, AD oftentimes progresses to allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis and/or asthma, a process referred to as the &quot;atopic march.&quot; Recent reports have&#xD;
      indicated that daily application of moisturizing creams on neonates and infants can prevent&#xD;
      the occurrence of AD and subsequently food allergies. This is postulated to be the outcome of&#xD;
      restoring the barrier integrity of the skin through the daily application of moisturizer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Mothers must be aged &gt;18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Parents' ability to complete questionnaire(s) at defined times throughout study&#xD;

             14 days&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Neonate has an existing widespread skin condition that would make the detection and/or&#xD;
             assessment of eczema difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Neonate has been administered oral or parenteral antibiotics from birth until study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Neonate has a serious health issue which, at parent or investigator discretion, would&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Any conditions which precludes the daily application of moisturizing lotion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from&#xD;
