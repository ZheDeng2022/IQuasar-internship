  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC are treated with platinum-doublet&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens, except those harboring specific oncogenic drivers such as epidermal&#xD;
      growth-factor-receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements.&#xD;
      In the second-line setting, response rates remain low and median survival rarely exceeds 10&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few years, several checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death&#xD;
      protein-1 (PD1) or its ligand (PDL1) used as second-line therapies generated evidence of&#xD;
      improving survival and, more recently, as first-line NSCLC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) was recently approved as first-line treatment for patients&#xD;
      with at least 50% of their NSCLC cells expressing PDL1, many patients are still not&#xD;
      benefiting from this first-line agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with relapsed NSCLC, atezolizumab (anti-PDL1) prolonged survival compared to&#xD;
      docetaxel in the phase II POPLAR and phase III OAK trials. Novel concepts of synergic action&#xD;
      between immunotherapy and chemotherapy have emerged recently. However, those types of&#xD;
      treatments are given for different durations: chemotherapy is allowed for only a short period&#xD;
      (rarely exceeding 6 cycles), while anti-PDL1 can be continued for several months until loss&#xD;
      of its clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy is defined as low-dose and frequent chemotherapy administration,&#xD;
      without prolonged drug-free breaks. Metronomic administration of oral vinorelbine has been&#xD;
      tested against breast cancer and advanced refractory NSCLC. The combination could have&#xD;
      immunostimulatory effects: induction of immunogenic cancer-cell death, enhancement of antigen&#xD;
      presentation through dendritic cell modulation, increased cancer-cell immunogenicity,&#xD;
      preferential depletion of regulatory T cells, modulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells,&#xD;
      enhancement of the cytotoxic activity of immune-effector cells.&#xD;

    <description>The scale EuroQol 5 dimensions (EDQ5) is used to evaluate the quality of life. The EQ-5D scale is a standardised measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal, whih is divided by the EQ-5D descriptive system (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). Each dimension has 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems).</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire with 30 questions developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. An essential aspect of the &quot;modular&quot; approach to QOL assessment adopted by the EORTC Quality of Life Group is the development of modules specific to tumour site, treatment modality, or a QOL dimension, to be administered in addition to the core questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30).</description>

Vinorelbine capsules are taken orally on days 1, 3 and 5 of each week of the 21-day cycle. Vinorelbine will be administered at the dose of 40 mg per day on days 1, 3 and 5 of each week of the 21-day cycle. In case of toxicity, the dose will be decreased to 30 mg.</description>
