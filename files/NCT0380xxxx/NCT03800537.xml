  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become one of most important medical imaging tools over&#xD;
      the past 30 years because it is non-invasive, requires no ionizing radiation, and provides&#xD;
      exquisite images of soft tissues and anatomic structures with many tissue/disease specific&#xD;
      contrasts. While MRI has served the community well for many years, it is increasingly clear&#xD;
      that it also has significant limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the principle limitations is the lack of quantitative information for tissue/structure&#xD;
      characterization. The current paradigm of MRI is to use a set of scanner settings to generate&#xD;
      an image &quot;weighted&quot; by a specific MR contrast mechanism (physical parameter), where it is&#xD;
      hoped that variations in the parameter will be accentuated. However, without quantitative&#xD;
      knowledge of the parameters, the final image contrast may depend on many factors, which&#xD;
      complicates image interpretation and diagnostic performance. Quantitative measurement can&#xD;
      provide a great deal of information about tissue properties and pathological conditions,&#xD;
      since these parameters ultimately determine the contrast that is observed in conventional&#xD;
      images.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate novel quantitative MRI techniques in clinical&#xD;
      studies to determine whether they can provide better, faster and more useful information for&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis. Quantitative MRI has been a continuous interest in the MRI community, but&#xD;
      extremely challenging due to long acquisition times and sensitivity to motion. Recently, the&#xD;
      investigators have introduced a novel MRI data acquisition approach, namely MR Fingerprinting&#xD;
      (MRF), for simultaneous measurement of several important parameters in a single MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators propose to apply MR Fingerprinting at UNC and evaluate its&#xD;
      performance for different neurological diseases. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      quantitative MR imaging technique will lead to improved tissue characterization and&#xD;
      diagnosis.&#xD;
