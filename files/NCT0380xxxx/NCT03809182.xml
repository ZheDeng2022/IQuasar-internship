      This study investigated the effect of dexmedetomidine in obese patients undergoing bariatric&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was performed. Consenting obese&#xD;
      adult patients with impaired glucose tolerance, undergoing bariatric surgery, were&#xD;
      randomized, by a computer, to receive placebo (0.9% Sodium-chloride) or dexmedetomidine 1&#xD;
      ug/kg bolus in 10 minutes followed by an infusion of 0.5 ug/kg/h until the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Baseline HgbA1c, glucose, and insulin plasmatic levels were measured. Subsequently, glucose&#xD;
      and insulin levels were taken every 2 hours during the first 12 hours from the onset of the&#xD;
      drug infusion. Intraoperative fentanyl and postoperative morphine consumption, pain score,&#xD;
      the occurrence of emesis, and postoperative sedation levels were recorded as secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

          <description>This corresponds to the Apfel simplified risk score, which is based on 4 predictors: female sex, history of PONV and/or motion sickness, nonsmoking status, and use of postoperative opioids. The higher the number of risk factors the more probable the incidence of PONV.</description>
