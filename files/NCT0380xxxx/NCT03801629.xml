  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical research indicates acute opioid administration evokes an immune response in the&#xD;
      periphery and brain. Here, we will translate those preclinical findings to healthy human&#xD;
      volunteers and quantify the neuroimmune response to a morphine challenge using positron&#xD;
      emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]PBR28.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from the local community via media advertisements, flyers, and&#xD;
      word-of-mouth. Interested individuals will undergo a phone screen and in-person medical and&#xD;
      psychiatric examination. Up to 20 eligible individuals (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria)&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a single day, subjects will complete behavioral and physiological testing, a [11C]PBR28&#xD;
      PET scan, and report subjective drug effects before and after a morphine challenge. Subjects&#xD;
      will complete either a 'High' or 'Low' morphine dose condition (single-blind): 0.07mg/kg i.m.&#xD;
      vs. 0.04mg/kg i.m., respectively. To measure the neuroimmune response to morphine, we will&#xD;
      use [11C]PBR28 PET imaging (120-minute scans on a High Resolution Research Tomograph with&#xD;
      Vicra motion correction). [11C]PBR28 binds with high affinity and specificity to the 18kDa&#xD;
      translocator protein (TSPO), which is highly expressed in microglia and has been shown to&#xD;
      respond to inflammatory challenges. TSPO volumes of distribution (VT), i.e., TSPO&#xD;
      availability, will be quantified in brain regions of interest using multilinear analysis-1&#xD;
      (MA-1) with the metabolite-corrected arterial input function. The post-morphine [11C]PBR28&#xD;
      PET scan will occur 2-hours after the morphine challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine whether an acute morphine administration increases brain TSPO&#xD;
      availability in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will significantly increase TSPO&#xD;
      availability across brain regions of interest, consistent with a neuroimmune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine whether morphine evokes a dose-dependent increase in brain TSPO&#xD;
      availability in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently increase TSPO&#xD;
      availability across brain regions of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: To determine whether morphine administration increases peripheral markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, e.g., cytokine/chemokine concentration in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will increase cytokine/chemokine&#xD;
      concentrations in plasma, including IL-1B, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IFNy, MCP-1, and GM-CSF,&#xD;
      consistent with a peripheral immune response. Exploratory Hypotheses: 1) IL-1B, IL-6, TNF-a,&#xD;
      IFNy, MCP-1, and GM-CSF will exhibit morphine dose-dependent increases in plasma. 2) The&#xD;
      change in IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-y, and GM-CSF levels will be positively correlated with the change&#xD;
      in brain TSPO VT levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4: To determine whether morphine administration alters pain sensitivity, pain&#xD;
      tolerance, cognitive function, and reward responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will enhance pain tolerance and&#xD;
      impair verbal learning/memory proficiency and impair reward responsiveness. Morphine will not&#xD;
      alter pain sensitivity, visual attention, psychomotor processing speed, or working memory&#xD;
      proficiency. Exploratory hypotheses: 1) The change in TSPO availability in thalamus will be&#xD;
      positively correlated with the change in pain tolerance. 2) The change in TSPO availability&#xD;
      in hippocampus will be inversely correlated with the change in verbal learning/memory&#xD;
      proficiency. 3) The change in TSPO availability in caudate, ACC, and OFC will be inversely&#xD;
      correlated with the change in reward responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 5: To determine whether morphine administration alters vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently reduce systolic&#xD;
      and diastolic blood pressure. Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will lower heart&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 6: To measure the subjective response to morphine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 6: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently increase&#xD;
      subjective ratings of 'high', 'good drug effect', 'nausea', and 'bad drug effect'.&#xD;
      Exploratory hypotheses: 1) The change in TSPO availability in caudate, ACC, and OFC will be&#xD;
      positively correlated with the change in 'high' and 'good drug effect'. 2) The change in TSPO&#xD;
      availability in the insula and thalamus will be positively correlated with the change in&#xD;
      'nausea' and 'bad drug effect'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 7: To determine whether morphine administration alters peripheral stress markers&#xD;
      of the autonomic nervous system and HPA-axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 7: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently increase plasma&#xD;
      levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 8: To determine whether morphine administration alters peripheral markers of&#xD;
      neurosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 8: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently increase plasma&#xD;
      levels of allopregnanolone and pregnenolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 9: To determine whether morphine administration alters peripheral markers of the&#xD;
      metabolic hormone ghrelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 9: Relative to pre-morphine levels, morphine will dose-dependently increase plasma&#xD;
      levels of ghrelin.&#xD;
