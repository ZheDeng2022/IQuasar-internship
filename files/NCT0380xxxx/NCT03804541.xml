  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose phase I study to investigate the absorption,&#xD;
      metabolism and excretion of [14C] Ensartinib in healthy Chinese male subjects. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted into two steps：Firstly, 2 subjects are enrolled in to participate in the pilot&#xD;
      study to grope for the completion date of plasma, urine and feces sampling on the 3rd day&#xD;
      post-dose and onwards. Then, the collection time of blood and excreta samples (urine and&#xD;
      feces) from the subsequent 4-6 subjects will be adjusted according to the pilot study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who had signed informed consent and meet inclusion criteria and no exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are admitted to Phase I Clinical Unit two days prior to dosing (D-2). On the morning&#xD;
      of Day 1 before dosing, subjects will be transferred to nuclear medical ward. And after an&#xD;
      overnight fast of at least 10 h, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 200 mg (100 μCi)&#xD;
      of [14C]Ensartinib as an oral suspension. Then, after two days of the dosing, subjects will&#xD;
      be transferred back to Phase I Clinical Unit ward and confined to this unit until blood or&#xD;
      excreta sampling and safety monitoring at the designated time points or intervals are&#xD;
      complete&#xD;

    <description>A novel, potent ALK inhibitor.The ALK inhibitor ensartinib has been validated in potency and selectivity assays indicating that it is more selective and up to 10 times more potent than competitive ALK inhibitors. Ensartinib has been active in animal models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer. Importantly, ensartinib has shown activity in models with ALK mutations that confer resistance to other small molecule ALK inhibitors.</description>
