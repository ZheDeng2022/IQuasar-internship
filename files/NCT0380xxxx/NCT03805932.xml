    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, slow-growing blood cancer in which the bone marrow makes&#xD;
      too many of certain white blood cells. The antibody Rituximab binds to a protein in cancerous&#xD;
      white blood cells and is often used to treat HCL. Researchers want to see if combining it&#xD;
      with the drug Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk (also called Lumoxiti) can fight HCL better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of Moxetumomab pasudotox taken with Rituximab for people with HCL or HCL&#xD;
      variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 18 years and older with HCL or HCL variant that has not responded to standard&#xD;
      therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, heart, and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test of blood oxygen levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of bone marrow. This can be from previous test results or a new sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs in up to 8 cycles. A cycle will last about 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both drugs will be given through a plastic tube in a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first week of cycle 1, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 visit to get Rituximab for 7.5 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 visits to get Lumoxiti for 30 minutes per infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first week of cycles 2-8, participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. visit to get Rituximab for 2-4 hours and Lumoxiti for 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. visits to get Lumoxiti for 30 minutes per infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to drink lots of water and take aspirin during the cycles. They&#xD;
      will get drugs to minimize allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat screening tests at visits throughout the cycles and 1 follow-up&#xD;
      visit. They may have an eye exam.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent CD22+ B-cell leukemia comprising 2% of all&#xD;
           leukemias, or approximately 1200 of the 62,130 new cases of leukemia/year in the US. HCL&#xD;
           variant (HCLv), also CD22+, is 10-20% as common as HCL, but more common in the&#xD;
           relapsed/refractory population due to its poor prognosis and response to standard purine&#xD;
           analog chemotherapy. HCLv cells are CD25-negative and wild type for BRAF, so HCLv&#xD;
           patients are not candidates for BRAF inhibitors. CD25+ classic-appearing HCL-cells that&#xD;
           express unmutated IGHV4-34 are wild-type for BRAF, remain brightly CD22 positive, and&#xD;
           confer a poor prognosis when treated with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk is a recombinant immunotoxin containing a variable domain&#xD;
           (Fv) fragment of an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin,&#xD;
           which kills CD22+ cells by binding to CD22 via the Fv fragment, and induction of&#xD;
           apoptotic cell death catalytic inhibition of protein synthesis in the cytosol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk in phase 1 testing demonstrated a high complete response (CR)&#xD;
           rate in patients with chemoresistant HCL, without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), but with&#xD;
           reversible grade 2 hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) not requiring plasmapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk completed multicenter phase 3 testing in 80 patients, meeting&#xD;
           its CR endpoint, with 8.8% incidence each of capillary leak syndrome (CLS, grade 3-4&#xD;
           2.5%), and HUS (grade 3-4 6.3%), both reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk is the only known non-chemotherapy-containing regimen for HCL&#xD;
           which can consistently eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD), and this is associated&#xD;
           with prolonged CR durations. Recently, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has&#xD;
           accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk as the&#xD;
           treatment of adult patients with HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who did not achieve CR, or CR with MRD, often made neutralizing antibodies to&#xD;
           the bacterial-based toxin, and/or had collections of HCL cells not completely eradicated&#xD;
           by Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk. Both issues may be addressed by the addition of anti-CD20&#xD;
           monoclonal antibody (Mab) rituximab to Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the safety and toxicity of Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk and rituximab used at the&#xD;
      planned dose level, in patients with HCL and HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCL or HCLv with at least 1 prior purine analog, and, for HCL patients with &gt;=2-years 1&#xD;
           month response, at least 1 other therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for treatment, either 1) ANC &lt;1/nL, 2) Hgb &lt;10g/dL, 3) Plt &lt;100/nL, 4) symptomatic&#xD;
           splenomegaly, or enlarging HCL mass &gt; 2cm in short axis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL, or creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min&#xD;
           by Cockcroft-Gault equation, where creatinine clearance = (140 age)(Kg weight)/(72 x&#xD;
           Creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No uncontrolled infection or cardiopulmonary dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I trial, single arm, non-randomized, dose escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Doses: Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk 30-40 mcg/kg intravenous (iv) over 30 min,&#xD;
                Rituximab 375 mg/m^2 iv, 50-400 mg/hr.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rituximab day 1 (begin day -2 on cycle 1), Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk days 1, 3,&#xD;
                and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will receive up 4 cycles past documentation of CR without MRD, maximum 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To prevent renal toxicity and hypovolemia, patients will be encouraged to drink&#xD;
                water gradually, approximately 0.5-1 cup/hour or 6L/day, not going &gt;3 hours without&#xD;
                drinking from days 1 to 8 and to keep a hydration diary to record daily fluid&#xD;
                consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To prevent rituximab toxicity, patients will receive prophylactic dexamethasone&#xD;
                orally 0.5- 2 hours before the 1st dose of rituximab, and before subsequent doses&#xD;
                until rituximab infusion reactions are not seen. Patients will also receive&#xD;
                diphenhydramine, famotidine, and acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dexamethasone 4 mg orally (maximum 2 doses/day) will be given as needed to treat&#xD;
                nausea or fever associated with Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk, which might prevent&#xD;
                adequate water intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Up to 10-16 patients are intended to be treated in the trial; if a higher dose of&#xD;
                Moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk is used, total 16 evaluable subjects may be required.&#xD;

          -  The effects of moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk and rituximab on the developing human fetus&#xD;
             are unknown therefore participants must use effective methods of contraception as&#xD;
             directed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential (&lt; 50 years) who are sexually active with a&#xD;
                  non-sterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
                  prior to study entry and or the duration of study participation and must agree to&#xD;
                  continue using such precautions for 3 months after completion of Rituximab&#xD;
                  administration. Contraception after this point should be discussed with a&#xD;
                  responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal&#xD;
                  method are not acceptable methods of contraception. Females of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or those who&#xD;
                  are premenarchal or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without&#xD;
                  an alternative medical cause). A highly effective method of contraception is&#xD;
                  defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year)&#xD;
                  when used consistently and correctly. Not all methods of contraception are highly&#xD;
                  effective. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
                  her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
                  physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception from Day 1&#xD;
                  until 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational product. It is&#xD;
                  required that a female partner of a male subject also use an effective method of&#xD;
                  contraception throughout this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to co-enroll in the investigator s companion protocol&#xD;
             10C-0066 titled Collection of Human Samples to Study Hairy Cell and other Leukemias,&#xD;
             and to Develop Recombinant Immunotoxins for Cancer Treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks or&#xD;
             treatment with rituximab within last 3 months prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of&#xD;
             the study, starting with the screening visit through 4 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because moxetumomab&#xD;
             pasudotox-tdfk and rituximab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with moxetumomab&#xD;
             pasudotox-tdfk and rituximab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with moxetumomab pasudotox-tdfk and rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled pulmonary infection, pulmonary&#xD;
             edema or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with retinal or choroidal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive for Hepatitis B core antibody or surface antigen unless the patient is on&#xD;
             Tenofovir or Entecavir and Hepatitis B Viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) load is &lt;2000&#xD;
             IU/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active second malignancy requiring treatment other than minor resection of indolent&#xD;
             cancers like basal cell and squamous skin cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients unless taking appropriate&#xD;
             anti-HIV medications with a CD4 count of &gt; 200. Otherwise, there may be an increased&#xD;
             risk of lethal infections when temporarily suppressing normal B-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an allogeneic bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of both thromboembolism and known congenital hypercoagulable&#xD;
             conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radioimmunotherapy within 2 years prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with history of thrombotic microangiopathy or thrombotic microangiopathy&#xD;
             /HUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with corrected QT interval (Frederica) elevation &gt; 500 msec (manually&#xD;
             over-read by medically qualified person) based on at least two separate 12-lead ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on high dose estrogen (defined as &gt; 0.625 mg/day of an estrogen compound).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oxygen saturation at rest &lt; 88% measured by pulse oximetry or PaO2 less than or equal&#xD;
             to 55 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with life expectancy of less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinical evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (Grade 3-4).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &lt; 50% of predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or &lt; 50% of predicted&#xD;
             diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, corrected for hemoglobin concentration and&#xD;
             alveolar volume (DLCO). Note: Patients with no prior history of pulmonary illness are&#xD;
             not required to have pulmonary function testing (PFT). Forced expiratory volume will&#xD;
             be assessed after bronchodilator therapy.&#xD;
