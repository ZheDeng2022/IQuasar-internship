      This is a prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the role of dynamic computed&#xD;
      tomographic perfusion (CTP) and Computed Tomography-Derived Fractional Flow Reserve (CT-FFR)&#xD;
      in patients presenting with chest discomfort.Patients with lesions greater than 50% and who&#xD;

      /CT-FFR 49. Those who agree to participate will be scheduled to have the CT-FFR and CTP&#xD;
      performed within sixty days of the initial Coronary CTA procedure. A CTA will be performed at&#xD;
      rest for FFR. The patient will then take approximately a 30 min break. Regadenoson will then&#xD;
      be administered and the dynamic CT procedure will be done for perfusion. If patients are&#xD;
      deemed to be appropriate for invasive angiography by the referring physician, coronary&#xD;
      lesions between 40% and 80% will get a fractional flow measurement performed if indicated on&#xD;
      a clinical basis. Stenosis in vessels less than 1.5 mm will be excluded from the study. The&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a widely used, highly accurate&#xD;
      technique for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD), with sensitivity and negative&#xD;
      predictive values of over 90% 1-4. Patients with normal CCTA findings have an excellent&#xD;
      prognosis and do not require further testing for CAD 5. However, like invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography (CATH), CCTA is an anatomic test and, cannot reliably predict the impairment of&#xD;
      flow (functional significance) of Coronary stenoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, in approximately 15-25% of patients, additional functional testing may be&#xD;
      required after CCTA, usually in the form of stress testing 6-8. Stress testing is commonly&#xD;
      done by exercise or pharmacologic stress with electrocardiographic monitoring and often,&#xD;
      imaging of myocardial perfusion by nuclear scintigraphy (MPI) or detection of abnormal&#xD;
      contraction by echocardiography. Furthermore, in patients with previously known CAD, CCTA&#xD;
      alone is not an adequate test, because in most cases there are multiple lesions that are&#xD;
      possible sources of ischemia. Over the last two decades the number of abnormal stress studies&#xD;
      have decreased substantially from 40.9% in 1991 to 8.7% in 20099. This underscores the need&#xD;
      for an accurate mechanism to identify which patients best benefit from invasive angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial Computed Tomographic Perfusion (CTP) and Computed Tomography-Derived Fractional&#xD;
      Flow Reserve (CT-FFR) have emerged as promising ways to identify ischemia when there is&#xD;
      coronary disease identified by CCTA. The two tests provide different and perhaps&#xD;
      complimentary information. Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measures the difference in flow&#xD;
      created by a coronary stenosis before and after the administration of a vasodilator agent by&#xD;
      measuring the drop in pressure across the stenosis. Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) measures flow&#xD;
      at maximum vasodilation versus flow at rest in a given arterial tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational study designed to evaluate the role of dynamic computed&#xD;
      tomographic perfusion (CTP) and Computed Tomography-Derived Fractional Flow Reserve (CT-FFR)&#xD;
      in patients presenting with chest discomfort.Patients with lesions greater than 50% will&#xD;
      qualify to be a subject in the CTP study /CT-FFR 49. Those who agree to participate will be&#xD;
      scheduled to have the CT-FFR and CTP performed within sixty days of the initial Coronary CTA&#xD;
      procedure. A CTA will be performed at rest for FFR. The patient will then take approximately&#xD;
      a 30 min break. Regadenoson will then be administered and the dynamic CT procedure will be&#xD;
      done for perfusion. If patients are deemed to be appropriate for invasive angiography by the&#xD;
      referring physician, coronary lesions between 40% and 80% will get a fractional flow&#xD;
      measurement performed if indicated on a clinical basis. Stenosis in vessels less than 1.5 mm&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study. The CT-FFR and CTP will be performed in these patients&#xD;
      within 60 days of index coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CT scanner to be used for this study is an Aquilion ONE ViSION edition 320-detector row&#xD;
      scanner with 0.5-mm nominal width detector elements (Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara,&#xD;
      Japan). The scanner has a minimum rotation time of 275 ms. The CT acquisition software&#xD;
      includes a novel dose reduction technology (Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction 3D (AIDR 3D)&#xD;
      Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to imaging procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have two 18-20 gauge intravenous lines placed, one preferably in an anticubital&#xD;
      vein for contrast administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary CTA for FFR&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive sublingual nitroglycerine prior to scanning to ensure coronary&#xD;
      vasodilatation, while additional oral and/or intravenous beta-blockers will be administered&#xD;
      to achieve a pre-scan heart rate of &lt;75 beats per minute (bpm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For CT-FFR, a standard protocol for coronary CTA will be applied, according to the&#xD;
      established protocol at Lancaster General Hospital. Prior to the scan, an automated bolus&#xD;
      tracking algorithm (SUREStart) will be used to time the image acquisition to occur during the&#xD;
      arterial phase at or near peak contrast. Scan parameters will be as follows: single heart&#xD;
      beat half-scan volume acquisition mode with detector collimation 320 x 0.5 mm or less as&#xD;
      necessary to cover heart (typically 120 mm); tube voltage 100-120 kV; gantry rotation time&#xD;
      270 ms. To adjust for patient size, tube potential (kV) and tube current (mA) are determined&#xD;
      with use of automatic exposure control (SUREExposure3D, and SUREkV, Toshiba Medical Systems).&#xD;
      These features reduce variances in image quality by adjusting the acquisition parameters for&#xD;
      body habitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering will be used to obtain 70-99% of the R-R&#xD;
      interval. Radiation dose relevant indices (CT dose index (CTDI vol), dose length product&#xD;
      (DLP), and patient size) will be obtained for each examination. Size Specific Dose Estimates&#xD;
      (SSD) and Effective Dose (ED) will be calculated by using conversion factors according to&#xD;
      standard methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four phases of the R-R Interval (RR) will be reconstructed covering the range from 70% - 99%&#xD;
      (typically 70%, 80%, 90%, and 99%). Reconstruction parameters will be as follows: Medium&#xD;
      Calibrated Field of View (CFOV), Filter Convolution (FC) 03 reconstruction kernel, 0.5 mm&#xD;
      acquisition thickness with 0.25mm interval, AIDR 3D iterative reconstruction. Adaptive motion&#xD;
      correction and FIRST will be used if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic CTP procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTP procedure involves infusion of a stress agent and a contrast bolus prior to image&#xD;
      acquisition. See Figure 2 for a representation of the CTP procedure, and Table 1 for CTP&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No stress agent is FDA-approved specifically for use in CT perfusion. The investigator's&#xD;
      choice of stress agent for this study is regadenoson (Lexiscan), a vasodilator widely used in&#xD;
      standard-of-care nuclear stress testing. It has been used previously in CT perfusion (12).&#xD;
      Regadenoson was chosen for its ease of use and its favorable safety/tolerability profile in&#xD;
      patients (37). Its mechanism of action is vasodilation of the coronary vasculature and&#xD;
      augmentation of coronary blood flow. Arteries with hemodynamically significant stenosis are&#xD;
      not as capable of augmenting flow, resulting in relative under-perfusion in the downstream&#xD;
      territory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invesitgators will use the standard intravenous dose of Lexiscan recommended for use in&#xD;
      nuclear stress testing in this population, which is 5 ml (0.4 mg). Lexiscan, which comes in a&#xD;
      prefilled 5 ml syringe containing 0.4 mg of regadenoson, is administered as a rapid&#xD;
      (approximately 10-15 seconds) injection into a peripheral vein followed immediately by a 5 ml&#xD;
      saline flush. Addendum 1 gives detailed study procedures for myocardial CT perfusion,&#xD;
      including the use of Lexiscan, and Addendum 2 gives the Lancaster General Hospital Lexiscan&#xD;
      Administration Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 12 lead ECG will be performed at baseline. After this, rhythm monitor leads for CT will be&#xD;
      placed. Patient will be positioned supine on the on the CT gantry with continuous ECG&#xD;
      monitoring after the baseline ECG is performed as above. If heart rate is greater than 65&#xD;
      beats/minute and blood pressure is greater than 100/60 mm of mercury metoprolol will be&#xD;
      administered as per established Lancaster General Health (LGH) protocol for Coronary CTA.&#xD;
      Regadenoson will be injected at 0.4 mg / ml followed by 5 ml saline Flush. One minute after&#xD;
      regadenoson administration the scanner will be instructed to acquire the heart rate and&#xD;
      adjust the gantry rotation time. If patients is stable and has a steady heart rate, 50 cc of&#xD;
      contrast will be administered no later than 1.5 minutes after the administration of&#xD;
      regadenoson followed by 30 cc - 50 cc of normal saline. The rate of injection for both&#xD;
      contrast and saline is 6m/s. A prospectively gated scan will be performed at 70% - 80% of the&#xD;
      R - R cycle for every heart beat for a total of 25 seconds. Myocardial Blood flow will be&#xD;
      calculated for 17 segments (Table I) . A 12 lead ECG will be obtained immediately after&#xD;
      acquisition of images and each subsequent minute for 5 minutes. In the event of ECG changes,&#xD;
      the ECG will be repeated every 60 to 90 seconds until it returns to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who experience stress induced adverse reactions during CTP, aminophylline will&#xD;
      be administered IV by a co-investigator physician at a dose of 50-250 mg, using the lowest&#xD;
      effective dose. Intravenous Aminophylline is a non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor that&#xD;
      is FDA approved for the treatment of symptoms and reversible airway obstruction due to asthma&#xD;
      and other chronic lung diseases. In addition, it is widely accepted as the primary reversal&#xD;
      agent of adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson when patients experience pharmacologic&#xD;
      vasodilator stress induced adverse reactions during nuclear cardiac stress testing. The dose&#xD;
      used for reactions during stress testing, and which the investigator will use for reactions&#xD;
      during CTP, is lower than the FDA approved dose of 5.7 mg/kg dose used in patients with acute&#xD;
      symptoms of lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTP examination will be graded using the standard 17-segment myocardial model recommended&#xD;
      by the American College of Cardiology Foundation / American Heart Association for nuclear&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion and stress echocardiography, in comparison to the myocardial appearance&#xD;
      from the baseline coronary CTA. Areas of myocardial hypo-enhancement (decreased CT signal)&#xD;
      under hyperemic conditions (coronary vasodilation during the regadenoson infusion) indicate&#xD;
      possible ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      If clinically indicated by the initial CCTA and the study CTP, the invasive angiography will&#xD;
      be performed at the discretion of the evaluating cardiologist based on a clinical evaluation.&#xD;
      Lesions between 40% and 80% will have an FFR. Patients' coronary angiography and FFR will be&#xD;
      as per the protocol in Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long Term Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients medical charts will be reviewed for long term cardiac related outcomes (MACE events,&#xD;
      etc) 1 year after the study procedure. This will not require direct participation from the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
