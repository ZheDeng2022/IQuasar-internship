  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PREPARE TAVR pilot study will examine the effects of remotely administered physiological&#xD;
      reconditioning program (RAPR) on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes at one year post&#xD;
      TAVR in frail older adults.&#xD;

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a home based exercise and&#xD;
      dietary intervention program on the quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes in frail&#xD;
      adults undergoing Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomly (1:1) assigned to the standard of care (SOC group) where patients will receive all&#xD;
      medical care as decided by their treating physicians or assigned to a home based program&#xD;
      known as remotely administered physiological reconditioning (RPR) program which will include&#xD;
      receiving personalized instructions for a progressive exercise program and dietary changes.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted for regular phone and in-person follow up for monitoring their&#xD;
      progress. The primary endpoint will be quality of life as assessed by KCCQE questionnaires at&#xD;
      one-year post TAVR. The secondary endpoints include length of stay post TAVR, all-cause&#xD;
      mortality, repeat hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality and repeat&#xD;
      hospitalization at one year.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). KCCQE is a 23-item self-administered questionnaire developed to independently measure the patient's perception of their health status, which includes heart failure symptoms, impact on physical and social function, and how their heart failure impacts their quality of life (QOL) within a 2-week recall period. KCCQ responses are provided along a rating scale continuum with equal spacing from worst to best.</description>
