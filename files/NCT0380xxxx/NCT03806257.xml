  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standards for post-cardiac surgery physical interventions vary between insitutions and there&#xD;
      are no published guidelines for national organizations in the U.S. The increasing body of&#xD;
      evidence for the effectiveness of physical interventions coupled with variability in how&#xD;
      these interventions are implemented suggests a critical need to prospectively determine the&#xD;
      impact of clearly defined postoperative physical interventions. This randomized, controlled&#xD;
      study seeks to determine the effectiveness of a three-pronged, enhanced, post-operative&#xD;
      physical therapy protocol which includes 1) early mobilization, 2) frequent mobilization and&#xD;
      ambulation, and 3) patient education on the outcomes of hospital lengths of stay and&#xD;
      discharge disposition. The investigators will enroll 220 adult subjects undergoing elective&#xD;
      CABG, mitral valve repair or replacement surgery, aortic valve surgery, or combined&#xD;
      CABG/valve procedures. Subjects will be randomized to either the control (standard-of-care)&#xD;
      group or intervention group (enhanced protocol), and followed for five days. Subjects in each&#xD;
      group will wear a FitBit Charge 2 for the duration of the five days following surgery. This&#xD;
      will provide both sleep activity and steps data that will be analyzed for sleep quality and&#xD;
      distance walked. The primary aim is to assess the difference between groups for ICU and&#xD;
      hospital length of stay.&#xD;

      Patients will be identified based on pre-screening the cardiothoracic surgery schedule. Study&#xD;
      staff will visit potential study subjects in the pre-surgical testing clinic to discuss the&#xD;
      study's objectives and to ascertain subjects' interest in participating in the study. After&#xD;
      providing informed consent, subjects will be randomized using SAS into either the&#xD;
      interventional group or standard care group after their surgical procedure is complete and&#xD;
      the subject has been transferred to the CVICU. After completion of the surgical procedure,&#xD;
      patients who had a major perioperative complication such as stroke, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage requiring massive transfusion (&gt;10 units of PRBCs),&#xD;
      intraoperative cardiac arrest, or intraoperative pulmonary arrest, will be considered screen&#xD;
      failures and will not be randomized, since the investigators consider the patient enrolled&#xD;
      once randomized. Patients randomized to the interventional group will undergo the enhanced&#xD;
      physical therapy protocol which includes mobilization from bed to chair on the day of surgery&#xD;
      and more frequent ambulation on the subsequent five days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main differences between the standard therapy (control) group and intervention group is&#xD;
      the timing of post-operative mobilization and ambulation, as well as the point at which they&#xD;
      receive gait and safe ambulation training. In the standard therapy group, the patients will&#xD;
      receive a FitBit2 after their arrival on the ICU, withstanding any postoperative&#xD;
      complications. On POD 1 the subjects routinely get up to the bedside chair with the help of&#xD;
      an ICU nurse or physical therapist. The subjects will generally ambulate one-half the&#xD;
      circumference of the ICU with assistance, though this is not enforced. On POD2 and onward,&#xD;
      the standard therapy group typically will get up to the bedside chair at least once, as well&#xD;
      as walk one-half circumference of the ICU, and will receive the standard physical therapy&#xD;
      gait and ambulation training. The intervention group will have the FitBit2 watch placed on&#xD;
      their wrist on POD 0, along with getting up to the bedside chair. On POD 1, the subjects will&#xD;
      get up to the bedside chair twice (as tolerated by patient), and will be asked to walk&#xD;
      one-half the ICU circumference. Additionally, the patient's physical therapy and&#xD;
      gait/ambulation training will commence on POD 1. On POD 2, the subjects will get up to the&#xD;
      bedside chair three times, and will be asked to attempt three walks with the goal of one full&#xD;
      ICU circumference.&#xD;
