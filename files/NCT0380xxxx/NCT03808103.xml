  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of oral administration of EcoActive to patients with&#xD;
      inactive Crohn's disease and how it affects the levels of AIEC in stool.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if EcoActive is safe and effective in people with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease. EcoActive is a collection of bacteriophages. Bacteriophages (or phages) are&#xD;
      viruses that infect only bacteria. The phages in EcoActive infect a specific type of bacteria&#xD;
      called Adherent Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of Crohn's disease is poorly understood. However, the presence of AIEC in the&#xD;
      intestines is associated with worsening inflammation in this disease. Inflammation is the&#xD;
      presence of redness, irritation, and ulcers in the intestines. By using phages that only&#xD;
      infect and kill this specific type of bacteria (AIEC), it is the hope this can be used to&#xD;
      improve the course of Crohn's disease. The phages would only target the AIEC, without&#xD;
      affecting the natural, often helpful, bacteria of the intestines. EcoActive may also lessen&#xD;
      the use of antibiotics to control symptoms. When antibiotics are used, they can have major&#xD;
      effects on the rest of the bacteria in the intestines. Also, repeated use can cause&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics. Reduced use of antibiotics would&#xD;
      limit both of these risks.&#xD;
