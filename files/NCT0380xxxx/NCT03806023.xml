  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) have residual nerve circuits. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to strengthen those circuits to improve motor recovery after injury. To do&#xD;
      this, the investigators are attempting to pair electrical and magnetic stimulation with&#xD;
      physical training targeted toward the connections between nerve circuits. Past studies by&#xD;
      other groups have shown that synapse strength can be improved temporarily after a short&#xD;
      period of paired stimulation between the brain (motor cortex) and the peripheral nerves&#xD;
      serving target muscles - in other words, &quot;Fire Together, Wire Together&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brain's intention to move a muscle can be read by recording surface electrical activity&#xD;
      over target muscles (electromyography or EMG). In animal models of SCI, scientists have&#xD;
      successfully used target muscle EMG to trigger spinal cord electrical stimulation pulses&#xD;
      while the animals perform physical exercises. Using the body's own signals to trigger nerve&#xD;
      stimulation is called &quot;closed-loop stimulation&quot;. This might be an optimal method to&#xD;
      coordinate brain and nerve activity, especially with the clinical advantage of being possible&#xD;
      to combine with physical exercise training. However, whether EMG-triggered closed loop&#xD;
      stimulation has the same amount of effect when applied non-invasively in humans is still&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed study is a proof-of-principle to demonstrate the potential of non-invasive&#xD;
      closed-loop stimulation in humans with incomplete cervical SCI. We will test different&#xD;
      combinations of triggered and non-triggered electrical and magnetic stimulation, and record&#xD;
      the short-term effects on nerve transmission and skilled function of hand muscles. This pilot&#xD;
      study will be a foundation for future studies combining EMG-triggered stimulation with&#xD;
      long-term physical exercise training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In both animal models and humans with spinal cord injury (SCI), synaptic efficacy between&#xD;
      corticospinal axons and spinal motor neurons has improved temporarily after a short period of&#xD;
      paired stimulation between motor cortex and spinal or peripheral sites. In a demonstration of&#xD;
      closed-loop stimulation in SCI rats, target muscle electromyography (EMG) signals were used&#xD;
      to trigger spinal cord electrical stimulation while performing physical retraining. Results&#xD;
      showed that EMG-triggered stimulation plus physical retraining led to greater motor recovery&#xD;
      than non-triggered stimulation or physical training alone. However, these studies used&#xD;
      invasive direct spinal cord stimulation in rodent models. Whether this approach can work&#xD;
      non-invasively in humans remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty participants (10 able bodied and 10 SCI subjects) will be recruited. Each subject will&#xD;
      undergo five different 20-minute interventions. Stimulation will be delivered at the motor&#xD;
      cortex via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the median nerve, or both. Stimulation&#xD;
      will occur either while the subject is passively at rest or triggered by reaching endogenous&#xD;
      EMG threshold during a pinch task. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and every 20 minutes&#xD;
      for one hour after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that for at least 20 minutes after stimulation, one session of&#xD;
      EMG-triggered stimulation will significantly improve motor evoked potential amplitude,&#xD;
      increase cortical silent period duration, and decrease time required to complete a pegboard&#xD;
      task compared with one session of passively delivered stimulation. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that EMG triggered median nerve stimulation alone will provide equal or greater&#xD;
      benefits as EMG triggered TMS or EMG-triggered paired stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: One session of EMG-triggered stimulation will significantly improve motor&#xD;
      evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, increase cortical silent period duration of APB, and&#xD;
      decrease time required to complete a manual pegboard task compared with one session of&#xD;
      passively delivered stimulation or one session of voluntary contraction alone for at least 20&#xD;
      minutes post-stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: EMG-triggered PNS alone will result in equal or greater effects than EMG&#xD;
      triggered TMS or TMS+PNS paired stimulation. This would indicate that EMG triggered PNS might&#xD;
      be used as a potential intervention to add during physical training, a setting in which TMS&#xD;
      is difficult to apply.&#xD;
