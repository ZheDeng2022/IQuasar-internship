      Increased health education has the potential to facilitate better use of health care services&#xD;
      and to promote early treatment, thus it can strengthen the health care system, and ultimately&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality. In this study, we will develop and test the effect of digital&#xD;
      health messages related to HIV, Tuberculosis (TB) and Taenia solium cysticercosis/taeniosis&#xD;
      (TSCT) (the intervention diseases) in Migoli and Izazi (the intervention villages), in&#xD;
      Iringa, Tanzania (TZ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is planned as follows: A digital platform, providing the intervention&#xD;
      villages with digital health messages related to the above-mentioned diseases, will be&#xD;
      implemented in TZ in 2019. The platform will be accessible free of charge, through own&#xD;
      devices and tablets based in the local Wi-Fi spots in the villages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of this project, the doctoral research fellow will participate in&#xD;
      developing the digital health messages, together with experts from the medical and teaching&#xD;
      environments in Tanzania, Norway, Germany and USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the PhD-project consists of a cluster non-randomised controlled trial and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews in Tanzania. The digital health messages will be physically shown&#xD;
      to the participants in the intervention group. The study is planned to investigate the&#xD;
      knowledge related to the intervention diseases, before the intervention, immediately after&#xD;
      exposure to the intervention, and at follow-up points throughout one year, after the&#xD;
      intervention has been implemented. Semi-structured interviews with clients (users of the&#xD;
      intervention) from each of the intervention villages are included, to explore the perception&#xD;
      and reception of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline study and the immediate after survey will take place in Tanzania in Q1 2019,&#xD;
      while the other follow-up studies and interviews (3, 6 and 12 months after baseline) will be&#xD;
      undertaken throughout one year.&#xD;

      Introduction This protocol is registered in Helseforsk, University of Oslo, and the project&#xD;
      has been assessed by Norwegian Centre for Research Data (NSD), ref. number 59643. Ethical&#xD;
      approval from the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Tanzania, has been granted&#xD;
      with the reference number NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol IX/2947.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD-project consist of three work packages (WPs): WP1: A systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis, WP2: A cluster non-randomised controlled trial and WP3: Semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with clients in the intervention group. Only WP2 and WP3 are elaborated upon in&#xD;
      this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned research project will be included as a health-research component in the Norwegian&#xD;
      Government- and Norwegian Research Council- funded innovation project &quot;Non-discriminating&#xD;
      access for Digital Inclusion&quot; (DigI). The project runs from January 2017 to September 2020.&#xD;
      Altogether 11 partners from eight countries are collaborating on the project. Professor Josef&#xD;
      Noll from the Dept. of Technology Systems (ITS), University of Oslo (UiO), is the project&#xD;
      owner, and the doctoral research fellow's co- supervisor. Responsible for the health-research&#xD;
      component and main supervisor of the doctoral research fellow, is Professor Dr. Andrea&#xD;
      Winkler at the Institute of Health and Society, UiO. Head in TZ, is Dr. Bernard Ngowi&#xD;
      (HIV/AIDS and TB specialist) from NIMR and Associate professor Helena Ngowi (TSCT specialist)&#xD;
      from Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA). Associate professor Maurice Isabwe from Dept.&#xD;
      of Information and Communication Technology at University of Agder is head of developing the&#xD;
      digital health messages. This study is thus multicentre with several institutions responsible&#xD;
      for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Tanzania, DigI will facilitate a digital health education platform, where digital health&#xD;
      messages related to HIV / AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Taenia solium cysticercosis/taeniosis&#xD;
      (TSCT) will be transferred to the community; hereby called clients, defined by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization (2017) as &quot;members of the public that are potential or current users of&#xD;
      health services, including promotion activities&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital health messages will be accessible at a Wi-Fi spot in the local village close to&#xD;
      the local health post. The digital health messages will also be shown face-to-face to each of&#xD;
      the participants in the intervention group, by enumerators in the research team from SUA and&#xD;
      the doctoral research fellow. The intervention will be available for all clients in the&#xD;
      intervention villages, not only for the participants in the study described in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be maintained by NIMR Muhimbili Centre in Dar es Salaam during the&#xD;
      first phase, but is going to be managed as a sustainable business model where a local sales&#xD;
      man or woman is selling vouchers to access the World Wide Web. NIMR have close contact with&#xD;
      the village authorities and health workers in the intervention villages, and will be alerted&#xD;
      if the intervention for some reason is not functioning. The Wi-Fi network that provides the&#xD;
      access to the digital health education platform, reaches within a radius of 50 meters, and is&#xD;
      driven by a solar panel. This means that the intervention will be accessible even if the&#xD;
      electricity locally shuts down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale Today's education channels are changing, thus health education&#xD;
      interventions must meet the target population at their own level of technology, and further&#xD;
      do rely upon the characteristics of the technology available. A useful tool to deliver&#xD;
      education and improve health seeking behaviour and health-related lifestyle decisions, is&#xD;
      mobile technologies, because they make people more contactable. Health seeking behaviour may&#xD;
      change after the target group has been exposed to adequate health messages that provide&#xD;
      relevant information to the target population, , thus digital health information can&#xD;
      contribute to prevention and management of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital health and digital health education Digital health is defined by World Health&#xD;
      Organization (2016) as &quot;The use of digital, mobile and wireless technologies to support the&#xD;
      achievement of health objectives. Digital health describes the general use of information and&#xD;
      communications technologies (ICT) for health and is inclusive of both mHealth (mobile health)&#xD;
      and eHealth (electronic health)&quot; . eHealth is defined by the WHO (2005) as &quot;the&#xD;
      cost-effective and secure use of information and communications technologies in support of&#xD;
      health and health-related fields, including health-care services, health surveillance, health&#xD;
      literature, and health education, knowledge and research&quot; . mHealth is a component of&#xD;
      eHealth, and commonly referred to as the use of mobile and wireless technologies for health.&#xD;
      WHO (2011) defines it as: &quot;medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices,&#xD;
      such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and&#xD;
      other wireless devices&quot; .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health behaviour change may reduce the burden of preventable disease and death around the&#xD;
      world, &quot;as health education covers the continuum from disease prevention and promotion of&#xD;
      optimal health to the detection of illness to treatment, rehabilitation, and long-term care&quot;&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of eHealth is now understood as central in order to provide more care and better care&#xD;
      to more people, especially those most in need. A key part of the Sustainable Development Goal&#xD;
      3 relates to reaching people with the information they need in order to live healthier lives,&#xD;
      and eHealth is regarded as a tool to reach the public with health messages and support, as&#xD;
      well as encouraging clients to take active roles in their health and wellbeing (ibid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of smart devices and mobile data services are rapidly changing, and it is likely that&#xD;
      an increasingly part of the population in for example Sub-Saharan Africa will have access to&#xD;
      both in the future.&#xD;
