  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the sensory profile of patients using quantitative sensory testing (QST) and&#xD;
      questionnaires as well as the level of sensitisation using temporal summation and diffuse&#xD;
      noxious inhibitory control paradigms in all patients undergoing a chronic pain intervention&#xD;
      at Barts Health NHS Trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective- To identify the phenotype of responders and non-responders to a chronic&#xD;
      pain intervention using QST sensory profile as well as the sensitisation paradigms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective- To establish the correlation between sensory profile, and sensitisation&#xD;
      parameters as well as other measures of chronic pain as per Initiative on Methods,&#xD;
      Measurement and Pain Assessment in clinical trials (IMMPACT) recommendation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common interventions performed at Barts Health NHS Trust includes Neuromodulation, targeted&#xD;
      epidural steroid and/or radiofrequency treatment, 8% Capsaicin patch and pharmacological&#xD;
      interventions such as anti-neuropathic agent and opioids.&#xD;
