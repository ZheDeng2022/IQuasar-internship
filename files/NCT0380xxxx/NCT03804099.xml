  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible visual impairment&#xD;
      in Western Countries. It is a well-established fact that vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) plays a key part in the development of the neovascular (or exsudative) form of AMD.&#xD;
      Today, VEGF-inhibition by means of injection of anti-VEGF agents into the vitreous cavity&#xD;
      constitutes the gold standard of AMD therapy. In physiological conditions, VEGF acts as a&#xD;
      vasodilator by activating endothelial nitric oxide synthase. As a consequence, VEGF&#xD;
      inhibition should result in significant ocular vasoconstriction, which has in fact been&#xD;
      demonstrated for bevacizumab and ranibizumab, two of the three available VEGF-inhibitors. The&#xD;
      understanding and awareness of potentially harmful implications of the induced&#xD;
      vasoconstriction on retinal and/or optic nerve head structure and function is sparse. This is&#xD;
      especially delicate, as most patients with exsudative AMD require repeated injections on a&#xD;
      monthly basis for many years. Aflibercept, the latest anti-VEGF agent approved for&#xD;
      intravitreal use in 2011, offers a superior binding affinity for VEGF compared to the former&#xD;
      two drugs. However, as of today, its effect on ocular circulation is unclear. With Laser&#xD;
      Speckle Flowgraphy (LSFG), a commercially available, non-invasive and patient-friendly method&#xD;
      for the evaluation of blood flow at the optic nerve head, the choroid and retina has arisen&#xD;
      in recent years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to measure ocular perfusion with LSFG before and after 3 consecutive injections of&#xD;
      aflibercept in unilateral neovascular age-related maculopathy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged over 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  written informed consent for participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled for 3 consecutive intravitreal injections (4 week intervals) of aflibercept&#xD;
             for treatment of exudative AMD in one eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is generally healthy with no current significant or a history of a significant&#xD;
             neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic, metabolic,&#xD;
             rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder, as determined by the&#xD;
             investigator's clinical judgment through collection of medical history and performance&#xD;
             of a physical examination. A significant disorder is defined as a disease or medical&#xD;
             condition associated with impaired health status, requiring regular or current medical&#xD;
             treatment and/or follow up. For the purposes of this study, an investigator may&#xD;
             classify a medical condition as a nonsignificant disorder despite the fact that the&#xD;
             subject receives treatment. Subjects having controlled Stage 1 hypertension (blood&#xD;
             pressure of 140-159 mmHg systolic and/or 90-99 mmHg diastolic) are eligible for&#xD;
             participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal findings in the medical history unless the investigator considers an&#xD;
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active exudative AMD requiring treatment of both eyes&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular surgery (including intravitreal injection) during the 3 months preceding the&#xD;
             study&#xD;

             (e.g. glaucoma, optic nerve head drusen, tilted disc, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ocular infection or clinically significant inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opacities of the cornea (e.g. corneal scars, corneal oedema), the lens (e.g. LOCS-II&#xD;
             grading &gt; 2, posterior capsule opacification) or the vitreous (e.g. vitreous&#xD;
             haemorrhage, asteroid hyalosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are not able to cooperate or with insufficient ability to fixate (tremor,&#xD;
             nystagmus)&#xD;
