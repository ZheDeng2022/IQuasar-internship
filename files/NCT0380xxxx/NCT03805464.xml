  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of a wearable sensor to detect&#xD;
      changes in knee joint loading using an experimental knee joint effusion as a model for a&#xD;
      common clinical physiological alteration in joint status. The rationale for this project is&#xD;
      that it will establish the efficacy of an inexpensive, clinically, and publicly available&#xD;
      device that can detect changes in biomechanical loading due to acute physiologic change in&#xD;
      joint status. The study will utilize a cross-sectional cohort study design and will seek to&#xD;
      enroll 25 male and female healthy adult participants (18-35 yo). Participants will report to&#xD;
      the laboratory for three total sessions (Session 1: informed consent and task&#xD;
      familiarization; Session 2: testing; Session 3: knee joint status assessment). The primary&#xD;
      outcomes of interest include lower extremity thigh and shank acceleration and velocity data&#xD;
      (wearable sensor data), lower extermity 3D kinematics and kinetics (motion capture data), and&#xD;
      lower extremity muscle function (EMG data) during walking gait, as well as functional balance&#xD;
      and patient-reported subjective outcomes. Data will be analyzed by calculating change scores&#xD;
      from the pre- to post-experimental effusion outcome measure testing. Paired-samples t-tests&#xD;
      and Cohen's d effect sizes will be used to assess changed in wearable sensor data from pre-&#xD;
      to post-experimental effusion. Correlation statistics will be used to determine if there are&#xD;
      association between the motion capture and wearable sensor data. The potential risks&#xD;
      associated with an experimental joint effusion will be addressed by maintaining appropriate&#xD;
      sterile conditions and having the participant check-in with the PI (licensed healthcare&#xD;
      provider) at 48 hours following testing session.&#xD;
