      Purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Macadamia nuts on body weight,&#xD;
      adiposity, , oxidative stress, glucose, insulin an lipid levels. it will a randomized cross&#xD;
      over study that will include two study diets (Macadamia nut diet and control diet) with a&#xD;
      wash out period of 4 weeks in between. 40 subjects will be selected and randomized into&#xD;
      either of the two phases. During the Macadamia nut diet phase subjects will be provided the&#xD;
      appropriate portion of Macadamia nuts (15% of daily calories or 30-45 grams based on kcal&#xD;
      requirement of the individual, instructions will be provided on how to incorporate nuts into&#xD;
      the diet. this phase will last for 8 weeks. During the control diet phase, subjects will&#xD;
      continue with their normal diet and abstain from eating nuts. subjects will be tested for&#xD;
      various outcomes at baseline and twice at the end of each phase. The intervention will last&#xD;
      for 5 months in total.&#xD;
