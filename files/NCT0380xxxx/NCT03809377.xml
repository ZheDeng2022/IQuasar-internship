      Peripheral blood samples will be taken with informed consent from radiotherapy patients&#xD;
      before and during treatment fractions for sarcoma, breast, lung, gut, genitourinary and head&#xD;
      &amp; neck tumours at The Royal Marsden. Candidate genes identified by PHE, Columbia and/or in&#xD;
      the literature as being specific to radiation responses will be assessed, together with genes&#xD;
      relevant to systemic inflammatory and immune responses, to identify transcriptional responses&#xD;
      for a range of doses and exposures on an inter-individual basis. Data will be analysed using&#xD;
      existing and new statistical tools focused on count data modelling. The intended outcome is&#xD;
      identification of a radiation specific panel of genes to inform individual radiation&#xD;
      responses and if the results are favourable, a large scale follow up to this project is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;

      Biomarkers of radiation exposure are recognised to form an important component of the&#xD;
      'toolkit' for initial triage assessment of potentially exposed individuals in a mass casualty&#xD;
      radiation accident or incident. Furthermore, radiation is an important medical tool and&#xD;
      biomarkers can contribute to longer term assessment of radiation effects and public health&#xD;
      risks. The gene expression assay has been gaining popularity as a sensitive biological marker&#xD;
      of radiation exposure with the potential to be used for truly individualised dosimetry. The&#xD;
      possibility for this assay to be used for a large scale mass-casualty scenario has been&#xD;
      proposed and tested in a recent inter-comparison exercise. However, a fuller understanding of&#xD;
      genetic factors that contribute to individual radiation risks is needed to inform tailored&#xD;
      screening approaches - i.e. to identify a truly radiation specific panel of genetics&#xD;
      responses for use as a transcriptional biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Columbia University, research has shown that transcriptional effects have the potential to&#xD;
      be used as individualised predictors of radiosensitivity to early and late effects. At Public&#xD;
      Health England (PHE), recently established molecular counting nCounter technology allows&#xD;
      direct counting of nucleic acid molecules (DNA, mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA) without the need for&#xD;
      enzymatic reaction or amplification steps hence reducing time for data collection. This new&#xD;
      gene expression analysis technique has been assessed for radiation biodosimetry applications&#xD;
      with promising results. Furthermore, gene expression has shown a high degree of promise as a&#xD;
      marker for late effects of radiation, for instance normal tissue reactions following curative&#xD;
      radiotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the earlier pilot RTGene study the investigators found genes that are consistently&#xD;
      down-regulated and up-regulated towards the end of the radiotherapy treatment. The next stage&#xD;
      of this work (RTGene 2) will be to validate the nCounter data for a small number of new genes&#xD;
      consistently found in the top 6 of differentially expressed. Importantly, in an attempt to&#xD;
      identify genes which are promising biomarkers of susceptibility to radiation-induced&#xD;
      toxicity, expression levels will need to be compared with normal tissue reaction to IR, and&#xD;
      combined with longer term radiation toxicity data to identify genes with the most pronounced&#xD;
      expression level fluctuations during and after radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood samples will be taken with informed consent from radiotherapy patients&#xD;
      before and during treatment fractions for sarcoma, breast, lung, gut, genitourinary and head&#xD;
      &amp; neck tumours at The Royal Marsden. Candidate genes identified by PHE, Columbia and/or in&#xD;
      the literature as being specific to radiation responses will be assessed, together with genes&#xD;
      relevant to systemic inflammatory and immune responses, to identify transcriptional responses&#xD;
      for a range of doses and exposures on an inter-individual basis. Data will be analysed using&#xD;
      existing and new statistical tools focused on count data modelling. The intended outcome is&#xD;
      identification of a radiation specific panel of genes to inform individual radiation&#xD;
      responses and if the results are favourable, a large scale follow up to this project is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;
