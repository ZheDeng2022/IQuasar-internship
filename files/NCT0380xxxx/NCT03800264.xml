      Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia that occurs after&#xD;
      on pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. It is associated with postoperative&#xD;
      complications, including increased risk of stroke, prolonged hospital stay and increased&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study was to find reliable, effective, safe and well tolerated&#xD;
      tools for the prevention of AF after on pump coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: The study included 176 patients (age range 40 to 79 years) and&#xD;
      scheduled for elective on pump CABG operations without concomitant procedures. The patients&#xD;
      were divided randomly into two equal groups. Group (A) in which bisoprolol was used for&#xD;
      prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation after surgery. Group (B) in which bisoprolol and&#xD;
      hydrocortisone were used for prophylaxis against atrial fibrillation after surgery. For each&#xD;
      patient, the following data were collected: gender, preoperative diseases, intraoperative&#xD;
      cross clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and Lt internal mammary Artery usage,&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, death, myocardial infarction chest infection&#xD;
      and C - reactive protein levels.&#xD;

      The study was conducted at The Cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit of Ain Shams&#xD;
      University hospitals during a period of 6 months. The study protocol was approved by&#xD;
      &quot;research and ethics committee&quot; of anesthesia and intensive care department, Ain Shams&#xD;
      University. Informative consent was obtained from the patients before enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      176 Patients were registered in the study. Patients were randomly allocated by&#xD;
      computer-generated random number list into two study groups of 88 patients each, with a range&#xD;
      of age between 40 and 79 years old and were undergoing elective on pump CABG operations&#xD;
      without concomitant procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received bisoprolol 5mg per oral (P.O.) in the evening of the operation and then one&#xD;
      dose (5 mg) every twenty four hours during the next two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received bisoprolol as group (A) in addition hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenously is&#xD;
      given in the evening of the operation and then 100 mg every eight hours during the next two&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for the study included: Patients with preoperative rhythm abnormalities&#xD;
      (sick sinus syndrome, atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, history of chronic or&#xD;
      intermittent AF), pretreatment with classes I and III antiarrhythmic agents, receiving&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs except angiotensin convertor enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thyroid&#xD;
      disease, renal or liver disease, peripheral arterial atherosclerotic disease,&#xD;
      thrombophlebitis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, systemic bacterial or mycotic infection,&#xD;
      active tuberculosis, Cushing's syndrome, peptic ulcer, psychotic mental disorder, Herpes&#xD;
      Simplex keratitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sedation with diazepam (10 mg intramuscular), radial arterial catheterization,&#xD;
      intravenous catheters, and a central venous catheter were introduced in the operating&#xD;
      theater. Hemodynamic parameters; Heart rate monitoring, mean arterial pressure, rectal&#xD;
      temperature, central venous pressure and arterial blood gas throughout the process was&#xD;
      observed. Anesthesia was started by fentanyl (35 mg / kg) and muscle relaxation was achieved&#xD;
      with pancronium (0.1 mg / kg), then endotracheal intubation using ventilation with 100%&#xD;
      oxygen. The median incision of the sternum was used for cardiac exposure. The left internal&#xD;
      mammary artery was harvested and the saphenous vein was prepared, if necessary. All&#xD;
      operations were performed under cardiopulmonary bypass and moderate hypothermia (28-328C)&#xD;
      with flow rates of 2.2-2.4 l / m2 and the mean perfusion pressure of 50-85 mm Hg. Heart&#xD;
      failure was assisted by initial crystalloid cardioplegia (48C, 15 cc / kg) and heart&#xD;
      preservation was assisted with 400 cc cold blood Cardioplegia every 20 minutes. The hot shut&#xD;
      was performed shortly before removing the cross clamp. The venous cannula was inserted&#xD;
      through the right atrial appendix. The arterial cannula was placed in the ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Postoperative Monitoring: All patients were continuously monitored at the ICU with&#xD;
      electrocardiography (ECG), invasive blood pressure and with finger probe for oxygen&#xD;
      saturation within 48 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients developed atrial fibrillation received treatment according to their condition, if&#xD;
      they are haemodynamically unstable electrical cardioversion (synchronized adjusted at 100&#xD;
      joules using biphasic electrical cardiovertor) was applied. If they are haemodynamically&#xD;
      stable pharmacological cardioversion (amiodarone 5 mg/kg intravenous over 60 minutes, then&#xD;
      1.2 grams per day by continuous intravenous infusion) was used. (5)&#xD;
