  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV remains to prevail in the uremic patients under hemodialysis. The comprehensive&#xD;
      surveillance in the risk population facilitates the link to care for HCV eradication.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Taiwan has the leading prevalence and incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD)&#xD;
           worldwide. Uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) are at great risk for&#xD;
           hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The prevalence and annual incidence of HCV infection&#xD;
           in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis have been reported to be 10%-59% and 0.2%-6.2%,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HCV-related morbidities and mortality remain the major disease burden in the ESRD&#xD;
           population. Uremic patients with HCV infection are associated with higher risk of excess&#xD;
           risk of cardiovascular disease, hospitalization, worse quality of life, and mortality,&#xD;
           and have more profound anemia compared to those without HCV infection..&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imperatively, uremic patients remain at high risk of HCV new- or re-infection in the&#xD;
           hemodialysis units.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigators have performed a surveillance for prevalence of viral hepatitis in a&#xD;
           collaborative group of Nephrologists and Hepatologists, the FORMOSA-LIKE group, which&#xD;
           showed that the proportion of anti-HCV seropositivity in uremic patients is 15-19 % with&#xD;
           the viremic rate of ~75% in Southern Taiwan in 2012. However, the update seroprevalence&#xD;
           and disease severity of HCV infection among the uremic patients in the era of DAA in&#xD;
           Taiwan is unknown. The current study aims to fully execute the surveillance program&#xD;
           among the uremic population&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Participants with HCV infection will be directly linked to medical care without gap. The&#xD;
           concept of micro-elimination in the high risk environment would help to facilitate WHO&#xD;
           goal of HCV elimination by 2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Understanding the potential drug-drug interaction (DDI) between directly acting&#xD;
           antivirals (DAA) and co-medications for co-morbidities among uremic patients under&#xD;
           maintenance hemodialysis would be helpful for decision-making when linking to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comprehensive surveillance and link-to-care among hemodialysis units might have great&#xD;
           impact on the improvement of both liver-related (biochemical and virological responses,&#xD;
           and hepatic fibrosis regression) and non-liver related outcomes (monthly erythropoietin&#xD;
           requirement and quality of life), and the transfer rate of clean zoning among&#xD;
           HCV-viremic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All uremic participants will be tested for anti-HCV antibody. HCV virology including viral&#xD;
      loads (and genotypes if RNA seropositivity) will be further tested in patients with anti-HCV&#xD;
      seropositivity. All infected subjects will be evaluated for the liver fibrosis by&#xD;
      non-invasive methods including fibroscan, FIB-4 and APRI and Serum WFA(+) -M2BP. All&#xD;
      participants with chronic hepatitis C infection will be directly referred to the&#xD;
      collaborative Hepatology Departments in one medical center and 5 regional core hospitals for&#xD;
      HCV treatment. The outcome of HCV-related diseases, in terms of proportion of HCV&#xD;
      micro-elimination in HD facilities, liver-related outcomes (biochemistry improvement [ ALT&#xD;
      and AFP decline], sustained virological response rate, and hepatic fibrosis regression) and&#xD;
      non-liver related outcomes [monthly erythropoietin requirement, and quality of life [SF36,&#xD;
      HCV-CLDQ] ) will be evaluated 2 years after executing link-to-care strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 1: Universal screen, confirmative determination of HCV viremia, genotyping and disease&#xD;
      staging, education and link-to-care for HCV treatment in FORMOSA-LIKE collaborative alliances&#xD;
      Year 2,3: Re-evaluate liver and non-liver related outcomes, and rate of HCV clean zoning&#xD;
      among hemodialysis units.&#xD;
