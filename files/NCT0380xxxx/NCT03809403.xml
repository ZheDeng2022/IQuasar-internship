  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colectomy is the most commonly used therapeutic approach for the treatment of non-metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. This approach is generally very effective however the rate of recurrence&#xD;
      and the appearance of metachronous metastasis remains a major problem in the postoperative&#xD;
      period. One of the hypothesis that can explain this tumor progression is the dissemination of&#xD;
      tumor cells at the time of tumor mobilization. In this work, we wish to verify this&#xD;
      hypothesis by comparing two surgical technics used in our department for left or right&#xD;
      colectomies: respectively either first section of the mesenteric vessels followed by the&#xD;
      mobilization of the tumor or first mobilization of the tumor followed by the section of the&#xD;
      mesenteric vessels. To evaluate the dissemination, we will study two disseminations markers&#xD;
      that have shown their prognostic value: i) circulating tumor cells (which represent a direct&#xD;
      marker of dissemination) and ii) tumor circulating DNA (which is an indirect marker) but has&#xD;
      the advantage of being more representative of all tumor clones and therefore the tumor burden&#xD;
      released into the blood at the time of surgery).&#xD;

      A / Epidemiology of colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer remains the third most common cancer in France in 2017 with an incidence of&#xD;
      about 44,000 new cases in 2017 and nearly 18,000 deaths each year. The ColoRectal Cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) ranks second among cancer deaths behind lung cancer and breast cancer. Thanks to&#xD;
      diagnostic and therapeutic progress, the mortality rate decrease of 1.5% in men and 1.1% in&#xD;
      women between 2005 and 2012.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these numbers, colorectal cancer has a good prognosis when diagnosed at an early&#xD;
      stage. In fact, the 5-year relative survival is 91% for localized stages (stage I and II) and&#xD;
      70% for stages with locoregional and lymph nodes invasion (stage III). On the other hand,&#xD;
      about 25% of the patients at the time of diagnosis have metastasis (stage IV), with a&#xD;
      survival at 5 years of 11%. Those data explain that the mortality of this cancer is mainly&#xD;
      due to the spread of the primary tumor to secondary locations, mainly liver or lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unstable microsatellite phenotype (ISM) is an important colonic carcinogenesis pathway,&#xD;
      find in approximately 15% of operable colorectal cancers (CRC) and may be of sporadic or&#xD;
      hereditary origin. Several studies have shown that patients with MSI tumors have a better&#xD;
      prognosis than patients with stable microsatellite tumors (SSM) due to a better response to&#xD;
      platinum-based chemotherapy. The determination of this status therefore determines the&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment of CRC and is determined in anatomopathology on the analysis of the&#xD;
      operative specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B / The place of surgery in the care of the CCR:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the (tumor node metastasis (TNM) classification is used to establish therapeutic&#xD;
      management. Stages I are treated by surgery alone. Stages II are treated by surgery alone in&#xD;
      the absence of risk factors for recurrence and with adjuvant chemotherapy if not. Stages III&#xD;
      are treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy within 8 weeks and for 6 months. For the&#xD;
      stages IV (metastatic), the management of those patients is discussed on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
      according to the symptomatic or non-symptomatic nature of the primary tumor and the&#xD;
      resectability or non-resectability of the metastasis. If there is no contraindication, most&#xD;
      of these patients are treated with first-line chemotherapy, then reassessed every 2 to 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C / Surgical technic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical treatment depends on tumor localisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a tumor located on the right colon, from the caecum to the middle of the&#xD;
      transverse colon, a right colectomy is performed associated with lymph node dissection along&#xD;
      the superior mesenteric vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a tumor located on the left colon, from the middle of the transverse colon to&#xD;
      the rectum, a left colectomy is performed with a dissection centered on the inferior&#xD;
      mesenteric artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In current practice, there are different surgical technics for both types of left and right&#xD;
      colectomies. One of the main differences between those technics is the section of vessels&#xD;
      (superior or inferior mesenteric vessels):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The so-called &quot;no touch&quot; technic involves a ligation of the mesenteric vessels before any&#xD;
      tumor mobilization. This technic is the one used systematically at Saint Antoine Hospital for&#xD;
      left colectomy because of the easy dissection of the inferior mesenteric artery and vein in&#xD;
      the absence of mobilization of the left colon, those vessels being at a distance from other&#xD;
      elements (the left ureter is visualized before the ligation of the inferior mesenteric&#xD;
      artery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An other technic is to first mobilize the tumor to have an optimal exposure of the vessels&#xD;
      before the ligation. This technic is the one routinely performed at Saint Antoine Hospital&#xD;
      for the right colectomies because of the anatomy of the ileocolic artery and the right colic&#xD;
      artery at the origin of which is performed the lymphadenectomy. Indeed the complete&#xD;
      mobilization of the right colon allows a section of the adhesions between the right mesocolon&#xD;
      (which contains the colonic vessels) and the duodenum and the right ureter. In this way, the&#xD;
      section of the right colic vessels can be made at the origin with good control of adjacent&#xD;
      structures. Moreover, the lymph node dissection is systematically performed by laparotomy:&#xD;
      indeed even for colectomies performed under laparoscopy it is necessary to make a&#xD;
      mini-laparotomy incision in order to extract the operative piece and to perform the&#xD;
      anastomosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no difference has been demonstrated in terms of survival without recurrence and&#xD;
      overall survival between those different technics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the choice of the approach, laparoscopic or by laparotomy, depends on the&#xD;
      comorbidities of the patient, severe respiratory failure may be a contraindication to&#xD;
      laparotomy and its history: one or more previous surgeries by laparotomy is considered as a&#xD;
      contraindication to laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D / Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) in colorectal cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the metastatic extension factors of colorectal tumors treated at a localized stage&#xD;
      (stage II and III) is the dissemination of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells&#xD;
      in the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells witch migrate into the blood and lymphatic vessels from a tumor (primary or&#xD;
      metastasis) are called circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Some of these have a tumor inducing&#xD;
      potential (responsible for relapses) or the ability to form metastasis with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in molecular biology technologies (high-throughput sequencing and digital polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR), for example) have made possible to consider the exploration of&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA, which is present in small quantities in plasma. The amount of ctDNA is&#xD;
      proportional to the tumor burden. Thus the mutations of the tumor's DNA (or somatic&#xD;
      mutations) can be identified from the ctDNA, the mutations having a theranostic impact on the&#xD;
      KRAS, NRAS and BRAF genes could be identified in the ctDNA of patients presenting colorectal&#xD;
      cancers. These mutations can thus serve as tracers, the amount of tumor DNA can also be&#xD;
      monitored and DNA methylation tests can also be specific for the tumor DNA. The presence of&#xD;
      these molecular abnormalities can therefore be used to detect CTCs and ctDNA in these&#xD;
      patients. Several studies, initially conducted in the context of breast cancer,have shown the&#xD;
      interest of these two parameters in the monitoring and follow-up of patients with CRC: indeed&#xD;
      their short half-life of a few minutes to a few hours allows a follow-up in real time their&#xD;
      kinetics in the peripheral blood, making it a predictor of earlier relapse than commonly&#xD;
      measured tumor markers (ACE and CA 19-9). In addition, their presence is associated with a&#xD;
      significant decrease in recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Studies in colorectal&#xD;
      cancer show similar results to those shown for breast cancer: In the retrospective study of&#xD;
      Linuma et al, multivariate analysis for relapse-free survival (SSR) and overall survival (SG)&#xD;
      found that patients with CTC expression and positive ctDNA had a worse prognosis than the&#xD;
      others: SG (hazard ratio [HR], 3.84, 95% CI, 2.41 to 6.22, P .001) and SSR ( HR, 3.02, 95%&#xD;
      CI, 1.83 to 5.00, P .001). These results are found in the prospective study by Roder et al,&#xD;
      where the detection of CTC in operated patients with colon cancer is associated with 5-year&#xD;
      Overall survival (OS)of 68% against 85% in patients without CTC detectable. In multivariate&#xD;
      analysis, the results are similar with a significant difference on SG (HR1.94, 95% CI&#xD;
      1.0-3.7, p = 0.04) and SSR (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.1-3.7, p = 0.044).&#xD;
&#xD;
      E / Determination of microsatellite instability (MSI) status on ctDNA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with MSI tumors have a better prognosis than microsatellite stability (MSS) patients&#xD;
      and have different sensitivities to chemotherapy. The MSI status is currently determined on&#xD;
      the operative specimen in pathology by determining the expression of the MLH1-MSH2-MSH6 and&#xD;
      PMS2 proteins by immunohistochemistry and by a molecular test determining the instability of&#xD;
      microsatellite markers. The determination of the MSI status on the ctDNA is not carried out&#xD;
      in current practice but raises several questions: is it systematically detectable on the&#xD;
      ctDNA found on peripheral blood when this phenotype is present? Are the ctDNA levels&#xD;
      comparable according to the MSI and MSS status?&#xD;
&#xD;
      F / Influence of the surgical technic on the amount of ctDNA:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to limit the metastatic spread of CRC, studies have evaluated standard surgical&#xD;
      technics, particularly in order to limit the release of ctDNA or CTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have compared laparoscopy versus laparotomy on the level of ctDNA and intraoperative&#xD;
      CTC in portal and peripheral blood. The results showed a significant decrease in the overall&#xD;
      cDNA level in laparoscopic patients. The randomized prospective study of Wind et al reports&#xD;
      CTC levels in the laparotomy and laparoscopic groups, respectively 44% vs. 5%. 9% (p = 0.046)&#xD;
      in portal blood after mobilization of the tumor. And after resection of the tumor&#xD;
      respectively 29% vs. 20% (p = 0.590) in the portal blood. One of the hypothesis of the&#xD;
      authors to explain this difference is that laparoscopic tumor mobilization is significantly&#xD;
      less important than the one performed during laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis led to the principle of the &quot;no touch&quot; technic: to achieve the minimum of&#xD;
      intraoperative tumor mobilization with an early ligation of mesenteric vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few low-level studies have compared ADNct and CTC levels in perioperative peripheral blood&#xD;
      comparing the &quot;no touch&quot; technic with those that mobilize the tumor first. The results show a&#xD;
      tendency to decrease the rates of both markers in the no-touch technic. In the prospective&#xD;
      study by Hayashi et al, 8 out of 11 patients (73%) operated according to the &quot;mobilization&#xD;
      first&quot; technique had detectable CTCs in portal and postoperative portal blood samples whereas&#xD;
      only 1 patient (14%) from the &quot;no touch&quot; group was detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G / Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this work is to compare the amount of ctDNA and CTC in the peripheral blood&#xD;
      at D-1, D1 and D3 after colectomy for localized adenocarcinoma using the surgical &quot;no touch&quot;&#xD;
      technic against mobilization first and to determine the MSI status on ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard procedure for hospitalization for patients requiring colectomy for CCR is as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A preoperative consultation with the surgeon and one with the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization the day before the intervention with visit of the surgeon and the&#xD;
           anesthesiologist, blood sample of a complete preoperative assessment (D-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention (D0): right or left colectomy depending on tumor localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systematic blood test after surgery on D1, D3: samples of 4ml tubes for blood count&#xD;
           determination, blood Ionogram and assay of C-reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Release on D4 depending on the clinical condition and the results of the blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An information note is given to the subject the day before the intervention and a&#xD;
           written statement is collected before the J-1 levy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the blood samples taken as part of the treatment, an additional volume is&#xD;
           collected 2 samples of 6mL at D-1 then at D1 and D3 to measure the levels of circulating&#xD;
           tumor cells and tumor circulating DNA by PCR and the MSI status. There is no blood&#xD;
           sample added by the research, the tubes are thus collected at the same time as the&#xD;
           standard blood samples of usual perioperative follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D / ctDNA Extraction, Molecular Tests, and CTC Detection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extraction of complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) will be performed with an&#xD;
      extraction automaton (MaxwellTM) from 6 ml of plasma obtained from the blood sample. The cDNA&#xD;
      obtained will be quantified by fluorimetry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).&#xD;
      Molecular analyzes will be performed by high-throughput sequencing on targets of interest in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and supplemented with digital PCR targeting mutations previously identified&#xD;
      by sequencing the primary tumor (from the operative specimen). A set up of DNA methylation&#xD;
      tests can also be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the rarity of CTCs, it is necessary to proceed in two steps: i) enrichment followed&#xD;
      ii) ScreenCell® detection is a non-invasive technique that allows to enrich from the&#xD;
      peripheral blood a cell fraction containing circulating cells The ScreenCell® Molecular&#xD;
      Biology (MB) kit then makes it possible to carry out molecular analyzes such as PCRs in order&#xD;
      to sequence the gene of interest. This ScreenCell® MB kit allows DNAse free filtration.&#xD;
      Before filtration, 6 ml of blood are diluted in 1 ml of the buffer provided. Two minutes&#xD;
      after 1.6 ml of the culture medium adapted to the blood cells studied. After filtration, the&#xD;
      kit allows extraction of RNA directly from isolated cells in the filter. An adequate volume&#xD;
      of the lysis buffer is added directly to the filter capsule (closed in an eppendorf) to&#xD;
      extract RNA from the isolated cells in the filter. After centrifugation, the genetic material&#xD;
      will be analyzed. For this, a reverse transcriptase will be performed in order to obtain the&#xD;
      cDNA of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes will be performed to compare tumor cell and circulating DNA levels&#xD;
      according to non parametric Fisher or chi² tests. A value of p &lt;0.005 is considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
