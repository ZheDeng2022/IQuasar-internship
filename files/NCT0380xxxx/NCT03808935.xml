    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether a low dose of CBD+THC will decrease the&#xD;
      frequency of convulsive seizures in adults with drug-resistant epilepsy, when used in&#xD;
      addition to standard anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). This study will also study the genes&#xD;
      associated with epilepsy and whether different epileptic syndromes respond to treatment with&#xD;
      CBD+THC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the two major compounds&#xD;
      found in the cannabis plant. Reports from patients, families, and the scientific community&#xD;
      suggest that CBD (when used as an add-on therapy) decreases the number of convulsive seizures&#xD;
      in children and adults with Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Tuberous sclerosis&#xD;
      complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design: Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial,&#xD;
      followed by an open phase where treatment allocation will be revealed and all participants&#xD;
      will either continue or begin receiving the active study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Adults (18 years of age and older) with drug-resistant epilepsy, including&#xD;
      patients with Dravet and Lennox Gastaut syndromes, and patients with frequent convulsive&#xD;
      seizures (e.g., tonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, drop attacks, and focal motor seizures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Capsules containing a ratio of 16 CBD: 1 THC oil at a maximum total daily dose&#xD;
      of approximately 300 mg of CBD per day, divided into equal doses in the morning and evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: Placebo capsules containing high-oleic sunflower oil and no active or medicinal&#xD;
      ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Frequency of seizures; side effects; blood levels of AEDs, CBD, THC, and liver&#xD;
      enzymes; impact on cognition and quality of life; genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A total of 80 participants (40 assigned to treatment and 40 to control group)&#xD;
      recruited from Toronto Western Hospital in Toronto, and University Hospital in London,&#xD;
      Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time: Each participant will be enrolled for approximately 16 to 18 weeks, while the clinical&#xD;
      trial is expected to take place over a period of two years.&#xD;
