    <textblock>
      World Health Organization report notifies of the escalating global burden of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD), projecting that it will become the major worldwide cause of death and&#xD;
      disability by 2020. The South Asian countries have the highest rates of CVD globally. It is&#xD;
      widely acknowledged that South Asians have 40-60% higher risk of CVD linked to mortality,&#xD;
      compared with other populations. Multiple human population studies have established the&#xD;
      concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as an independent, inverse&#xD;
      predictor of the risk of having a cardiovascular event. Furthermore, HDLs have several&#xD;
      well-documented functions with the potential to protect against cardiovascular disease. This&#xD;
      study trial is designed to find out the role of alternative medicine such as functional food&#xD;
      to improve the dyslipidemia and particularly increase the levels of HDL in general&#xD;
      population. We expect that the use of Ajwa dates will significantly enhance the level of HDL&#xD;
      and reduce cardiovascular events in general population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall lipid profile is important in cardiovascular diseases but particularly serum HDL&#xD;
      levels have long been recognized as an independent inverse prognostic marker of CVD, when the&#xD;
      Framigham study, in 1980s showed that HDL below 40-60mg/dl is of prognostic relevance. A rise&#xD;
      of 1mg/dl in HDL levels is considered to reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) risk to 2-3%.&#xD;
      Even patients with elevated total cholesterol (TC) and LDL, presenting a high HDL are seen to&#xD;
      be protected from atherosclerosis. Multiple human population studies have shown the&#xD;
      concentration of HDL cholesterol as an independent, inverse predictor of the risk of having a&#xD;
      cardiovascular event. Additionally, HDL has several well-documented functions with the&#xD;
      potential to protect against cardiovascular diseases. These include an ability to promote the&#xD;
      efflux of cholesterol from macrophages in the artery wall, inhibit the oxidative modification&#xD;
      of LDL, inhibit vascular inflammation, inhibit thrombosis, promote endothelial repair,&#xD;
      promote angiogenesis, anti-oxidant, enhance endothelial function, improve diabetic control,&#xD;
      and inhibit hematopoietic stem cell proliferation. HDL also exerts direct cardio protective&#xD;
      effect, which are mediated with its interactions with the myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have emphasised the high incidence of CVD within the South Asian countries.&#xD;
      The increased risk of cardiovascular events in South Asians at a younger age might be due to&#xD;
      unknown factors affecting plaque rupture, the interaction between prothrombotic factors and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, or may be due to any undiscovered risk factors. Urbanisation and&#xD;
      westernisation is characterised by a distinct increase in the intake of energy dense foods, a&#xD;
      decrease in physical activity, and a heightened level of psychosocial stress, all of which&#xD;
      promote the development of hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. Most common&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia in South Asians is low HDL-C and high triglycerides. High triglyceride and low&#xD;
      HDL-C levels are metabolically interlinked. This metabolic phenotype is also associated with&#xD;
      increased levels of small LDL particles despite relatively normal levels of LDL-C among South&#xD;
      Asians. This clinical syndrome is accompanied by insulin resistance, a condition frequently&#xD;
      referred to as atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is a common metabolic derangement among Asian.&#xD;
      South Asians not only have lower HDL levels but also have a higher concentration of small,&#xD;
      less-protective HDL particles. One proposed mechanism is presence of dysfunctional HDL&#xD;
      particles. Another potential explanation for the apparent blunted cardioprotection of HDL in&#xD;
      South Asians might be related to HDL particle size. Small particles might be less efficient&#xD;
      in reverse cholesterol transport. In general, HDL particle size tends to be lower in patients&#xD;
      with CHD and those with low HDL-C levels . Alarmingly, an estimated 60-80% of Pakistani&#xD;
      population has been reported to have low HDL. There are a number of non-pharmacological and&#xD;
      pharmacological recommendations for management of low HDL. Non-pharmacological (functional&#xD;
      food) strategies are reported to increase HDL levels around 10-15% and which include regular&#xD;
      exercise , body weight reduction in obese individuals , cessation of cigarette smoking in&#xD;
      smokers and dietary modifications like decrease intake of saturated trans-fatty acids with&#xD;
      increase intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids . There are also a number of&#xD;
      pharmacological agents being considered as therapeutic options but the tolerability and&#xD;
      safety issues limit their use in addition to limited success in improving HDL. Therefore, the&#xD;
      focus of research now days had been toward the use of functional food which can play&#xD;
      significant role in cardiac protection. Ajwa dates have been recognized to contain the&#xD;
      nutritional and medicinal properties. These are a rich source of nutrition, containing&#xD;
      sugars, proteins, vitamins, high dietary fibres, minerals and fats, various phytochemicals&#xD;
      like sterols, polyphenols, flavonoids and glycosides. Ajwa fruit is gifted by nature and is&#xD;
      enriched with polyphenols and can act as a protective agent against many diseases. Various&#xD;
      studies have been conducted to investigate the presence of different polyphenols in Ajwa.&#xD;
      Different researchers have determined different phenolic components&#xD;

The AKU faculty and staff will be invited to MDL lab for screening and initial baseline, enrolled participant will be informed for inclusion in the research on the basis of our criteria of HDL levels. Written informed consent (a copy will also be provided to the participant) will be taken from each individual. A questionnaire regarding their diet and life style will be filled. Following vitals will be measured body weight, height and blood pressure. Blood sample will be taken for lipid profile (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides). Total period for each participant will be 6 weeks for interventions. In Ajwa Dates group, number of interaction will be 5 days a week for 6 weeks (30 doses will be provided).</intervention_model_description>
