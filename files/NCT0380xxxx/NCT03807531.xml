  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the Temporary Spur&#xD;
      Stent System (TSS). The TSS is intended for use in conjunction with a commercially available&#xD;
      drug coated balloon in the infrapopliteal arteries for the treatment of de novo or restenotic&#xD;
      lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, single arm trial, with sites in New&#xD;
      Zealand, Germany, and Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two and no more than 10 sites are expected to participate, with 100 subjects&#xD;
      enrolled (no more than 40 at a single site).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study follow up will take place over a period of 365 days. A vessel recoil substudy will&#xD;
      be included for a select group of subjects.&#xD;

      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the performance and safety of the Temporary&#xD;
      Spur Stent System (TSS) for subjects with infrapopliteal arterial disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Temporary Spur Stent System is intended for use in conjunction with a commercially&#xD;
      available drug coated balloon in the infrapopliteal arteries for the treatment of de novo or&#xD;
      restenotic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TSS has been developed to provide another treatment option for patients with Peripheral&#xD;
      Arterial Disease (PAD), and Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 100 subjects will be treated with the Temporary Spur Stent System in conjunction with&#xD;
      an approved Drug Coated Balloon (DCB). No less than 1 subject and no more than 40 subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled at a single site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vessel recoil substudy is included in the trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      vessel recoil in a select group of subjects (no more than 10 per site, up to 35 subjects in&#xD;
      total). This will be conducted by obtaining measurements using Optical Coherence Tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS), or Quantitative Vascular Analysis (QVA) of the target&#xD;
      vessel during the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis for this trial will use as a comparator a performance goal derived&#xD;
      from a meta-analysis of infrapopliteal balloon angioplasty. Descriptive statistics may be&#xD;
      used to describe other data points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to participate in a baseline evaluation visit, the index procedure, a&#xD;
      30 day follow up visit, a 90 day follow up visit, a 180 day follow up visit, and a 365 day&#xD;
      follow up visit. The baseline evaluation and index procedure visits may be combined. At each&#xD;
      follow up visit, the subject will undergo a physical exam with wound evaluation (if&#xD;
      applicable) including pictures, a medication history and compliance review, Ankle Brachial&#xD;
      and Toe Brachial Indices (ABI and TBI), a duplex ultrasound of the treated limb, review of&#xD;
      symptoms, and Adverse Events (AE) assessment. Subjects may choose to withdraw from the study&#xD;
      at any time, for any reason. If subjects choose to withdraw, they will be asked to undergo an&#xD;
      unscheduled study visit consisting of the aforementioned procedures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3, 6, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The second secondary efficacy measurement is decrease in Rutherford class score at 3, 6 and 12 months. Rutherford score is a classification system for patients with peripheral vascular disease.&#xD;
Categories are numbered from 0 to 6, with 0 being asymptomatic, and 6 being major tissue loss, functional foot no longer salvageable. Higher values are therefore considered a worse outcome.&#xD;
Rutherford class zero: No symptoms; Rutherford class 1: Mild Claudication (minimal leg pain with ambulation) symptoms; Rutherford Class 2: Moderate Claudication (moderate leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 3: Severe claudication (severe leg pain with ambulation); Rutherford Class 4: Ischemic Rest pain (leg pain at rest); Rutherford Class 5: Minor tissue loss (nonhealing ulcer, focal gangrene, diffuse pedal ischemia); Rutherford class 6: Major tissue loss (extending above the transmetatarsal TM level, functional foot no longer salvageable.</description>

    <description>The third secondary efficacy endpoint is wound healing for subjects with Rutherford class 5 at 6 and 12 months, as assessed by the investigator using WIfI score and descriptive characteristics, including change in wound size measured by any decrease in wound surface area.&#xD;
The WIfI classification scoring system is a grading system using a composite score of wound (W), ischemia (I), and foot infection (fi). These three different categories are graded from 0 to 3 with 0 being the best and 3 being the worst.&#xD;
The total score will be provided (clinical stage 1-5), which is used to estimate the risk for major amputation at one year. Patients with a score of 1 are considered low risk, and patients with a score of 5 are considered high risk (foot not salvageable). Therefore, higher values are considered a worse outcome.&#xD;
The composite score is calculated by adding up the score from each category.</description>

&#xD;
          5. Stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesions located in the infrapopliteal vessels, with&#xD;
             target lesion that can be successfully crossed with a guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Target lesion must meet lesion-specific criteria in pre-screening by angiography&#xD;
             (pre-screening with CTA, MRA or selective angiography may be performed prior to the&#xD;
             index procedure)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Target vessel(s) reconstitutes(s) at or above the medial malleolus, with the target&#xD;
             treated segment extending no more than 10 mm beyond the medial malleolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If the anterior tibial or posterior tibial arteries are treated, there must be&#xD;
             inline flow to the foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If the peroneal artery is treated, there must be at least one collateral supplying the&#xD;
             foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Target lesion must begin no higher than the tibioperoneal trifurcation (popliteal&#xD;
             arteries excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Target vessel reference diameter is measured to be between 2.0 mm to 4.5 mm in&#xD;
             diameter, assessed by one of the following methods after successful completion of&#xD;
             guidewire crossing of the lesion site:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Quantitative Vascular Angiography (QVA).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Lesion length must be &gt; 30 mm and &lt; 150 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Only one limb may be enrolled per subject. Up to two vessels may be treated per&#xD;
             subject; if required, a second modality may be used for treatment in the non-target&#xD;
             infrapopliteal vessel. Any treatment of the non-index vessel must be performed prior&#xD;
             to the use of the investigative device and only one artery may be treated with the&#xD;
             investigative device&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The total treated segment is defined as the total length of artery treated with the&#xD;
             investigational device. Target treatment length is &lt;240 mm with a maximum segment of&#xD;
             150 mm separated by 30 mm of healthy tissue between treated lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Successful pre-dilatation of the target lesion as outlined in the procedure&#xD;
             instructions, defined as resulting in stenosis &lt;50%, without resulting flow limiting&#xD;
             dissection (Type D or greater), thrombus, or aneurysm by angiography prior to the&#xD;
             insertion of the investigative device.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Iliac, SFA and popliteal inflow lesions can be treated using standard angioplasty&#xD;
             and/or an approved stent (no atherectomy) during the index procedure or &gt;30 days&#xD;
             prior. Inflow lesions treated intraprocedure must be treated first, prior to&#xD;
             consideration of treatment of infrapopliteal lesions. If pre-screening with&#xD;
             angiography, CTA, MRA, or ultrasound has been performed &lt;365 days prior to the&#xD;
             procedure, intra-procedure angiography of the aorto-iliac vasculature is not required,&#xD;
             however, the infrainguinal inflow must still be imaged using angiography during the&#xD;
             index procedure. Inflow lesions must have a healthy vessel segment of &gt;30 mm between&#xD;
             the study lesion and the treated segment, defined as less than 50% stenosis without&#xD;
             aneurysmal segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Retrograde access (in the infrapopliteal arteries) is permitted for lesion crossing,&#xD;
             however, the Temporary Spur Stent System must be deployed from antegrade access&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. For subjects with bilateral disease, planned treatment of the contralateral limb must&#xD;
             either be performed &gt;30 days prior to the index procedure or &gt; 14 days following the&#xD;
             index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject unwilling or unlikely to comply with the appropriate follow up time for the&#xD;
             duration of the study in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the trial.&#xD;
