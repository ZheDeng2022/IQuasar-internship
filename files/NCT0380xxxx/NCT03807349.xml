    <measure>Radiographic Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (RUSH)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographic fracture healing as seen on x-ray and defined using Radiographic Union Score for Hips (RUSH) scoring system. The RUSH quantifies four measures of healing: cortical bridging, cortical fracture disappearance, trabecular consolidation, and trabecular fracture disappearance. Cortical healing is assessed in four anatomic femoral neck regions (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral) and trabecular healing is measured with two assessments (fracture line disappearance and consolidation of matrix). Each of the 10 assessed dimensions of radiographic femoral neck healing are scored 1 to 3, leading to a minimum score of 10 (no signs of healing) and a maximum score of 30 (perfect healing).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (Steinberg Classification)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Steinberg Classification is based on the radiographic appearance and location of lesion. It is concise and delineates the progression and extent of Avascular Necrosis (AVN) involvement more accurately.&#xD;
[stage 0:] normal or non-diagnostic radiographs, MRI and bone scan of at risk hip (often contralateral hip involved, or patient has risk factors and hip pain) [stage I:] normal radiograph, abnormal bone scan and/or MRI [stage II:] cystic and sclerotic radiographic changes [stage III:] subchondral lucency or crescent sign [stage IV:] flattening of femoral head, with depression graded into mild: &lt;2 mm moderate: 2-4 mm severe: &gt;4 mm [stage V:] joint space narrowing with or without acetabular involvement [stage VI]: advanced degenerative changes</description>

    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (FIX-IT)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Function IndeX for Trauma (FIX-IT) score is an assessment tool for patients with lower extremity fractures, incorporating pain and the ability to weight-bear. The score utilizes two questions to assess the ability to bear weight and two questions to assess pain at the fracture site. The maximum subtotal for each set of questions is 6 points, yielding a maximum overall score of 12 points and a minimum score (lowest weight bearing and highest pain) of 0 points.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) is a five dimensional self-assessment that is comprised of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. These five dimensions can be used to index a subject's health utility on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 is death and 1 is perfect health. The scoring rule for EQ-5D permits scores less than 0, implying that some health states may be worse than death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (Harris Hip)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using Harris Hip Score. This is quantified on a scale of 0-100 and the domains covered are pain, function, absence of deformity, and range of motion. The score is quantified on a scale of 0-100, with 100 points being the best possible outcome. The domains cover pain (1 item, 0-44 points), function (7 items, 0-47 points), absence of deformity (1 item, 4 points), and range of motion (2 items, 5 points).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Fracture Healing of the Intracapsular Femur (Timed Up-and-Go)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the Timed 'Up-and-Go' Test. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.This test is used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. Scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11-20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. A score of 30 seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls.</description>
