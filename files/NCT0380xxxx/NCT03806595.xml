  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headaches in children are very common and are a source of significant distress for the&#xD;
      patient and their family. Migraines are the most common headache disorder in children and are&#xD;
      associated with episodic pain and other symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light and&#xD;
      sound that can impair a child's ability to participate in daily activities and lead to missed&#xD;
      school or parental missed work. When home treatment fails to relieve symptoms, children often&#xD;
      seek care in the emergency department (ED) where a limited number of treatment options exist;&#xD;
      while largely effective, these rescue treatments currently all require needle insertion of an&#xD;
      intravenous line, take time to administer, result in prolonged ED stays, and have potential&#xD;
      unpleasant side effects. In adult patients, a number of studies suggest that lidocaine, a&#xD;
      local anesthetic administered intranasally, may provide relief of migraine and migraine-like&#xD;
      headache pain in minutes. This approach has the benefit of working quickly, not requiring a&#xD;
      needle, and having fewer side effects as the medication acts locally on nerves in the nose.&#xD;
      Intranasal lidocaine has not yet been studied in children for this purpose. This study will&#xD;
      compare the use of intranasal lidocaine to placebo. The goal of this pilot study is to&#xD;
      provide information to inform the sample size calculation for the definitive randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that will aim to measure the efficacy of intranasal lidocaine as an&#xD;
      analgesic option for children age 7 years and older who present to the Pediatric ED with a&#xD;
      chief complaint of migraine or post traumatic headache with migraine-like features. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives will be to report on the frequency and severity of rebound headache between the&#xD;
      two treatment groups, adverse events of the study drug, as well as the impact on healthcare&#xD;
      utilization measures.The investigators hypothesize that children receiving intranasal&#xD;
      lidocaine will have faster and more effective pain recovery compared to children receiving&#xD;
      placebo and will be less likely to require the standard therapy for migraine headache. Given&#xD;
      very few side effects reported in adult studies and the relatively benign nature of those&#xD;
      reported, the investigators do not expect any major safety concerns in the study. It is also&#xD;
      hypothesized that intranasal lidocaine will lead to shorter ED visits, thus reducing use of&#xD;
      staff and hospital resources and saving money for the healthcare system as a whole.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pain scores will be measured at 30 and 60 minutes post intranasal administration of either the study drug or placebo.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of subjects with numeric pain scores of &lt; 4 out of 10 on a verbal rating scale (range 0 -10 with increasing severity, i.e. 0 = no pain and 10 = most severe pain).Treatment success is defined as a score of 3 or less at the two time points. This will be recorded for each patient during the study timeframe, until study completion.</description>
