    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial looking at patient satisfaction with a 1-2 week&#xD;
      postoperative visit versus phone call after minimally invasive hysterectomy. Patients will be&#xD;
      screened, enrolled, consented, and randomized during the preoperative office encounter, which&#xD;
      usually takes place 30 days prior to their scheduled surgery. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      study group (1-2 week postoperative phone call) will be given a time and date when to expect&#xD;
      the postoperative phone call. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive a standard&#xD;
      postoperative visit appointment 7-21 days after surgery. Patients in both arms will receive&#xD;
      postoperative discharge instructions advising when to contact our office and when to present&#xD;
      to the emergency room with certain complaints. The patients in the study arm will have&#xD;
      instructions reinforcing that they will be contacted with a postoperative phone call instead&#xD;
      of a visit initially; however, patients in both arms will have a postoperative visit 6-8&#xD;
      weeks following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, patients randomized to the study arm will receive the phone call at 7-14 days&#xD;
      post-op. The physician performing the phone call will be a minimally invasive gynecology&#xD;
      fellow in our practice. The provider will use a script to review all of the typical review of&#xD;
      systems and pertinent postoperative functioning questions typically reviewed and documented&#xD;
      in our postoperative visit. They will also review the surgical pathology at this time. This&#xD;
      conversation will be documented in our electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the control arm will undergo typical office visit at 7-21 days postop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both arms will have postoperative office visits at 6-8 weeks postop, and will&#xD;
      complete a survey at that time. The survey is a modified version of the SCAHPS survey to&#xD;
      assess patient satisfaction with the surgical experience. There will also be some questions&#xD;
      about the patients' attitudes towards the number and timing of postoperative visits.&#xD;
