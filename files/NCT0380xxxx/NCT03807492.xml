  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EMPOWeR study is proposed as a cohort study with longitudinal follow-up to determine&#xD;
      rates of genetic mutations among men with or at-risk for prostate cancer to address the&#xD;
      various facets of genetic education and counseling for optimized genetic assessment and&#xD;
      wellness of men. The results will inform practice guidelines and future studies for maximal&#xD;
      impact of genetic evaluation of men for inherited prostate cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will undergo gene panel testing through a saliva or blood sample. A genetic test summary will be generated to give to participants at disclosure of results. Participants will receive genetic test results in person, by phone or via telehealth. Fisher's exact test will be used to determine association of mutations and variants to patient characteristics.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Any male &gt;18 years with prostate cancer is eligible. Furthermore, unaffected men at higher&#xD;
        risk for prostate cancer (family history of prostate cancer or African American males) are&#xD;
        also eligible for the study. Men will be approached by their providers or study staff&#xD;
        during their clinical appointments for participation. Emails or mailings may also be sent&#xD;
        to introduce the study to patients and to contact us for participation. Men who previously&#xD;
        participated in the Genetic Evaluation of Men (GEM) study (IRB#14S.546) will be offered&#xD;
        participation in EMPOWeR.&#xD;
