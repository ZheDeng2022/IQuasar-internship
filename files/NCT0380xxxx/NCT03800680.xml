      The research objective of this one-year study is to test whether an evidence-based, low-cost&#xD;
      mobile diabetes management package (DMP), with or without an incentive program grounded in&#xD;
      economic theory (M-POWER Rewards), can effectively and cost-effectively improve health&#xD;
      outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Technological and economic advancement have created a major challenge to public health&#xD;
      agencies in Singapore and other first world countries: the challenge being how to get&#xD;
      individuals to maintain a healthy lifestyle when that is no longer a requirement for economic&#xD;
      prosperity (and in fact may be a hindrance). What is required is a low cost strategy that&#xD;
      effectively manages risk factors for chronic disease without overwhelming the public&#xD;
      healthcare infrastructure. Although technology and economic advancement are clearly part of&#xD;
      the problem, they may also be part of the solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), lifestyle modification can be highly&#xD;
      effective at stemming the progression of the disease. Effective interventions include modules&#xD;
      that teach appropriate strategies for weight management, increased physical activity, better&#xD;
      diet, routine glucose monitoring, and strict compliance to prescribed diabetes medications.&#xD;
      These components can now be effectively delivered electronically. A recent review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 13 smartphone applications for diabetes management found that these&#xD;
      applications offered modest benefits, with a mean difference in HbA1c of -0.40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high costs involved in treating people with chronic conditions, employers,&#xD;
      insurers, and governments all have a financial incentive to contain the chronic disease&#xD;
      epidemic. Therefore, each has shown a willingness to invest in some level of prevention and&#xD;
      treatment efforts. It is our contention that contingent rewards may be necessary to help&#xD;
      people overcome their preferences for current over future consumption, often called present&#xD;
      bias. Behavioral economists recommend that, to overcome present bias, rewards should be tied&#xD;
      to both short-term and long-term outcomes or behaviors, such as monitoring blood glucose and&#xD;
      taking medications as prescribed (short term) and pre-defined outcomes such as achieving a&#xD;
      target HbA1c level over a specified duration (long term). Based on a recent systematic review&#xD;
      of incentive studies conducted by members of our team, an optimal rewards strategy has the&#xD;
      potential to greatly increase the effectiveness of existing mobile diabetes applications. If&#xD;
      shown to be effective and cost effective, the investigators also believe payers will&#xD;
      subsidize such a strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators propose to conduct a 52-week, three-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial to evaluate whether an evidence-based, low-cost mobile diabetes management package&#xD;
      (DMP), with or without an incentive program grounded in economic theory, can effectively and&#xD;
      cost-effectively improve outcomes for adults with diabetes. The control arm (Arm 1) will&#xD;
      receive usual care, whereas participants in the intervention arms will receive the DMP alone&#xD;
      (Arm 2) or the DMP with the M-POWER Rewards incentive program (Arm 3) in addition to their&#xD;
      usual care. The investigators hypothesize that participants in Arms 2 and 3 will show&#xD;
      improved glycemic control, as measured by HbA1c levels, at the Month 12 primary endpoint&#xD;
      compared to participants in the Arm 1 control group. The investigators also hypothesize that&#xD;
      Arm 3 will have improved HbA1c levels compared to Arm 2 at Month 12. Similar hypotheses will&#xD;
      be tested for secondary outcomes measured at Month 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators will quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of DMP with&#xD;
      M-POWER Rewards and the net cost implications of both from a third party payer's perspective.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that despite its higher implementation cost, effectiveness will&#xD;
      be greater and net cost will be lower for Arm 3 relative to the Arm 1 control group due to&#xD;
      the reduction in medical expenditures that result from improved glycaemic control.&#xD;
