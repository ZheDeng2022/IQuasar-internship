  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We would like to evaluate and optimize opioid prescribing after minimally invasive&#xD;
      hysterectomy. Currently, our standard prescribing is 150 oral morphine equivalents. However,&#xD;
      recent studies show that half of the opioids prescribed are not used. We would like to&#xD;
      include the patient in the decision making of the opioid prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have designed a randomized controlled trial to prescribe standard (150 oral morphine&#xD;
      equivalents) or patient directed (less than or equal to 150 oral morphine equivalents) for&#xD;
      pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that with patient input, there will be a higher utilization of the opioids&#xD;
      prescribed. Also, we anticipate a lower number of opioids used overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help us optimize opioid prescribe and evaluate whether patient input can help&#xD;
      in this important measure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an emphasis in patient centered care in medicine and part of this effort has&#xD;
      evaluated the success of shared decision making in the care of the patient. Currently, there&#xD;
      is strong research and clinical emphasis trying to determine how, as surgeons, we can assist&#xD;
      in minimizing the misuse of opioid medications. Several studies have shown significant&#xD;
      over-prescribing and under-utilizing of the pain medications that are prescribed to patients&#xD;
      after surgery. One such study by As-Sanie et al showed that about half of medications were&#xD;
      utilized for pain after surgery, with typically 200 oral morphine equivalents prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent prospective cohort study by Prabhu et al showed that shared decision making in the&#xD;
      prescription of narcotic pain medications after cesarean section decreased opioid use without&#xD;
      impacting patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of shared decision making in&#xD;
      the prescribing of pain medications after minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. For adult&#xD;
      female patients who are undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy, we will randomize them to&#xD;
      either standard care or patient directed treatment. Our standard arm will receive 150 oral&#xD;
      morphine equivalents, or 30 tablets of oxycodone, whereas our patient directed arm will&#xD;
      receive a prescription with as many pills is determined after discussion with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to contribute to identifying the optimized opioid prescription for post surgical&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
