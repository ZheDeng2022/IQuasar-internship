  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, single-center study of ADG106 in subjects&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or relapsed/ refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
      ADG106 is a fully human ligand-blocking, agonistic anti-CD137 IgG4 mAb. It binds to the&#xD;
      activated human T cells via a T cell receptor CD137. ADG106 administered intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      over a period of 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess safety and tolerability at increasing dose levels of single agent ADG106 in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors and/or non Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the recommended dosage and dosage regimen for further study. Secondary&#xD;
      Objectives To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ADG106. To evaluate the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of ADG106. To evaluate the potential anti-tumor effect of ADG106. To&#xD;
      investigate serum biomarkers related to immune regulation and cytokine releasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the potential biomarkers of ADG106.&#xD;
