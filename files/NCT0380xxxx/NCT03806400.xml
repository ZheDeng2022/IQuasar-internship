  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a major concern in paediatric inpatient surgery&#xD;
      and may increase patient discomfort, delay patient discharge, and increase the cost of&#xD;
      patient care. The incidence of PONV after strabismus surgery is relatively high, compared&#xD;
      with other inpatient surgeries, particularly in children. Oculocardiac reflex (OCR) is a&#xD;
      phenomenon defined by bradycardia or dysrhythmia during strabismus surgery. Oculocardiac&#xD;
      reflex is commonly caused by the traction on the extraocular muscle (EOM), which, through the&#xD;
      ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve, stimulates the vagal center. The afferent arm of the&#xD;
      reflex is the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the efferent arm is the vagus&#xD;
      nerve, which diminishes sinoatrial node impulses and leads to bradycardia.While there is a&#xD;
      general consensus regarding the role of unmodifiable risk factors for PONV, including the&#xD;
      number of muscle and the occurrence of Oculocardiac reflex or not, the role of modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors, such as duration of surgery and anesthesia and perioperatively administered&#xD;
      medications, is still disputed. In the present study, the investigators evaluated whether&#xD;
      these factors may be associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting after paediatric&#xD;
      strabismus surgery while controlling for a range of covariates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome was incidence of PONV that occurred within 3 days after the operation.&#xD;
      The investigators defined PONV as a presence of either nausea or vomiting. In study hospital,&#xD;
      it was routine for nurses to assess and record nausea and vomiting every 8 hours for all&#xD;
      postoperative patients during postoperative 3 days. Accordingly, the investigators&#xD;
      retrospectively collected the presence of PONV from electrical medical records. If patients&#xD;
      had discharged hospital within postoperative 3 days, the incidence of PONV was assessed&#xD;
      solely during hospital stay. The data, collected included information regarding age at&#xD;
      surgery, gender, and type of strabismus. During strabismus surgery, the number and sequence&#xD;
      of the operated muscles, HR before traction of the EOM (baseline HR), maximum decreased HR&#xD;
      after traction of the EOM, HR at maximum recovery from decreased HR and maintained during&#xD;
      traction of the EOM (adrenergic HR), and HR at the cutting of the muscle, were collected.&#xD;
      Oculocardiac reflex was defined as a decrease in HR greater than or equal to 20% rather than&#xD;
      maximum at first traction of the muscle.&#xD;
