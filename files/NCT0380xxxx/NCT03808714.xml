  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our preliminary data shows that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who resided in&#xD;
      rural Alabama smoke cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a combination of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive behavioral interventions are&#xD;
      efficacious in promoting smoking cessation across diverse populations, these evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for tobacco dependence have not proven to be effective/efficacious (or even&#xD;
      accessible) among some subpopulations suffering disproportionally from tobacco-related&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. The overall goal of this feasibility study is to make adaptations to&#xD;
      these evidence-based approaches, and develop, implement, and examine the feasibility and&#xD;
      scalability of a theory-based, culturally relevant smoking cessation intervention for young&#xD;
      adult AA men in rural Alabama who smoke cigarettes. Our formative assessments point to a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention delivered by a trained Community Health Worker with the&#xD;
      support from an &quot;expert&quot; physician who can deliver the pharmacological component via Skype&#xD;
      through an integrated approach. The proposed study will address the next three steps in this&#xD;
      process: development of the intervention, pretesting, and feasibility. First, we will develop&#xD;
      the intervention with input from a Community Advisory Committee, followed by an iterative&#xD;
      process by which the target audience will be exposed to materials and messages to provide&#xD;
      feedback (pretesting). Once all intervention components are finalized, we will recruit&#xD;
      participants, randomly assign them to intervention/control groups, pilot test, and evaluate&#xD;
      the intervention. The comparison group will be the Alabama Tobacco Quitline with 8 weeks of&#xD;
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be consistent with the pharmacological approach proposed for&#xD;
      the intervention. The primary outcome will be 7-day point prevalence abstinence (defined as&#xD;
      no cigarettes in the past 7 days and verified through measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide&#xD;
      levels) at 6-month follow-up. We will also conduct detailed treatment fidelity and&#xD;
      scalability assessments (acceptability, feasibility, potential reach and adoption, alignment&#xD;
      with the strategic context) to inform a full-scale efficacy trial.&#xD;

      Despite smoking fewer cigarettes daily, African American (AA) men suffer higher morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality associated with tobacco-related disorders than whites. Our preliminary data shows&#xD;
      that 39.9% of AA men between 19 and 30 years of age who resided in rural Alabama smoke&#xD;
      cigarettes. Although it has been well established that a combination of pharmacotherapy and&#xD;
      advice-oriented counseling and/or cognitive behavioral interventions are efficacious in&#xD;
      promoting smoking cessation across diverse populations, these evidence-based treatments for&#xD;
      tobacco dependence have not proven to be effective/efficacious (or even accessible) among&#xD;
