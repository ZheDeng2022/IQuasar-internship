    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind randomized controlled trial, aiming to evaluate the effects of vaginal&#xD;
      seeding on body mass index as well as allergy risk for cesarean-delivered infants. It will be&#xD;
      conducted in Liuyang city of China, and the targeted sample size is 106. All the eligible&#xD;
      pregnant women will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group, and&#xD;
      their babies of the participants will be followed up to 24 months of age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have suggested that caesarean-delivered children are at higher risks of&#xD;
      developing metabolic and allergic diseases like obesity and asthma, possibly because newborns&#xD;
      born by caesarean section were lack of exposure to maternal vaginal flora. It is needed to&#xD;
      explore a simple, convenient, and safe intervention strategy to reduce caesarean-related&#xD;
      risks. In a recent non-randomized study, the authors found that exposure of&#xD;
      caesarean-delivered newborns to maternal vaginal fluid at birth (i.e., vaginal seeding) could&#xD;
      partially restore the microbiota of them at 30 days after births, but the long-term health&#xD;
      consequences of restoring the microbiota of caesarean-delivered infants remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized study, the investigators aim to examine whether the changes in newborns'&#xD;
      microbiota will persist to 24 month of age, and whether vaginal seeding will have any effects&#xD;
      on body mass index and allergy risk from birth to 24 months of age. the investigators will&#xD;
      enroll a total of 106 pregnant women, and the participants' infants will be followed up at 0&#xD;
      (before hospital discharge), 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. At each follow-up visit, a&#xD;
      questionnaire survey including information on feeding, medication, and allergic status will&#xD;
      be conducted, infants' height and weight will be measured, and feces will be collected. At&#xD;
      18-month-old visit, infants' venous blood will be also collected for the assay of&#xD;
      multiallergen. The primary outcomes were body mass index and allergy risk index. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes included the microbiota profile, allergic symptoms and diseases,&#xD;
      overweight/obesity, and adverse effects.&#xD;

The gauze will be extracted prior to the C-section, kept in a sterile container in an incubator (37 ℃), and taken out from the incubator immediately before the swabbing. The infant will be swabbed with the gauze, starting from the lips, followed by the face, thorax, arms, legs, genitals and anal region, and finally the back. The swabbing will take around 15-20 seconds.</description>
