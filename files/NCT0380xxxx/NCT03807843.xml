  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and immunogenicity of an investigational chikungunya vaccine will be tested in&#xD;
      subjects with history of chikungunya infection. Initially 21 to 50 year old subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled; after favorable review of safety data, subjects aged 51 to 65 will be enrolled.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective randomized double-blind interventional clinical study. This study&#xD;
      proposes to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an investigational live recombinant&#xD;
      measles-vectored chikungunya vaccine (MV-CHIK) delivered in 2 vaccinations, 28 days apart&#xD;
      compared with saline placebo. After providing informed consent, individuals will be screened&#xD;
      for eligibility including verification of previous exposure to chikungunya virus. They will&#xD;
      then be randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either MV-CHIK or saline placebo in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. This study will be conducted in two Steps, first in up to 30 individuals ages 21&#xD;
      to 50. Then, pending a favorable review of the available vaccine safety data, in up to 30&#xD;
      individuals ages 51 to 65.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous infection with chikungunya as verified by a serum immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age appropriate for the Step being conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥21 to ≤50 years on the day of enrollment for Step 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. ≥51 to ≤65 years on the day of enrollment for Step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Available and accessible for the duration of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to comply with all requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential, willing to practice adequate contraception for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical history and physical examination findings are considered normal or not&#xD;
             clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator, which includes resolution&#xD;
             of any arthralgias that may have occurred during prior chikungunya infection, as well&#xD;
             as the absence of synovitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory values are considered normal or not clinically significant in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator. If laboratory screening tests are out of the normal reference&#xD;
             range and of potential clinical significance, the test(s) may be repeated up to 2&#xD;
             times (a total of 3 per screening evaluation) at the discretion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             and the repeat values and their potential clinical significance will be used to&#xD;
             determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of immunity to measles. For persons born after 1957, this will be established&#xD;
             by a history of compliance with vaccination policies that included measles vaccination&#xD;
             or known vaccination as an adult at least one month before they are randomized.&#xD;
             Volunteers born before 1957 will be presumed to have immunity to measles based on&#xD;
             natural exposure in accordance with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
             (CDC) guidelines [McLean 2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Taking medication or other treatment for unresolved symptoms attributed to a previous&#xD;
             chikungunya virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior receipt of any investigational chikungunya or other alphavirus vaccine. To date,&#xD;
             no alphavirus vaccines have been commercially available in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  self-limited upper respiratory infections until afebrile without medication for&#xD;
                  &gt;1 week;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  chikungunya unless/until asymptomatic (other than mild subjective symptoms not&#xD;
                  requiring treatment) for &gt;3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  non-recurrent upper respiratory or urinary tract infections successfully treated&#xD;
                  with antibiotics, until asymptomatic for 1 month after full antibiotic course has&#xD;
                  been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an acute allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of an immunosuppressive disorder (such as HIV infection, Common Variable&#xD;
             Immune Deficiency), chronic infection (such as chronic hepatitis B or C), autoimmune&#xD;
             disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune&#xD;
             thyroid disease), or any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             could lead to an atypical immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of moderate or severe non-traumatic arthritis or arthralgia within 3 months of&#xD;
             the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (within 30 days), current or anticipated use of any immunosuppressive or immune&#xD;
             modifying medication including corticosteroids (excluding nasal, ophthalmic, and other&#xD;
             topical preparations).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other vaccination or planned vaccination within 4 weeks of either study dose (seasonal&#xD;
             influenza vaccine excepted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt or planned receipt of blood products including immunoglobulins within 120 days&#xD;
             of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating or planning pregnancy during the trial.&#xD;

             was exposed to an investigational product (pharmaceutical product or placebo or&#xD;
             device) or planned participation in another interventional clinical study while&#xD;
             participating in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Relevant history of any medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may interfere with the safety of the subject or aims of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of neoplastic disease (excluding successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer&#xD;
             or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) within the past 5 years or a history of any&#xD;
             hematological malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Behavioral or psychiatric disease or cognitive impairment that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator affects the ability or willingness of the subject to understand and&#xD;
             comply with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-consent to storage of blood specimens for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the contract research organisation (CRO) or its subcontractors, the Investigator, or&#xD;
             study site staff. Direct relationship includes first degree relatives or dependents&#xD;
             (children, spouse/partner, siblings or parents), as well as employees (site or&#xD;
             Sponsor).&#xD;
