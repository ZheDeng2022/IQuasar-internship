      This study will determine whether vertebral body tethering is a safe and feasible method of&#xD;
      treatment for pediatric idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a condition in which the spine is deformed by a curvature in the coronal plane.&#xD;
      It is generally associated with a twisting (axial plane) deformity as well. It can have a&#xD;
      variety of underlying etiologies and the etiology is used to classify the types of scoliosis.&#xD;
      Idiopathic scoliosis is sub-classified in two ways: by age of onset and by magnitude of&#xD;
      deformity. Curves between 10 and 25 degrees are considered mild. Curves between 25 and 50&#xD;
      degrees are classified as moderate. Curves greater than 50 degrees are termed severe. The&#xD;
      current standard of care for moderate scoliosis in patients with remaining growth is to&#xD;
      utilize a thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO brace) to prevent progression of deformity. The&#xD;
      scientific evidence has supported the efficacy of this intervention in avoiding progression&#xD;
      of the Cobb angle to 50 degrees or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treated with a TLSO brace, many idiopathic scoliosis patients would conceivably be&#xD;
      subjected to years of brace wear and the cost and psychological factors inherent therein.&#xD;
      Additional downsides of brace treatment include the potentially negative psychosocial impact&#xD;
      of wearing an external sign of deformity during adolescence, a key period of emotional&#xD;
      development. Prior research has identified negative psychosocial effects related to wearing a&#xD;
      brace in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence has suggested that certain curve patterns will likely progress to 50 degrees&#xD;
      or more, despite treatment with a TLSO brace. Sanders, et al. demonstrated a correlation of&#xD;
      Cobb angle (greater than 35 degrees) and skeletal maturity (bone age 4 or less) to the risk&#xD;
      of progression to 50 degrees or more, despite TLSO bracing. The evidence supports that the&#xD;
      current practice of TLSO bracing is not an effective treatment to avoid progression to 50&#xD;
      degrees in these patients. It is on this population (thoracic Cobb angle greater than 35&#xD;
      degrees, bone age of 4 or less) that we intend to test the safety and feasibility of Anterior&#xD;
      Vertebral Body Tethering to avoid curve progression to 50 degrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention is surgical orthopedic implantation of the Anterior Vertebral Tether&#xD;
      Device, by way of thoracoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measures include assessments of safety of the insertion procedure and of the device, as well&#xD;
      as the secondary measure of feasibility by determining the ability to successfully implant&#xD;
      the investigational device.&#xD;

    <description>Intraoperative and post-intervention medical events or signs and symptoms of complications arising after the start of study intervention will be captured. The event description, date of onset, end date, severity, and outcome will be documented. The frequencies, type, body system, severity, and relationship to the study intervention will also be summarized. A distinction will be made between those events which are &quot;device-related&quot; and &quot;non device-related&quot;.</description>

    <description>The feasibility of the vertebral body tethering device will analyzed based on successful implantation of the device. Implantation will be considered a failure if the device breaks/loosens after implantation, or if it overcorrects the spinal curve.</description>
