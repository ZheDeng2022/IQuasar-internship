    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify the dose of intrathecal (IT) chloroprocaine that&#xD;
      provides effective anesthesia in 90% of patients undergoing elective cerclage placement&#xD;
      (intraoperative analgesic supplementation not required).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cerclage is a procedure performed on pregnant women with cervical incompetence to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of second trimester spontaneous abortion and preterm labor. This outpatient&#xD;
      procedure is performed commonly under both general and regional anesthesia. In an effort to&#xD;
      ensure rapid discharge some institutions prefer the use of general anesthesia; however, this&#xD;
      has the disadvantage of exposing the fetus to general anesthetic drugs, increased risk of&#xD;
      aspiration and a higher requirement for opioid analgesia post operatively. The benefits of&#xD;
      neuraxial anesthesia for cerclage placement includes rapid onset of a dense sensory block,&#xD;
      reduced fetus exposure to medications, and maintenance of maternal airway reflexes.&#xD;
      Successful analgesia for cerclage placement requires a sensory block from S4-T10 dermatomes.&#xD;
      Inadequate sensory coverage with a spinal anesthetic typically necessitates the conversion to&#xD;
      general anesthesia adding risk to the mother and fetus while increasing intraoperative times&#xD;
      and resources. Currently there are no studies determining optimum dose of spinal&#xD;
      chloroprocaine for cervical cerclage. The investigators propose a dose determining study to&#xD;
      determine the ED90 of intrathecal lidocaine and chloroprocaine which will help decrease&#xD;
      incidence of inadequate anesthesia for cervical cerclage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, double blinded, dose ranging, biased-coin design study. Usual practice&#xD;
      for regional anesthesia for cerclage placement consists of a mixture of 3% chloroprocaine and&#xD;
      fentanyl. The exact dosing of the local anesthetic mixture used is dependent on the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist's preference. Chloroprocaine provides a rapid onset of surgical anesthesia&#xD;
      with little need for intraoperative analgesic supplementation. If there are contraindications&#xD;
      for spinal anesthesia or patient refusal than general anesthesia is offered as an&#xD;
      alternative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the anesthetic quality of various doses chloroprocaine and&#xD;
      in elective cerclage placement. Chloroprocaine is licensed and commonly administered&#xD;
      intrathecally for cerclage placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate against the occurrence of inadequate analgesia in this ED90 study, a combined&#xD;
      spinal-epidural technique will be utilized in order to provide supplemental analgesia via&#xD;
      epidural top up if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose testing the hypothesis in patients scheduled for elective cervical&#xD;
      cerclage placement. Participants will receive standard of care for anesthesia but in the&#xD;
      context of a clinical trial with the addition of randomization, blinding, and more&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation of the trial outcomes (see outcomes objectives below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be conducted over a 2 year period from January 2019 to September&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Study Solutions The solutions and their administration procedures are identical to&#xD;
      those used outside this research and are almost exclusively used for patients requiring&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia for cervical cerclage. The only deviation involves diluting the&#xD;
      chloroprocaine with saline so that study solutions are of equal volume to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Patient (A#X) 45mg (1.5mL) of Chloroprocaine 3% (Nesacaine - Fresenius Kabi), will be&#xD;
      drawn up into a 3 ml syringe (a 1 ml 'TB syringe' will be used to aspirate the drug in&#xD;
      aliquots to ensure accuracy). The following additive will be added: 10 mcg (0.2ml) of&#xD;
      fentanyl (50 mcg/ml) 0.3 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride Thus the total volume in the&#xD;
      syringe will be 2 ml. Study drugs will be prepared by one anesthesiologist (un-blinded) and&#xD;
      administered by another anesthesiologist (blinded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent Patient (A#X+1) The dose of Chloroprocaine 3% based on outcome from prior subject&#xD;
      and calculations mentioned previously will be added to 10 mcg (0.2ml) of fentanyl (50&#xD;
      mcg/ml). Sterile 0.9% sodium chloride will be added until the total volume in the syringe is&#xD;
      2 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue If the subject has discomfort and requests analgesia, then 5 ml of 3% chloroprocaine&#xD;
      via the epidural route will be given, alternatively the anesthesiologist can treat the&#xD;
      discomfort at his discretion. Other alternatives include intravenous fentanyl, ketamine,&#xD;
      inhalational nitrous oxide and conversion to general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Riks/Benefit Risks of the procedure include the following: discomfort during placement (10%&#xD;
      or 1 in 10), drop in blood pressure (1% or 1 in 100), headache (1% or 1 in 100), allergic&#xD;
      reactions (0.001% or 1 in 100,000), bleeding or infection (0.001% or 1 in 100,000), damage to&#xD;
      nerves (0.001% or 1 in 100,000), failure of the anesthetic or inadequate anesthesia and need&#xD;
      for general anesthesia (0.1% or 1 in 1,000). The benefit of participating in the study is&#xD;
      that perceived pain may be better controlled, however this cannot be guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at two study sites, the University of Arkansas for Medical&#xD;
      Sciences in Little Rock, Arkansas and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.&#xD;

          <title>Chloroprocaine Dose</title>
          <description>Initial Patient (A#X) 45mg (1.5mL) of Chloroprocaine 3% (Nesacaine - Fresenius Kabi), will be drawn up into a 3 ml syringe (a 1 ml 'TB syringe' will be used to aspirate the drug in aliquots to ensure accuracy). The following additive will be added: 10 mcg (0.2ml) of fentanyl (50 mcg/ml) 0.3 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride Thus the total volume in the syringe will be 2 ml. Study drugs will be prepared by one anesthesiologist (un-blinded) and administered by another anesthesiologist (blinded).&#xD;
Subsequent Patient (A#X+1) The dose of Chloroprocaine 3% based on outcome from prior subject and calculations mentioned previously will be added to 10 mcg (0.2ml) of fentanyl (50 mcg/ml). Sterile 0.9% sodium chloride will be added until the total volume in the syringe is 2 ml.</description>

            <description>Initial Patient (A#X) 45mg (1.5mL) of Chloroprocaine 3% (Nesacaine - Fresenius Kabi), will be drawn up into a 3 ml syringe (a 1 ml 'TB syringe' will be used to aspirate the drug in aliquots to ensure accuracy). The following additive will be added: 10 mcg (0.2ml) of fentanyl (50 mcg/ml) 0.3 ml of sterile 0.9% sodium chloride Thus the total volume in the syringe will be 2 ml. Study drugs will be prepared by one anesthesiologist (un-blinded) and administered by another anesthesiologist (blinded).&#xD;
Subsequent Patient (A#X+1) The dose of Chloroprocaine 3% based on outcome from prior subject and calculations mentioned previously will be added to 10 mcg (0.2ml) of fentanyl (50 mcg/ml). Sterile 0.9% sodium chloride will be added until the total volume in the syringe is 2 ml.</description>

        <description>The motor block is assessed using the Bromage scale (1-5). The block is objectively assessed using this scale based on which joints a patient is able to mobilize following epidural or subarachnoid block. A score of 1 represents a patient who is unable to mobilize any lower extremity joint. A score of 5 represents a patient able to mobilize all lower extremity joints.</description>
