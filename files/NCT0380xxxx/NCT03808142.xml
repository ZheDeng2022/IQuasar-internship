  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study researchers wanted to learn more about the medication usage behavior among&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with Betaferon using the myBETAapp which includes&#xD;
      the elements to what extent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  taking medication matched the presciberÂ´s recommendation (adherence, compliance),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  treatment for the prescribed duration (persistence) was continued and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  injections were missed. Among MS patients treated with Betaferon using the myBETAapp the&#xD;
           study also collected information on the health-related quality of life, treatment&#xD;
           satisfaction and satisfaction with treatment support.&#xD;
