  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a frequent group of diseases, affecting 1% of the general population with a&#xD;
      higher incidence in children. Anti-epileptic drugs are used as part of the drug treatment.&#xD;
      Even if children with epilepsy have its own characteristics, as in adults, the choice of an&#xD;
      anti-epileptic treatment is also based on the benefit-risk balance. The purpose of the&#xD;
      treatment should not only be the seizure control. The occurence of side effects is a major&#xD;
      factor to be taken into account. In the special populatIon of children with resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy (20 to 30% of epilepsy), the treatment goal is not any more to be seizure free but&#xD;
      to achieve the lowest possible frequency of seizures with the lowest level of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When assessing the benefit-risk balance of antiepileptic treatment, it is important to keep&#xD;
      in mind that the child is a developing human being whose main activity is learning. Special&#xD;
      attention should be paid to minimize treatments with excessive cognitive consequences. Be&#xD;
      particularly wary of combination therapies (combinations of several antiepileptic&#xD;
      treatments). Indeed, it is well established that they are more harmful than monotherapy. It&#xD;
      is also important to avoid the use of drugs with too strong a cognitive effect. Some&#xD;
      molecules such as phenobarbital or topiramate have been the subject of a few studies that&#xD;
      have established their deleterious effect on the cognitive level. Among antiepileptics,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines are sometimes used as disease-modifying therapy. In France, clobazam is the&#xD;
      clonazepam have a Marketing Authorization for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no study to determine whether these molecules have cognitive consequences.&#xD;
      In order to have more data to better establish the risk-benefit balance of benzodiazepines in&#xD;
      the treatment of children with epilepsy, the investigators wish to conduct work to evaluate&#xD;
      the cognitive consequences of benzodiazepines in children treated for epilepsy.&#xD;

      1. Research Assumptions Epilepsy is a frequent group of diseases, affecting 1% of the&#xD;
           general population with a higher incidence in children. Anti-epileptic drugs are used as&#xD;
           the main treatment. The choice of an anti-epileptic treatment is based on the&#xD;
           benefit-risk balance. The purpose of the treatment should not only be efficacy, the&#xD;
           presence of side effects is a major factor to be taken into account. Thus, in children&#xD;
           with resistant epilepsy (20 to 30% of epilepsy), the objective is not necessarily to be&#xD;
           seizure free but to achieve the lowest possible frequency of seizures with the lowest&#xD;
           possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
           When assessing the benefit-risk ratio of antiepileptic treatment, it is important to&#xD;
           keep in mind that the child has a developing brain whose main activity is learning.&#xD;
           Special attention should be paid to minimize treatment related cognitive consequences.&#xD;
           Be particularly wary of combination therapies (combinations of several antiepileptic&#xD;
           treatments). Indeed, it is well established that they are more harmful than monotherapy.&#xD;
           It is also important to avoid the use of drugs with too strong cognitive effect of their&#xD;
           own. Some molecules such as phenobarbital or topiramate have been the subject of a few&#xD;
           studies that have established their deleterious effect on the cognitive level.&#xD;
           Benzodiazepines are available drug used as antiepileptic drugs. In France, clobazam and&#xD;
           clonazepam have a Marketing Authorization for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although effective in children with epilepsy, benzodiazepines seem to raised a&#xD;
           significant number of problems. One of them is the absence of study determining whether&#xD;
           these molecules have cognitive consequences. In order to have more data to better&#xD;
           establish the risk-benefit balance of benzodiazepines in the treatment of children with&#xD;
           epilepsy, the investigators wish to conduct work to evaluate the cognitive consequences&#xD;
           of benzodiazepines in children treated for epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis tested: Benzodiazepines have cognitive consequences in children treated for&#xD;
           epilepsy The investigators will conduct a prospective study on the cognitive impact of&#xD;
           benzodiazepine withdrawal after successful curative epilepsy surgery in children. The&#xD;
           investigators will focus, through neuropsychological tests, on the working memory and&#xD;
           attention abilities of children with drug-resistant epilepsy who require surgery and are&#xD;
           receiving a benzodiazepine. The three assessments (pre-surgical (seizures and&#xD;
           benzodiazepine); post-surgical (no seizure and benzodiazepine) and post benzodiazepine&#xD;
           discontinuation (no seizure and benzodiazepine)) will assess the impact of&#xD;
           benzodiazepines on working memory and attention abilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The data from this study will allow physicians to better understand the balance of&#xD;
           benefit and risk balance of benzodiazepine use in children with epilepsy. These data&#xD;
           could lead to the writing of a good use for the treatment of epilepsy in children and&#xD;
           avoid misuse if the cognitive impact is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of the studied population and justification for its choice Children followed&#xD;
           for drug-resistant epilepsy in preoperative assessment will be selected by the&#xD;
           coordinator's team or one of the partners. Indeed, only this methodology (pre- and&#xD;
           post-operative comparison with and without benzodiazepine) will make it possible to&#xD;
           answer the question asked and in particular the comparison of post-operative evaluation&#xD;
           with benzodiazepines with post-operative evaluation after stopping benzodiazepines&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Benzodiazepin as antiepileptic drugs Efficiency profile: The efficacy spectrum of&#xD;
           clobazam and clonazepam is quite broad since these molecules have shown their efficacy&#xD;
           in controlled trials on absences, myoclonias, atonic seizures and focal seizures as well&#xD;
           as in open trials on generalized tonic-clonic and focal seizures. Some authors have even&#xD;
           suggested that clonazepam may be the third line treatment in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cognitive side effects: As mentioned above, the cognitive effects of antiepileptics are&#xD;
           an important concern in children with epilepsy. This is one of the main point in the&#xD;
           benefit-risk ratio evaluation at treatment initiation or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The evaluation of this type of side effect is not easy from a methodological point of&#xD;
           view and there are almost no data on this subject except for the most recent&#xD;
           antiepileptics. In addition, this type of side effect is not always reported by&#xD;
           children. Parents, on the other hand, do not easily notice cognitive effects when&#xD;
           starting treatment, whereas they observe a difference when stopping the drug.The&#xD;
           cognitive domains where antiepileptics have been shown to have a negative effect are&#xD;
           speed of treatment and attention processes. Reviews of the cognitive effects of&#xD;
           antiepileptics do not focus on benzodiazepines and there are no data on the cognitive&#xD;
           effect of benzodiazepines on children in the general population to our knowledge. This&#xD;
           may be because there are not only very few controlled or open studies that have sought&#xD;
           to assess the cognitive effects of benzodiazepines used as a treatment in children with&#xD;
           epilepsy. Clobazam appears to have like the other antiepileptic drugs some cognitive&#xD;
           side effect. A number of studies that have been conducted in children with active&#xD;
           epilepsy or epileptic encephalopathy suggest that the use of a benzodiazepine as an&#xD;
           anti-epileptic treatment has a positive effect. This may be explained by the suppression&#xD;
           of seizures or the suppression of the epileptic encephalopathy process, which have a&#xD;
           greater cognitive effect than drugs. More recently, the study by Boshusein et al. used&#xD;
           an interesting methodology that, once modified, would make it possible to assess the&#xD;
           cognitive role of antiepileptics and to avoid the consequences of repeated seizures.&#xD;
           These authors investigated the cognitive effect of discontinuation of treatment by&#xD;
           comparing data from an intelligence quotient test (IQ) before and after epilepsy surgery&#xD;
           showing that discontinuation of treatment (and cessation of seizures through surgery)&#xD;
           was responsible for an increase in IQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Benefits and risks for research participants It is difficult to assess the impact of&#xD;
           antiepileptic drugs in children with epilepsy because the effect of treatments cannot be&#xD;
           distinguished from the impact of repeated seizures. The originality here is our&#xD;
           methodology which will allow us to have an analysis of the impact of the drug alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will conduct a prospective study on the cognitive impact of&#xD;
           benzodiazepine withdrawal after epilepsy control after epilepsy surgery in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will focus, through neuropsychological tests, on the working memory&#xD;
           and attention abilities of children with drug-resistant epilepsy who require surgery and&#xD;
           are receiving a benzodiazepine. The three assessments (pre-surgical (seizures and&#xD;
           benzodiazepine); post-surgical (no seizure and benzodiazepine) and after benzodiazepine&#xD;
           discontinuation (no seizure and benzodiazepine) will assess the impact of&#xD;
           benzodiazepines on working memory and attention span.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Objectives Main objective: The main objective is to evaluate the impact on working&#xD;
           memory of benzodiazepine discontinuation in children after epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives: Evaluate the impact of benzodiazepine discontinuation on these&#xD;
           same children on:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Short-term memory and visuospatial memory Attention in its different forms Attention and&#xD;
           speed of the visual attention Attention and speed on the sensorimotor level Attention&#xD;
           and speed at the executive level&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Description of the research methodology Experimental design: This is a prospective&#xD;
           cohort study, in which patients who will be operated on for respective epilepsy surgery&#xD;
           in the case of focal epilepsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 3 visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first visit (V1) will allow for inclusion and first cognitive assessment, before&#xD;
           surgery and with benzodiazepines. The purpose of this visit is to include the patient&#xD;
           and the first cognitive assessment that will reflect the impairment associated with&#xD;
           epilepsy with repeated seizures. At most, a delay of 3 months will occur between the V1&#xD;
           visit and surgery, although in healthcare practice is often shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second visit will take place 3 months after the surgery without any modification of&#xD;
           the treatments (V2). It will allow for clinical reassessment (healing or presence&#xD;
           seizure) as well as a new cognitive assessment, after surgery and with benzodiazepines.&#xD;
           This visit will reflect the cognitive functioning after the surgical procedure. This&#xD;
           visit will allow to evaluate the epilepsy status of the child after surgery. The&#xD;
           decrease in benzodiazepine will be initiated from V2 over 3 to 6 months depending on the&#xD;
           choice of the prescriber, as is usually done in practice. This decrease will be achieved&#xD;
           as part of the care, and offered to children who have been seizure free for at least 1&#xD;
           month at the time of V2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third visit will allow the collection of clinical data and a new cognitive&#xD;
           evaluation, after surgery and 3 months after the complete discontinuation of&#xD;
           benzodiazepine (V3). This visit will provide data reflecting the cognitive consequences&#xD;
           of the benzodiazepines withdraw. The decrease in benzodiazepine will be initiated from&#xD;
           V2 over 3 to 6 months depending on the choice of the prescriber, as is usually done in&#xD;
           practice. Visit 3 will therefore be between 9 and 12 months after the surgery. It is&#xD;
           possible in rare cases that complete discontinuation of benzodiazepine may not be&#xD;
           possible, in which case the assessment will be made 3 months after a stable and lower&#xD;
           dose of benzodiazepine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  It is therefore the evolution of cognitive functions between V2 and V3 that will&#xD;
                make possible to meet the main objective. Visit 1 will allow the selection of the&#xD;
                patient, it will also allow to have an assessment in comparison with V2 to evaluate&#xD;
                the cognitive impact of the surgery combined with the presence or absence of&#xD;
                repeated seizures according to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There is no control group planned in this study. The investigators do not expect&#xD;
                any change in cognitive functions of children with epilepsy if no major&#xD;
                modification of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  From a regulatory point of view, this is biomedical research, but only&#xD;
                neuropsychological assessments are carried out as a result of the research. All&#xD;
                other diagnostic and therapeutic actions (and in particular surgery and epilepsy&#xD;
                and the reduction of antiepileptic treatment) are performed as part of the care&#xD;

Different tests are proposed (search in the sky, gunfire, do two things at a time, listen to two things at a time...). There are two forms A and B that test the effect of an intervention to modify attention (to avoid the retest effect). This is a standardized test (on age).</description>
