  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ZYN002 is a pharmaceutically manufactured Cannabidiol (CBD) that is developed as a clear gel&#xD;
      that can be applied to the skin (called transdermal delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gel will be applied to clean, dry, intact skin of the shoulders and/or upper arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only participants from the ZYN2-CL-016 study who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria for study ZYN2-CL-017 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/caregivers will apply the study gel twice daily for the 52-week treatment period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label extension, multiple-center study, to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CBD administered as ZYN002, a transdermal gel, for the treatment of child and&#xD;
      adolescent patients with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). Male and female patients with FXS will be&#xD;
      treated for up to 12 months. Up to 300 male and female patients, ages 3 to 18 years will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents/caregivers will apply the study gel twice daily for the 52-week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who weigh less than or equal to 35 kg, will receive 1 sachet of ZYN002, applied&#xD;
      every 12 hours (± 2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who weigh more than 35 kg will receive 2 sachets of ZYN002, applied every 12&#xD;
      hours (± 2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Investigator's discretion, the dose may be increased to a total of 4 sachets a day or&#xD;
      decreased to a total of 2 sachets a day any time after the first month of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants whose weight changes during the course of the study may have their doses changed&#xD;
      at the investigator's discretion on or after the Month 1 visit, or reduced due to&#xD;
      tolerability issues at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are taking anti-epileptic drugs may have an additional one or two weeks of&#xD;
      treatment after the 52 week treatment period to taper off study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for safety analysis of ZYN002. Additionally, the&#xD;
      parents/caregivers will be asked to complete some questionnaires. There will be other&#xD;
      questionnaires and scales that will be completed at the site by the study doctor and/or with&#xD;
      the participant and their parents/caregivers.&#xD;
