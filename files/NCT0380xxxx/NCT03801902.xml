  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well giving accelerated hypofractionated or conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy and durvalumab works in treating patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. Accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher&#xD;
      doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and&#xD;
      have fewer side effects. Conventionally fractionated radiation therapy delivers smaller doses&#xD;
      of radiation therapy over time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side effects.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. It is not yet known whether giving accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy or&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated radiation therapy with durvalumab will work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to two schedules of radiation&#xD;
      therapies (60 Gy in 30 fractions or 60 Gy in 15 fractions) is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine if the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to radiation therapy is feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess toxicities associated with the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) to radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain preliminary estimates of progression-free survival (PFS), using Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, in patients who received MEDI4736&#xD;
      (durvalumab) added to radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the impact the addition of MEDI4736 (durvalumab) has on progression-free&#xD;
      survival, using immune-related response criteria (irRC) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the changes in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and various immune parameters&#xD;
      during treatment with durvalumab and radiotherapy and changes after completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 starting 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to radiation therapy. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 13 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo accelerated&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy (ACRT) 1 fraction per day, 5 days per week for 15&#xD;
      fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive durvalumab as in Arm I. Patients also undergo conventionally&#xD;
      fractionated radiation therapy 1 fraction per day, 5 days per week for 30 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 4 months for 1 year.&#xD;
