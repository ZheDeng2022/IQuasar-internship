  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal tumors have a molecule called CA19-9 in the tumors and blood. The agent&#xD;
      MVT-5873 was designed to block this molecule. Researchers want to test how safe it is to give&#xD;
      this agent to people before and after surgery to remove a tumor. They want to learn the&#xD;
      highest dose tolerated. They want to see if getting the agent at surgery helps slow down the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of giving MVT-5873 at surgery to remove cancer and see if it slows the&#xD;
      progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults at least 18 years old with certain cancers and certain blood CA19-9 levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of tumor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few days before surgery, participants will get a dose of the study agent. They will get it&#xD;
      through a small plastic tube in a vein over about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will sign a separate consent and have the surgery. A sample of the tumor and&#xD;
      normal liver will be removed for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 1-2 weeks after surgery, participants will recover in intensive care then regular care at&#xD;
      the hospital. They will be monitored and treated throughout the stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After leaving the hospital, participants will get the study agent every week for 1 month.&#xD;
      Then they will get it every other week for 2 months. They will repeat screening tests at&#xD;
      study visits and at a follow-up visit. That will be about 5 weeks after the last dose.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resections to remove tumors in the liver, bile ducts and pancreas are rarely curative,&#xD;
           and patients frequently succumb to disease recurrence in the ensuing months to year(s)&#xD;
           after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard adjuvant therapies, which typically begin 6-12 weeks after surgery, offer&#xD;
           little demonstrable decreases in the rates of tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The concept and implementation of immediate perioperative therapy has not been evaluated&#xD;
           given the serious concerns related to healing and recovery with standard cytotoxic&#xD;
           chemotherapy and newer targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A significant percentage of metastatic colorectal cancers, and primary tumors of the&#xD;
           pancreas and bile ducts express Sialyl Lewis, an epitope on the well-established tumor&#xD;
           marker, CA 19-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MVT-5873, a fully human antibody against Sialyl Lewis, has displayed ADCC and CDC in&#xD;
           vitro, potentiated chemotherapeutic efficacy in mouse models and demonstrated efficacy&#xD;
           in Phase 1 trials of patients with advanced inoperable HPB cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MVT-5873 is well tolerated as a single agent; moderate elevations in AST/ALT appear to&#xD;
           be dose-limiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with resectable Sialyl Lewis-expressing cancers represent an ideal population&#xD;
           to explore the use of perioperative MVT-5873 given moderate level of CA 19-9 elevations,&#xD;
           and the potential for extension of recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document the safety of perioperative MVT-5873 in patients undergoing pancreas and liver&#xD;
           resections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if perioperative MVT-5873 can decrease 1-year recurrence rates for patients&#xD;
           with operable CA 19-9-producing cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Colon (metastatic to liver)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pancreas&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Bile Ducts (Cholangiocarcinoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum CA19-9 levels greater than the upper limit of normal, but less than 2500.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease amenable to complete surgical extirpation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pre-operative one-time treatment with MVT-5873, resection to remove all demonstrable disease&#xD;
      in the liver, bile ducts and pancreas, and continuing MVT-5873 mono-therapy until off&#xD;
      treatment criteria are met.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnoses of&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma in one of the following scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary tumors of the pancreas&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary tumors of the bile duct and ampulla&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Metastatic colorectal cancers to the liver&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have disease resectable with a standard pancreatectomy&#xD;
             (pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) or liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may have received prior therapy, including neoadjuvant regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have serum CA 19-9 elevations greater than the upper limit of normal but&#xD;
             less than 2500 U/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;90,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with Periampullary cancers that require a pancreaticoduodenectomy for&#xD;
             complete tumor extirpation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt;10 ULN*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;1.5X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Subjects with periampullary cancers typically present with biliary&#xD;
                       obstruction resulting in significant abnormalities in liver function tests&#xD;
                       that do not reflect liver dysfunction. These values normalize after tumor&#xD;
                       removal. They can be normalized pre-operatively with biliary stenting but&#xD;
                       several large studies have demonstrated an increase in infectious&#xD;
                       complications with drainage. As such, a practice standard has been to avoid&#xD;
                       stenting until bilirubin level rises above 10 X ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with liver tumors (cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic colorectal cancer)&#xD;
             requiring a hepatectomy for complete tumor extirpation:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;5 X institutional upper limit of normal*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;1.5X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Liver abnormalities in this range are consistent with parenchymal&#xD;
                       destruction from the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with pancreas tumors that require a distal pancreatectomy for&#xD;
             extirpation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt;1.5 X institutional upper limit of normal*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2 X institutional upper limit of normal*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine &lt;1.5X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Liver abnormalities in this range are consistent with pancreas cancer&#xD;
                       destruction from the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of MVT-5873 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation and for 3 months after completion of study&#xD;
             treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree to co-enrollment on the tissue collection protocol 13C0176, Tumor,&#xD;
             Normal Tissue and Specimens from Patients Undergoing Evaluation or Surgical Resection&#xD;
             of Solid Tumors .&#xD;
