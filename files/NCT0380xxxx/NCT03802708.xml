      Background: The term &quot;fetal alcohol spectrum disorder&quot; (FASD) describes a broad spectrum of&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental presentations resulting from alcohol exposure in utero. The prevalence has&#xD;
      been estimated at 1 in 100 people, and estimated to be more than 330 000 affected individuals&#xD;
      in Canada. The Canadian Diagnostic Guidelines describe the physical and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      effects resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. These include distinct facial features,&#xD;
      microcephaly and neurodevelopmental deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethanol toxicity is researched in association to the concentration, duration, and timing of&#xD;
      ethanol exposure and the possible pathways leading to phenotypic translation to&#xD;
      teratogenesis. Studies of FASD in animal models are beginning to implicate a number of&#xD;
      susceptibility genes that are involved in various molecular pathways on gene-ethanol&#xD;
      interactions. Some of which are reportedly involved in ethanol teratogenesis as a part of&#xD;
      their roles in DNA damage control, Central Nervous System axis formation, cellular survival&#xD;
      as well as proliferation and growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mutation in one particular gene, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)) is known to worsen&#xD;
      alcohol induced neuronal death both in vivo and in vitro, and expression of the nNOS gene&#xD;
      protects neurons against alcohol toxicity Nitric Oxide (NO) is synthesized by the enzyme&#xD;
      nitric oxide synthase (NOS through) L-arginine There are three NOS isoforms: neuronal NOS&#xD;
      (nNOS, NOS-1), inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS-2), and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS-3) .NO is&#xD;
      associated with modulation of neurotransmission and memory formation along with other vital&#xD;
      activities. In the presence of O2, radicals form that can lead to toxicity. They may be&#xD;
      disruptive to cell signaling processes and result in pathological conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data suggest that ethanol alters NOS expression and activity in the brain There are known&#xD;
      effects of ethanol on production of NO, NOS activities, and interactions of NO with alcohol&#xD;
      metabolism enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose and length of ethanol exposure are the main factors determining ethanol effects on NO&#xD;
      production, NOS activity or NOS expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structural congenital brain anomalies are described in the context of FASD including&#xD;
      microcephaly, migration anomalies, neural tube defects along with midline brain anomalies&#xD;
      involving the corpus callosum, cerebellar anomalies and hydrocephalus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cilia are evolutionarily-conserved antennae-like organelles found on the surface of cells.&#xD;
      Cilia detect different extracellular stimuli such as fluid flow, light, smell, and hormones&#xD;
      through specific ciliary receptors, and they play key roles in cell locomotion and division,&#xD;
      fluid movement, as well as embryonic development of different tissues. In regards to neural&#xD;
      development, ciliary growth factors were recently shown to play a role in embryonic neuronal&#xD;
      cell migration and signaling as well as in formation of the Central Nervous System (CNS)&#xD;
      midline and lateralization. In the mature organism, cilia extend from the basal bodies of the&#xD;
      ependymal cells lining the ventricular surface of the brain, where they facilitate the flow&#xD;
      of Cerebro Spinal Fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nervous system defects are strongly associated with a number of ciliopathies, with common&#xD;
      findings including midline defects such as hydrocephalus, neural tube defects, and a plethora&#xD;
      of cortical and cerebellar abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prototype human ciliary disease has been Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). In the past&#xD;
      decade, significant advancement in understanding of PCD has led to improved diagnosis, mainly&#xD;
      by the finding that Nasal nitric oxide (nasal NO) is greatly reduced in these patients. The&#xD;
      mechanism of this reduction has been suggested to be related to reduced iNOs expression as&#xD;
      part of the ciliopathy. Nasal NO measurement is a simple non-invasive test easily carried out&#xD;
      even in the youngest patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As NO measurement is a simple non-invasive test with immediate results, it serves as an ideal&#xD;
      screening test for suggestive diagnosis of various ciliopathies, including those involving&#xD;
      brain malformations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent work, this research group was the first to determine a connection between ciliary&#xD;
      dysfunction as measured by nasal NO concentration and isolated midline central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) anomalies The overall mean nasal NO level in children with isolated midline CNS&#xD;
      anomalies in the study, was significantly lower compared to the previously-established normal&#xD;
      range with some being within the range of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Recent work shows&#xD;
      that inter neuronal connectivity, brain ventricles morphogenesis and proper formation of the&#xD;
      neural tube depend on non-disrupted ciliary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary cilia function as a result of membrane proteins such as polycystin-1 (PC-1),&#xD;
      PC-2, TRPV4, P2Y12, and fibrocystin. Acetylated alpha tubulin is a known ciliary marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in PC-1 are associated with polycystic kidney disease type 1 mutations that were&#xD;
      found to be associated with fatty acid oxidation defects in metabolomic and lipidomic tests.&#xD;
      Acetylated alpha tubulin is assessed through proteinomic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Given the recent recognition of the interactions between NO with ethanol and the&#xD;
      important role of cilia in early brain development, the investigators hypothesize that cilia&#xD;
      may be involved in molecular pathways leading to brain injury in children that are diagnosed&#xD;
      with FASD. Such a mechanism has not been previously explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that nasal NO levels as well as the key metabolites in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with FASD will be reduced compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This study will aim at measuring nasal NO in a selected group of patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, along with metabolomics and proteinomic&#xD;
      analysis as related to key metabolites involved in NO pathway in urine samples, and compare&#xD;
      them to healthy children. This study will enable clinicians to potentially employ a&#xD;
      non-invasive screening tool for pediatric patients with suspected Fetal Alcohol Spectrum&#xD;
      Disorder and consider an early developmental intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 10 children ages 5-16 years, who are diagnosed with FASD will be recruited from the&#xD;
      FASD outpatient clinic at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. 10 healthy children of the&#xD;
      same age range will be recruited through the HICUPP registry for healthy children&#xD;
      (Pro00056156).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure nasal NO levels by inserting an inert NO sampling line with a&#xD;
      disposable foam olive (DirectMed Inc., Glen Cove, NY) into the child's nostril while the&#xD;
      contralateral nostril is left open. Air will be then sampled at a constant rate of 0.3&#xD;
      liters/min from the nose by a chemiluminescent analyzer which provides measurement of the&#xD;
      nasal NO level in parts per billion (ppb). All nasal NO measurements will be performed with&#xD;
      the subjects seated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be obtained using an NO analyzer (CLD 88 SP, ECO PHYSICS AG, Duerten,&#xD;
      Switzerland). The analyzer will be calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications.&#xD;
      Measurements will be made using velum-closure technique via exhalation from a deep&#xD;
      inspiration through a fixed resistor (disposable, cardboard cylinder with 1 mm opening;&#xD;
      DirectMed Inc., Glen Cove, NY) for 20-40 seconds or via a party favor blowout toy with a&#xD;
      comparable expiratory resistance. Both types of resistor require slight puffing of the cheeks&#xD;
      to develop a mouth pressure &gt; 5 cm H2O, a pressure sufficient to close the soft palate. The&#xD;
      maneuvers will be performed according to ATS/ERS guidelines. In patients who are&#xD;
      uncooperative with the above maneuver the measurements will be made using tidal breath&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examiner will enter the measured NO level directly into a computer file, which will be&#xD;
      saved in an encrypted format on a password-protected computer at the Glenrose Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Hospital. Identifying information such as participants' names or phone numbers will not be&#xD;
      entered. Each participant will be assigned a number instead of a name, which will be&#xD;
      recorded. Other identifying information, such as the child's gender, age and diagnosis, will&#xD;
      be coded using a number as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on information provided, a statistical analysis of co-variants will be performed,&#xD;
      comparing the measured NO levels of patients with FASD to healthy controls (with the&#xD;
      reference range of the normal as published in Mateo 2011 and Marthin 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the nasal NO measurements, the investigators will also conduct metabolomic and&#xD;
      proteomic analysis to measure the levels of key metabolites and proteins in urine of patients&#xD;
      with FASD. These will be compared to the healthy, controls to further explore this hypothesis&#xD;
      of ciliary involvement. The metabolomic analyses will be used to measure key metabolites&#xD;
      involved in the NO pathway (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, asymmetric dimethylarginine) as&#xD;
      well as soluble NO byproducts (nitrotyrosine, nitrotryptophan, and&#xD;
      3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid). Additional metabolomic studies will be performed to look&#xD;
      for altered beta-oxidation markers (acylcarnitines) which can be affected by ciliary&#xD;
      dysfunction, vitamin levels (esp. vitamin A and its byproducts) as well as changes in&#xD;
      catecholamines (due to altered neuronal functions affected by cilia) in urine. The&#xD;
      metabolomic analyses will be done using targeted, MS-based metabolomics methods. The&#xD;
      investigators will also conduct proteomic analysis on urine in FASD patients to measure&#xD;
      changes in key ciliary proteins, namely polycystin-1 (PC-1)( PC-2, TRPV4, P2Y12, fibrocystin)&#xD;
      as well as acetylated alpha-tubulin and compare these values to a group of healthy children.&#xD;
      The proteomic analyses will consist of a combination of MS-based proteomics and immunoassays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using PASW Statistics Version 19 (SPSS Inc., 2010). Alpha will be set&#xD;
      at .05 for all analyses. The percentage of children who score above and below age and&#xD;
      norm-based cut-off values on each measurement will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether the two groups (FASD, Healthy controls) differ in the measured level a&#xD;
      Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be conducted on subscale scores using Group&#xD;
      as a between-subjects factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noting that the sample size is small, the investigators will report an effect size between&#xD;
      the groups for the NO level, and the metabolomics analysis, as well as a 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the effect size. The hypothesis is that there is a difference between the&#xD;
      groups; given that the investigators cannot prove the null (i.e., a lack of a statistically&#xD;
      significant finding will not prove the hypothesis), the investigators will use this effect&#xD;
      size to instead estimate the effect. However it is hypothesized that the nasal NO levels and&#xD;
      key metabolites as relates to NO in children with FASD will be reduced in comparison to&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the study, the de-identified data will be kept in an encrypted&#xD;
      file on the password-protected computer for a minimum of five years.&#xD;
