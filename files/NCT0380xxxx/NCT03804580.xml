    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm study to assess the safety and efficacy of osimertinib (80 mg,&#xD;
      orally, once daily) as first-line therapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not previously treated&#xD;
      with an epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have to provide a biopsy sample (fresh or archival) for molecular testing at&#xD;
      inclusion. If feasible, a biopsy will also be sampled when partial response is achieved and&#xD;
      at the time of disease progression on osimertinib. Liquid biopsies will be sampled throughout&#xD;
      the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects should continue on study treatment until RECIST 1.1-defined progression or until a&#xD;
      treatment criterion is met. There is no maximum duration of treatment as subjects may&#xD;
      continue to receive investigational product beyond RECIST1.1-defined progression as long as&#xD;
      they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as judged by the investigator.&#xD;

                  amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and with Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone&#xD;
