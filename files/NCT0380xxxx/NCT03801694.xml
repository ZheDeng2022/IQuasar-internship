  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to assess the levels of serum catecholamines associated with&#xD;
      myocardial depression (MD) in patients with acute neurological injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of plasma catecholamines, associated&#xD;
      with myocardial depression (MD) as noted on Transthoracic ECHO (TTE) by evidence of wall&#xD;
      motion abnormalities (WMA) with or without drop in ejection fraction or symptomatic heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is commonly diagnosed after the onset of HF once&#xD;
      patients become symptomatic. The investigators intend to study whether early MD can be&#xD;
      detected by identifying certain levels of plasma catecholamines and whether the level&#xD;
      correlates with severity of myocardial depression. Identification of early MD changes can&#xD;
      lead to alteration of management strategies and may help prevent worsening of HF. Highly&#xD;
      selected patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) or Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) requiring&#xD;
      induced hypertension with the use of norepinephrine infusion will be recruited to enroll in&#xD;
      this pilot study. This group of patients are expected to have high circulating catecholamines&#xD;
      and are more likely to develop MD. Given the prevalence of TTS in females and elderly, 10&#xD;
      female patients &gt;50 years admitted to the neuro ICU with diagnosis of either AIS or SAH will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Patients with history of coronary artery disease, smoking, poorly controlled&#xD;
      diabetes with HbA1c &gt;8 and uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. Patients with poor&#xD;
      ECHO windows will also be excluded. Baseline plasma catecholamine levels, transthoracic&#xD;
      ECHO(TTE), Troponin T, EKG and BNP will be obtained and will be followed daily through the&#xD;
      study duration.&#xD;

    <description>Baseline plasma catecholamine levels as well as daily levels will be measured until up to 5 days from study onset. Baseline transthoracic ECHO followed by daily ECHO with strain imaging will be obtained to assess for evidence of myocardial depression. The investigators will assess the correlation of plasma catecholamine levels (i.e level of dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) in the development of myocardial depression. In other words, the investigators will evaluate the level of catecholamines that is associated with stress induced cardiomyopathy. If participants develop symptomatic heart failure before 5 days, study will stop at that point.</description>
