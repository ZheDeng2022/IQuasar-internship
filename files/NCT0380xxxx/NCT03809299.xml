      Caloric restriction increases lifespan and/or healthspan across multiple species. However&#xD;
      implementation of long-term CR in humans is problematic and unacceptable to many individuals.&#xD;
      As a result, intermittent fasting models have been developed to improve adherence. Such&#xD;
      models have been shown to improve blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, decrease hepatic fat&#xD;
      content and body weight. Investigators established an isocaloric twice-a-day (ITAD) feeding&#xD;
      plan in mice, wherein test mice were acclimatized to consume over two hour periods (8-10am&#xD;
      and 5-7pm), the same amount of food as ad-libitum mice. This intervention prevented obesity&#xD;
      and age-associated type 2 diabetes via system-wide activation of autophagy. The investigators&#xD;
      will perform further studies of the same feeding model in humans in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      design. The objective is to test the hypothesis that restricting eating periods to twice a&#xD;
      day (TAD), when compared to isocaloric ad lib meal timing (ALMT), will have beneficial&#xD;
      effects on glucose metabolism, body composition, energy expenditure and autophagy in human&#xD;
      subjects at risk for diabetes&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Caloric restriction (CR) increases lifespan and/or healthspan across multiple species&#xD;
      including non-human primates. However, implementation of long-term CR in humans is&#xD;
      problematic and unacceptable to many individuals. Further, since CR leads to loss of muscle&#xD;
      mass in mice, it is likely that its implementation as a restorative strategy during aging may&#xD;
      exacerbate age-associated muscle loss. As a result, intermittent fasting models, e.g.,&#xD;
      alternate-day fasting, alternate day-modified fasting, the 5:2 diet, and the more recently&#xD;
      elucidated early time-restricted feeding (eTRF)3 were developed as alternative strategies to&#xD;
      improve adherence. Intermittent fasting increases glucose clearance/improves insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, decreases hepatic fat content, lowers blood pressure and body weight by varying&#xD;
      degrees (at least when calories were unmatched). Despite these metabolic advantages, these&#xD;
      approaches have also shown poor adherence in humans. For instance, alternate-day fasted&#xD;
      subjects remained hungry on the fast days, which led to the conclusion that this approach&#xD;
      cannot be continued for extended periods of time, and that adding one small meal on the&#xD;
      fasting day may make this model more acceptable. Accordingly, in alternate day-modified&#xD;
      fasting, fasted days (25% caloric intake) alternated with feasting days (125% calories),&#xD;
      which improved compliance although dropout rates remained relatively high (38%) when compared&#xD;
      to control group (26%). In addition, this feeding approach was not found to be superior to&#xD;
      daily caloric restricted controls in terms of adherence, weight loss or cardiovascular&#xD;
      benefits. More recently, eTRF wherein men with prediabetes were subjected to a 6-hr feeding&#xD;
      interval with dinner before 1 pm displayed a number of metabolic benefits when compared to&#xD;
      individuals on a 12-hr feeding time-frame. Nevertheless, due to vocational or societal&#xD;
      factors, it is plausible that a vast majority of individuals may not be able to adhere to a&#xD;
      regimen requiring the consumption of three meals within the first 6 hr of the diurnal cycle.&#xD;
      In the attempt to offset compliance-related issues and to pursue a simpler approach,&#xD;
      investigators established an isocaloric twice-a-day (ITAD) feeding plan in mice, wherein test&#xD;
      mice are acclimatized to consume over two 2hr-periods (8:00-10:00am and 5:00-7:00pm) the same&#xD;
      amount of food as ad libitum-fed mice. This would effectively translate to a breakfast and&#xD;
      dinner (two meals) in humans. It has been shown that two periods of food restriction per day&#xD;
      in mice prevents obesity and age-associated type 2 diabetes via system-wide activation of&#xD;
      autophagy. This study is to determine if twice-a-day feeding will restore normoglycemia and&#xD;
      promote metabolic correction in older men with prediabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway that plays key roles in maintaining &quot;clean&quot;&#xD;
      cells. It is well-established that basal autophagy levels begin to decline progressively in&#xD;
      aged organisms. Maintaining higher autophagy levels improves organ function and stress&#xD;
      response. For instance, liver-specific overexpression of autophagy genes protects against&#xD;
      diet-induced obesity and tumor necrosis factor-mediated acute hepatotoxicity. In the&#xD;
      investigators' studies with ITAD feeding in mice, blocking autophagy in distinct tissues&#xD;
      resulted in loss of the metabolic benefits from this feeding strategy. Consequently, it is&#xD;
      propose that establishing ITAD feeding in humans will yield a cost-effective, practical and&#xD;
      immediately translatable strategy to prolong health-span by preventing diabetes and&#xD;
      sarcopenia as well as the vast number of secondary diseases caused by sustained&#xD;
      hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the feasibility of a TAD eating regimen and collect preliminary&#xD;
      data to inform a larger-scale and more definitive trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of implementing a structured TAD eating regimen using&#xD;
      study-provided meals 1a. To design meal plans that are isocaloric with habitual intake and&#xD;
      intended to maintain weight and to develop methods to prepare, package and deliver the meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1b. To develop and evaluate methods to enhance and monitor participant adherence to TAD&#xD;
      eating; this will include patient logs, photo records of food intake and continuous&#xD;
      (participant blinded) glucose monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. c. To assess participant satisfaction with TAD meal restriction, using validated&#xD;
           instruments to evaluate hunger, satiety and well-being Aim 2: To collect preliminary&#xD;
           data on the effect of TAD meal restriction to inform design of an adequately powered RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. To collect preliminary data on the effect of TAD meal restriction on glucose&#xD;
           tolerance, insulin sensitivity and secretion, body composition and energy expenditure&#xD;
&#xD;
      2b. To collect preliminary data on the effect of TAD meal restriction on cellular processes&#xD;
      related to autophagy&#xD;
