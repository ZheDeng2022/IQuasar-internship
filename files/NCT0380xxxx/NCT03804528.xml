  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of an 8-week aerobic&#xD;
      exercise program on cognition and determine the relationship between cognitive improvements&#xD;
      and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) neuroplasticity. The investigators will also&#xD;
      explore the effect modification of BDNF levels and BDNF allelic status, and APOE4 status on&#xD;
      cognitive response after exercise.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will quantify cognitive improvements following moderate to high intensity&#xD;
      aerobic exercise intervention (participant will choose between treadmill, elliptical or&#xD;
      stationary bike). Each participant will engage in 60 minute daily sessions delivered 3&#xD;
      times/week for 8 consecutive weeks (a total of 24 sessions). The investigators will determine&#xD;
      the relationship between cognitive improvements and TMS neuroplasticity. The cognitive&#xD;
      domains explored will be: 1) Visuomotor processing speed and cognitive flexibility/task&#xD;
      switching; 2) Response inhibition, mental flexibility, and attentional control; 3) Attention&#xD;
      and working memory; 4) List Learning and Memory; and 5) Semantic Verbal Fluency. The&#xD;
      investigators will also explore the effect modification of BDNF levels and BDNF allelic&#xD;
      status, and APOE4 status on cognitive response after exercise.&#xD;
