  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is in 2 parts. Different participants will take part in the 1st and 2nd parts of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the 1st part of the study is to check how much TAK-788 adults with non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can receive without getting side effects from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of the 2nd part of the study is to learn if the condition of adults with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer improves after treatment with TAK-788. Another aim is to continue&#xD;
      checking for side effects from TAK-788.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 1st part of the study, at the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take&#xD;
      part. For those that can take part, participants will take a capsule of TAK-788 once a day&#xD;
      for 28 days. This will count as 1 cycle. Different small groups of participants will receive&#xD;
      lower to higher doses of TAK-788. The study doctors will check for side effects after each&#xD;
      dose of TAK 788. In this way, researchers can work out the best dose of TAK-788 to give&#xD;
      participants in the 2nd part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the clinic 30 days after their treatment has finished for a final&#xD;
      check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2nd part of the study, at the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take&#xD;
      part. Participants will receive the best dose of TAK-788 worked out from the 1st part of the&#xD;
      study. Participants will receive TAK-788 in the same way as those from the 1st part of the&#xD;
      study. The study doctors will learn if the condition of these participants improves after&#xD;
      treatment with TAK-788. The study doctors will also check for side effects from TAK-788.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment has finished, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks until the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, participants can receive TAK-788 for up to just over 1 year, or&#xD;
      longer if their condition stays improved.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-788. TAK-788 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      Japanese participants with NSCLC. This study has two parts (Phase 1 part and Phase 2 part),&#xD;
      Phase 1 part of this study will look at the safety, efficacy, tolerability and PK of TAK-788&#xD;
      orally administered once daily, and will determine a RP2D. Phase 2 study will look at the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TAK-788 in treatment naive Japanese NSCLC patients with epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation. All participants will be assigned&#xD;
      to Phase 1 part or Phase 2 part and will be asked to take TAK-788 capsule as following dosage&#xD;
      and regimen;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 part; TAK-788, 40 mg as starting dose, once daily, and escalating up to 160 mg until&#xD;
      a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). An expansion phase may be followed at any dose to further&#xD;
      confirm safety observations following identification of MTD/RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 part; TAK-788, 160 mg, once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 58-63 participants (Phase 1 part; 28-33 and Phase 2 part;&#xD;
      30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study of Phase 1 part is approximately 3 years and Phase 2 part is approximately 4 years.&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the treatment period, and the&#xD;
      post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the last dose of the study drug.&#xD;

                  CNS metastases or previously treated intracranial CNS metastases with&#xD;
                  radiologically documented new or progressing CNS lesions). Brain metastases are&#xD;
                  allowed if they have been treated with surgery and/or radiation and have been&#xD;
