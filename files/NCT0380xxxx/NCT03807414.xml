      The use of extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBPT) is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      widespread worldwide in everyday clinical practice, particularly in the critical care&#xD;
      setting. Nonetheless, most of the clinical trials aimed at exploring the effect of EBPT on&#xD;
      patients' long-term outcomes have failed to demonstrate consistent results regarding 28 day-&#xD;
      or hospital- mortality rates. The aim of this observational prospective registry is to&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of extracorporeal blood purification therapies (EBPT) is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      widespread worldwide in everyday clinical practice, particularly in the critical care&#xD;
      setting. For most of these treatments, the extracorporeal removal of inflammatory mediators&#xD;
      (via enhanced transmembrane clearance and/or selective/un-selective adsorption of bacterial&#xD;
      toxins or inflammatory mediators) is already well established in the literature. Unselective&#xD;
      cytokine removal is the main rationale for the use of EBPT, and it might explain the effect&#xD;
      of these treatments on multiorgan dysfunction in critically ill patients. Indeed, an&#xD;
      increment in hemodynamic stability and an improvement in the multiorgan dysfunction scoring&#xD;
      system of treated patients are consistently observed in most of the studies available in the&#xD;
      literature. Nonetheless, most of the clinical trials aimed at exploring the effect of EBPT on&#xD;
      patients' long-term outcomes have failed to demonstrate consistent results regarding 28 day-&#xD;
      or hospital- mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the post-hoc analysis of large databases suggests that a specific&#xD;
      subpopulation of patients, who are likely to benefit more than others from EBPT, could be&#xD;
      identified in clinical practice. As an example, press releases from the Euphrates trial&#xD;
      suggest that a specific range of baseline endotoxin activity assay might correlate with a&#xD;
      positive long-term outcome in patients treated with Toraymixin cartridges. Nowadays, a&#xD;
      personalized approach to extracorporeal therapy has been advocated as the only strategy&#xD;
      capable of maximizing the clinical effect of EBPT and their impact on patient outcomes (i.e.&#xD;
      precision medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of clinical characteristics correlated with positive outcomes during EBPT&#xD;
      allows the implementation of specifically designed trials, focused on a well-defined cluster&#xD;
      of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a large database encompassing the clinical/biochemical characteristics&#xD;
      of patients undergoing EBPT is thus widely hoped for to enable the identification of a&#xD;
      cluster of patients with specific features who most benefit from these treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is well known that only a clinical trial can formally assess the effect of EBPT&#xD;
      on a specific clinical outcome, several drawbacks pose practical limitations to the&#xD;
      implementation of a clinical trial in the critical care setting for this purpose. First, most&#xD;
      European countries (and particularly Italy) do not allow the enrollment and randomization of&#xD;
      non-competent patients (as critically ill patients formally are), due to ethical issues.&#xD;
      Second, clinical trials are associated with very high costs. Third, the quality of results&#xD;
      and conclusions deriving from post-hoc analysis of randomized clinical trials (often&#xD;
      underpowered) may be qualitatively similar to those obtained from a very large database of&#xD;
      patients observed during treatments performed according to the routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an example, COMPACT and COMPACT 2 trials, failed to demonstrate a significant effect of&#xD;
      Coupled plasma-filtration adsorption (CPFA) on the outcome of critically ill septic patients,&#xD;
      with the notable exception of specific subpopulations (e.g. those where an adequate volume of&#xD;
      plasma was filtered and adsorbed). This conclusion was obtained through two highly-costly&#xD;
      multicenter randomized clinical trials, prematurely halted due to ethical issues, using&#xD;
      post-hoc analysis of a subgroup of an already limited sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, the identification of specific clusters of patients during EBPT is obtained by&#xD;
      means of the implementation of a large web-based registry where a network of researchers can&#xD;
      upload the clinical data of patients undergoing EBPT in line with the routine clinical&#xD;
      practice of each single center. Taking into consideration the feasibility of the research&#xD;
      (i.e. mainly related with the lack of critical ethical issues and the easy-to-use interface&#xD;
      of web-platforms), these observation-based registries are inexpensive and effective tools&#xD;
      able to identify specific clusters of patients within a very large sample size with widely&#xD;
      heterogeneous clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an example, a web-based registry has been already implemented to describe the clinical&#xD;
      effects of polymyxin-B based cartridges for endotoxin removal (EUPHAS 2 registry). Another&#xD;
      one has been similarly implemented to describe the clinical effects of un-selective cytokine&#xD;
      adsorption obtained with CytoSorb (CytoSorb registry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into consideration the fact that data on CPFA already exist and web-based registries&#xD;
      are already available for Toraymixin and for CytoSorb, the aim of this project is to design&#xD;
      and nationally promote a web-based registry specifically designed for oXiris membrane. In&#xD;
      particular, an easy-to-use web-based platform will be made available for all centers that&#xD;
      spontaneously adhere to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three main characteristics will distinguish this web-based registry of the clinical use of&#xD;
      oXiris membrane when compared with the already available Euphas 2 and CytoSorb registries.&#xD;
      First, it will also be available for smartphone and/or tablet applications; this&#xD;
      characteristic will guarantee easy-to-use access and data uploading and enhanced compliance&#xD;
      from clinical researchers. Second, it will not be confined to a simplistic registration of&#xD;
      patients' data; it will instead also provide the clinician with clinical tools that might be&#xD;
      helpful for patient management (e.g. automatic calculation of clinical scoring systems, ideal&#xD;
      body weight, functions of mechanical ventilation, antibiotic adjustment according to renal&#xD;
      function, etc.). All these tools will provide the clinician with real-time feedback; this&#xD;
      web-based registry will provide a clear example of translational medicine and translational&#xD;
      research, where data from clinical practice will feed a database for clinical research and,&#xD;
      contemporaneously, the research tool will improve clinical practice, providing useful&#xD;
      instruments for routine practice. Finally, this web-based registry will allow every center to&#xD;
      instantaneously evaluate its results, providing a real-time basic statistic for every&#xD;
      recorded variable (e.g. age at enrollment, main comorbidities, baseline serum creatinine,&#xD;
      mortality rate, rate of multidrug resistant bacteria, etc.). This function may allow each&#xD;
      center to continuously monitor outcomes and local practices, and will represent a major&#xD;
      improvement when compared to already existing platforms in Italy, such as the Prosafe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this rationale, the research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a cluster of critically ill patients that mostly benefits from extracorporeal&#xD;
           blood purification therapies (EBPT) with oXiris membrane?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Might some baseline variables be used to identify this subpopulation of &quot;responsive&quot;&#xD;
           patients? In particular, may these indicators be employed to guide indications for EBPT&#xD;
           with oXiris, in order to personalize treatments and improve patients' long-term outcome?&#xD;
