  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate (PV-001-DC) will be&#xD;
      given to a group of 3 people. If this is found to be safe, it will be given to up to 7 other&#xD;
      people, for a total of up to 10 people in this arm. This will be the first study of&#xD;
      PV-001-DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients must be progressing after having completed prior therapy with a PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      antagonist alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4. If the patient is positive for BRAF, the&#xD;
      patient must have progressed on at least one BRAF inhibitor in addition to a PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      inhibitor alone or in combination with CTLA-4 for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although other kinds of dendritic cells (DCs) have been approved to treat some forms of&#xD;
      cancer, they have not been approved to treat melanoma. PV-001-DC is a special kind of DCs&#xD;
      that is combined with tumor lysate. The study procedures will start with the removal of a&#xD;
      small amount of tumor tissue processed into protein fragments (lysate). There will also be&#xD;
      collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a procedure in which blood is drawn from a&#xD;
      patient and separated into its different cell types), the white blood cells will be collected&#xD;
      and the remainder returned to the patient. Dendritic cells will be grown from the collected&#xD;
      white blood cells and combined with the lysate to form PV-001-DC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of study treatment, patients will go to the clinic and have a needle placed&#xD;
      in a vein. The PV-001-DC product will be infused into the patient's vein. Approximately every&#xD;
      3 weeks, for a total of 4 treatments, patients will receive additional infusions of&#xD;
      PV-001-DC. Patients will be at the clinic for at least 1 hour following the end of the&#xD;
      PV-001-DC infusion and if they feel fine, they may go home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans will be performed during the study at different times to see if their tumors have&#xD;
      changed in size. Patients will also have their blood and small samples of tumors tested for&#xD;
      changes to the immune system. After 365 days, the trial will be completed for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will monitor patients carefully for any harmful side effects. The side effects&#xD;
      in people cannot be completely known ahead of time&#xD;
