  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic gastrectomy has fewer infectious complications compared to open surgery.&#xD;
      Recently, the incidence of postoperative infectious complications was greatly reduced due to&#xD;
      the development of surgical techniques and improvement of prevention and control of surgical&#xD;
      infection. Previous multicenter, phase II study (KSWEET-01) revealed that the incidence of&#xD;
      infectious complications of laparoscopic gastrectomy without prophylactic antibiotics was not&#xD;
      significantly higher than previously reported data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aim to prove the safety of totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy&#xD;
      without prophylactic antibiotics, specially reference to the postoperative infectious&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the non-inferiority of incidence of infectious&#xD;
      complications in the experimental group that did not use prophylactic antibiotics compared to&#xD;
      the control group using prophylactic antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the incidence of surgical site infections within 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery and the difference limit of the non-inferiority of the experimental group is assumed&#xD;
      to be - 0.05 (5%). Assuming that the incidence of postoperative infectious complications in&#xD;
      the control group is 5% and the incidence of infectious complications in the experimental&#xD;
      group is assumed to be about 8%. It is assumed that the significant level is 5% and the power&#xD;
      is at least 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the above method, a total of 260 patients (130 patients in each group) are&#xD;
      needed when 117 patients are needed in each group and about 10% of drop rates and protocol&#xD;
      violence are considered.&#xD;
