  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a high rate of inappropriate antibiotic use in long-term care (LTC) facilities, with&#xD;
      both unnecessary initiation and prolongation of treatments. Although there are challenges to&#xD;
      rational antibiotic use in LTC, the variability in antibiotic initiation and use of prolonged&#xD;
      treatment durations is driven by prescriber tendencies rather than resident characteristics.&#xD;
      Audit-and-feedback is a well-established intervention to improve professional practices, and&#xD;
      is ideally suited for use to improve antibiotic prescribing tendencies in LTC. The literature&#xD;
      is saturated with trials indicating benefit of audit-and-feedback, but is in dire need of&#xD;
      studies to identify methods to improve the impact of this technique. Health Quality Ontario&#xD;
      (HQO), a key partner in the FIRST AID-LTC research program, is already providing&#xD;
      audit-and-feedback for other inappropriate prescribing practices in LTC, and has identified&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing as a priority focus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overarching Goals&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goals of FIRST AID - LTC are two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improve rational antibiotic prescribing by physicians to minimize harms among LTC&#xD;
           residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Advance the science of audit-and-feedback to improve physician prescribing practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve rational antibiotic prescribing in LTC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. by decreasing unnecessary initiation of antibiotic treatments among Ontario LTC&#xD;
           residents, as well as the variability in initiation rates across LTC prescribers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. by decreasing unnecessary prolonged duration of antibiotic treatments among Ontario LTC&#xD;
           residents, as well as the variability in prolonged duration treatment use across LTC&#xD;
           prescribers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To advance audit-and-feedback implementation science:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. by evaluating whether a dynamic audit-and-feedback report highlighting antibiotic&#xD;
      prescribing can lead to greater reductions in antibiotic use, than a static paginated report&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Contributions to Health-Related Knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the literature is inundated with trials examining the impact of audit-and-feedback&#xD;
      compared to usual care, there is a need for studies to improve audit-and-feedback delivery.&#xD;
      FIRST AID-LTC will test optimal delivery and peer comparison techniques for&#xD;
      audit-and-feedback. The knowledge learned can be extrapolated to antibiotic interventions in&#xD;
      LTC in other provinces across Canada, as well more broadly to inappropriate medication&#xD;
      prescribing practices in LTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Contributions to Health Care, Health Systems and Health Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      FIRST AID-LTC will lead to immediate reductions in excess antibiotic use in Ontario LTC&#xD;
      facilities, which in turn should result in substantial reductions in direct drug costs, as&#xD;
      well as downstream complications of allergy, organ toxicity, C. difficile infections and&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance. With easy transferability to other Canadian provinces, the&#xD;
      improvements in cost-savings and patient outcomes could be massive in scope.&#xD;

        To Identify an LTC Resident&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual having a minimum of 2 records on separate days within the quarter meeting any&#xD;
        combination of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a record for a non-emergency long-term care inpatient services OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  an Ontario Drug Benefits record administered in long-term care&#xD;
&#xD;
        Index date = The analysis will be anchored on the most recent of either of the records&#xD;
        above within a given quarter or their date of death (whichever date is earliest)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-Ontario resident at index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Invalid age (age&lt;19 or age&gt;115) at index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Missing or invalid sex or date of birth at index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Death date is &gt;7 days before index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the individual does not live in a nursing home or home for the aged&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cannot be linked to a Most Responsible Physician (MRP) (see methodology below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        To Identify the Most Responsible Physician (MRP) Using Virtual Rostering&#xD;
&#xD;
        For each patient in the above resident cohort, the study team will retrieve all records&#xD;
        from health care providers in the 6 month period preceding the index date (180 days),&#xD;
        keeping only records from physicians who have a specialty of 1) general practice, 2)&#xD;
        community medicine or 3) geriatrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Steps for MRP assignment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 1) The study team will first select physicians with the highest count of records for&#xD;
        the monthly management of a nursing home or home for the aged. This is completed for as&#xD;
        many residents as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 2) If there were no monthly management fee records as described above then the&#xD;
        physician with highest count of non-emergency long-term care inpatient services records for&#xD;
        each patient will be selected. This step is only applied to residents who could not be&#xD;
        matched to a physician by Step 1. **Physician must have seen the patient one or more times&#xD;
        in 90 days prior to and including index date to be considered MRP. This criteria is applied&#xD;
        to ensure the physician has seen the resident within the reporting quarter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Step 3) Some patients will virtually roster to physicians in Enrollment groups, some will&#xD;
        virtually roster to physicians that are not in a group. For these, the study team will&#xD;
        recode enrollment program type to 'NOR' (not otherwise rostered) - these are likely fee for&#xD;
        service physicians.&#xD;
