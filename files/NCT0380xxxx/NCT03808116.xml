      Performance evaluation of a novel, semi-automated device and method for needle core biopsy&#xD;
      download compared to standard methods in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Biopsy core length obtained (i.e. collecting all tissue fragments) 4. Biopsy core yield&#xD;
      (i.e. percent of tissue loss during the pathologic processing)&#xD;

      Examination procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy cores will be collected from the breast during US guided biopsy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of cores taken will be decided per the physician discretion according to the&#xD;
           clinical demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional two biopsy core will be taken the SmartBx cassette. Since the SmartBx&#xD;
           cassette holds two biopsies together, two consecutive cores will be collected using the&#xD;
           SmartBx.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  samples will be photographed for measurements in 2 steps during the process:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. On the needle notch [A].&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. On the glass slide [B].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard tissue fixation, processing of the samples in paraffin will be performed&#xD;
           unchanged per the pathology laboratory protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Embedding of the biopsy cores taken with the SmartBx will be embedded using the SmartBx&#xD;
           mold and tamper.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard staining and histology analysis will be preformed to the sectioned samples,&#xD;
           unchanged per the pathology protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Analysis will be preformed to the histological results, and a comparison between the&#xD;
           standard procedures samples to the SmartBx samples will be performed in terms of -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy core length obtained (i.e. collecting all tissue fragments)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy core yield (i.e. percent of tissue loss during the pathologic processing)&#xD;

    <description>he SmartBx device is intended for the retention of a biopsy specimen and for preservation of the specimen's in-needle location and orientation.&#xD;
The SmartBx is used as an aiding tool in biopsy procedures. When operated in conjunction with the standard equipment in a prostate biopsy procedure, the SmartBx may be used for the following:&#xD;
To preserve sample unity, including core fragments in their original location along the needle notch.&#xD;
Avoid sample damaging during sample removal from the needle and the following pathology process.</description>
