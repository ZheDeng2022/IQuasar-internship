    <textblock>
      The stay aims to determine whether switching from targeted therapy to immunotherapy based on&#xD;
      a decrease in levels of circulating tumour DNA in the blood, will improve the outcome in&#xD;
      melanoma patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The optimal scheduling of targeted and immune therapies in metastatic melanoma is unknown. At&#xD;
      present, patients are treated with targeted therapy until acquired resistance develops, and&#xD;
      then switched to immune therapy. Pre-clinical data has revealed that BRAF inhibition results&#xD;
      in an environment that can enhance immune responses. Tumours responding to BRAF inhibitors&#xD;
      but not resistant have been shown to have increased T cell infiltration, improved T cell&#xD;
      recognition of melanoma associated antigens and reduced production of immunosuppressive&#xD;
      cytokines. Furthermore, in response to targeted therapy LDH levels, which are associated with&#xD;
      decreased response to immune therapy reduces, which may improve efficacy of immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A precise definition of response is required in order to decide upon a switch to immune&#xD;
      therapy. A radiological definition of response is currently the standard assessment. However&#xD;
      a scan at a fixed time point of 2 or 3 months does not reflect the wide range of response&#xD;
      dynamics or allow decision making on an individual patient basis. The investigators have&#xD;
      developed techniques using circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the metastatic setting, which&#xD;
      are able to accurately monitor tumour burden over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to provide a signal as to whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In BRAF mutant melanoma the efficacy of immune therapy is enhanced by response to&#xD;
           pre-treatment with MAPK pathway inhibition with dabrafenib + trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in ctDNA levels can be used to accurately inform when to switch from targeted to&#xD;
           immune therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from this study will provide the basis for follow on studies with sufficient power to&#xD;
      assess whether tumours responding to BRAF inhibition as defined by response in ctDNA can&#xD;
      improve efficacy of immune therapy.&#xD;
