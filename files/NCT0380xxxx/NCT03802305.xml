  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The irreversible acute pulpitis is the most common emergency at the hospital during dental&#xD;
      consultation. Pulpitis are characterized by intense and spontaneous oro-facial pains. In case&#xD;
      of mandibular molar, the emergency treatment consists in realizing a pulpotomy (eviction of&#xD;
      cameral pulp) under locoregional anesthesia called inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB). The&#xD;
      latter represents a real challenge, since inflammation may decrease its action. To mitigate&#xD;
      this deficiency and the drawbacks of the IANB (onset and duration of the anesthesia, bites&#xD;
      risk reported with IANB) other anesthesias are proposed. In particular the computerized&#xD;
      intraosseous technique anesthesia of which the Quicksleeper™ system is a part. However,&#xD;
      according to the observers, a mild to severe tachycardia have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Very few valid clinical trials exists on the subject, most being realized with systems of&#xD;
      intraosseous anesthesia other than Quicksleeper™. Therefore, the aim of this study is first&#xD;
      to analyze the variations of the cardiovascular parameters into two groups of anesthesia:&#xD;
      locoregional anesthesia and Quicksleeper ™ system; and then, to compare the efficiency, side&#xD;
      effects, operating consequences of both techniques. This study should provide better data&#xD;
      about potential risk with computerized intraosseous technique such has Quicksleeper ™ system&#xD;
      in healthy or cardiovascular risk patient.&#xD;

      When the patient arrive in the dental care center, an initial assessment is made to get the&#xD;
      diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anamnesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           acute and spontaneous oro-facial pain, pulsatile severe intensity, which could irradiate&#xD;
           toward the ear and/or jaw, exacerbated by cold or hot.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical exams: positive vitality tests (electric test and cold pressor test)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Further examination (radiography)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the informed consent of the patient&#xD;
      will be taken. The patient is then randomized in one of the group (experimental or control).&#xD;
      He will fill a questionnaire (Corah's scale) for evaluating his state of anxiety during care.&#xD;
      A monitoring of cardiac parameters is made during the care at defined moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient evaluates his pain himself with the VAS (Visual Analog Score), before the&#xD;
      intervention. The anesthesia is carried out by only one experimenter, with the Quickslepper™&#xD;
      handpiece but different specific needles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient receive 1.8 mL of 4% articaine 1:100 000 on a period of 2 minutes.&#xD;
