      This is a prospective cohort study aiming to describe the incidence and outcome of sepsis in&#xD;
      critical patients undergoing craniotomy. This study has been approved by the institutional&#xD;
      review board of Beijing Tiantan hospital, and the need for informed consent was waived.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients over 18 years of age in intensive care will be screened for sepsis at admission&#xD;
      or during their ICU stay, whereas those who stay in the ICU for &lt;24 hrs for routine&#xD;
      postoperative surveillance will be excluded. Patients readmitted into ICU and have been&#xD;
      included at their first admission will not be included for a second time. Each center has one&#xD;
      or more investigators who are residents of intensive care medicine and responsible for&#xD;
      screening, patient records, and follow-up. They all have received at least one year of&#xD;
      clinical training in critical care medicine and had previous research experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis and septic shock are diagnosed according to the sepsis 3.0 criteria. Acute organ&#xD;
      dysfunction is defined as a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 for the&#xD;
      organ in question. The causal relationship between sepsis and organ dysfunction is confirmed&#xD;
      based on medical recording and communication between the investigators and related ICU&#xD;
      physicians. Infection is defined by the attending physicians as the presence of&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear cells in a normally sterile body fluid(except blood),positive culture or&#xD;
      Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid or tissue, unquestionable clinical signs of&#xD;
      infection, such as fecal peritonitis, necrotizing fasciitis, wound with purulent discharge,&#xD;
      et al, or clinical suspected infection with corresponding antibiotic treatment. ICU-acquired&#xD;
      infection is defined as infection identified 48 hours after ICU admission. Antibiotic&#xD;
      consociation application is defined as the daily administration of more than one kind of the&#xD;
      following antibiotics: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenem, macrolides, glycopeptides,&#xD;
      aminoglycosides, quinolones, sulfonamides, and other antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients developing sepsis at ICU admission or during their ICU stay, the following data&#xD;
      will be collected using preprinted case report forms: age, sex, primary diagnosis, chronic&#xD;
      comorbidities, clinical and laboratory data for admission Acute Physiology and Chronic Health&#xD;
      Evaluation (APACHE) II and SOFA score, clinical and laboratory data for maximum SOFA score,&#xD;
      microbiological and clinical infectious information, occurrence of ICU-acquired infection,&#xD;
      antibiotics administered, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, hospital costs, and&#xD;
      outcome. For patients who have not developed severe sepsis at ICU admission or during the ICU&#xD;
      stay, only age, sex, primary diagnosis, chronic comorbidities, ICU LOS, and outcome will be&#xD;
      recorded. If a patient has more than one episode that meet the criteria, only the data from&#xD;
      the first episode will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recorded data will be screened in details by medical personnel for any missing&#xD;
      information, logical errors, or insufficient details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables were expressed as mean (SD) and analyzed by unpaired Student's t test.&#xD;
      Nonparametric variables were expressed as median and 25-75% percentiles and analyzed by the&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute (n) and relative (%)&#xD;
      frequency and were analyzed by chi-square test, as appropriate. p &lt; 0.05 was considered&#xD;
      statistically significant for all comparisons. SPSS version 19.0 for windows software was&#xD;
      used for the statistical analysis.&#xD;
