    <description>In general, it is recommended using 9-10 Gy x 3 or 10 Gy x 5 fractions given every other day. Physicians should try to give the highest BED whenever possible while respecting normal tissue tolerance. All lesions are recommended to receive a biologically effective dose (BED) of 60 Gy or higher (BED10≥70), assuming α/β ratio of 10 and using the linear-quadratic model: BED = nd x [1 + d/(α/β)] where n is number of fractions and d is dose per fraction. Sometimes BED ≥80 Gy is preferred, with lower doses ≥50 Gy allowed at the discretion of the treating physician for concerns about normal tissue toxicity.</description>
