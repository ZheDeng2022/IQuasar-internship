  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea (i.e. breathlessness) and exercise intolerance are common symptoms for patients with&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (ILD), yet it is not known why. It has been suggested that muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction may contribute to dyspnea and exercise intolerance in ILD. Our study aims to: i)&#xD;
      examine differences in the structure and function of the leg muscles in ILD patients, ii)&#xD;
      determine if leg muscle fatigue contributes to dyspnea and exercise limitation in patients&#xD;
      with ILD, and iii) determine the effects of breathing extra oxygen on leg muscle fatigue, as&#xD;
      well as ability to exercise in ILD patients.&#xD;

      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the proposed work is to characterize skeletal muscle function in&#xD;
      patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD), and to determine the physiological and sensory&#xD;
      consequences of impaired skeletal muscle function in ILD during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are threefold; i) patients with ILD will have impaired skeletal muscle&#xD;
      function when compared to healthy controls, ii) impairments in skeletal muscle function&#xD;
      predispose ILD patients to exercise-induced quadriceps muscle fatigue, increase the&#xD;
      perception of exertional dyspnea, as well as reduce exercise tolerance, and iii) delivery of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen during exercise mitigates exercise-induced quadriceps muscle fatigue,&#xD;
      attenuates the perceived intensity of dyspnea, and improves exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the proposed study is to comprehensively investigate skeletal muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with ILD and characterize its impact on dyspnea and exercise&#xD;
      tolerance. In doing so, the proposed work will be the first to comprehensively assess&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function in patients with ILD as well as determine its functional&#xD;
      consequences. The results will provide important insight into the putative role of skeletal&#xD;
      muscle dysfunction on exercise limitation in patient with ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUSTIFICATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILD refers to a diverse group of diseases that share common physiological characteristics&#xD;
      resulting from inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. ILD has an estimated&#xD;
      prevalence of approximately 67-81 cases per 100 000 individuals. Given the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      disease sub-types, it is difficult to determine a precise median survival for patients with&#xD;
      ILD, however; in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common ILD sub-type,&#xD;
      have a median survival of only 2-3 years from the time of diagnosis. For patients with ILD,&#xD;
      dyspnea (i.e. breathlessness) is the most common symptom. Dyspnea can be extremely&#xD;
      debilitating, particularly during physical exertion. The clinical significance of dyspnea in&#xD;
      ILD is underscored by its strong correlation with quality of life and mortality. Patients&#xD;
      attempt to minimize dyspnea by avoiding physical activity, resulting in deconditioning and an&#xD;
      associated reduction in functional capacity. The importance of maintaining functional&#xD;
      capacity is highlighted by the fact that ILD patients with the lowest physical activity&#xD;
      levels have the lowest quality of life and the highest mortality. The effective management of&#xD;
      dyspnea and exercise intolerance is therefore of critical importance when considering the&#xD;
      management of patients with ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in ILD are complex,&#xD;
      multifactorial, and poorly understood. Indeed, relatively few studies that have adequately&#xD;
      investigated the mechanistic basis of dyspnea and exercise intolerance in patients with ILD.&#xD;
      It is generally agreed upon that exercise limitation in ILD is related to the combination of&#xD;
      altered respiratory mechanics, gas exchange impairment, and circulatory limitation. However,&#xD;
      it is assumed that dyspnea and exercise intolerance are exclusively related to the&#xD;
      respiratory and circulatory impairment associated with the pathogenesis of ILD. While this&#xD;
      assumption is reasonable, it ignores the potentially crucial role of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction as a source of dyspnea and exercise intolerance. Recent experimental evidence&#xD;
      indicates that skeletal muscle dysfunction contributes to both dyspnea and exercise&#xD;
      intolerance in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A growing body of literature supports the notion that skeletal muscle dysfunction is common&#xD;
      in ILD. While the precise mechanisms remain unclear, several well-established skeletal muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction-promoting factors are present in many ILD patients, including: chronic&#xD;
      hypoxaemia, oxidative stress, pulmonary and systemic inflammation, physical deconditioning,&#xD;
      malnutrition, and corticosteroid use. These factors may act individually or synergistically&#xD;
      to impair skeletal muscle function by causing muscle atrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, a&#xD;
      reduction in type I muscle fibre proportion, and increases in intramuscular fat. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, there is limited imaging data of skeletal muscle morphology in ILD, and&#xD;
      assessments of skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, and contractile function have not been&#xD;
      concurrently obtained. If present, skeletal muscle dysfunction likely reduces locomotor&#xD;
      muscle oxidative capacity, leading to premature fatigue, increased dyspnea, and diminished&#xD;
      exercise tolerance. Most importantly, there is no data on the physiological effects of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle fatigue and dysfunction on dyspnea and exercise capacity nor whether targeted&#xD;
      treatment options such as supplemental oxygen (O2) delivery can attenuate muscle fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the aims of the proposed research are threefold: i) to characterize skeletal&#xD;
      muscle function in patients with ILD compared to healthy controls, ii) to determine the&#xD;
      influence of skeletal muscle dysfunction on dyspnea, fatigue, and exercise intolerance in&#xD;
      patients with ILD compared to healthy controls, and iii) to determine if improving exercise&#xD;
      tolerance using supplemental oxygen relieves exercise-induce skeletal muscle fatigue in ILD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental hypotheses tested using combination of research designs. To test the hypotheses&#xD;
      i) and ii), the investigators will use a cross sectional design. To test hypothesis iii), the&#xD;
      investigators will use a single-blind placebo-controlled study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Participants will report to the laboratory on four separate occasions separated by a&#xD;
      minimum of 48 hours, and each visit will last ~2-3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete medical history screening, complete a series of questionnaires&#xD;
      concerning chronic activity-related dyspnea, quality of life, and physical activity.&#xD;
      Participants will then have their height and weight measured and perform pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing. Finally, participants will perform a symptom limited incremental cycle exercise&#xD;
      test. Detailed physiological and sensory measurements will be obtained immediately before and&#xD;
      throughout the incremental cycle exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 will be intended to characterize participant's pulmonary function and exercise&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess the volume and the fat&#xD;
      percentage of their quadriceps muscles They will then perform a series of tests aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating their quadriceps muscle function, including: i) assessment of maximum voluntary&#xD;
      quadriceps muscles strength, and ii) the non-invasive assessment of the oxidative capacity of&#xD;
      their quadriceps muscle using near-infrared spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from visit 2 will be used to address hypothesis 1 by characterizing participant's&#xD;
      quadriceps muscle function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a constant-load exercise test to exhaustion while breathing ambient&#xD;
      air (i.e., 20.93% oxygen). The work load will be set at 75% of the highest work rate achieved&#xD;
      during the incremental exercise test performed during visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from visits 3 and 4 will be used to address hypothesis 2 by characterizing the effect of&#xD;
      exercise on skeletal muscle fatigue in patients with ILD and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will perform a constant-load exercise test while breathing supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      (i.e., 60% oxygen). The work load will be set at 75% of the highest work rate achieved during&#xD;
      the incremental exercise test performed during visit 1 and the test will be terminated once&#xD;
      participants reach the same time that they achieved during the constant-load exercise test on&#xD;
      Day 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from visit 4 will be used to address hypothesis 3 by determining if supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      can be used to alleviate exercise-induced skeletal muscle fatigue in patients with ILD and&#xD;
      healthy controls.&#xD;
