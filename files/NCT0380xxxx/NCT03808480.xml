  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nivolumab is now the standard of care for second-line treatment of advanced squamous or&#xD;
      nonsquamous NSCLC regardless of the tumor's expression of PD-1L. CheckMate057 trial results&#xD;
      showed that in unselected patients with advanced or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC who had&#xD;
      stopped responding to a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, treatment with nivolumab&#xD;
      produced significantly better overall survival during follow-up as long as 18 months,&#xD;
      compared with a docetaxel-based regimen. But during the first 3 months on randomized&#xD;
      treatment, 15 more patients died in the nivolumab arm than in the docetaxel arm. This quickly&#xD;
      reversed during months 4-6 on treatment, when nine more patients died on docetaxel than on&#xD;
      nivolumab. A post hoc analysis showed a trend to a higher risk for death during the first 3&#xD;
      months of nivolumab treatment among patients with poorer prognostic features, more aggressive&#xD;
      disease, and low or no tumor expression of PD-L1. In addition, only a subgroup of patients&#xD;
      benefits from nivolumab with response rates of 20% in unselected cohorts and 10% in low PD-L1&#xD;
      expression cohort. Strategies to render the tumor micro-environment (TME) more susceptible to&#xD;
      anti-PD1 might include stimulation of anti-cancer immune responses by induction treatment&#xD;
      with low dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potent immune-modulating effects and anti-tumor activity of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      doxorubicin, Investigator propose a study of combining nivolumab with induction therapy with&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin for nonsquamous NSCLC with PD-L1 expression less than 10%.&#xD;

      Nivolumab is now the standard of care for second-line treatment of advanced squamous or&#xD;
      nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of the tumor's expression of&#xD;
      programmed death-1 ligand (PD-1L). The 2015 Food and Drug Administration approval cited&#xD;
      results from the Open-Label Randomized Phase III Trial of Nivolumab Versus Docetaxel in&#xD;
      Previously Treated Metastatic nonsquamous-NSCLC (CheckMate057) trial. Those results showed&#xD;
      that in unselected patients with advanced or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC who had stopped&#xD;
      responding to a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, treatment with nivolumab produced&#xD;
      significantly better overall survival during follow-up as long as 18 months, compared with a&#xD;
      docetaxel-based regimen. But a more detailed assessment of the survival data showed an&#xD;
      unexpected pattern of an early hazard among the nivolumab patients. During the first 3 months&#xD;
      on randomized treatment, 15 more patients died in the nivolumab arm than in the docetaxel&#xD;
      arm. This quickly reversed during months 4-6 on treatment, when nine more patients died on&#xD;
      docetaxel than on nivolumab. By 12 months after the onset of treatment, overall survival was&#xD;
      51% in the nivolumab group and 39% among those randomized to docetaxel. A post hoc analysis&#xD;
      showed a trend to a higher risk for death during the first 3 months of nivolumab treatment&#xD;
      among patients with poorer prognostic features, more aggressive disease, and low or no tumor&#xD;
      expression of PD-L1. In addition, only a subgroup of patients benefits from nivolumab with&#xD;
      response rates of 20% in unselected cohorts and 10% in low PD-L1 expression cohort.&#xD;
      Strategies to render the tumor micro-environment (TME) more susceptible to anti-PD1 might&#xD;
      include stimulation of anti-cancer immune responses by induction treatment with low dose&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, an old-school chemotherapeutic agent used across a wide range of&#xD;
      malignancies, was found to be a potent immune modulator that targets suppressive regulatory&#xD;
      immune cells within the tumor microenvironment while enhancing effector cells. However,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide has a limited effect on TIL from tumors larger than a few mm diameter in&#xD;
      view of an increased percentage of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Meanwhile,&#xD;
      doxorubicin is also has a potent immune-modulating activity, which can selectively impair&#xD;
      MDSC-induced immunosuppression. Additionally, both cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin have&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity against NSCLC. Given the potent immune-modulating effects and anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, Investigator propose a study of combining&#xD;
      nivolumab with induction therapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin for nonsquamous NSCLC&#xD;
      with PD-L1 expression less than 10%.&#xD;
