  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma is surgical resection. Only 10-15%&#xD;
      of the patients will be candidates for curative resection. After response to chemotherapy&#xD;
      this figure rises 10-13% more. To perform the surgery it is necessary to have a sufficient&#xD;
      remnant liver volume (RLV), which allows maintaining optimal liver function after resection.&#xD;
      If the estimated RLV is insufficient preoperatively, portal venous embolization site (PVE) is&#xD;
      performed for compensatory hypertrophy, thus increasing the number of resections 19%. Still,&#xD;
      in 20% of these patients surgery can not be performed because RLV is not achieved or because&#xD;
      the disease progresses while waiting for growth. Therefore, it is necessary to improve liver&#xD;
      regeneration without promoting tumor growth. Studies on liver regeneration, have determined&#xD;
      that cells (CD133 +) are involved in the liver hypertrophy that occurs after hepatectomy.&#xD;
      CD133 + have been used to induce liver hypertrophy with encouraging results. This population&#xD;
      of CD133 +, can be selected from peripheral blood after stimulation with Granulocyte&#xD;
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), being able to obtain a large number of them. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to treat patients who do not meet criteria for surgery because of&#xD;
      insufficient volume &lt;40%, with CD133 + and portal embolization in order to carry out a&#xD;
      surgical resection in a second place.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women between ≥ 18 years and ≤ 80. Women in fertile age should use&#xD;
             contraceptive methods recommended by the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) quality of life scale ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with hepatic metastases of colorectal carcinoma and insufficient hepatic&#xD;
             remnant function to perform a major hepatectomy. This volume would be calculated by&#xD;
             Positron emission tomography-Computed tomography (PET-CT) images or 64-channel&#xD;
             multidetector CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
             In patients who have received preoperative chemotherapy, the estimate residual liver&#xD;
             volume to be included in the study will be &lt;40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Patients who have preserved liver function (Child ≤ B7 and International Normalized&#xD;
             Ratio (INR) ≤ 2 in non-anticoagulated patients) and those who have not received&#xD;
             chemotherapy, needs &lt; 30% of residual volume to be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients should have signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnancy or lactation period.&#xD;

             anticoagulated patients the values will have to be reverse, prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have not received research drugs in the last 30 days or in the period of&#xD;
             5 elimination half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In patients on chemotherapy treatment, G-CSF can not be administered until 48 hours&#xD;
             after the last administration of chemotherapy. Patients who have received Bevacizumab&#xD;
             must wait 30 days since the last administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. In addition, all those aspects that prevent the patient from being part of the study,&#xD;
