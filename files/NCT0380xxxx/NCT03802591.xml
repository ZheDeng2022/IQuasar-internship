&#xD;
          3. Provide written informed consent before any protocol-related procedure (that is not a&#xD;
             part of subject's routine care) is carried out.&#xD;

             gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) carcinoma, and have histologically confirmed&#xD;
             predominant adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject may have at least a measurable lesion or an evaluable lesion, if not&#xD;
             measurable; the investigator will carry out evaluation according to Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 within 28 days prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 0 or 1.&#xD;

             advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject must provide tumor tissue samples for biomarker analysis in order to determine&#xD;
             the expression of PD-L1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Permitted prior treatment: Subjects with GC or GEJ carcinoma priorly treated with&#xD;
             adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, who experience clinical progression of disease at&#xD;
             least 6 months during treatment or after treatment are allowed to be enrolled.&#xD;

             treatment for at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and pass the&#xD;
             hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titer test (≤ 500 IU/mL or 2500 copies/mL) and hepatitis C&#xD;
             virus (HCV) RNA test (≤ lower limit of detection) before being enrolled. The subject&#xD;

             stable status for over 4 weeks prior to the first dose of investigational product).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, for example diabetes mellitus or&#xD;
             hypertension, that may increase the risk associated with participation or&#xD;
             investigational product administration, or compromise subject's ability to receive&#xD;
             investigational product, as per investigator's judgment.&#xD;
