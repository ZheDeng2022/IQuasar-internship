  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well copanlisib works when given&#xD;
      together with fulvestrant in treating patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and&#xD;
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      other places in the body (advanced) and progressing after prior treatment. HER2 and ER are&#xD;
      two types of proteins called receptors that can affect the growth of breast cancer cells.&#xD;
      Additionally, investigators hope to learn from this study if tumor genetic information is&#xD;
      important for predicting whether this type of breast cancer will respond to fulvestrant and&#xD;
      copanlisib. Copanlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy using fulvestrant may fight breast cancer by blocking&#xD;
      the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving copanlisib and fulvestrant may work better in&#xD;
      treating patients with ER+ and HER2- breast cancer compared to fulvestrant alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Establish safety of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant (FC). II. Evaluate the&#xD;
      response rate (RR) of the combination of copanlisib and fulvestrant in patients with&#xD;
      estrogen-receptor positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer that has previously progressed on aromatase inhibitor (AI)/cyclin&#xD;
      dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with copanlisib and&#xD;
      fulvestrant stratifying by actionable PIK3CA mutation, actionable PIK3CA or PTEN mutation, or&#xD;
      wild type PIK3CA and PTEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the RR in subjects with PTEN loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis&#xD;
      performed retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate toxicity in patients treated with FC in Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate copanlisib pharmacokinetics (PK) when given in combination with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore association between intrinsic subtype and response to FC therapy. III. Assess&#xD;
      baseline levels and treatment-induced proteomic changes and correlate with response to FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Evaluate circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) mutations at baseline and&#xD;
      over time for response predictors at baseline, clonal evolution associated with treatment,&#xD;
      and resistance mechanisms at disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Evaluate PFS in patients with baseline ctDNA PIK3CA actionable mutations versus (vs.)&#xD;
      those with wild type PK3CA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate genomic and gene expression changes in tumor cells and in associated tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment before and after administration of copanlisib in combination with&#xD;
      fulvestrant and at the time of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Evaluate circulating markers of metabolism before and after PI3K inhibitor therapy which&#xD;
      may predict treatment response and resistance mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive copanlisib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) over 1-2 minutes on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1&#xD;
      beginning cycle 2. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Prognostic effect of biomarker for PFS will be examined by the Kaplan Meier (KM) method or/and Cox proportional hazard model and for objective response rate (ORR) using logistic regression model. Predictive effect of biomarker will be explored by examining the interaction effect of biomarker and arm in Cox or logistic regression model. For markers measured along multiple time points, generalized linear mixed effects model will be used to model longitudinal trajectories along time with the inference focus on the arm factor, without and with adjustment for other covariates. Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be applied to compare time-matched biomarkers between the two arms or two patient subsets. Paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be applied to compare subject-specific biomarkers between two time points. Multiple comparisons will be adjusted to control false discovery rate. Proposed subset analyses will be applicable to biomarkers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+), human epidermal growth&#xD;
             factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have progressed&#xD;
             on combination therapy with an aromatase inhibitor and cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6&#xD;
             (CDK 4/6) inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Postmenopausal females are considered of childbearing potential unless they&#xD;
                  are surgically or permanently sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                  tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
                  for at least 12 consecutive months. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
                  level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state&#xD;
                  in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.&#xD;
                  Documentation of postmenopausal status must be provided&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1&#xD;
             (RECIST1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had tumor sequencing for evaluation of actionable PIK3CA or PTEN&#xD;
             mutations performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) certified, College&#xD;
             of American Pathologist (CAP) tested and bioinformatics-validated testing lab PRIOR to&#xD;
             enrollment in this current protocol. If available patient tumor sequencing status must&#xD;
             be provided to University of North Carolina (UNC) principal investigator (PI) at&#xD;
             consent, and prior to any additional screening procedures. The testing may have been&#xD;
             done at any time prior to enrollment. For patients who have not yet had tumor genomic&#xD;
             assessment, after consultation with the PI, tumor specimens will be sent to the UNC&#xD;
             Hospitals Clinical Molecular Genetics Laboratory for assessment of the Solid Tumor&#xD;
             Mutation Panel. In this case, results of genetic testing by the UNC lab must be&#xD;
             available prior to the first on study disease assessment (i.e., prior to day 1 of&#xD;
             cycle 4). In this case, the study will cover the cost of the Solid Tumor Panel&#xD;

                  resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at&#xD;
                  rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or&#xD;
                  anginal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Class IV NYHA Heart failure classification: Patients with cardiac disease&#xD;
                  resulting in the inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort.&#xD;
                  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If&#xD;
                  any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other cardiovascular-related abnormalities or therapy that prohibit study participation&#xD;

                  for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; there is no safety data in pregnancy;&#xD;
