      Closed-loop system systems that are shown to alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting&#xD;
      without degrading glucose control are still lacking. In this proposal, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to develop a novel, fully-automated, closed-loop system that delivers insulin and pramlintide&#xD;
      that controls postprandial glucose levels without any input from the user.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Meal carbohydrate content is the main determinant of prandial insulin needs, and&#xD;
      consequently, accurate carbohydrate counting is recommended for type 1 diabetes. Advances in&#xD;
      glucose sensors have motivated the development of the closed-loop system to automatically&#xD;
      regulate glucose levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes. In the closed-loop system, a&#xD;
      dosing algorithm adjusts the pump insulin infusion rate based on continuous glucose sensor&#xD;
      readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed-loop system systems that are shown to alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting&#xD;
      without degrading glucose control are still lacking. In this proposal, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to develop a novel, fully-automated, closed-loop system that delivers insulin and pramlintide&#xD;
      that controls postprandial glucose levels without any input from the user. Thus, the two&#xD;
      hormones' role in the postprandial state will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Insulin: to reduce plasma glucose levels. Insulin delivery needs to be aggressive to&#xD;
           counter-act fast increase in post-meal glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pramlintide: to slow gastric emptying and aim insulin in efficiently controlling&#xD;
           postprandial glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess a fully automated, dual-hormone, closed-loop system that&#xD;
      delivers insulin, and pramlintide to control glucose levels without degrading overall&#xD;
      glycemic control compared to an insulin-alone closed-loop system with carbohydrate-matched&#xD;
      boluses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the dual-hormone closed-loop system will alleviate&#xD;
      carbohydrate-counting burden (fully reactive system) without degrading glucose control&#xD;
      compared to the insulin-alone closed-loop system.&#xD;

    <description>Fast-acting insulin will be delivered using two separate infusion pumps. The pumps' infusion rates will then be changed manually based on the computer-generated recommendation. The computer-generated recommendations are based on a dosing algorithm. With no-meal announcement or carbohydrate counting, the dual-hormone closed-loop system will be fully reactive, and insulin and pramlintide dosages will be based solely on sensor readings</description>

    <description>Fast-acting insulin will be delivered by a subcutaneous insulin infusion pump based on an algorithm that automatically adjusts insulin rates based on a dosing algorithm. The carbohydrate content for every ingested meal will be entered into the algorithm to calculate the insulin prandial bolus based on each participant's insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. The carbohydrate content will be entered at the onset of the meal.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at the research facility at 19:00. Each 27-hour intervention visit includes 3 standardized meals (8:00, 12:00, and 17:00), an evening snack (22:00) and an overnight stay. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The infusion rate of either insulin alone or insulin and pramlintide will be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation. The computer generated recommendations are based on a predictive algorithm.</description>
