  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (fILD) is a group of debilitating chronic lung&#xD;
      conditions that are characterised by scarring of lung tissue, dyspnoea on exertion and&#xD;
      significant physical impairment. Exercise training is recommended for people with fILD in&#xD;
      improving breathlessness and exercise tolerance. However, despite the best efforts of&#xD;
      patients and clinicians, many of those who participate are not attaining its benefits. The&#xD;
      current exercise training strategies of moderate intensity continuous training may not be&#xD;
      well suited to fILD. High intensity interval training (HIIT), short bouts of high-intensity&#xD;
      exercise regularly interspersed with periods of rest or light exercise may be an alternate&#xD;
      exercise training option for people with fILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will determine to whether HIIT is better than the current method of continuous&#xD;
      exercise training at moderate intensity in improving exercise tolerance, breathlessness and&#xD;
      quality of life in people with fILD. A randomised controlled, assessor blinded trial will be&#xD;
      conducted. A total 130 people with fILD will be randomly assigned to moderate intensity&#xD;
      continuous training or HIIT. If this trial demonstrates that HIIT is effective, it will&#xD;
      provide an exercise training strategy that can readily be implemented in practice that will&#xD;
      maximise the outcomes of exercise training for people with fILD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a chronic lung condition characterized by scarring of lung&#xD;
      tissue. This stiffening of the lungs impairs breathing and reduces the amount of oxygen being&#xD;
      delivered throughout the body limiting the ability to perform daily and physical activity.&#xD;
      Around two-thirds of people with ILD have fibrotic ILD (fILD), a type of ILD, which typically&#xD;
      has worse impairment and disability than other types of ILD. There is no cure for these&#xD;
      conditions, although there are two new pharmacological therapies that slow the decline in&#xD;
      lung function in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), the most common type of fILD. These&#xD;
      treatments however do not provide improvement in breathlessness, exercise capacity or&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise training, or Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR), has shown to be effective at improving&#xD;
      exercise tolerance and HRQoL in ILD. The investigators recently demonstrated that, at a group&#xD;
      level, exercise training exerts a positive effect across varying subtypes of ILD, including&#xD;
      IPF, the most rapidly progressive of all the fILDs. However less than half of those with IPF&#xD;
      who undertook the exercise training achieved meaningful improvements in exercise capacity. In&#xD;
      addition, a large proportion of people with IPF were unable to keep up with the recommended&#xD;
      exercise training level, often due to excessive dyspnoea or desaturation. This suggests the&#xD;
      current exercise training strategies used in PR, which were adopted from guidelines for&#xD;
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), may not provide the optimal&#xD;
      exercise stimuli for fILD. High intensity interval training (HIIT), which is short bouts of&#xD;
      high intensity exercise regularly interspersed with periods of rest or light exercise, may be&#xD;
      an alternate exercise training option for people with fILD. However, it is unknown whether&#xD;
      this kind of exercise training achieves superior benefits to the traditional model of PR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to determine whether HIIT is better than the current method of&#xD;
      continuous exercise training at moderate intensity, in improving exercise capacity,&#xD;
      breathlessness and HRQoL in people with fILD. A total 130 people with fILD will be recruited.&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted at four hospital sites across Australia. People who agree to take&#xD;
      part in the study will be randomly allocated into two groups. Group 1 will undergo the&#xD;
      traditional PR model of moderate intensity continuous exercise training and group 2 will&#xD;
      undergo HIIT. Participants in both groups will participate in exercise training twice weekly&#xD;
      for eight weeks. The participants will be monitored continuously during exercise by an&#xD;
      experienced physiotherapist or exercise physiologist. At the beginning and the end of the&#xD;
      eight weeks of exercise training, and six months later, participants will undergo&#xD;
      measurements of exercise capacity and health status. This study will determine whether HIIT&#xD;
      is effective, providing an important exercise training strategy that can be readily used for&#xD;
      people with fILD to achieve positive benefits from PR.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in dyspnea measured using the Dyspnea-12 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea-12 is a uni-dimensional 12-item questionnaire divided in 2 domains: physical items (1 to 7) and affective items (8-12). Each item evaluate breathing experience and can be scored as: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2) or Severe (3). Results of this questionnaire will be reported as total score that can range from 0 to 36 and separate scores that can range from 0 to 21 for physical component and 0 to 15 for affective component. Higher scores indicate worse dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Changes in fatigue evaluated by the Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), a self reported rating scale including 9 items to measure how fatigue affects motivation, exercise, physical functioning, carrying out duties and how fatigue interferes with work, family, or social life. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale in which 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. Total score range from 9 to 63. Higher scores indicate greater fatigue severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in health related quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis specific version (SGRQ-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-I is a disease specific HRQoL measure with similar psychometric properties to the original SGRQ that is designed to be more relevant in patients with IPF. The questionnaire is divided in 3 domains: Symptoms (frequency and severity), Activity (activities that cause or are limited by breathlessness) and Impact (social functioning and psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease). Values of each domain as well as the total score value will be reported. Each item is weighted based on empirical data. Total score and scores in each domain can range from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate more limitations in quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health related quality of life using the chronic respiratory disease questionnaire (CRQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, nine weeks and 6 months following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CRQ consists of 20 items across 4 domains: Dyspnea (activities that cause breathlessness and are performed frequently), fatigue, emotional function and mastery ( the patient's feeling of control over their disease). Each domain includes four to seven items, and each item is scored on a 7-point Likert score. Total scores for each domain range from 4-35. Values of each domain will be reported. Lower scores indicate more limitations in quality of life.</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a scale with 14 items divided into two domains : anxiety symptoms (7 items) and depression symptoms (7 items). Each item can be scored from 0 to 3. Scores from each domain can vary from 0 to 21 and are stratified as follows: 0-7 (indicates absence of anxiety/depression symptoms); 8-10 ( presence of symptoms of anxiety and depression in moderate degree - borderline); 11 or more (significant number of anxiety/depression symptoms - confirmed cases). Score of each domain as well as number of confirmed cases will be reported.</description>
