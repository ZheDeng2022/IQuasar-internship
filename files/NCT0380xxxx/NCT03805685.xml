  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND's) remain an important complication after&#xD;
      surgery. After many years of speculating about the etiology of this complication, currently&#xD;
      studies are pointing to an inflammatory cascade being set in motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is designed to examine preoperative lifestyle factors (such as&#xD;
      sedentary behavior) associated with postoperative cognitive impairment in a group of patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives in our study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      identify perioperative risk factors for the development of PND's measure the incidence and&#xD;
      duration of perioperative neurocognitive disorders in a known high-risk group of elective&#xD;
      surgical patients measure a peripheral inflammatory marker (interleukin 6: IL-6) in the same&#xD;
      group of surgical patients&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Perioperative neurocognitive disorders remain an important complication after surgery. After&#xD;
      many years of speculating about the etiology of this complication, currently studies are&#xD;
      pointing to an inflammatory cascade being set in motion. Following the combination of&#xD;
      surgery/ anesthesia, high molecular group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is released. This&#xD;
      damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) binds to pattern recognition receptors (PRR) on&#xD;
      circulating bone marrow-derived monocytes (BM-DMs). Through an intracellular signaling&#xD;
      pathway, the transcription factor NF-kappaB passes into the nucleus, is activated and&#xD;
      increases expression and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These in turn disrupt the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier. Within the brain parenchyma the chemokine MCP-1 (also referred to as&#xD;
      CCL2) is upregulated and attracts the BM-DMs through binding to its receptor, CCR2. In turn,&#xD;
      this activates the resident quiescent microglia. Together, the BM-DMs and activated microglia&#xD;
      release HMGB1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines that disrupt long-term potentiation (LTP)&#xD;
      thereby blocking synaptic plasticity changes that are required for the cognitive functions of&#xD;
      learning and memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, treatment currently is lacking, however optimising lifestyle seems to be a&#xD;
      promising pathway in a murine population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is designed to examine preoperative lifestyle factors (such as&#xD;
      sedentary behavior) associated with postoperative cognitive impairment in a group of patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, patients will have a baseline MMSE (mini mental state examination)&#xD;
      assessment. At the same time, a standardized history form will be completed to document&#xD;
      pertinent patient information, with special emphasis on patterns of smoking and ethanol&#xD;
      consumption. French IPAQ data will be collected as well as the Geriatric Depression Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right before the surgery, a peripheral blood sample will be drawn (to analyse IL-6 levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction and Maintenance of General Anesthesia: All patients will receive general anesthesia&#xD;
      using an endotracheal tube to facilitate ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction of anesthesia will be performed using the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.V. (intravenous) Sufentanil 0.1- 0.2 mcg/kg I.V. Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg I.V. Propofol 2-3&#xD;
      mg/kg I.V. Rocuronium 0.6 -1.2 mg/kg General anesthesia will be maintained using 0.5-2.5%&#xD;
      sevoflurane in an O2:air mixture, the latter titrated to maintain an oxygen saturation (SpO2)&#xD;
      value of 96% or greater via pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional analgesia will be provided with I.V. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg and I.V. Diclofenac 1&#xD;
      mg/kg and, if necessary, I.V. sufentanil 5 mcg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive blood pressure will be measured on the upper arm, and a phenylephrine infusion&#xD;
      of 0-100 mcg/min will be administered to maintain mean arterial blood pressure within 20% of&#xD;
      the preoperative value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If muscle relaxation is required by the surgeon, I.V. rocuronium may be administered in 10-20&#xD;
      mg boluses. I.V. Sugammadex 4 mg/kg will be administered if needed to reverse neuromuscular&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the surgery, just prior to emergence from general anesthesia, each patient will&#xD;
      receive I.V. ondansetron 4 mg for anti-emetic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon emergence from anesthesia, all patients will be transferred to the post-operative&#xD;
      recovery unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depth of anesthesia monitoring will be done via BIS monitor. The BIS monitor value will be&#xD;
      maintained in the range of 40-60 to ensure uniform sedation levels in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Other Physiological Parameters During General Anesthesia: Heart rate, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate, non-invasive blood pressure, end-tidal CO2 levels,&#xD;
      inspired/end-tidal O2 levels, inspired/end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations, temperature, and&#xD;
      BIS values will be continuously monitored and recorded throughout the surgical procedure, to&#xD;
      ensure that the measured physiological parameters are within the normal range. Similarly, the&#xD;
      cumulative doses of all sedative and analgesic medications will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six hours post-operatively, a peripheral blood sample will be drawn again (to analyse IL-6&#xD;
      levels) as well as 24 hours post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once discharged from the hospital, patients will come for a follow-up visit at six weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively as well as three months. During this follow-up visit, patients will repeat&#xD;
      MMSE testing.&#xD;
