    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live bacteria which have been suggested to have beneficial effects not only on&#xD;
      gut function but also on psychological and cognitive functioning. This study will investigate&#xD;
      how a specific probiotic influences emotional and cognitive processing in participants with&#xD;
      low mood.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current antidepressant treatments, which largely target monoamine pathways, are efficacious&#xD;
      in treating many aspects of major depression, however it is estimated that more than 30% of&#xD;
      depressed patients fail to respond to standard antidepressant medications. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      strong clinical need to identify and investigate novel treatment strategies that target&#xD;
      different pathways involved in the pathophysiology of mood disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now compelling evidence for a link between the enteric microbiota and brain&#xD;
      function. The proliferation of the Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli strains in the large&#xD;
      intestine, have anxiolytic and mnemonic effects in both rodents and humans. The intake of&#xD;
      these bacteria as live cultures (probiotics) alters the expression of genes integral to&#xD;
      neurodevelopment and complex behaviours in rodents. For instance, the oral administration of&#xD;
      Bifidobacteria to rats elevated hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which&#xD;
      may underlie some antidepressant actions . At present, only several probiotics have been&#xD;
      examined, but it seems likely that of the 40,000 species in the gut, there will be others&#xD;
      with psychotropic properties. A multispecies probiotic (Bio-Kult) that contains several&#xD;
      species of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli is now available and of the 14 types of bacteria&#xD;
      packaged into a capsule, 50% have been shown to have psychotropic effects in animals. Dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with Bio-Kult therefore, presents as an optimal strategy to test the&#xD;
      influence of beneficial gut bacteria on emotional processing and cognition because, the&#xD;
      numerous types of bacteria ingested may have a synergistic effect on the brain and so convey&#xD;
      a 'stronger' action compared to single species probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translation from rodent to human investigations of probiotics has been surprisingly&#xD;
      robust, though many more human studies are necessary. In an important early investigation&#xD;
      male and female participants consumed either a fermented milk drink containing Lactobacillus&#xD;
      casei Shirota or a placebo. At the end of the three-week intervention, there were no overall&#xD;
      changes in self-reported affect. However, when only participants whose baseline mood scores&#xD;
      fell in the lowest third of the total range were analysed, probiotic supplementation resulted&#xD;
      in significantly more participants self-rating as happy rather than depressed, relative to&#xD;
      placebo. These results suggest that the emotional benefits of probiotics may be subject to&#xD;
      ceiling effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar effects have been observed in other investigations of mood. For instance, in a recent&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial, healthy participants consumed a placebo product or a mixture of&#xD;
      several probiotics (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W52, Lactobacillus&#xD;
      acidophilus W37, Lactobacillus brevis W63, Lactobacillus casei W56, Lactobacillus salivarius&#xD;
      W24, and Lactococcus lactis W19 and W58) over a period of four weeks. Relative to placebo,&#xD;
      probiotic-treated participants exhibited substantially reduced reactivity to sad mood&#xD;
      (assessed by the Leiden Index of Depression Sensitivity Scale), an effect that was&#xD;
      specifically attributable to fewer instances of rumination and aggressive cognitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomized and double-blind design, healthy volunteers consumed either a mixture of&#xD;
      probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum) or a placebo over 30&#xD;
      days, after which participants completed a range of self-report measures on mood and&#xD;
      distress. Participants also collected urine over 24 hours before and after the intervention,&#xD;
      enabling cortisol estimations. Relative to placebo, probiotic-treated participants showed&#xD;
      significant declines in self-reported negative mood and distress. Parallel to these changes&#xD;
      was a decrease in urinary free cortisol, which is suggestive of a potential mechanism&#xD;
      underlying the self-reported affective improvements. Interestingly, a follow-up analysis of&#xD;
      the individuals with the lowest stress (indexed by cortisol concentrations) showed similar&#xD;
      affective benefits to those with higher cortisol concentrations, to some extent contravening&#xD;
      the role of ceiling effects in determining probiotic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bio-Kult probiotic supplement has been selected for use in the present study because it&#xD;
      contains the greatest number of bacterial genera and species currently on the market. In&#xD;
      preliminary studies in rats, investigators have found that once daily Bio-Kult feeding for 3&#xD;
      weeks reduces circulating corticosterone, a stress hormone that is the corollary of human&#xD;
      cortisol. This appears to be consistent with the above human investigation. Thus, taking into&#xD;
      consideration its mentioned association with stress and mood, this probiotic supplement&#xD;
      provides an interesting tool to investigate effects on cognition and emotional processing,&#xD;
      particularly negative affective biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Negative affective biases in emotional processing are highly relevant to clinical mood&#xD;
      disorders and they are well-recognised in the aetiology and maintenance of depression, such&#xD;
      that depressed individuals are more likely to interpret, focus on and remember negative&#xD;
      compared to positive emotional cues in self-relevant neuropsychological tasks. Recent theory&#xD;
      suggests that over time this positive change in emotional bias contributes to improved mood,&#xD;
      and therefore the investigators will study the effect of Bio-Kult on emotional processing in&#xD;
      participants experiencing low mood, compared to a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be pre-screened using a standardized self-report measure on mood (Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire). After filling in the questionnaire, only those who score between 5 and&#xD;
      19 will be recruited into the study. Participants who are deemed non-eligible after filling&#xD;
      in this questionnaire will be notified via email (please see enclosed document 'email to&#xD;
      non-eligible participants'). The investigators expect to recruit sixty participants aged&#xD;
      between 18-55 years, who will be randomised to receive 4 weeks of Bio-Kult or a matched&#xD;
      placebo. This design will be made clear to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional and non-emotional cognition tests include computer-based tasks and questionnaires.&#xD;
      Sleep function will be measured by actigraphy. The investigators will also be collecting&#xD;
      biological data (blood and saliva) to assess cortisol and immune markers. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to complete questionnaires that are relevant to mood, and anxiety,&#xD;
      and to fill in a food diary to test for dietary effects.&#xD;
