      PROMETEO is a window opportunity, single arm, exploratory study to evaluate the effect of T-&#xD;
      VEC combined with Atezolizumab in women with operable early breast cancer who present&#xD;
      residual disease after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC). Other eligibility criteria include&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the efficacy (as measured by residual cancer burden [RCB] class 0/1 rate) of&#xD;
      Talimogene Laherparepvec with Atezolizumab given to subjects with operable early breast&#xD;
      cancer who present residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in the breast (pCRB) and&#xD;
           breast and axilla (pCRBL) at definitive surgery after neoadjuvant treatment with T-VEC&#xD;
           and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical and radiological ORR of breast tumors to TVEC- atezolizumab&#xD;
           given in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess RCB index in continuous variable and by the 4 RCB class (RCB0, RCB1, RCB2 and&#xD;
           RCB 3) after treatment with T-VEC and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing the expression of a gene signature tracking activated CD8 T-cells at surgery&#xD;
           after treatment with T-VEC and atezolizumab with residual disease after NAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of T-VEC in combination with atezolizumab as assessed by&#xD;
           incidence of treatment-emergent and treatment-related adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Translational and exploratory objectives are included.&#xD;
