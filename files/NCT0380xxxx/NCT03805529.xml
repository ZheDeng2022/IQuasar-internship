  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will help evaluate the effect of singing on heart rate variability and&#xD;
      endothelial function (markers of cardiac health). If study results are positive this will&#xD;
      support more research on the use of singing in cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this protocol is to evaluate the impact of singing on cardiac hemodynamics and&#xD;
      endothelial function, a marker of cardiovascular health and future cardiac risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to consist of an initial phone screen and 1 index visit. All&#xD;
      study-related procedures will be performed by a trained member of the research team. Dr.&#xD;
      Kulinski will provide oversight of all study related procedures and will be ultimately&#xD;
      responsible for validation of eligibility, and completion of all study-related tasks.&#xD;
      Patients in the cardiology clinics at Froedtert Hospital will be made aware of this study by&#xD;
      the clinic staff. If interested in participating, the patient will be provided with the study&#xD;
      coordinator's phone number and the study team will be provided with the patient's contact&#xD;
      information. The study team will first screen the potential subject via a phone conversation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject is deemed eligible based on the legibility criteria, they will be mailed a&#xD;
      copy of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) consent form to review. If after reviewing&#xD;
      information about the study, the potential subject remains interested, a 90-minute visit&#xD;
      (with reserved clinic exam room) will be scheduled for the same day as their upcoming clinic&#xD;
      appointment (or another day if preferred by the subject). Recruited subjects will be advised&#xD;
      to remain fasting (for a minimum of at least 3 hours) until their research study appointment&#xD;
      has been completed. They can drink water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will be called from the clinic waiting room at the time of their&#xD;
      appointment. The subject will be taken to a quiet clinic exam room for the visit. Phones,&#xD;
      beepers and other devices which can cause startling noises should be turned off. restrictive&#xD;
      clothing that could interfere with blood flow to the arms will be removed. We will ask the&#xD;
      subject to remove watches, rings, or other jewelry on the hands or fingers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline vital signs (resting heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry), weight and height&#xD;
      will be obtained. Blood pressure will be measured from the subject's control arm (dominant&#xD;
      arm preferred). The non-dominant arm is recommended as the tested (occluded) arm by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. The appropriately-sized (Bluetooth-capable) Heart Rate Variability (HRV) heart&#xD;
      rate sensor strap will be applied to the subject as shown (picture). It is recommended to&#xD;
      allow 5 minutes to pass between the time of blood pressure measurement and the commencement&#xD;
      of the EndoPAT recording. The subject will be asked to refrain from talking. Staff should&#xD;
      avoid talking to the subject and between themselves as much as possible. During this time,&#xD;
      the blood pressure cuff will be moved to the non-dominant upper arm, and subjects' fingers&#xD;
      will be placed into the probes with subject's forearms supported on the arm supports. The&#xD;
      index finger is recommended for the study; however, if this finger is unsuitable, a different&#xD;
      digit (except the thumb) may be used, so long as the same finger is used on both hands.&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained. Subject's positional comfort will be maximized.&#xD;
      The subject will be instructed to refrain from moving the fingers to the extent possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 5 minutes since blood pressure was taken, baseline EndoPAT measurements will be&#xD;
      obtained. Endo-PAT device will be placed on subjects to measure reactive hyperemia index&#xD;
      (RHI) according to a standard protocol (please also see uploaded Endo-PAT manual). Briefly,&#xD;
      this includes a stable period of baseline signal recording, followed by rapid inflation of&#xD;
      the blood pressure cuff to a supra-systolic level at least 60 mm Hg above systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure and no less than 200 mm Hg. Total cessation of blood flow will be verified by total&#xD;
      absence of EndoPAT signal from the occluded hand. This occlusion will be maintained for&#xD;
      exactly 5 minutes. This may cause mild stress and/or discomfort to the subject, who will be&#xD;
      closely monitored. After 5 minutes exactly, the cuff will be completely deflated as quickly&#xD;
      as possible. The EndoPAT signal will be recorded for an additional 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team member will assist the subject in completing pages 1-4 of the study&#xD;
      questionnaire, including demographics, medical history, current medications, current exercise&#xD;
      and singing habits and physical limitations and/or mobility issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the research team will verify Bluetooth connection to the research iPAD. NO subject&#xD;
      information will need to be entered on the iPAD. A 1-minute &quot;pre-singing&quot; baseline HRV&#xD;
      measurement will be obtained and recorded (refer to uploaded Data Collection Sheet). An&#xD;
      automated blood pressure, heart rate and pulse oximetry will be recorded. A pulse oximetry&#xD;
      finger probe will remain in place. In a seated position, the subject will watch and sing&#xD;
      along to the 10-minute coaching video that includes a warm-up with vocal exercise and the&#xD;
      lyrics to the Star-Spangled Banner, created by co-investigator Tanya Kruse Ruck, DMA,&#xD;
      assistant professor of voice at the University of Milwaukee. Approximately 7 minutes into the&#xD;
      (10-minute) singing video, a &quot;singing&quot; HRV measurement and automated blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and pulse oximetry will be obtained and recorded. The heart rate immediately after&#xD;
      singing will be recorded. A &quot;post-singing&quot; HRV measurement will be obtained. After the&#xD;
      1-minute post HRV measurement, the heart rate will be recorded (this will allow us to&#xD;
      determine 1-minute heart rate recovery). Another blood pressure and pulse oximetry will be&#xD;
      recorded. The pulse oximetry probe will be removed, and the subject's fingers connected to a&#xD;
      new set of EndoPAT disposable finger probes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second EndoPAT measurement will be started immediately according to the same protocol as&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be asked to rate the highest level of exertion while singing, according to&#xD;
      the Borg scale. The research team member will record their observation of the subject's&#xD;
      singing effort The subject will be asked to complete questions relating to their visit&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
