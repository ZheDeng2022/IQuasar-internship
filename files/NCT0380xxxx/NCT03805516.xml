    <textblock>
      This project examines the feasibility of a smartphone-based intervention to reduce obesity&#xD;
      and breast cancer risk among Chinese American women in San Francisco. The proposed&#xD;
      intervention is to use the mobile application and an activity tracker device to promote a&#xD;
      healthier lifestyle and physical activity. Ultimately, the findings will advance the NIH&#xD;
      mission of enhancing health promotion and disease prevention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the leading cause of death in women in the United States (US). Chinese Americans&#xD;
      are the largest ethnic group among Asian Americans. Although the incidence of breast cancer,&#xD;
      the most common cancer in women, has decreased among other U.S racial groups over the last 15&#xD;
      years, Chinese American women in California have experienced a significant increase of&#xD;
      incidence of 1.1% from 1998 to 2013. Studies have found that assimilation stress and obesity&#xD;
      are associated with increased risk for breast cancer in Chinese American women. There are no&#xD;
      existing interventions targeted at breast cancer prevention among premenopausal mothers with&#xD;
      abdominal obesity. Interventions tailored to an individual's cultural, lifestyle and social&#xD;
      support system are needed to reduce obesity and breast cancer risk. A smartphone-based&#xD;
      intervention provides a promising platform for obesity and cancer prevention. The overall&#xD;
      goal of this project is to test the feasibility of an obesity and breast cancer prevention&#xD;
      intervention among Chinese American women in San Francisco. The investigators will adapt the&#xD;
      Healthy Mothers Healthy Children: Technology-Based Intervention to Prevent Obesity to reduce&#xD;
      obesity and breast cancer risk in premenopausal women with abdominal obesity who have&#xD;
      dependent children in San Francisco. The proposed intervention (&quot;Smartphone-Based Cancer and&#xD;
      Obesity Prevention Program for Chinese Women: SCOPP-CW) includes 12 weekly educational&#xD;
      modules and six bi-weekly tailored messages delivered via WeChat, a popular private&#xD;
      communication app used by Chinese and Chinese Americans. The investigators propose to conduct&#xD;
      a pilot randomized control study (RCT) to assess the short-term efficacy of SCOPP-CW on&#xD;
      abdominal obesity, breast cancer knowledge and attitudes, weight-related behaviors (food&#xD;
      intake and physical activity), and metabolic risk (blood pressure, lipid profile, hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1c), which are associated with breast cancer. Thus the investigators propose the following&#xD;
      aims: (1) Aim 1: To estimate the preliminary efficacy of the SCOPP-CW intervention on the&#xD;
      primary outcomes (i.e. waist circumference and breast cancer knowledge and attitudes) and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (i.e. body mass index, self-efficacy, food intake, physical activity at&#xD;
      baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, and metabolic risk [blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, and&#xD;
      lipid panel]) at baseline and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess feasibility by understanding participants' acceptance, barriers to adherence&#xD;
      and recommendations for intervention using focus group interviews. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate that this intervention will have a significant impact on breast cancer prevention.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use the proposed pilot study's findings to conduct a larger scale&#xD;
      randomized trial (R01) to test the long-term efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;
