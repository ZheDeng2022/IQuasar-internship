      Settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection will be obtained from the data base available at the department of Oral&#xD;
      and Maxillofacial Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University. CBCT images will be&#xD;
      obtained from Egyptian patients who were referred to the CBCT unit in oral and maxillofacial&#xD;
      radiology department for different purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Prevalence of bifid canals - Classification and prevalence of observed types - Distance from&#xD;
      the involved teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources / Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled from the&#xD;
           computer database.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure parameters of the scans will vary depending on patients' sizes (according to&#xD;
           the manufacturer's recommendations).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both images with 0.2 and 0.4 voxel sizes will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For proper visualization of the mandibular canal, the reference lines will be rotated,&#xD;
           so that it lies perpendicular to the mandibular foramen on the axial cuts. Then,&#xD;
           scrolling through the corrected sagittal cuts will be performed to review the clearest&#xD;
           cut of the full course of the mandibular canal. Moreover, corrected coronal cuts will be&#xD;
           reviewed, to determine the exits of the accessory branches (buccal or lingual) if&#xD;
           present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT images will be interpreted by two oral and maxillofacial radiologists (with&#xD;
           different experiences) independently; blinded from demographic data of the patients and&#xD;
           from the results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The classification of Naitoh et al 2009 will be followed for the categorization of the&#xD;
           accessory branches:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Forward canal: emerging from the superior wall of the main canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bucco-lingual canal: emerging from the buccal or the lingual wall of the main&#xD;
                canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Dental canal: the end of the bifid canal is at the root apex of the molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Retromolar canal: emerging from the main canal, opening at the retromolar foramen&#xD;
                in the retromolar area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each radiologist will evaluate the images for presence of bifid canal twice with a time&#xD;
           lag of two weeks between the two reading sessions. If present, its configuration&#xD;
           (classification) will be registered. Any disagreement will be solved by consensus&#xD;
           between the two observers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If adherence or closeness of the canals to the teeth is detected, then the distance&#xD;
           between the canal and the involved tooth will be measured using built in measuring tool&#xD;
           in the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The measurements will be carried out by one observer (EE) and will be repeated 2 weeks&#xD;
           later for intra-observer reliability assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias&#xD;
&#xD;
      No source of bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of bifid mandibular canal in Egyptian&#xD;
      population. Based on the previous paper by Afsa and Rahmati 2017, the prevalence of bifid&#xD;
      mandibular canal was 31% Using a precision of 5, a design effect set at 1 with 95% CI&#xD;
      (confidence interval), a total sample size of 329 hemimandibles will be sufficient. The&#xD;
      sample size was calculated by Epi info 7 software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative Variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data: The distance between the canal and involved teeth and will be reported as&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using SPSS® v. 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software program. Pearson&#xD;
      Chi square and t-tests was performed for statistical analysis among gender, localization and&#xD;
      measurements. Categorical data will be described as numbers and percentages. A p value of&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
