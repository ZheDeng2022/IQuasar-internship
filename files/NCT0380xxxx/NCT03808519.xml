  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the influence of n3 PUFA supplementation on the rate of muscle&#xD;
      atrophy in older women undergoing 1 week of unilateral limb immobilization. Assessments in&#xD;
      skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle volume will also me made before, after and in&#xD;
      recovery from immobilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biological aging is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength resulting&#xD;
      in compromised metabolic function and mobility. Throughout life, individuals will also&#xD;
      experience periods of reduced physical activity/muscle disuse that independently lower muscle&#xD;
      mass and strength accelerating the aging process. More importantly, older adults (especially&#xD;
      older women) that experience periods of muscle disuse are unable to recover muscle mass and&#xD;
      strength. The losses in muscle mass with aging and disuse are underpinned by feeding-induced&#xD;
      declines in rates of muscle protein synthesis. Thus, strategies to enhance muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis could have clinical implications for those who wish to maintain metabolic health&#xD;
      and function during times of muscle disuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil has been shown to potentiate rates of muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis in response to simulated feeding in both younger and older adults. Fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation also has been efficacious in enhancing skeletal muscle strength during a&#xD;
      period of resistance exercise training. A previous study from our group demonstrated that&#xD;
      younger women supplementing with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil attenuated declines in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle mass and strength during 2 weeks of immobilization. However, no study has examined the&#xD;
      impact of fish oil supplementation to enhance muscle protein synthesis and offset declines in&#xD;
      muscle mass/strength during a period of immobilization in older women.&#xD;
