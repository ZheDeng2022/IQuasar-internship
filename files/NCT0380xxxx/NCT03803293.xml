    <textblock>
      This study is being done to better understand how genetic information related to drug dosing&#xD;
      and use can affect medical care of patients. By doing this study, the investigators are&#xD;
      developing and improving ways to incorporate information about drug related genetic variants&#xD;
      into the medical record.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to initiate a test of the concept that sequence information&#xD;
      can be coupled to electronic medical records (EMRs) for use in healthcare.The focus of this&#xD;
      study is on pharmacogenomics, given the role of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as major causes&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality, the increasing number of recognized variants included in FDA&#xD;
      labels as mediators of both efficacy and toxicity, and the relative lack of stigma attached&#xD;
      to carriers of variants in &quot;pharmacogenes&quot;. Preemptive sequencing of patients interrogates&#xD;
      large numbers of PGx variants and integrates clinically actionable results in a patient's&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR) for use by clinicians at the point-of-care. It is unknown,&#xD;
      however, whether integration of preemptive PGx data into the EHR will significantly improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Therefore, the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right&#xD;
      Time Using Genomic Data to Individualize Treatment Protocol (RIGHT Protocol) study was&#xD;
      designed to recruit a large group of patients for preemptive PGx testing, to develop the EHR&#xD;
      infrastructure to deliver clinical decision support in real time, and to study the effects of&#xD;
      integrating preemptive PGx testing into clinical practice on patient outcomes.&#xD;
