  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety of the use of the safety lancets: ergoLance and&#xD;
      Acti-Lance in the prevention of NSI and to evaluate the user's opinion with regards to the&#xD;
      handling characteristics of the medical devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The simulated use clinical study will involve healthcare professionals (HCPs) who routinely&#xD;
      use safety lancets to collect blood samples and lay persons.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The inclusion criteria for HCP and lay person evaluators have been chosen based on FDA&#xD;
        guidance:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  (HCP evaluators only) - evaluators who routinely use safety lancets to collect&#xD;
             capillary blood samples (prevention of the learning curve artifacts)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators will be United States (US) residents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators can read, write, and speak English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators are at least 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators are able to understand and provide signed consent for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators are willing to comply with the study protocol, including being willing to&#xD;
             answer questions and complete questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evaluators have no concerns about the ability to perform the simulated skin pricking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lay person evaluators will have a diverse range of ages (18+ years), socioeconomic&#xD;
        statuses, and race/ethnic backgrounds. UL-Wiklund will recruit some lay person evaluators&#xD;
        with reduced vision and dexterity. Users without safety lancet experience may also be&#xD;
        included in this simulated clinical use study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        HCPs:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They do not routinely use safety lancets to collect capillary blood samples,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They cannot read, write, and speak English,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They or a family member have a business or consulting relationship with a&#xD;
             pharmaceutical or medical device company, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They have participated in a product evaluation or marketing study involving safety&#xD;
             lancets within the last six months&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lay people:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  They cannot read, write, and speak English,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  They have participated in a product evaluation or marketing study involving safety&#xD;
             lancets within the last six months&#xD;
