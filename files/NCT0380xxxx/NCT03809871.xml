  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who have signed up to the Watford Football Club Community and Education Trust&#xD;
      Weight management programme called Shape Up will be approached to see if they would like to&#xD;
      take part in this research study. Their participation in the Shape Up programme will not be&#xD;
      affected if they do not choose to opt in to the research component. Fifty participants will&#xD;
      be recruited and randomised in to one of two groups. One group will be the control group and&#xD;
      they will undertake the Shape Up programme as normal and will be asked to complete some&#xD;
      questionnaires in week 1, week 12 and then at 12 weeks follow up. The intervention group will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the same questionnaires and will also have a venous blood sample taken&#xD;
      at week 1, 12 and then at 12 weeks follow up. This is for measures of cholesterol, sugar,&#xD;
      vitamin D, vitamin B12 and iron. The participants will receive a report from a medical doctor&#xD;
      in layman terms on these results a week later and will have access to their data on an online&#xD;
      portal set up by Medichecks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight management programme is based on a behaviour change programme where the&#xD;
      participants attend a 90-minute session for 12 weeks, and they are then supported for another&#xD;
      12 weeks following the end of the supervision. The participants have weight and BMI measured&#xD;
      at week 1, 12 and 12 weeks follow up. Each session consists of an education component&#xD;
      followed by an exercise component. Initially, the education part is longer and the exercise&#xD;
      is shorter, but as the programme progresses the education part becomes shorter and the&#xD;
      exercise longer. The education programme includes topics such as healthy eating, increased&#xD;
      physical activity and stress. The exercise programme includes whole body activities such as&#xD;
      circuit training as well as other group exercise such as football.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will include The Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire which will&#xD;
      identify the motivation behind the participants' health. A general health questionnaire which&#xD;
      is a subjective measure of health (Euro qol EQ-5). The Mental Component Summary of the 12-&#xD;
      item Short Form (SF12) which measures emotional quality of life. Physical activity will be&#xD;
      measured through the short Active Lives Questionnaire. All these questionnaires have been&#xD;
      attached as appendices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete an exit telephone interview from the study to determine&#xD;
      qualitative feedback on their experience of the study and to explore whether the biomarkers&#xD;
      influenced their motivation to change their lifestyle. Some example questions have been&#xD;
      attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is just a feasibility study, therefore no hypothesis testing will be undertaken.&#xD;

    <measure>Behaviour regulation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the behaviour regulation by measuring autonmoic regulation versus controlled regulation through the use of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire.&#xD;
An average of the scores on the subscale for autoregulation and also for the controlled regulation questions will be calculated. Scores will be from 1-7 for both sub scales.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective health measure</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A standardised measure of health status will be calculated using the Euro qol EQ-5 questionnaire. There are 5 dimensions to the questionnaire (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) and each is rated from 1-5. An average of the 5 is calculated as a general health score. A visual analogue scale is also presented for a self related health measure and this is from 0-100. 100 being the best health you can imagine and 0 being the worst health you can imagine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Amount of physical activity measured through the short Active Lives questionnaire. The amount of minutes where breathing is increased will be calculated per week.&#xD;
For each activity that respondents indicate was sufficient to raise their breathing rate, the total number of days is multiplied by the usual minutes spent undertaking the activity to give a measure of total minutes over the 7-day period for that activity.&#xD;
The respondent's final score is calculated by summing all activities which were sufficient to raise breathing rate, as follows:&#xD;
(Days of walking * usual minutes of walking IF sufficient to raise breathing rate) + (Days of cycling * usual munities of cycling IF sufficient to raise breathing rate) + (days of sport, fitness or dance * usual minutes of sport, fitness or dance IF sufficient to raise breathing rate).</description>
