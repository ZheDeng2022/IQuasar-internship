  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in adult patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). The study plans to recruit 300 subjects in&#xD;
      the United States and Canada in which the participating physician has decided to treat with&#xD;
      INFLECTRA. The study will evaluate treatment patterns, adherence, disease activity, remission&#xD;
      status, relapse status, treatment satisfaction, and healthcare resource utilization. Patient&#xD;
      outcomes will be assessed at four time points (quarterly) for approximately 52 weeks after&#xD;
      the decision to initiate treatment with INFLECTRA.&#xD;

        A total of 300 patients are planned to be enrolled from approximately 30 40 physician&#xD;
        clinics. Enrollment is planned to be competitive, but an upper limit of 20 patients per&#xD;
        site per cohort will be applied to maintain the generalizability of the study. This is an&#xD;
        observational study; therefore the decision to treat a patient with INFLECTRA must be made&#xD;
        prior to a decision to enroll them in this study. Patients are eligible to participate if&#xD;
        they have:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Initiated therapy with INFLECTRA as their first biologic;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Switched to INFLECTRA while in remission on a stable dose of REMICADE; or,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Switched to INFLECTRA from another biologic, due to non responsiveness, intolerance,&#xD;
             or other reasons.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants included had inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a confirmed diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD): 1) those who newly initiated therapy with Inflectra as their first biologic, 2) transitioned to Inflectra from Remicade, 3) switched to Inflectra from other biologics. Total 118 participants were enrolled and assessed for eligibility. Out of 118, only 115 participants received Inflectra and were eligible to be included in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants initiated or switched to Inflectra in a real-world setting and it was a decision made by physician irrespective of this study. Inflectra dose was per summary of product characteristics as determined by physician, for every 8 weeks. Participants were observed and evaluated prospectively at 4 study visits (visit 1= Day 1, visit 2= Day 90, visit 3= Day 180, visit 4= Day 365; all visits were from first dose of Inflectra) for approximately (approx.) 1 year after treatment with Inflectra.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire for Absenteeism Score at Visit 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>WPAI: participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which UC and CD affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. The scores/outcomes derived are: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism) and daily regular activity impairment. All outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages on a score range of 0 (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire for Absenteeism Score at Visit 2, 3 and 4</title>
          <description>WPAI: participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which UC and CD affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. The scores/outcomes derived are: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism) and daily regular activity impairment. All outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages on a score range of 0 (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
          <population>The full analysis set included all participants who signed the informed consent and met the study inclusion/exclusion criteria in the study design, or the subgroups as following: those who newly initiated Inflectra, transitioned to Inflectra from Remicade or switched to Inflectra from other biologics. Here 'number analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for each specified category.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WPAI Questionnaire for Overall Work Impairment Score at Visit 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>WPAI: participant rated questionnaire to determine the degree to which UC and CD affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work. The scores/outcomes derived are: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism) and daily regular activity impairment. All outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages on a score range of 0 (no impairment) to 100 (maximum impairment), higher scores indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM vII) for Convenience Score at Visit 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>TSQM vII was used to assess experiences of participants with medication on 3 dimensions: convenience, effectiveness and side effects. Convenience score utilized items 7 and 8. Items 7 and 8 were scored on the following scale: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= dissatisfied, 4= somewhat satisfied, 5= satisfied, 6= very satisfied, 7= extremely satisfied. Convenience score was calculated using formula = ([Sum of Item 7 + Item 8] - 2)/12*100. Convenience score ranged from 0 (no convenience) to 100 (best level of convenience). Higher convenience scores indicated more convenience with medication and greater satisfaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II (TSQM vII) for Side Effects Score at Visit 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>TSQM vII was used to assess experiences of participants with medication on 3 dimensions: convenience, effectiveness and side effects. Side effects score utilized items 4, 5 and 6. Items 4, 5 and 6 were scored on the following scale: 1= extremely dissatisfied, 2= very dissatisfied, 3= somewhat dissatisfied, 4= slightly dissatisfied, 5= not at all dissatisfied. Side effects score was calculated using formula = ([Sum of Item 4 + Item 5 + Item 6] - 3)/12*100, if one item is missing then: ([Sum of two completed items from 4 to 6] - 2]/8*100. Side effects score ranged from 0 (maximum side effects) to 100 (no side effects). Higher side effects scores indicated less side effects with medication and greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of CD, were said to have remission when Harvey-Bradshaw index (HBI) score was less than (&lt;) 5. HBI measures 5 parameters; the general well-being (0= very well to 4= terrible), abdominal pain (0= none to 3= severe), number of liquid stools per day (0 to no maximum score), presence of an abdominal mass on physical exam (0= none to 3= definite and tender), and whether there are any complications (0= no complications, 1= arthralgia, 2= uveitis, 3= erythema nodosum, 4= aphthous ulcer, 5= pyoderma gangrenosum, 6= anal fissure, 7= new fistula, 8= abscess). The total HBI score: sum of all the 5 individual parameters, the minimum score is 0 and there was no pre-specified maximum score as it depended on the number of liquids stools. Higher HBI scores = greater disease activity.</description>

Higher HBI scores = greater disease activity.</description>

        <description>Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of UC, were said to have remission when there was a reduction of partial Mayo score (PMS) of &lt;3 points from baseline. PMS comprised of 3 parameters: stool frequency (0= normal number of stools to 3= having &gt;=5 stools more than normal), most severe rectal bleeding of the day (0= no blood seen to 3= pure blood passed), and physician's global assessment (0= normal to 3= severe disease). The total PMS was the sum of all the parameters, score ranging from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease). Higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Ulcerative Colitis Response at Visit 1, 2, 3 and 4</title>
        <description>Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of UC, were said to have response when there was a reduction of partial Mayo score of &gt;=3 points from baseline. PMS comprised of 3 parameters: stool frequency (0= normal number of stools to 3= having &gt;=5 stools more than normal), most severe rectal bleeding of the day (0= no blood seen to 3= pure blood passed), and physician's global assessment (0= normal to 3= severe disease). The total PMS was the sum of all the parameters, score ranging from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease). Higher scores indicated more severe disease.</description>

        <description>In this outcome measure, number of participants who had infections as adverse events are reported under 2 categories: 1) all infections (including both serious and non-serious adverse events) and 2) serious infections (serious adverse event). An adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event was any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: resulted in death, was life threatening (immediate risk of death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions), resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
