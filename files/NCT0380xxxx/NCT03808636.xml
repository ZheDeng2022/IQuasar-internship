      Introduction M. tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health problem in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom and abroad. A total of 7832 cases were reported in the UK in 2013. Of those that were&#xD;
      culture confirmed (59%) the rate of drug resistance was 7.8%. In certain populations the&#xD;
      incidence of drug resistance is higher: homeless patients, those who have been in prison and&#xD;
      particularly those from Eastern Europe. Typically the patient will be on treatment for 18&#xD;
      months or more and the PHE has estimated the cost of this as being upto Â£50000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current diagnosis rests on the culture of the M. tuberculosis and drug sensitivity testing.&#xD;
      This can take six or eight weeks, meaning that patients may be on ineffective therapy for&#xD;
      some time, leading to further transmission and deterioration of the patient's clinical&#xD;
      condition. If the speed of culture of the organism could be increased substantially then the&#xD;
      delays in diagnosis and getting the correct treatment started could be reduced. In addition&#xD;
      if the percentage of culture confirmed cases could be increased then the patient and&#xD;
      clinician would benefit. Often patients are started on TB treatment without a confident&#xD;
      culture confirmed diagnosis. Other mycobacteria may masquerade as TB causing delays in&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment uncertainty before the confirmed culture result becomes available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tuberculosis will be diagnosed in the usual way, by routine analysis of appropriate samples,&#xD;
      including standard PCR and culture. Patients who are thought to have or have been confirmed&#xD;
      to have tuberculosis will be recruited to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be managed in the usual way according to the standard protocols for&#xD;
      treating tuberculosis as directed by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the diagnosis of tuberculosis is a lengthy process requiring several weeks of&#xD;
      culture of the organism. Identification of a quicker or easier test that might be performed&#xD;
      on samples would have great benefits to future patients. The investigators of this research&#xD;
      are looking to see if this different method of culture will significantly increase the speed&#xD;
      of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim To quantitate the speed of new culture method and compare with conventional&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study and no additional interventions will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 200 sputum samples obtained from eligible enrolled patients in duplicate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine Sample will be labelled and processed by the local NHS Trust Medical&#xD;
           Microbiology Department using conventional methods and validated SOP's, as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test sample will be link anonymised and processed as quickly as practical in a separate&#xD;
           Category III research laboratory at SGUL by trained research staff.This will extract&#xD;
           mycobacteria from the sample which will then be inoculated into a novel media&#xD;
           supplemented with growth additives (TiKa Medium). Each Test Sample will then be randomly&#xD;
           allocated to one of three different commercially available culture bottle systems (MGIT,&#xD;
           BacTAlert, VersaTrek) and processed as usually recommended by the manufacturer for up to&#xD;
           42 days. Time to positivity (TTP) will be recorded and the identity of the growing&#xD;
           culture verified using conventional (molecular probe) methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TTP values will be collated in a database. At the end of the study this database will be&#xD;
      compared with retrospective data from routine mycobacterial culture results determined from&#xD;
      the original parallel samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will determine the degree of improvement (as determined in days to positivity)&#xD;
      delivered by each method and will test the hypothesis that the TiKa Medium can significantly&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.05) improve the recovery of non-culturable phenotypes and make culturable phenotypes of&#xD;
      pathogenic mycobacteria grow faster from clinical samples, than previously observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no exceptions (waivers) to eligibility criteria prior to participant inclusion&#xD;
      into the study. Any questions raised about eligibility should be addressed prior to entering&#xD;
      the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Any patient with possible or diagnosed tuberculosis who is capable to&#xD;
      give informed consent will be offered to be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Any patient under 18 or who is unable to give informed consent will be&#xD;
      excluded from this trial. Any persons under detention will not be included. Any patient who&#xD;
      is unable to give a sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient may withdraw from the study at any time. Any patients who are lost to follow up&#xD;
      will be contacted and attempts will be made to re-engage them with services as is standard&#xD;
      practice for patients with tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment at a site will only commence once evidence of the following&#xD;
      approval/essential documents are in place:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The main REC approval, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Final sponsorship and host site approval,&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who wish to enter the study will be fully screened and consented by the&#xD;
      Chief Investigator, or one of the qualified clinicians involved in the study as Clinical&#xD;
      Co-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached by the routine clinical team and asked if they would be&#xD;
      interested. If they express an interest one of the researchers will contact them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be taken by a member of the research team who has had experience, training and&#xD;
      qualifications in Good Clinical Practice around taking consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form (ICF) along with a copy of the Patient Information&#xD;
      Sheet (PIS) will be given to the study participant. An original signed &amp; dated consent form&#xD;
      will be retained in the medical notes and a copy will be placed in the ISF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment data will be collected in pseudoanonymised form as per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be handled in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The Case Report&#xD;
      Forms (CRFs) will not bear the participant's name or other directly identifiable data. The&#xD;
      participant's trial Identification Number (ID) only, will be used for identification. The&#xD;
      sponsor Subject ID log JREOLOG0002 can be used to cross reference participant's identifiable&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case Report Forms will be designed by the CI and the final version will be approved by the&#xD;
      Sponsor. All data will be entered legibly in black ink with a ball-point pen as per GCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The agreed archiving period for this trial will be 5 years. This will include any study&#xD;
      databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to be enrolled in the study has been calculated using a standard power&#xD;
      calculation based upon previous experimental data suggesting that an effect size of &gt;0.3&#xD;
      would be achievable within the standard deviation expected using this protocol at an error&#xD;
      probability of 0.05. This would estimate a 0.95 power to be 20% below the number of sample&#xD;
      expected to collect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: To show statistical difference (P&lt;0.05) between Test and Routine group&#xD;
      sample TTP data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: Summary of baseline data and flow of patients. The researchers are&#xD;
      proposing to enroll 200 patients over a period of 9 months. The research site is a centre of&#xD;
      excellence and referral for tuberculosis and the researchers fully expect to meet this&#xD;
      participant number. There is no differential patient treatment involved in this study and&#xD;
      there will be no requirement to randomise patients within the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test samples however will be randomised post processing for inclusion in each of the three&#xD;
      culture machines (arms) using a random number generated chart (n=3) limited to provide equal&#xD;
      numbers to each test arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is fully financed with funding from Innovate UK&#xD;
