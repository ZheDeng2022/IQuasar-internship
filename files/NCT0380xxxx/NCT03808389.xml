  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and due to the&#xD;
      lack of early diagnosis and effective therapy, represents a large burden for our society and&#xD;
      healthcare system. The last years, it became increasingly apparent that non-motor symptoms,&#xD;
      including gastrointestinal dysfunction, precede the onset of the typical PD motor symptoms by&#xD;
      several years. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that PD, and more specifically the&#xD;
      aggregation of alpha-synuclein, starts in the gut before spreading to the brain.&#xD;
      Additionally, recent microbiome studies consistently showed microbiota differences between PD&#xD;
      patients and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this project is to address the impact of gut dysbiosis and the&#xD;
      restoration of gut homeostasis by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the development&#xD;
      and progression of PD. We will identify PD-specific changes in microbiota composition and gut&#xD;
      inflammation and determine the effect of a 'microbiome-reset' approach through FMT in PD&#xD;
      patients on the identified changes and more importantly on disease symptoms and progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease will be investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At time of FMT, forty patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to the&#xD;
      treatment arm (healthy donor stool) or placebo arm (own stool). Transplantation will be&#xD;
      performed through nasojejunal administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors for this study will be recruited from a healthy donor pool who will donate stool after&#xD;
      clearance of a strict inclusion protocol which will assess the presence of any infectious&#xD;
      diseases. Donor stool will be frozen and stored until day of FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened for relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria and will have to&#xD;
      sign an informed consent before admission to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior and on a regular basis following the FMT participants will be evaluated through&#xD;
      neurological clinical examination and standardized clinical scoring scales including&#xD;
      MDS-UPDRS, PDQ-39, NMSS and MoCA. Stool samples will be taken regularly and stored at -80Â°C&#xD;
      for microbiome analysis. Blood will be collected for determining relevant markers. All&#xD;
      participants will also undergo sampling for oral and nasal microbiome. Follow-up will&#xD;
      continue for a total duration of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to FMT, all participants will undergo a colonoscopy to exclude contra-indications for&#xD;
      FMT and to collect mucosa-adherent microbial samples and gastrointestinal tissue biopts. This&#xD;
      colonoscopy will be repeated once, one year following the FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint in this study will be a change in clinical status measured through the&#xD;
      MDS-UPDRS. Additionally, motor and non-motor symptoms will be correlated with serum markers&#xD;
      of inflammation and gut and central nervous system barrier function, microbiota changes and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal biopsy analysis of inflammation.&#xD;

    <description>The MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living; 13 items), Part II (motor experiences of daily living; 13 items), Part III (motor examination; 33 scores based on 18 items, several with right, left or other body distribution scores) and Part IV (motor complications; 6 items). Each item has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Part III will be clinically scored in an OFF-medication state. Subscales are analyzed separately.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in non-motors symptoms as scored on the Non-motor symptoms scale for Parkinson's disease (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Non-motor symptoms scale for Parkinson's disease (NMSS). Non-motor symptoms are assessed over the last month. Each symptom is scored with respect to:&#xD;
Severity: 0 = None; 1 = Mild: symptoms present but causes little distress or disturbance to patient; 2 = Moderate: some distress or disturbance to patient; 3 = Severe: major source of distress or disturbance to patient.&#xD;
Frequency: 1 = Rarely (&lt;1/wk); 2 = Often (1/wk); 3 = Frequent (several times per week); 4 = Very Frequent (daily or all the time).&#xD;
NMSS contains nine dimensions: cardiovascular (2 items), sleep/fatigue (4 items), mood/cognition (6 items), perceptual problems (3 items), attention/memory (3 items), gastrointestinal (3 items), urinary (3 items), sexual function (2 items), and miscellaneous (4 items).&#xD;
Subscores are calculated through multiplication of frequency x severity. Total score is calculated by adding all subscores, range 0-360.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in quality of life as scored on the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire. All 39 questions are coded in the same way: 0 = Never; 1 = Occasionally; 2 = Sometimes; 3 = Often; 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable).&#xD;
The different dimensions are mobility (10 items), activities of daily living (6 items), emotional well being (6 items), stigma (4 items), social support (3 items), cognition (4 items), communication (3 items) and bodily discomfort (3 items).&#xD;
Each dimension is calculated as a scale from 0 to 100 (0 = no problem at all; 100 = maximum level of problem). Formula for scoring each dimension = (sum of scores of each question in dimension)/ (4 x number of questions in dimension) x 100.&#xD;
The Single Index score: PDQ-SI= summing the eight dimensions and then dividing by eight.&#xD;
