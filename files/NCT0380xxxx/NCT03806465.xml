  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine is being introduced sub-nationally in phased pilot&#xD;
      introductions through the EPI programmes in Malawi Ghana and Kenya. Vaccine introduction is&#xD;
      by the respective MoH in selected areas randomly assigned to receive the vaccine at the&#xD;
      beginning of the pilots. In the context of this programmatic activity, the Malaria Vaccine&#xD;
      Pilot Evaluation (MVPE) registered here as observational evaluations during early vaccine&#xD;
      introduction, include a series of 3 household surveys, and sentinel hospital and community&#xD;
      mortality surveillance, building on routine systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These observational evaluations will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The programmatic feasibility of delivering a 4 dose schedule;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety in routine use, with focus on cerebral malaria and meningitis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The impact of the malaria vaccine in routine use on severe malaria and all-cause&#xD;
           mortality&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An evaluation of the pilot implementation of RTS,S/AS01 through routine health systems in&#xD;
      moderate to high malaria transmission settings in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. In the context of&#xD;
      the new vaccine introduction, the Ministries of Health in the three countries will introduce&#xD;
      the malaria vaccine (RTS,S/AS01) in a phased fashion (with some areas introducing the malaria&#xD;
      vaccine first and the latter half, after the evaluation period) building on the national&#xD;
      immunization programmes which routinely deliver vaccines and expanding the schedule of their&#xD;
      routine EPI contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the pilot implementation will run for a total of about 46 months in each&#xD;
      country. This will focus on the three main primary objectives of feasibility, safety and&#xD;
      impact. The pilot implementation assumes that a total of 46-60 clusters will be identified&#xD;
      per country, evenly split between implementation and comparison areas, with each cluster&#xD;
      contributing approximately 4,000 children per year to the evaluation of RTS,S/AS01. Hence a&#xD;
      total of approximately 120,000 children will receive the RTS,S vaccine in each country in&#xD;
      each year. Evaluation data will be collected in the following ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMMUNITY BASED MORTALITY SURVEILLANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community based mortality surveillance will be established across the pilot evaluation areas&#xD;
      to enable the evaluation of the impact of the malaria vaccine on all-cause mortality. This&#xD;
      will use a network of Village Reporters (VR) to document all deaths among children aged up to&#xD;
      48 months in the implementation and comparison areas. Once the death is notified, a&#xD;
      standardized, WHO-approved Verbal Autopsy (VA) will be performed, according to WHO guidelines&#xD;
      and locally acceptable practices. The VA will focus is on confirming death, age and&#xD;
      vaccination status. The total number of clusters per country is expected to range from 46-60.&#xD;
      Assuming 4,000 children born per cluster per year, 30 months of vaccination and a total&#xD;
      follow-up of 44 months, each cluster will contribute 23,134 person years at risk (pyar),&#xD;
      allowing for 1% mortality in the first month of life, and 0.08% mortality for every month&#xD;
      after the first month. This equates to a mortality risk of 22.2 per 1000 for children aged 5&#xD;
      to 36 months. A mortality risk of 21 per 1,000 equates to a rate, over 2.5 years, of 8.489455&#xD;
      per 1,000 pyar. Based on a minimum mortality rate of 8.5 per 1000 pyar, 23 clusters in each&#xD;
      arm, each with an annual birth cohort of approximately 4,000 subjects, would have 80% power&#xD;
      to detect, at the 5% significance level, a decrease of at least 10% in overall mortality in&#xD;
      each country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this mortality risk, the pilot evaluation it is estimated to have approximately 80%&#xD;
      power to detect an interaction between gender and treatment of 1.15 (i.e an increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality in girls of 1.035), compared with the 1.9-fold increase in risk among girls&#xD;
      receiving RTS,S/AS01 in the RTS,S Phase 3 trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY (CROSS SECTIONAL HOUSEHOLD) SURVEYS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three household surveys will be conducted to evaluate the programmatic feasibility to deliver&#xD;
      a 4 dose schedule at baseline (before vaccination starts), 18 months and 30 months after&#xD;
      start of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 100 houses per cluster will estimate the cluster-specific coverage of&#xD;
      RTS,S/AS01 to within 10% (ie 95% CI from 40 to 60%) using a conservative estimate of 50%&#xD;
      coverage and a high response rate above 95% in each cluster. Assuming a design effect of 1.5&#xD;
      between clusters, the overall precision in RTS,S/AS01 and coverage estimates of other&#xD;
      vaccines over the pilot programme's implementation and comparison areas will be 2% (ie 95%CI&#xD;
      48% to 52%) in each country. This will result in 15,800 (6,600 in Ghana, 4,600 each in Kenya&#xD;
      and Malawi) households included in the surveys. The second household survey may be powered to&#xD;
      generate coverage estimates in each arm, rather than in each cluster, to within ±2% of the&#xD;
      true value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SENTINEL HOSPITAL SURVEILLANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four to eight sentinel hospitals will be identified in each country to collect information on&#xD;
      a larger scale on the safety of the malaria vaccine in children aged less than 5 years&#xD;
      admitted with a focus on cases of cerebral malaria and meningitis. The catchment area of each&#xD;
      hospital (approximately a cluster) is expected to have an annual birth cohort of, and provide&#xD;
      services for, approximately 4,000 children in the MVPE. Hence a total catchment area of&#xD;
      48,000 children in implementation areas and another 48,000 children in comparison areas will&#xD;
      contribute to the hospital-based evaluation of safety across the programme (three countries,&#xD;
      Ghana, Kenya and Malawi). This is expected to provide 80% power to detect a 1.7-fold increase&#xD;
      in risk of cerebral malaria and 2.6-fold increase in risk of meningitis. Children admitted to&#xD;
      the sentinel hospitals in this age group will be assessed for severe malaria and meningitis&#xD;
      using a standardised surveillance approach.&#xD;
