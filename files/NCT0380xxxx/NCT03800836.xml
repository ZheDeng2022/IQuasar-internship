  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study consisting of four cohorts in this setting. In Cohort 1, the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of ipatasertib (ipat) in combination with atezolizumab (atezo) and paclitaxel (pac)&#xD;
      or nab-paclitaxel will be evaluated for participants with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have not previously received chemotherapy. In Cohort&#xD;
      2, ipatasertib and atezolizumab (with no chemotherapy), will be administered to participants&#xD;
      with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. In Cohort 3, the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      ipatasertib, atezolizumab, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) (Ipat + Atezo + AC) followed&#xD;
      by Ipat + Atezo + Pac will be evaluated in participants with locally advanced Type 2-4 (T2-4)&#xD;
      TNBC. In Cohort 4, the safety and efficacy of Ipat + Atezo + Pac will be evaluated in&#xD;
      participants with PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand-1) positive locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      TNBC that is not amenable to resection and who have not previously received chemotherapy in&#xD;
      the advanced setting.&#xD;
