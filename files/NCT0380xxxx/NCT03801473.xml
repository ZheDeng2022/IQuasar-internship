      The aim of this study is to compare conventional neurorehabilitation with robot-assisted gait&#xD;
      training program in terms of fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gait disturbances are common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Nowadays, gait training&#xD;
      with robot assisted technology is used for rehabilitation. In several studies conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation was compared with robot assisted rehabilitation program, and they found no&#xD;
      superior effects of robot assisted walking program. In this study we aimed to compare these&#xD;
      modalities in terms of fatigue, anxiety and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related quality of life measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items.&#xD;
This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores, and two additional single-item measures. The subscales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function.&#xD;
The summary scores are the physical health composite summary and the mental health composite summary.&#xD;
Each composite summary scored 0-100. Higher values indicate better QoL.</description>
