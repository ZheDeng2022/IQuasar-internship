  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although multisensory and cognitive stimulation therapy was shown as an effective&#xD;
      intervention in improving cognition and behavioral symptoms of people with dementia (PWD), it&#xD;
      is not commonly found as an element in the previous dyadic interventions. It was believed&#xD;
      that the involvement of the family caregivers in multisensory and cognitive stimulation&#xD;
      therapy could produce additional benefits to both PWD and caregivers by enhancing their&#xD;
      interactions. This study, therefore, aims to explore the feasibility and the effects of a&#xD;
      home based dyadic multisensory and cognitive stimulation (MCS) program for the PWD and their&#xD;
      family caregivers. A two- arm quasi-experimental study design will be adopted and 60 subjects&#xD;
      ( 30 pairs of dyads-PWD and caregivers) will be recruited (15 pairs in each group). The&#xD;
      Intervention group will attend the home-based dyadic MCS group, while the control group will&#xD;
      receive the usual care. The outcomes measurements of caregivers (positive caregiving&#xD;
      experience, perceived stress, caregiver burden, and quality of life) and PWD (cognitive&#xD;
      function and behavioral symptoms) will be assessed at baseline, immediately post&#xD;
      intervention, and 3 month-follow up. To understand the therapeutic components and identify&#xD;
      the strengths, limitations and difficulties of the home based dyadic MCS program, process&#xD;
      evaluation will be conducted through semi-structured focus group interviews with 15&#xD;
      participants from the MCS group. It is hypothesized that the MCS group will have a&#xD;
      significant improvement on positive caregiving experience, perceived stress, caregiver&#xD;
      burden, and quality of life of caregivers and cognitive function and behavioral symptoms of&#xD;
      PWD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dementia becomes a major issue of worldwide concern. According to the World Alzheimer Report,&#xD;
      the number of patients with dementia (PWD) worldwide was estimated at 46.8 million and it&#xD;
      will be triply projected to 131.5 million in 2050. Similarly, dementia is also a prominent&#xD;
      problem in Hong Kong. One in every three local seniors who are over 895 years of age suffered&#xD;
      from dementia. The prevalence of PWD in Hong Kong will have a triple increase from 100,000&#xD;
      cases in 2009 to 300,000 cases in 2039.As the disease progresses, PWD will gradually lose&#xD;
      their self-care ability and their cognitive function. In addition, behavioral symptoms such&#xD;
      as agitation, delusion, and anxiety will appear on the sufferers. The caring burden and the&#xD;
      uncertainty about the disease progress result in high levels of caring stress and negative&#xD;
      emotion on family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, different psychosocial interventions have been designed for the PWD and their&#xD;
      family caregivers to promote their psychological well-being. The dyadic intervention is&#xD;
      deemed as one of the effective approach due to its mutual influence between the PWD and their&#xD;
      family caregivers. A systematic review with 40 clinical trials found that dyadic approach can&#xD;
      be integrated into different interventions such as psycho-education, and caring skills&#xD;
      training . Although cognitive stimulation and multisensory stimulation therapy are regarded&#xD;
      as an effective intervention for the cognition and the behavioral symptoms of the PWD, it is&#xD;
      not commonly found as an element in the previous dyadic interventions. Involving family&#xD;
      caregivers in a cognitive training can have some potential benefits for both caregivers and&#xD;
      the PWD (e.g. cognitive function of the PWD and the quality of life) . The involvement of the&#xD;
      family caregivers in the cognitive and multisensory stimulation therapy could promote the&#xD;
      interactions between the PWD and caregivers which may produce additional benefits for both&#xD;
      caregivers and the PWD, compared with the traditional cognitive stimulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to explore the feasibility and effects of the home based dyadic Multisensory&#xD;
      and cognitive stimulation (MCS) intervention for the PWD and their family caregivers. From&#xD;
      this, the following research objectives were derived:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the recruitment rate the and adherence rate of home based dyadic MCS program&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore the feasibility in delivering the home based MCS program by the family&#xD;
           caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the preliminary effects of dyadic MCS program for family caregivers of PWD in&#xD;
           positive aspects of caregiving, stress, depression, quality of life, and burden; and the&#xD;
           cognitive function and behavioral symptoms of the PWD immediate post-intervention (T1)&#xD;
           and, 3-month follow-up (T2), compared with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two- arm non-randomized controlled trial will be adopted to achieve the research&#xD;
      objectives. After considering the number of group size and previous studies about the sample&#xD;
      size, a total of 60 subjects (30 pairs of dyads-PWD and caregivers) will be recruited from&#xD;
      four elderly community centers in Hong Kong (15 pairs for each group) with convenience&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the Intervention group will attend the home-based dyadic MCS group, while&#xD;
      the control group will receive the usual care. The outcomes measurements of caregivers&#xD;
      (positive caregiving experience, perceived stress, caregiver burden, and quality of life) and&#xD;
      PWD (cognitive function and behavioral symptoms) will be assessed by a blinded assessor at&#xD;
      baseline (T0), immediately post intervention (T1) , and 3 month-follow up (T2). To understand&#xD;
      the therapeutic components and identify the strengths, limitations and difficulties of the&#xD;
      home based dyadic MCS program, process evaluation will be conducted through focus group&#xD;
      interviews with 15 MCS participants after the intervention. In order to obtain a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of views about the intervention, participants will be purposely selected for&#xD;
      interview based on their level of stress reduction after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IBM SPSS 23.0 will be used for the data analyses. Mixed multi-variate modeling or MANOVA test&#xD;
      will be performed to investigate the between-group effect, the within-group effect (Times:&#xD;
      T0, T1, and T2) and the interaction effect (Group x Time) on all of the outcomes variables.&#xD;
      The last observation carried forward method will be adopted to replace the missing data if&#xD;
      the missing value is in a small amount (&lt;20%) and randomly distributed (Gray, Grove, &amp; Burns,&#xD;
      2013; Hamer &amp; Simpson, 2009). For the qualitative data, content analysis approach will be&#xD;
      used to analyze all the transcribed interview verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and Value:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical project addresses the limitations of the previous psychosocial interventions and&#xD;
      provides the PWD and their caregivers with an opportunity to improve the cognitive function&#xD;
      of the PWD and promote the positive caregiving experience in the family caregivers which can&#xD;
      reduce the caregivers' level of stress and improve the quality of life of the both family&#xD;
      caregivers and the PWD. The findings from this projects can also inform the future direction&#xD;
      in supporting the PWD and their family members and strengthen the nursing role in the&#xD;
      community care.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A two-arm non-randomized study design will be adopted to test the effect of a dyadic multisensory and cognitive stimulation program (MCS) for PWD and their caregivers between the intervention and control group. The Intervention group will attend the home-based dyadic MCS group, while the control group will receive the usual care. The dyadic MCS program is a 15-week program which composes of center-based face to face sessions (FTF) and caregiver-delivered home-based sessions. In the first 4 weeks, participants will attend the center-based FTF session twice a week (8 sessions), while in the remaining week (5th-15th Week), home-based sessions will be delivered by the caregivers at home and was suggested to deliver 3 times/week. To address any difficulties from the caregivers, the home-based sessions will be supplemented with weekly telephone follow-up and 2 FTF sharing sessions which will be held on the 8th and 12th week over the intervention period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Change in behavioural and psychological symptoms of PWD will be measured by the Chinese version of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). NPI-Q is an informant-based instrument that measures the presence and severity of 12 Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) in patients with dementia and caregivers distress. The caregivers will be asked to identify whether the symptoms of the PWD had been present in the past week, and rate the severity of the symptoms (from a Likert scale ranged from 1 to 3) and the corresponding distress to them (from a Likert scale ranged from 1 to 5). The NPI-Q provides two subscores- total Severity of symptoms and total distress scores. Higher score on these two subscales represent a higher level of symptoms severity of PWD and distress.</description>

In the first 60 minutes, MCS activities (e.g. reality orientation, calculation and drawing) will be led by an occupational therapist. Skills in delivering the MCS activities will also be taught to equip CG with skills in leading the home-based sessions later. CG will leave in the last 30 minutes to attend a psychoeducation group on caregiving (led by social workers) and the PWD will continue the session.&#xD;
From week 5 onwards, The home based session (Week 5-15) will be delivered by the CG 3 times weekly at home (30 - 45min/ session).The sessions will be supplemented with weekly telephone follow-up and two FTF sharing sessions held on the 8th and 12th week over the period.</description>
