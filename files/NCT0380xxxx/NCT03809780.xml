  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent prospective multicenter phase II study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lower&#xD;
      dose lenalidomide (15mg) and dexamethasone (20mg) in frail patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory MM. The overall response rate was 71% including complete remission of 15%. Median&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival were 8.9 and 30.5 months. In addition, grade&#xD;
      3-4 toxicities such as neutropenia, and infections were reduced. This study supported that&#xD;
      lower dose lenalidomide may be optimal stating dose for elderly patients with frailty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder that occurs mainly in older adults.&#xD;
      The median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years, and two-thirds of patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MM are older than 65years. As life expectancy increases, the population of older&#xD;
      individuals grows. Consequently, the number of patients with MM, especially elderly patients,&#xD;
      is expected to increase considerably in the next two decades. Elderly patients may have a&#xD;
      variety of comorbidities and reduced physical function at diagnosis, and may be intolerable&#xD;
      to standard chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent prospective multicenter phase II study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lower&#xD;
      dose lenalidomide (15mg) and dexamethasone (20mg) in frail patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory MM[8]. The overall response rate was 71% including complete remission of 15%.&#xD;
      Median progression free survival and overall survival were 8.9 and 30.5 months. In addition,&#xD;
      grade 3-4 toxicities such as neutropenia, and infections were reduced. This study supported&#xD;
      that lower dose lenalidomide may be optimal stating dose for elderly patients with frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators thought that the use of lower dose of lenalidomide in the frail&#xD;
      group is expected to increase the effectiveness as it is used for a long time while reducing&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients ≥ 70 years unfit and ineligible transplantation in patients with newly&#xD;
             diagnosed MM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is, in the investigator(s) opinion, willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             protocol requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any&#xD;
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that&#xD;
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future&#xD;
             medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic MM based on standard CRAB criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has measurable disease, defined as follows: any quantifiable serum monoclonal&#xD;
             protein value (generally, but not necessarily, ≥ 0.5 g/dL of M-protein) and, where&#xD;
             applicable, urine light-chain excretion of &gt;200 mg/24 hours. For patients with oligo&#xD;
             or non-secretory MM, it is required that they have&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm as determined by clinical examination or applicable&#xD;
             radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan) or an abnormal free light chain ratio (n.v.:&#xD;
             0.26-1.65). The investigators anticipate that less than 10% of patients admitted to&#xD;
             this study will be oligo- or non-secretory MM with free light chains only in order to&#xD;
             maximize interpretation of benefit results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The frailty of the patient will be calculated by R-MCI and scoring according to renal&#xD;
             function, pulmonary function, activity, frailty, age, and cytogenetics, 0-3 points are&#xD;
             low risk (fit) risk (inadequate) and 7 or higher will be classified as high risk&#xD;
             (frail). Only inadequate and frail can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria with 21 days of starting&#xD;
             treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/mm3 and platelet ≥ 50,000/mm3 (≥ 30,000/mm3 if&#xD;
             myeloma involvement in the bone marrow is &gt;50%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of the normal range (ULN). Alanine&#xD;
             aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/min or creatinine &lt; 3mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating females.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male patients not agreeing to use an acceptable method for contraception (i.e., condom&#xD;
             or abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential not agreeing to use two acceptable methods for&#xD;
             contraception (e.g. a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with anti-myeloma therapy (does not include radiotherapy,&#xD;
             bisphosphonates, or a single short course of steroid &lt; to the equivalent of&#xD;
             dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant medical disease or conditions that, in the investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
             interfere with protocol adherence or subject's ability to give informed consent or&#xD;
             could place the subject at unacceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of clinical active infectious hepatitis type B or C, classified into&#xD;
             Child-Pugh class C (see Appendix V) and HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of acute active infection requiring antibiotics or infiltrative pulmonary&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to any of the required drugs or supportive treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  prior history of malignancies, other than MM, unless the subject had been free of&#xD;
             disease for &gt;= 3 years with the following exceptions: Basal cell CA of skin, Squamous&#xD;
             cell CA of skin, CA in situ of cervix and breast, incidental histologic finding of&#xD;
             prostate cancer (TNM stage of T1a or T1b)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the&#xD;
             various formulations.&#xD;
