  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face a number of health disparities,&#xD;
      many of which can be tied to a lack of access to or use of primary care. Stigma and&#xD;
      misunderstanding make simple doctor's visits into ordeals only worth enduring for the most&#xD;
      serious of problems. This project addresses those issues by enlisting TGNC people as experts&#xD;
      on their own experience. TGNC individuals will form a year-long cohort that will form the&#xD;
      basis for this research. Collectively, they will define the scope of challenges faced when&#xD;
      seeking healthcare, what medical advocacy training they desire, and how to address groups of&#xD;
      healthcare providers and staff. Healthcare providers, including MDs, nurses, and PAs, will&#xD;
      attend two facilitated sessions with the TGNC cohort to meet as peers with knowledge&#xD;
      exchanged in both directions. Similar meetings will occur with clinic staff, as TGNC&#xD;
      individuals have expressed how stigma begins from the moment they call a medical office. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that when TGNC individuals are given the tools to navigate the healthcare&#xD;
      system and the ability to speak with medical professionals as peers, rather than patients,&#xD;
      through a participatory action research design they will be better able to access appropriate&#xD;
      care through increased confidence and mutual support. The complementary hypothesis for&#xD;
      medical providers is that direct interaction with a variety of TGNC individuals who&#xD;
      articulate their needs will decrease stigma and increase comfort when treating TGNC people as&#xD;
      patients. As a partnership between academic, medical, and community institutions, this&#xD;
      project has the potential to directly impact the lives of TGNC individuals who participate&#xD;
      and indirectly impact others served by the LGBT Center. This proposal works on three levels:&#xD;
      1) at the academic level - an assessment of participatory action research as an intervention&#xD;
      to decrease health disparities, 2) at the individual level - the potential for individuals to&#xD;
      increase personal knowledge and skills, and 3) at the institutional level - as actors within&#xD;
      the TGNC community develop relationships with individual healthcare providers, medical&#xD;
      clinics and activist groups and community partners and educational institutions are&#xD;
      concurrently forming networks that will have positive, although probably more diffuse, impact&#xD;
      on TGNC individuals as these institutions come together to support TGNC health care.&#xD;

      RESEARCH QUESTION: Do interactive dialogues between trans and gender nonconforming (TGNC) -&#xD;
      trained in health literacy and advocacy - and healthcare providers and staff seeking cultural&#xD;
      competency around TGNC primary care result in 1) more confidence on the part of TGNC in&#xD;
      navigating the healthcare system, 2) more confidence on the part of providers in responding&#xD;
      to the needs of TGNC patients, (sub question - is there a measurable difference between types&#xD;
      of providers' responses to trainings, i.e., medical doctors compared to nurse practitioners)&#xD;
      3) person-to-person networks between the two populations resulting in ongoing, sustainable&#xD;
      dialogue, 4) TGNC individuals prepared to train other TGNC in a peer-to-peer role to act as&#xD;
      advocates on behalf of the TGNC population within the healthcare system, all of which&#xD;
      ultimately result in increased access to and use of primary care services and reduce the&#xD;
      health disparities faced by TGNC individuals? SIGNIFICANCE: The LGBTQ+ community has&#xD;
      historically acted on its own behalf out of necessity, including for the push to remove&#xD;
      homosexuality as a mental disorder from the DSM and reframing the HIV/AIDS conversation and&#xD;
      demanding research. Our project, driven by TGNC people's interests and advocacy, falls within&#xD;
      this tradition of advocacy from inside the community. Our project aims to improve quality of&#xD;
      life by addressing health disparities faced by TGNC individuals and by developing a&#xD;
      self-sustained space to teach self-advocacy skills to navigate the healthcare system. The&#xD;
      LGBT Community Center of Greater Cleveland (The LGBT Center) is in the process of hiring a&#xD;
      new Youth Program Coordinator who will be responsible for the project management of this&#xD;
      program. The ideal candidate will bring both professional and personal experience of working&#xD;
      within the TGNC community and an interest in research. &quot;TRANS in the CLE Conference,&quot;&#xD;
      convened in October of 2017, had more than 130 attendees, 26 presenters, and 15 workshops.&#xD;
      The LGBT Center regularly hosts the Queer Youth Initiative, serving an average of 100 people&#xD;
      a month between the ages of 11 and 20. A majority of those individuals identify as&#xD;
      transgender, non-binary, or gender nonconforming. This demonstrates both the significant&#xD;
      presence of TGNC individuals in Cleveland and the LGBT Center's ability to reach this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INNOVATION: This project places TGNC community members and The LGBT Center in position to&#xD;
      lead the direction of the research project, to gain research and health advocacy skills&#xD;
      themselves, and the ability to form a cohort that will continue to operate beyond this pilot&#xD;
      project. In Cleveland, TGNC affirming services are available at the Pride Network at&#xD;
      MetroHealth, Cleveland Clinic's Center for LGBT Care, and University Hospital's navigator&#xD;
      program. ECHO community partners receive technical assistance from experts in the field, but&#xD;
      these are not necessarily informed by TGNC community input. Almost no other academic program&#xD;
      is asking TGNC people what issues to prioritize, and no other program in the Cleveland area,&#xD;
      to our knowledge. TGNC individuals are often research subjects and not recognized as experts&#xD;
      themselves. Alpert's online survey asks LGBTQ+ individuals what they feel doctors should say&#xD;
      and do, but the interaction is still mediated through an academic expert. The intervention&#xD;
      closest to what is proposed is the Transgender Law's &quot;Organizing for Transgender Healthcare:&#xD;
      A Guide for Community Clinic Organizing and Activism&quot;, which defines transgender health care&#xD;
      as &quot;culturally appropriate primary health care, including access to sex-specific and&#xD;
      transition-related procedures&quot;. In a case study in Los Angeles, a group of trans men formed&#xD;
      an advocacy group (C3) that engaged with two community clinics to improve the clinics'&#xD;
      cultural competency, medical forms, outreach materials, protocols for accessing hormones, and&#xD;
      the referral process. This project is being proposed by cisgender women but is designed to be&#xD;
      driven by TGNC individuals as partners and advocates navigating the healthcare system. In&#xD;
      comparison to the model of C3 in Los Angeles, this project is innovative in that it calls for&#xD;
      a sustained dialogue between the TGNC cohort and the health care providers and reaches a&#xD;
      cross-section of practitioners from clinics that provide primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Over the course of the grant year, each step of the project is divided into three&#xD;
      month portions. The first quarter will be dedicated to recruiting and forming a cohort of&#xD;
      TGNC individuals, drawn mostly from the LGBT Center's extensive contact lists and centrality&#xD;
      within the TGNC population. The investigators plan on recruiting 20 individuals to ensure the&#xD;
      study meets the minimum retention of 12 subjects throughout the study needed for qualitative&#xD;
      saturation, and individuals between 14-18 years of age will be able to participate with&#xD;
      guardian permission. Interested individuals will fill out applications to identify their&#xD;
      interests and ability to commit to the project and will allow us to create a cohort that&#xD;
      reflects the diversity of the TGNC community in Cuyahoga County, including gender identity,&#xD;
      types of gender-affirmative care required (including whether or not someone is considering,&#xD;
      in the process of, or completed physical transition), racial and ethnic identity, age (over&#xD;
      14), and socio-economic class. Upon accepting the invitation to participate, each member of&#xD;
      the cohort will complete a pretest that will elicit data on their experiences in the&#xD;
      healthcare system, their knowledge of basic and transgender-specific medical terminology,&#xD;
      their familiarity with healthcare providers in Cuyahoga County, and the likelihood of seeking&#xD;
      care under a number of conditions (acute, chronic, moderate, severe). The investigators&#xD;
      expect this to take one month. The following two months will consist of meeting as a cohort&#xD;
      twice a month. The first two meetings will be dedicated to understanding the group's&#xD;
      collective experiences with health care, what they would like to see change, and what&#xD;
      strategies can be used to accomplish those ends. The investigators recognize that TGNC people&#xD;
      come from a variety of backgrounds and each will bring their own strengths, networks, and&#xD;
      perspectives to the table which will allow us to make full use of the indigenous expertise of&#xD;
      the group. In consultation with the Nursing School of CWRU, the investigators will develop a&#xD;
      health literacy training that meets the expressed needs of the cohort and Jesse Honsky will&#xD;
      present it during the 3rd meeting. The goal here is not to provide all possible health&#xD;
      education but rather to arm the cohort with the skills and language to empower them to act as&#xD;
      advocates on their own behalf when navigating the healthcare system. The final meeting (the&#xD;
      4th) in this first quarter will be with a trained facilitator (Shemariah Arki) who will,&#xD;
      under the direction of the TGNC cohort, plan a series of three interactive dialogues between&#xD;
      the TGNC cohort and the healthcare providers. By meeting with the TGNC cohort first, without&#xD;
      the healthcare providers, the TGNC cohort will have the opportunity to ensure the dialogues&#xD;
      are designed to meet their objectives. Individual healthcare practitioners and medical staff&#xD;
      will be recruited during the first quarter from the aforementioned clinics. The investigators&#xD;
      will recruit at least twelve providers and twelve staff members. In the second quarter, the&#xD;
      investigators will conduct a pretest that will collect data on attitudes towards TGNC&#xD;
      individuals, TGNC-specific healthcare concerns, depth and breadth of referral networks for&#xD;
      TGNC providers. Once the healthcare provider group is solidified, the LGBT Center will host&#xD;
      three evening meetings (once per month) with the trained facilitator wherein TGNC individuals&#xD;
      lead a conversation about what they see as barriers to their care, how they would like to be&#xD;
      treated, and what they want healthcare providers to know about them as people. The first two&#xD;
      meetings will be with healthcare practitioners and the final meeting will be medical staff so&#xD;
      that the meetings can be more specific and without the interference of power dynamics within&#xD;
      the provider groups. During this second quarter, the TGNC cohort will continue to meet on its&#xD;
      own once a month to debrief from meetings, respond to what they have learned so far, and&#xD;
      possibly refine the strategies for future meetings with healthcare providers as the series&#xD;
      goes forward. At the end of the three months of dialogue, each participant, from both the&#xD;
      TGNC cohort and healthcare provider, will be given a post-test to measure changes in&#xD;
      attitude, practice, and knowledge. Participants will also have the opportunity to engage in a&#xD;
      reflective interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third quarter will diverge onto two different paths: the LGBT Center project coordinator&#xD;
      will continue to engage with the cohort as they shift into the role of peer educators and&#xD;
      advocates with other members of the TGNC community that interact at the LGBT Center. Luminais&#xD;
      will conduct follow-up interviews with any TGNC cohort member that notifies the researchers&#xD;
      that they have sought medical care and with any healthcare provider that notifies the&#xD;
      researchers that they have had a clinical interaction with a TGNC individual. The&#xD;
      investigators will not be seeking any protected medical information or the identity of&#xD;
      patients, in the case of healthcare providers, but rather a discussion of the ease or&#xD;
      difficulty in communication, levels of comfort, and comparison with other interactions in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the process, both Luminais and the LGBT Center coordinator will be engaged in&#xD;
      participant observation and keep detailed field notes on all the meetings. All interviews&#xD;
      will be transcribed; interviews and field notes will be coded with a priori codes derived&#xD;
      from the literature on reducing health disparities and TGNC-specific health care by a&#xD;
      research assistant. Pre- and post-tests will be analyzed to determine the success of&#xD;
      facilitated dialogue in improving confidence and knowledge by both the TGNC cohort and the&#xD;
      healthcare providers, and depending on sample size, the investigators will determine if there&#xD;
      are any statistically significant changes. This analysis and write up will encompass the last&#xD;
      quarter of the project.&#xD;
