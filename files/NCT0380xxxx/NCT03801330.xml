    <description>Survey of health status and quality of life&#xD;
From (https://www.rand.org/health-care/surveys_tools/mos/36-item-short-form/scoring.html) &quot;Scoring the RAND 36-Item Health Survey is a two-step process. First, precoded numeric values are recoded per the scoring key given in Table 1. Note that all items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. In addition, each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. Scores represent the percentage of total possible score achieved. In step 2, items in the same scale are averaged together to create the 8 scale scores. Table 2 lists the items averaged together to create each scale. Items that are left blank (missing data) are not taken into account when calculating the scale scores. Hence, scale scores represent the average for all items in the scale that the respondent answered.&quot;</description>

&#xD;
          -  Gold level A-D, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to perform the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This means that participants must meet the standard definition of COPD and have a&#xD;
             post-bronchodilator measurement of FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All COPD Assessment Test scores will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have an mMRC score = 1-4.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additionally, patients must have taken a Pulmonary Function Test within 1 year or they&#xD;
             must retake (for baseline measurement) before participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not have had a Pulmonary Rehabilitation class within the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If participants have had a recent cardiac event within 6 months (such as a myocardial&#xD;
             infarction or an abnormal cardiac catheterization) they must obtain cardiologist&#xD;
             approval before participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In an effort to evaluate feasibility we will request that participants have their own&#xD;
             Wi-Fi. Participants may use their own mobile device if they prefer but Blue Marble&#xD;
             will have ample supply to provide to participants a device for the purposes of this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target representativeness for gender, based on COPD demography will be ~50% women,&#xD;
             based on recent trends indicating that women have an equal, and perhaps slightly&#xD;
             greater risk of COPD compared to men3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Ethnicity/Race target recruitment, consistent with the US and the population at&#xD;
             each site.&#xD;

             school).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for participants with COPD:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary functional fitness that precludes participation in outpatient/home PR&#xD;
             program (i.e. requires in-patient supervision or severity of a co-morbidity that&#xD;
             represents a contradiction to exercise in a self-directed program) will be&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant who desaturates below SaO2 &lt;88% during the pre-test 6MWT and does not&#xD;
             have personal oxygen available will be referred for further evaluation and can be&#xD;
             included once they have an O2 titration and supplemental oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other exclusions include if a patient's oxygen use exceeds 4 liters per minute (LPM)&#xD;
             or those who score less than 100 meters during the entry 6-minute walk distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with coronary problems will be excluded based on specific morbidity and&#xD;
             severity. These coronary exclusions include coronary artery disease with unstable&#xD;
             angina.&#xD;

          -  Additional exclusions include: any respiratory disorder other than COPD that&#xD;
             contraindicates participation in a home-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The inability to learn how to use Inspiration Point&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An acute neurological or cardiovascular condition such as stroke or acute heart&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active cancer with an anticipated survival of less than 6 months or treatment that&#xD;
             will preclude them from participating in Pulmonary Rehab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A participant with high fall risk as per physician determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence of a neurologic disorder that precludes a potential participant from&#xD;
             following a typical COPD exercise program or demonstrating hand function sufficient to&#xD;
             interface with the tablet.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This also includes patients with prior or current neurologic event/condition&#xD;
             presenting fall risk or requiring assist device for ambulation will also be excluded.&#xD;
