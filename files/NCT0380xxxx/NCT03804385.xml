      pneumothorax is defined as air or gas accumulated in the pleural cavity. Spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax can be classified as either primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax , which is defined as a pneumothorax without underlying lung disease,&#xD;
      predominantly occurs in young, thin males. It is usually caused by ruptured pleural blebs or&#xD;
      bullae. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs in older people with underlying&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, such as emphysema or asthma, acute or chronic infections, lung cancer, and&#xD;
      congenital diseases including cystic fibrosis, catamenial pneumothorax , or&#xD;
      lymphangio-leiomyomatosis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age-adjusted incidence of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is from 7.4 to 18 per 100 000&#xD;
      population per year in males, and from 1.2 to 6 per 100 000 population per year in females.&#xD;
      It usually occurs in tall, thin males of 10 to 30 years old. Less often does it occur in&#xD;
      people at the age of more than 40 years. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax might be associated&#xD;
      with some congenital disorders such as Marfan's syndrome, or some environmental factors such&#xD;
      as smoking. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs at rest. Approximately 10% of&#xD;
      patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax have a positive family history. Smoking is&#xD;
      also regarded as a precipitating factor for Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The relative&#xD;
      risk of pneumothorax ranged from 7 to 100 times higher in light to heavy smokers Most authors&#xD;
      believe that Primary spontaneous pneumothorax results from spontaneous rupture of a&#xD;
      sub-pleural bleb or bulla. However, only a portion of patients with Primary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax could be found with blebs or bullae in imaging or at the time of surgery. Other&#xD;
      mechanisms may be considered, such as increase in pleural porosity secondary to inflammation.&#xD;
      The development of bullae, blebs, or pleural porosity might be related to many factors, such&#xD;
      as distal airway inflammation, distal bronchial tree anomaly, disorders of connective tissue&#xD;
      formation, local ischemia, and malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax usually occurs at rest, and presents with acute onset of&#xD;
      local pleuritic chest pain accompanied by dyspnoea. This pain may be mild or severe, sharp&#xD;
      and steady ache in character, and usually resolves within 24 h even though pneumothorax still&#xD;
      exists. On physical examination, decreased air entry on auscultation, decreased chest wall&#xD;
      movement on inspection, hyper-resonance (tympanic) on percussion are most often detected in&#xD;
      patients with large pneumothorax (free air occupies more than 15% to 20% area of hemi&#xD;
      thorax). Reflex tachycardia can be found in most patients in response to discomfort or&#xD;
      circulating or respiratory compromise. Tension pneumothorax should be suspected if severe&#xD;
      tachycardia, cold sweating, hypotension, or cyanosis has developed. Blood gas analysis in&#xD;
      patients with large pneumothoraces may reveal increased alveolar-arterial difference in&#xD;
      oxygen partial pressure (PA-aO2) due to increased intrapulmonary shunt from the collapsed&#xD;
      lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most Primary spontaneous pneumothorax cases are confirmed by upright posteroanterior chest&#xD;
      radiograph, which can be used to assess the pneumothorax size with good accuracy. A pleural&#xD;
      line with or without an air-fluid level can be seen in the chest radiograph, but sometimes it&#xD;
      is difficult to detect these signs, especially in patients with small pneumothoraces,&#xD;
      emphysema, or poor exposure of the film. Expiratory chest radiographs have no diagnostic&#xD;
      value for patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computed tomography (CT) of the chest can be used to detect patients with small penman-thorax&#xD;
      (less than 15% area of hemi thorax). In addition, CT can provide more detailed information to&#xD;
      assist in the subsequent management. Findings which can be noted include the number, size,&#xD;
      and location of bullae/blebs (ipsi- or contra-laterally), as well the possibilities of&#xD;
      pleural adhesion, pleural fluid accumulation, and possible underlying pulmonary diseases. For&#xD;
      more than 90% of patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax, pathological lung changes&#xD;
      can be detected by CT. The most common type is few (n&lt;5) and small (&lt;2 cm in diameter) blebs,&#xD;
      followed by mixed blebs and bullae (&gt;2 cm in diameter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first line of management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is intercostal tube&#xD;
      insertion .that provide management of this case and only recurrent or persisting cases need&#xD;
      further surgical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical management of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is usually indicated in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent ipsi-lateral pneumothorax, first episode with occupational risk or persistent&#xD;
      air-leakage (more than 5 to 7 d), or prior contra-lateral pneumothorax. A first episode of a&#xD;
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax is treated by observation if the area of pneumothorax is&#xD;
      &lt;20% or by simple aspiration if &gt;20%, but recurrences are frequent. For recurrent or&#xD;
      persisting pneumothorax, a more invasive surgical approach is indicated. The procedure can be&#xD;
      approached through open thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two objectives in the surgical management of pneumothorax. The first widely&#xD;
      accepted objective is resection of blebs or the suture of apical perforations to treat the&#xD;
      underlying defect. The second objective is to create a pleural symphysis to prevent&#xD;
      recurrence. There is nearly zero mortality and very low major morbidity with either&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracic surgery or open approaches. Postoperative complications are low&#xD;
      (5%-10%), and usually minor and self-limited, including prolonged air-leakage, pleural&#xD;
      effusion or hemorrhage, wound infection or hematoma, pulmonary atelectasis or pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The traditional open approach has gradually been replaced by minimally invasive&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracic surgery in the diagnosis and treatment for patients with various&#xD;
      intrathoracic diseases, including the treatment of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The&#xD;
      outcomes of video-assisted thoracic surgery for patients with Primary spontaneous&#xD;
      pneumothorax are very good compared to conservative treatment and equal to those of open&#xD;
      thoracotomy. The video-assisted thoracic surgery approach has the benefits of less&#xD;
      postoperative pain, better wound cosmetics, shorter hospital stay and duration of drainage,&#xD;
      better functional recovery, better short and long term patient satisfaction, and equivalent&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness to the open approach.video-assisted thoracic surgery is recommended as the&#xD;
      first-line surgical treatment for patients with recurrent Primary spontaneous pneumothorax or&#xD;
      first episode of Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the recommendation can only be&#xD;
      graded as B or C as there have been only a limited number of patients in relevant randomized&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of postoperative recurrence requiring re-operation for the video-assisted thoracic&#xD;
      surgery and surgical groups varies in different reported series. However, re-operation&#xD;
      following video-assisted thoracic surgery is more often required than that after open&#xD;
      thoracotomy, with a higher rate of both late recurrent pneumo-thorax and prolonged early&#xD;
      postoperative air-leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      video-assisted thoracic surgery for Primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be accomplished&#xD;
      mostly through three ports, but two or single port(s) with the use of single incision port&#xD;
      laparoscopic surgery (SILS) system has been reported in recent years. Endotracheal general&#xD;
      anesthesia with the use of a double or single lumen endotracheal tube is still recommended by&#xD;
      most reported series for Primary spontaneous pneumothorax patients undergoing video-assisted&#xD;
      thoracic surgery . video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures through local or epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia for patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (the awake procedure) have been&#xD;
      reported The bullae/blebs in patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax can be managed&#xD;
      through video-assisted thoracic surgery by stapling and resection, no-knife stapling,&#xD;
      suturing, or endo-loop ligation. Pleurodesis is usually required in addition to&#xD;
      bullae/blebectomy for surgical management of patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax.&#xD;
      It can significantly decrease the risk of early air-leakage or late recurrence, which is&#xD;
      especially important for patients undergoing video-assisted thoracic surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the surgical treatment for patients with Primary spontaneous pneumothorax has become&#xD;
      less invasive through video-assisted thoracic surgery in recent years, there have been many&#xD;
      published papers suggesting the use of this surgical intervention for patients with the first&#xD;
      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax There are still some reported series that do not agree with&#xD;
      the use of video-assisted thoracic surgery after the first Primary spontaneous pneumothorax.&#xD;
      Retrospective cost effective analysis has revealed that tube thoracostomy should be used at&#xD;
      first occurrence, followed by video-assisted thoracic surgical bullae/blebectomy and&#xD;
      pleurodesis in case of recurrence. However, these studies were only based on single,&#xD;
      retrospective, and small case number analyses, and the patient satisfaction and quality of&#xD;
      life were not considered. video-assisted thoracic surgery will be expected as an option of&#xD;
      management for patients with their first Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the&#xD;
      management of the first Primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains controversial because there&#xD;
      is still little high-quality evidence to guide the decision-making&#xD;
