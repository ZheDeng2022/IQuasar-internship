      This is a national, prospective, multicenter, comparative, randomized, single-blinded&#xD;
      non-inferiority study performed in two parallel groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 months (plus a run in period of 15 days prior inclusion) Patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      dry eye syndrome.&#xD;

      Public hospitals and private practices specialized in ophthalmology Approximately 10 sites&#xD;
      France Approximately 80 patients globally: 40 per arm with a 1:1 ratio including an expected&#xD;
      dropout rate of 15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry eye has been defined as a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a&#xD;
      loss of homeostasis of the tear film and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which the tear&#xD;
      film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and&#xD;
      neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, prevalence estimates for dry eye vary dramatically from 5% to 50% due to the various&#xD;
      operational definitions of dry eye used and the characteristics of the population studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The available evidence suggests also that dry eye has a negative impact on overall quality of&#xD;
      life. It causes pain and irritation and affects ocular and general health and well-being, the&#xD;
      perception of visual function and visual performance. Reduced quality of life in everyday&#xD;
      activities and leisure pursuits is reported by 60% of patients, while 38% of patients&#xD;
      complain of reduced efficiency at work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the economic burden and impact of dry eye on vision and quality of life, work&#xD;
      productivity, psychological and physical impact of pain are considerable. As a consequence,&#xD;
      dry eye represents a public health burden. However, only a handful of therapies are available&#xD;
      for dry eye patient and are used according to the disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In such context, SIFI SpA. has developed Eyestil Protection® (or SF-104 XNT Single dose). It&#xD;
      is a sterile preservative-free device (eye drops) for ophthalmic use containing 0.2% xanthan&#xD;
      gum, presented in 0.3 ml unidose containers. The main action of Eyestil Protection is to&#xD;
      lubricate and moisturize the ocular surface as well as to protect it from oxidative stress&#xD;
      thanks to the anti-oxidative properties of the xanthan gum (as demonstrated by in-vitro&#xD;
      studies (Amico, Tornetta et al. 2015). It is indicated in all cases of dry-eye related ocular&#xD;
      discomfort and to relief ocular discomfort due to the use of contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eyestil Protection® unidose is CE marked but is not available yet in all European countries,&#xD;
      notably in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confronted to a European regulatory change on medical devices - from a Directive (Directive&#xD;
      1993/42/EEC) to a Regulation (MDR 2017/745) that now requires clinical evidence of device&#xD;
      performance and safety; SIFI SpA decided to implement the present clinical comparative&#xD;
      performance study. The choice of Vismed® (unidose) as the comparator has been done since it&#xD;
      is the current French standard of care treatment for patients with moderate to severe dry&#xD;
      eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To demonstrate the non-inferiority of Eyestil Protection® compared to Vismed® in terms of&#xD;
      clinical performance as detected by a reduction of keratitis lesions objectified by staining&#xD;
      tests after 1 month of treatment, in patients with moderate to severe dry eye syndrome with&#xD;
      keratoconjunctivitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives Clinical performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tear film stability per group as objectified by the tear break up time&#xD;
           (TBUT) test at month 1 and 3;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the long term clinical performance of Eyestil Protection® compared to&#xD;
           Vismed® as detected by a reduction of keratitis lesions objectified by staining tests&#xD;
           after 3 months of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tear production per group as objectified by the Schirmer test at month&#xD;
           3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare patients reported outcomes (PRO) measures per group at month 1 and 3,&#xD;
           including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient's reported symptoms and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient's quality of life (QoL). Investigator overall satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess investigator's overall satisfaction of the treatment's clinical performance at&#xD;
           month 1 and 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety • To describe the safety profile of Eyestil Protection® compared to Vismed® after 3&#xD;
      months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare patient's QoL subscale scores per group at each time point.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Suspended</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Slow enrolment process and COVID situation worsened the situation. SIFI has developed a new&#xD;
    product with probably a better performance. SIFI changed its marketing strategy and decided&#xD;
    that Eyestil® Protection will be not marketed anymore&#xD;

    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of the time obtained at the tear break up time test (TBUT). This full procedure will be performed 3 times per eye and per time point. Each obtained time will be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF. At screening and at baseline visits, the sum of these 3 times for at least one eye to be eligible must be ≤ 30 seconds.&#xD;
Conventionally TBUT's measures shorter than 10 seconds can be referred to tear film instability and measures shorter than 5 seconds, usually, are undoubtable sign of dry eye. The longer it takes, the more stable the tear film. A short TBUT is a sign of poor tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates an increase in TBUT (improvement) and a negative number change from baseline indicates a decrease in TBUT (worsening).</description>

The frequency is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (highest frequency).&#xD;
• The degree is scored on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4, a larger number indicates a greater burden.&#xD;

But the cut-off that will here use will be 9 mm with the following interpretation:&#xD;
Normal = ≥ 10 millimeters (mm) of tears,&#xD;

    <description>The between-group comparisons of the average variation of Ocular Symptoms Disease Index (OSDI) score. The patient's dry eye symptoms will be assessed with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI). It is a validated 12-questions scale for patients that covers a broad spectrum of ocular surface symptoms, the severity of such symptoms for patients and how these symptoms affect/impact visual function over a 1-week recall period. Its scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater severity of disease.Positive result is considered when the OSDI score is ≥ 18.To be consistent with the IMD indication, patient with moderate to severe dry eye thus with an OSDI ≥ 18 will be selected. If the patient's OSDI score will be strictly below 18 at the screening or baseline visit, s/he will be considered as a screening failure.&#xD;
Each item response will be collected in the study database since given separately to patients.</description>
