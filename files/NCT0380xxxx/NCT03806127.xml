    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of vibegron, a beta-3 adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      (β3-AR) agonist, in the treatment of pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) due&#xD;
      to IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D) or mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation&#xD;
      (IBS-M).&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) With Predominantly Diarrhea (IBS-D) Participants Who Were Abdominal Pain Intensity (API) Weekly Responders at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An API Weekly Responder was defined as a participant who experienced a decrease in the weekly average of &quot;worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours&quot; scores of at least 30% compared with the Baseline weekly average. A participant was considered a responder over Weeks 1 to 12 if they met the criteria for at least 50% of the weeks assessed (i.e., ≥6 weeks).</description>

    <measure>Number of Global Improvement Scale (GIS) Responders at Week 12 for All IBS Participants, Including IBS-D and IBS-M Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Global improvement assessment asks participants to evaluate their current IBS status by asking the following question: How would you rate your IBS signs or symptoms overall over the past 7 days?: (1) significantly relieved; (2) moderately relieved; (3) slightly relieved; (4) unchanged; (5) slightly worse; (6) moderately worse; (7) significantly worse. A responder was defined as a participant who answered that their symptoms were either moderately relieved or significantly relieved. A participant with a missing GIS response was considered to be a non-responder.</description>

    <measure>Number of IBS-D Participants Who Were API Weekly Responders With ≥ 40% Improvement Over 12 Weeks</measure>

    <description>An API Weekly Responder was defined as a participant who experienced a decrease in the weekly average of &quot;worst abdominal pain in the past 24 hours&quot; scores of at least 40% compared with the Baseline weekly average. A participant was considered a responder over Weeks 1 to 12 if they met the criteria for at least 50% of the weeks assessed (i.e., ≥6 weeks).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>from the time the participant provided informed consent to participate in the study at the Screening Visit until completion of the Safety Follow-up Call (up to Day 113 or Early Withdrawal plus 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs are defined as events that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of the double-blind study treatment through 14 days after the last dose of study treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Changes From Baseline in Clinical Laboratory Values at Week 12</measure>

             abdominal pain (e.g., interstitial cystitis; fibromyalgia currently being treated with&#xD;

          <description>Stratified strata was based on the randomization stratifications. Participants were asked to rate their IBS-related abdominal pain at its worst in the past 24 hours on a 0- to 10-point numeric rating scale, where 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst possible pain.</description>

          <description>Stratified strata was based on the randomization stratifications. The Rome IV criteria classifies IBS into 4 distinct subtypes based on predominant stool consistency: IBS with predominantly constipation (IBS-C), IBS with predominantly diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with mixed episodes of diarrhea and constipation (IBS-M), and IBS with unknown subtype (IBS-U). IBS-D: ≥ 25% diarrhea and &lt; 25% constipation. IBS-M: ≥ 25% constipation and ≥ 25% diarrhea.</description>
