  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fewer than 10 percent of people with pancreas cancer can have surgery. Surgery gives the best&#xD;
      outcome. Radiation therapy is usually used to make surgery possible. But it does not work for&#xD;
      most people. Adding immunotherapy might help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe combined dose of M7824, M9241, and radiation and to see if it causes pancreas&#xD;
      cancer tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older who have pancreas cancer and cannot have curative surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 01-C-0129 with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart, urine, and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans. For this, participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They may&#xD;
      receive a contrast agent by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drugs either alone or with radiation. They will get M7824 by&#xD;
      vein every 2 weeks. They will get M9241 injected under the skin every 4 weeks. Participants&#xD;
      who get radiation will get it 5 days in a row the first month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every 2 weeks. They will repeat screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants tumors shrink, they will have surgery. If their whole tumor is removed, they&#xD;
      will stop treatment. They will otherwise continue treatment as long as they can tolerate it&#xD;
      and it is helping them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits 1 week and 1 month after they stop treatment. Then they will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone or email for life. If they stop treatment for a reason other than their&#xD;
      disease getting worse, they will have scans every 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At time of diagnosis, fewer than 10% of newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients&#xD;
           present with resectable disease (patients who can undergo surgery) and patients able to&#xD;
           undergo a margin-negative surgical resection (R0) are reported to have the most&#xD;
           favorable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Locally advanced, non-metastatic pancreas cancer (LAPC) is observed in up to 30% of all&#xD;
           pancreas cancer patients at time of diagnosis (including both borderline resectable and&#xD;
           non-resectable disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary goal of neoadjuvant therapy in LAPC is, among tumor control and extension of&#xD;
           survival, the conversion to resectable disease achieving a R0 resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation therapy (RT) is commonly used as neoadjuvant treatment for LAPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  However, currently used RT neoadjuvant treatment regimens result in only about 40%-60%&#xD;
           of patients with borderline resectable pancreas cancer to undergo surgical resection, in&#xD;
           initially unresectable LAPC patient conversion are even lower, with only 7% - 19% able&#xD;
           to undergo resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combining immunotherapy and radiation therapy could synergistically improve anti-cancer&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti-programmed death ligand 1&#xD;
           (PD-L1) antibody functioning as an immune checkpoint inhibitor and the extracellular&#xD;
           domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) receptor type 2, a TGF-beta trap.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The M9241 immunocytokine is composed of 2 IL-12 heterodimers, each fused to one of the&#xD;
           H-chains of the NHS76 antibody, which has affinity for both single- and double-stranded&#xD;
           DNA. M9241 targets delivery of IL12, a proinflammatory cytokine that has been shown&#xD;
           anti-tumor activity including objective responses in phase I clinical trials, to regions&#xD;
           of tumor necrosis where DNA has become exposed, e.g. after radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We hypothesize that released neo-epitopes upon increased DNA damage induced by radiation&#xD;
           therapy together with the local proinflammatory action of M9241 will complement the&#xD;
           anti-tumor activity of M7824 in locally advanced pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
           M7824 and M9241 in combination with SBRT as neoadjuvant/perioperative treatment in&#xD;
           subjects with pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a preliminary estimate of efficacy as best overall response (BOR) according&#xD;
           to RECIST 1.1 of M7824 and M9241 in combination with SBRT as neoadjuvant/perioperative&#xD;
           treatment in subjects with locally advanced pancreas cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically or cytologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient must be eligible to undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (Cohorts&#xD;
           2-3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open label Phase I/II trial. During phase I the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
           M7824 and M9241 will be evaluated and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of M7824 and&#xD;
           M9241 in combination with SBRT will be estimated. During phase II efficacy of the M7824&#xD;
           and M9241 in combination with SBRT will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive treatment in cycles consisting of 28 days (with exception of&#xD;
           additional administer of M7824 alone in Phase IA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If during treatment patient become candidate for curative surgery, treatment will be&#xD;
           stopped and can be restarted after surgery in case if surgical exploration does not&#xD;
           result in the successful removal of the tumor.&#xD;
