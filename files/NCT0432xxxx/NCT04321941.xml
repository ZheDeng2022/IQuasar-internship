      The trial is a phase 2 randomised, open, non-inferiority within patient-controlled&#xD;
      multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects with a diagnosis of Crohn´s Disease and a clinical indication for an&#xD;
      MRE examination, who are at least 18 years of age and who provide a written informed consent,&#xD;
      will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial period will be up to 16 weeks and consists of 7 visits (see schedule of events).&#xD;
      All patients who have attended at least 1 of the Magnetic Resonance Enterography&#xD;
      (MRE)/Computerised Tomography Enterography (CTE) examinations should go through the end of&#xD;
      treatment procedures at visit 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend two examinations during the course of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A CTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An MRE The Crohn's disease activity will be assessed radiologically on the MRE and CTE&#xD;
           scans by identifying the presence and severity of a number of morphologic entities and&#xD;
           dynamic signs in the SB and colon as described in the RCDAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional evaluation of CD activity and disease complication on the MRE and CTE images will&#xD;
      be performed using the CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index respectively&#xD;

      The trial is a phase 2 randomised, open, non-inferiority within patient-controlled&#xD;
      multi-centre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment will take place at 1 or more study centres by clinicians specialised in&#xD;
      gastroenterology. MRE and CTE examinations will be performed at the department of Radiology&#xD;
      at a hospital or private practise that performs radiology. Participating radiology department&#xD;
      or private practice need to be certified to perform the examination at Skåne University&#xD;
      Hospital, SUS, Malmö, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female subjects with a diagnosis of CD and a clinical indication for an MRE&#xD;
      examination, who are at least 18 years of age and who provide a written informed consent,&#xD;
      will be eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial period will be up to 16 weeks and consists of 7 visits (see schedule of events).&#xD;
      All patients who have attended at least 1 of the MRE/CTE examinations should go through the&#xD;
      end of treatment procedures at visit 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects interested in participating in the trial will be screened for eligibility at visit&#xD;
      1. After receiving information about the trial according to the procedures for subject&#xD;
      information and consent (see section 14.3) and found eligible according to the in-/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, patients will be included in the trial and randomised. After randomisation, the&#xD;
      subject's demography, medical history and concomitant illness and medical treatment will be&#xD;
      noted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will attend two examinations during the course of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A CTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An MRE The order in which the MRE and CTE-L is performed will be randomised. Date and&#xD;
           time for the patient's MRE examination will be booked at the department of radiology&#xD;
           when the subject have been randomised. The date of CTE examination will then be booked&#xD;
           two to three weeks apart from the MRE, either before or after according to the&#xD;
           randomisation, to ensure both a proper washout period of given medical compounds and a&#xD;
           minimal risk of change in status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Crohn's disease activity will be assessed radiologically on the MRE and CTE scans by&#xD;
      identifying the presence and severity of a number of morphologic entities and dynamic signs&#xD;
      in the SB and colon as described in the RCDAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiologist assessment, according to the RCDAS, of the CTE and MRE examinations will be&#xD;
      performed by the investigators specialised in abdominal imaging at the department of&#xD;
      radiology. The radiologist assessment of one patient's CTE and MRE examinations will not be&#xD;
      performed by the same investigator in order to avoid that one assessment influence the other.&#xD;
      Appointment of assessor for each examination will be performed by randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudonymised assessment of CTE and MRE scans will be performed in batches of approximately 5&#xD;
      scans. Patient identification details will be removed from the scans and replaced by a code&#xD;
      and the scans will be saved in a separate archive. The assessor will not have access to the&#xD;
      code list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of the trial, a blinded assessment of all pseudonymised images will be&#xD;
      performed where the investigators assess the images initially assessed by the other&#xD;
      investigator. The data will be used to document inter-reader variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional evaluation of CD activity and disease complication on the MRE and CTE images will&#xD;
      be performed using the CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index respectively once all subjects have&#xD;
      completed the trial. The CDMRIS scale and Lémann Index are described below. All assessments&#xD;
      of the CTE and MRE images will be performed by the investigators at the department of&#xD;
      radiology. Only the principal investigator will assess images according to Lémann and CDMRIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time the subjects drink the contrast agent prior to the MRE/CTE scan, they will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a questionnaire assessing taste, smell, consistency, fullness and ability&#xD;
      to swallow the contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be contacted 2 days after the MRE and CTE examination for control of any&#xD;
      potential AE and concomitant medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' experience of anxiety level at the CTE and MRE examinations will be investigated by&#xD;
      the use of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults questionnaires. The State&#xD;
      questionnaire STAI-S consists of 20 statements that evaluate how respondents feel at the&#xD;
      moment in terms of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry. The inventory might also be&#xD;
      used to evaluate how respondents felt at a particular situation in the recent past. STAI-S&#xD;
      has been found to be sensitive to changes in transitory anxiety. The Trait questionnaire&#xD;
      STAI-T consist of 20 statements that evaluate how respondents feel in general and react to&#xD;
      stressful situations. The subjects will respond to the STAI-S directly after the CTE, and&#xD;
      MRE, as well as after optional capsule and ultrasound examinations respectively, when&#xD;
      remaining at the clinic, and also to the STAI-T directly after the second radiology&#xD;
      examination is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of up to 20 subjects will be asked to perform a capsule endoscopy examination and/or&#xD;
      ultrasound examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The capsule examination enables visualisation of both the small bowel and the colon&#xD;
           mucosa in one procedure. The Crohn's disease severity and presence of strictures, ulcers&#xD;
           and other lesions will be evaluated. In the small bowel and colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ultrasound examination enables visualisation of bowel wall thickening and flow and&#xD;
           presence of ulcers, strictures, fistulas and abscesses.&#xD;
