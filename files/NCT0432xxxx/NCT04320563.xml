      Resono Ophthalmic has developed Rexo-Eye in 2014, a QMR-based patented instrument which is&#xD;
      hypothesised to stimulate physiological cellular regeneration and reactivate the tear system&#xD;
      by stimulating and reactivating the lacrimal system, induce mild hyperthermia and massage&#xD;
      effects which reactivate the tear and lipid secretion, targeting all arms of pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms of dry eye disease. By improving cell migration and cell health, eye surface&#xD;
      epithelial problems in dry eyes which are hard to reverse could hopefully be improved. It has&#xD;
      been marked since 2016 as a medical device for the treatment of ocular surface disorders and&#xD;
      patented in Italy and Europe, with other international patents pending. In this study, we aim&#xD;
      to assess the efficacy and safety of Rexon-Eye in dry eye patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease, or ocular surface disease (OSD)as defined by the International Dry Eye&#xD;
      Workshop (2007)1, is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in&#xD;
      symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance and tear film instability with potential damage to&#xD;
      the ocular surface.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an armantaranium of therapies different types of dry eyes such as lubricating&#xD;
      eyedrops, moisture retention chamber, intense pulsed light which are not curative and require&#xD;
      repetitive application. Recently, Quantum molecular resonance (QMR) has emerged as a new&#xD;
      treatment for all types of dry eyes. This technology involves transpalpebral non-invasive&#xD;
      high frequency microcurrent electrical stimulation of cells which stimulate natural&#xD;
      regeneration of cells. With the application of low-power high-frequency oscillating&#xD;
      electrical currents in the range of 4 to 64 megahertz, it works via the resonance effect by&#xD;
      maximising delivery of energy to biological tissues by oscillating electrical fields without&#xD;
      increasing temperature and eliciting biological responses.2, 3 A previous in-vitro study had&#xD;
      evaluated the biophysical effects these high frequency electrical fields on cells in culture,&#xD;
      which showed that it invoked a series of cellular massage of contractions and relaxations'&#xD;
      which trigger cellular metabolism and stimulate tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resono Ophthalmic has developed Rexo-Eye in 2014, a QMR-based patented instrument which is&#xD;
      hypothesised to stimulate physiological cellular regeneration and reactivate the tear system&#xD;
      by stimulating and reactivating the lacrimal system, induce mild hyperthermia and massage&#xD;
      effects which reactivate the tear and lipid secretion, targeting all arms of pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms of dry eye disease. By improving cell migration and cell health, eye surface&#xD;
      epithelial problems in dry eyes which are hard to reverse could hopefully be improved. It has&#xD;
      been marked since 2016 as a medical device for the treatment of ocular surface disorders and&#xD;
      patented in Italy and Europe, with other international patents pending. Therapy takes place&#xD;
      in the form of special mask electrodes applied to the patient's periorbital area worn for 20&#xD;
      minutes per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies have shown evidence to improve subjective and objective symptoms of dry eye&#xD;
      disease as well as to successfully reduce the number of tear substitute eye drops over a 2&#xD;
      month treatment period with Rexon-Eye. However, these studies are mainly small scale and&#xD;
      conducted in Western populations. There have been no other studies conducted in Asian&#xD;
      populations on the efficacy and safety of the Rexon-Eye device in targeting dry eye disease.&#xD;
      Thus our study aims to evaluate these two aims through this study, while determining patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and acceptability of the technology and furthermore, exploring changes in the&#xD;
      composite of tears before and after the Rexon-Eye device.&#xD;
