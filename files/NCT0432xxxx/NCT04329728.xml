    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2 study designed to characterize the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics(PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of AVM0703 administered as a single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with lymphoid malignancies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 The Phase 1 portion of the study will enroll patients into a 3+3 dose-escalation&#xD;
      design to assess the dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and establish an Maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 does (RP2D). Up to 9 sequential AVM0703 dose cohorts are planned.&#xD;
      In each cohort, 3 to 6 patients will be treated. Each patient in each cohort will be&#xD;
      sequentially enrolled after 7 days of observation. Dose escalation will be allowed after 3&#xD;
      patients have completed the 21-day DLT assessment period with no reported DLTs or after 6&#xD;
      patients have completed the 21-day DLT assessment period with no more than 1 DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation will use the following rules for evaluating dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If none of the first 3 evaluable patients in a cohort experience a DLT, that dose level&#xD;
           will be deemed safe, and another 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose&#xD;
           level;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1 of the first 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT, 3 more patients will be&#xD;
           treated at the same dose level; If ≥2 of the 3 to 6 patients in any dose level&#xD;
           experience a DLT, that dose level will be considered to have exceeded the MTD and dosing&#xD;
           will stop at that level. If the previous dose level did not already have 6 patients&#xD;
           treated with ≤1 DLT, enrollment and dosing will then resume in the previous dose level&#xD;
           with additional patients up to a total of 6 patients. The highest dose level at which no&#xD;
           more than 1 of 6 evaluable patients has experienced a DLT in the 21-day DLT assessment&#xD;
           period will be considered the MTD for AVM0703; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If ≤1 patient experience(s) a DLT at the highest dose level tested, an MTD will not have&#xD;
           been established, but sufficient data may be available to select an RP2D based on the&#xD;
           overall safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon disease relapse, patients may be retreated at a dose previously shown to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Escalation Plan Dose Cohort AVM0703 Dose (a) Cohort 1: 6 mg/kg Cohort 2: 9 mg/kg Cohort&#xD;
      3: 12 mg/kg Cohort 4: 15 mg/kg Cohort 5: 18 mg/kg Cohort 6: 21 mg/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
      (a) Expressed as dexamethasone phosphate. For prophylaxis against dexamethasone-induced CNS&#xD;
      side effects, hydrocortisone will be dosed orally for 5 days starting on the day of&#xD;
      dexamethasone infusion. Hydrocortisone will be divided into 3 daily doses starting in the&#xD;
      morning and spaced 6 to 8 hours apart using the following dosing schedule each day: for&#xD;
      pediatric and adolescent patients at 5 mg/m2 (morning dose), 3 mg/m2 (mid day dose), and 2&#xD;
      mg/m2 dose (evening dose); and for adult patients at 10 mg/m2 (morning dose), 5 mg/m2&#xD;
      (mid-day dose), and 5 mg/m2 dose (evening dose), the last dose administered at hour of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for GI bleeding: Administer a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker starting&#xD;
           at least 1 day prior to and for approximately 4 weeks after AVM0703 administration, as&#xD;
           per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for TLS: All patients should be assessed for risk of TLS. Patients at high&#xD;
           risk for TLS are defined as patients with ALC &gt;25 × 109/L and/or who have a lymph node&#xD;
           &gt;10 cm. For patients at high risk of TLS, recommended prophylaxis is oral and IV&#xD;
           hydration and anti hyperuricemic therapy (eg, allopurinol or rasburicase) starting at 2&#xD;
           days before AVM0703 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for patients not deemed high risk for TLS will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring TLS: High-risk patients should have TLS labs (eg, potassium, phosphorus,&#xD;
           calcium, uric acid, and creatinine) obtained predose, and 4 and 8 hours post-infusion of&#xD;
           AVM0703 on Day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 To further assess safety and efficacy of AVM0703, disease-specific expansion cohorts&#xD;
      will be opened in the Phase 2 portion of the study to obtain preliminary evidence of clinical&#xD;
      activity. The Phase 2 portion of the study will include patients with malignancies that are&#xD;
      deemed responsive to AVM0703, such as DLBCL (including DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      and primary DLBCL of the CNS), high-grade B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma, Chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ SLL, T-cell lymphoma, or Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Up&#xD;
      to approximately 18 patients will be enrolled into each of the selected tumor types at the&#xD;
      MTD/RP2D defined in the Phase 1 portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon disease relapse, patients may be retreated at a dose previously shown to be safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient must be given additional anticancer therapy before Day 28, disease assessment&#xD;
      should be performed before they receive any other therapy. Patients who go on to receive&#xD;
      additional anticancer therapy will be followed for survival at 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
      post-infusion, and yearly thereafter until death, withdrawal of consent/assent, or study&#xD;
      closure. Survival information can be obtained via public records, telephone calls, and/or&#xD;
      medical records. Any subsequent anticancer therapy that the patients receive will also be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For prophylaxis against dexamethasone-induced CNS side effects, hydrocortisone will be dosed&#xD;
      orally for 5 days starting on the day of dexamethasone infusion. Hydrocortisone will be&#xD;
      divided into 3 daily doses starting in the morning and spaced 6 to 8 hours apart using the&#xD;
      following dosing schedule each day: for pediatric and adolescent patients at 5 mg/m2 (morning&#xD;
      dose), 3 mg/m2 (mid day dose), and 2 mg/m2 dose (evening dose); and for adult patients at 10&#xD;
      mg/m2 (morning dose), 5 mg/m2 (mid-day dose), and 5 mg/m2 dose (evening dose), the last dose&#xD;
      administered at hour of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for GI bleeding: Administer a proton pump inhibitor or H2 blocker starting&#xD;
           at least 1 day prior to and for approximately 4 weeks after AVM0703 administration, as&#xD;
           per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for TLS: All patients should be assessed for risk of TLS. Patients at high&#xD;
           risk for TLS are defined as patients with ALC &gt;25 × 109/L and/or who have a lymph node&#xD;
           &gt;10 cm. For patients at high risk of TLS, recommended prophylaxis is oral and IV&#xD;
           hydration and anti hyperuricemic therapy (eg, allopurinol or rasburicase) starting at 2&#xD;
           days before AVM0703 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prophylaxis for patients not deemed high risk for TLS will be at the discretion of the&#xD;
           Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring TLS: High-risk patients should have TLS labs (eg, potassium, phosphorus,&#xD;
           calcium, uric acid, and creatinine) obtained predose, and 4 and 8 hours post-infusion of&#xD;
           AVM0703 on Day 0.&#xD;
