      This study aims to develop a cost-effective screening strategy for the Singapore population&#xD;
      by targeted screening of people who have a high risk of stomach cancer, in order to detect&#xD;
      early signs of the disease at a stage that can be prevented or cured. Often, patients only&#xD;
      consult their doctors when they have advanced symptoms, by which time the cancer may be at a&#xD;
      difficult to treat, or incurable stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using costs in the Singapore health system as well as local population risk profiles and&#xD;
      demographics, our previous study demonstrated that screening of high-risk groups is&#xD;
      cost-effective and a panel of serum makers was effective in differentiating high-risk from&#xD;
      low-risk individuals. This study aims to validate the predictive value of various blood&#xD;
      biomarkers, such as that of antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, pepsinogen levels, micro&#xD;
      RNAs (miRNAs) and blood-based protein markers in participants who have been scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy for clinical reasons. If successful, the marker&#xD;
      can be used to stratify population into different risk groups and various screening systems&#xD;
      can be provided according to different risk level. This will reduce the number of annual&#xD;
      invasive screening examinations required to detect early gastric cancer (GC), thereby&#xD;
      rendering it cost-effective to generalize as clinical practice in Singapore.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Validate the predictive value of various blood biomarkers, including the panel of&#xD;
           antibodies against H.pylori and pepsinogen levels, micro RNAs (miRNAs) and blood-based&#xD;
           protein markers in a prospective cohort study involving 8000 participants who have been&#xD;
           referred for upper for predicting gastric cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record the number of participants who are diagnosed with gastric cancer, including high&#xD;
           grade dysplasia, carcinoma in-situ and adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop a cost-effective screening strategy based on 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a prospective cohort study involving 8000 subjects who are referred for&#xD;
      upper GI endoscopy for standard clinical indications. Blood will be drawn from subjects for&#xD;
      blood tests, including antibodies against H. pylori, pepsinogen levels, specific miRNA&#xD;
      levels, blood-based protein markers, before undergoing an upper GI endoscopy for clinical&#xD;
      reasons. Subjects will be monitored for a period of 10 years via verification with the&#xD;
      National Registry of Diseases Office (NRDO) of Singapore. The correlation between the blood&#xD;
      test results and findings from the clinical endoscopy or NRDO database verification will be&#xD;
      analyzed to determine the predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment Patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy will be considered for&#xD;
      enrolment provided they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 8000 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled. The Patient Informed Consent Form will be discussed with the patient. If&#xD;
      acceptable, the form will be signed by the patient, Principal Investigator and witness if&#xD;
      applicable. The subject will be assigned initials and a number in the order in which they&#xD;
      were enrolled. Subjects will also be asked to provide information on demographics, family&#xD;
      history of gastric cancer, diet, medical history, and lifestyle habits. The data will be&#xD;
      captured in a comprehensive database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Collection 15 mls of blood will be drawn from each subject. Serum, plasma and white&#xD;
      blood cells will be extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sera will be assayed for antibodies against H. pylori, Pepsinogen I and II levels to&#xD;
           derive H. pylori status and pepsinogen index. Participants will be classified into 4&#xD;
           groups, A, B, C and D, according to H. pylori status and pepsinogen Index. Group A&#xD;
           includes subjects negative for both H. pylori antibodies and pepsinogen atrophic&#xD;
           gastritis (PGA). Group B subjects will be negative for PGA and positive for H.pylori&#xD;
           antibodies. Group C subjects will be positive for both tests. Finally, Group D subjects&#xD;
           will be positive for PGA and negative for H. pylori antibodies. The incidence rate and&#xD;
           relative risk of gastric cancer as determined by the findings of subjects' clinical&#xD;
           gastroscopies or verification with NRDO will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total RNA from serum or plasma will be isolated and the expression levels of miRNAs will&#xD;
           be determined. The final miRNA expression levels after normalization of both technical&#xD;
           and biological variations are analyzed with multiple statistical methods to identify&#xD;
           panels of miRNAs with the highest discriminatory power between healthy and disease&#xD;
           states. Each participant will be assigned a score based on miRNA expression profile,&#xD;
           indicating the possibility of having GC. The result will be compared with endoscope and&#xD;
           histology result which is the gold standard for diagnosis of GC. We will compare the&#xD;
           performance of our miRNA panel with other serum markers including H. pylori status and&#xD;
           pepsinogen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Levels of 10 blood-based protein markers (determined from systematic review) will be&#xD;
           analyzed from sera through ELISAs (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Subsequent&#xD;
           statistical multivariate analysis may be applied to generate a biomarker panel with a&#xD;
           superior diagnostic performance compared to the conventional blood-based biomarkers for&#xD;
           gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation In our previous case-control study, 10% of the control group had&#xD;
      pepsinogen (PG) determined atrophic gastritis, and the odds ratio (95%CI) for the risk of&#xD;
      developing gastric cancer was 4.02 (2.56-6.30) compared with subjects who had no PG atrophic&#xD;
      gastritis. A minimum of 47 gastric cancer cases are required to evaluate the PG-H. Pylori&#xD;
      panel in the prediction of gastric cancer risk (with odds ratio 3.5) at power of 90% and&#xD;
      p-value &lt;0.05. Based on the estimated gastric cancer prevalence rate among NUH patients of&#xD;
      the gastroenterology and upper GI surgery clinics of 0.6%, a cohort size of 8000 subjects&#xD;
      will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis The chi-square test and the t-test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      distributions of selected demographic, lifestyle and other risk factors between cases and&#xD;
      controls. The logistic regression method will be used to examine the associations between&#xD;
      blood markers measured and risk of gastric cancer. Statistical computing will be carried out&#xD;
      using the SPSS 19. The statistical significance level is set at two-sided P value of 0.05.&#xD;
