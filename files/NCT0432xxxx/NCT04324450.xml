  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumours are the leading cause of cancer-related death and morbidity in children,&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults. The brain is also one of the most sensitive organs to&#xD;
      treatments used in pediatric oncology, even for cancers not related to the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Therapeutic index is therefore a major issue in pediatric neuro-oncology. The&#xD;
      efficacy of the therapy as well as its toxicity are difficult to measure using standard&#xD;
      tests. In order to optimize therapies that could have an impact on the brain, and&#xD;
      consequently on the quality of life of patients, it becomes crucial to optimize the means of&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies to date have focused on the various components of memory impacted following&#xD;
      treatment of a posterior fossa tumour. However, supra-tentorial structures such as the&#xD;
      hippocampus, which have long been described for their role in memory, are either partially&#xD;
      irradiated (irradiated in their lower part due to their proximity to the target volume during&#xD;
      irradiation of the posterior fossa) or completely irradiated (e.g. included in the&#xD;
      prophylactic irradiation of medulloblastoma prior to dose supplementation in the posterior&#xD;
      fossa). On the other hand, the cerebellum plays a central role in learning and procedural&#xD;
      memory involved in motor and cognitive learning, as it enables automation and procedural&#xD;
      retention such as reading (automation of the grapho-phonemic conversion procedure) or&#xD;
      arithmetic (mental arithmetic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPALA study is aimed at investigating the impact of different irradiation doses received by&#xD;
      children treated with radiotherapy on cognitive functions related to the hippocampus and to&#xD;
      the cerebellum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study will thus provide elements enabling a better limitation of&#xD;
      radiotherapy doses on regions linked to the development of cognition and memory. The project&#xD;
      brings together researchers and clinicians with complementary expertise in oncology,&#xD;
      neurology and imaging in both children and adults. This study will also provide a better&#xD;
      understanding of the role of the cerebellum in memory and executive functions, and develop a&#xD;
      method that can then be used in a prospective longitudinal multicentre form.&#xD;
