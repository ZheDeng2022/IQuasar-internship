    <textblock>
      In a 10-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled outpatient pilot trial the efficacy&#xD;
      of pregabalin in the treatment of alcohol dependence will be studied in 50 treatment-seeking&#xD;
      outpatients. Participants will report drinking a minimum of 5 standard drinks for men or 4&#xD;
      standard drinks for women at least 4 days per week over the past 28 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 10-week double-blind placebo controlled outpatient clinical trial, the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy ofpregabalin will be tested in 50 outpatients with Alcohol Use Disorder.Participants&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated (1:1) to receive pregabalin or an identical-appearing, inert&#xD;
      placebo. All study medication (placebo and pregabalin) will be over-capsulated with&#xD;
      riboflavin to assess compliance. Pregabalin will be administered in 75 mg and 100 capsules;&#xD;
      placebo capsules will appear identical to the pregabalin capsules. Participants in both study&#xD;
      arms will receive the same number of capsules. Pregabalin will be titrated over a 3-week&#xD;
      period to the FDA maximum (600 mg per day) or the maximum tolerated dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur daily for the first 4 days of the study period, then approximately&#xD;
      every other day for the remainder of week 1, for a total of 5 study visits (study days&#xD;
      1,2,3,4, and 5 or 7). During the second week, study visits will continue every other day for&#xD;
      a total of 3 study visits (study days 8,10, and 12). During the remainder of the 8-week&#xD;
      medication study period, study visits will occur twice weekly. There will be two visits&#xD;
      during a post-study taper week (week 9) and a follow-up visit during week 10. One visit per&#xD;
      week will be with the research psychiatrist. All participants will have a weekly supportive&#xD;
      behavioral treatment session with the research psychiatrist using a manual designed for&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy trials in subjects with alcohol use disorders&#xD;
