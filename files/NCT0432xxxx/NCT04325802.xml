      Purpose: To study the etiology and the epigenetic pathways leading to and regulating chronic&#xD;
      itch. Similarly, to examine the mechanisms underlying skin changes, including epigenetic&#xD;
      alterations while also testing the efficacy of opioid antagonists in atopic dermatitis. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to examine chronic sensory disorder mechanisms related to&#xD;
      chronic itch.&#xD;

      Specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A1 Evaluate the underlying mechanism of itch severity in terms of circadian rhythm by&#xD;
      collecting epidermis at different circadian stages using suction blisters. This will be done&#xD;
      in AD patients with chronic itch. The cells will be isolated from part of the suction&#xD;
      blisters and used to isolate and sequence RNA to evaluate and compare the differential&#xD;
      protein and RNA expression in suction blister taken from symptomatic &amp; non-symptomatic areas&#xD;
      in patients with AD at different time points. The investigators will then correlate the itch&#xD;
      severity symptoms to clock gene and opioid receptor levels and RNA expression differential&#xD;
      pattern. A1 will be evaluated by study arm A and the results from this study will serve to&#xD;
      decide on time point taking the suction blisters for the therapeutic/mechanistic studies (arm&#xD;
      B and C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A2 Investigate the mechanistic role and therapeutic efficacy of opioid receptors in chronic&#xD;
      itch. For this purpose, a cross-over, placebo-controlled design will be used to treat&#xD;
      patients with opioid receptor antagonist (Naltrexone) by expanding on our existing trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect, evaluate, quantify and compare the differential protein and RNA&#xD;
      expression in epidermis taken by suction blisters from symptomatic and non-symptomatic areas&#xD;
      in patients with AD on Placebo or Naltrexone treatment. Transcriptome analysis will be&#xD;
      focused, but not restricted to, analysis of neuroinflammatory and neuronal markers (including&#xD;
      cytokines, GPCR and opioid receptors). Confirmation will occur using in-situ hybridization of&#xD;
      biopsies to correlate specific cell type and location and qPCR expression of in vitro&#xD;
      cultures. The binding studies using fluorescent labeled opioid ligands and internalization&#xD;
      pattern will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A3 Test the underlying mechanisms of the opioid system with nerve-keratinocyte interaction&#xD;
      and possible effects on itch transduction from skin to nerves by using an in vitro&#xD;
      neuron-keratinocyte co-culture model. Moreover, the investigators plan to validate&#xD;
      itch-causing networks and pathways found in A2 using this in vitro model and will be able to&#xD;
      evaluate calcium flux threshold changes after exposure to external stimuli (e.g. light, or&#xD;
      mechanic stimuli) onto keratinocytes and neuronal somata under different opioid exposure&#xD;
      conditions. The FC derived sensory neurons will be co-cultured with different patient KC. The&#xD;
      investigators will test the reaction pattern of KC and transmission of the signal to&#xD;
      connected peripheral sensory neurons by Fluo-4 AM Calcium imaging and electrophysiology. The&#xD;
      reaction will be responding to the odorant Sandalore, as the investigators have previously&#xD;
      published that Sandalore induces these desired calcium fluxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apply the in vitro epithelial/nerve model to validate possible itch pathways identified by&#xD;
      epigenetic analysis in the clinical trials by confirming the expression pattern with qPCR and&#xD;
      functional assays on cells with CRISPR knockout of the RNA targets, opioid trafficking,&#xD;
      calcium imaging and electrophysiology. Finally, further develop co-cultures between human&#xD;
      skin and iPS-derived human peripheral neurons to perform functional studies.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will start with placebo in week 1 and cross over to Naltrexone in week 3. There will be a wash-out phase during week 2 using only moisturizer regularly and if necessary as rescue medications topical corticosteroids and/or antihistamines. The same rescue medications can be used during the following weeks of the cross-over treatment. At visit 2 and 4 patients will be asked the area where they are experiencing most intense itch and we will take there suction blisters (preferably on the trunk). Suction blisters will be taken after week 1 (1 week on treatment arm 1) and after week 3 (1 week on treatment arm 2).</description>
