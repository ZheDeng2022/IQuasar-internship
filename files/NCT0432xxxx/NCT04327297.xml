      This study evaluate the mineral status of infants with cow's milk protein allergy which is&#xD;
      affected due to the elimination of milk , and the change in this mineral status after&#xD;
      receiving amino acid - based formula for 12 weeks.&#xD;

      Introduction Food allergy is defined as an adverse health effect arising from a specific&#xD;
      Immune response that occurs following ingestion of a given food . Cow's milk protein (CMP) is&#xD;
      the leading cause of food allergy in infants and young children younger than 3 years .Cow's&#xD;
      milk contains at least 25 different proteins , all of which may act as antigens .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevelance Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) does seem to peak in the first year of life,&#xD;
      with a prevalence of approximately 2% to 3% in the Infant population . This prevalence then&#xD;
      falls to &lt;1% in children 6 years of age and older . A few exclusively breast-fed infants may&#xD;
      also develop clinically significant CMPA via dairy protein transfer into human breast milk .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical presentation Manifestations of CMPA may involve many different organ systems mostly&#xD;
      the skin and the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract . Skin: Urticaria, Atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal: perioral swelling , vomiting, regurgitation, early Satiety, diarrhea&#xD;
      (+/-malabsorption or protein loss enteropathy) , failure to thrive, abdominal colic and&#xD;
      persistent constipation . Respiratory: runny nose, wheezing and chronic cough. General&#xD;
      manifestation: anaphylaxis leading to death in sensitized patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic procedures Thorough medical history and physical examination. Skin prick test&#xD;
      (SPT) and the determination of specific Ig-E in a blood sample. Allergen elimination and&#xD;
      controlled challenge procedure. Cow's Milk-related-Symptom-Score (CoMiSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cow's Milk-related Symptom-Score (CoMiSS) is a score that considers general manifestations&#xD;
      ,dermatological and respiratory symptoms.It was developed to be used as an awareness tool for&#xD;
      cow's milk related symptoms. It also can be used to evaluate and quantify the evolution of&#xD;
      symptoms during therapeutic interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mineral elements in milk and their nutritional importance There is a sufficient evidence that&#xD;
      minerals, both independently or in proper balance with other minerals, have structural,&#xD;
      biochemical and nutritional functions that are very important for overall human health, both&#xD;
      mental and physical . Furthermore, they act as catalysts for many biological reactions in the&#xD;
      body, including muscle contraction, transmission of nerve impulses and utilization of&#xD;
      nutrients from food .Many mineral elements are essential in human nutrition: sodium,&#xD;
      potassium, chloride, calcium, manganese, selenium, iodine, cobalt .All essential mineral&#xD;
      elements can be found in milk because by definition it contains the nutrients required for&#xD;
      growth of the young .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cow milk protein allergy and mineral status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate nutritional intake in infancy is essential to ensure appropriate physiological and&#xD;
      mental development .Exclusion diets, in particular cows' milk exclusion diets, have been&#xD;
      associated with poor growth in childhood ; as eliminating dairy products in diets of CMP&#xD;
      allergic infants ,as well as, coexisting feeding problems ,can result in removing a&#xD;
      substantial source of minerals which are involved in essential body functions .This avoidance&#xD;
      should ideally be supported by input from an allergy dietitian to monitor and optimise the&#xD;
      nutritional content of the diet and to maintain potential growth .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following treatment options are available for infants with CMPA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypoallergenic extensively hydrolyzed formulas (eHF) of cow's milk proteins,theses&#xD;
           formulas are of choice in patients with CMPA, however, allergic reactions have been&#xD;
           reported in children extremely sensitive to cow's milk .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Milk derived from purified soya proteins. However, the use of soya is not recommended as&#xD;
           a substitute in infants with CMPA under 6 months of age .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Milk derived from partial rice protein hydrolysis formulas; they have scant sensitising&#xD;
           capacity and do not produce adverse reactions .&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Free amino acid -based formulas (AAF). Amino acid-based formulas (AAF) Formula&#xD;
           containing free amino acids as the only nitrogen source. An (eHF) is recommended for&#xD;
           infants with mild to moderate CMA, whereas initiation with an (AAF) is recommended for&#xD;
           more severe or complex allergy or when symptom-resolution with (eHF) fails or when&#xD;
           (eHF)s are rejected by the patients due to playability problems . Dietary management of&#xD;
           CMA with an AAF has been proven to be well-tolerated, effective, and safe; adequate&#xD;
           infant growth on an AAF has widely been reported .&#xD;
