      This study will systematically quantify the effects of protein pacing and intermittent&#xD;
      fasting (PP-IF) on total and regional (abdominal) body composition (lean mass and fat mass),&#xD;
      blood glucose and lipids, and anti-aging biomarkers, hunger ratings, and the gut microbiome&#xD;
      in 40 overweight/obese adult men (n=20) and women (n=20) following a 8-week weight loss&#xD;
      intervention. Participants will be enrolled in the study as a single cohort and participate&#xD;
      in a 8-week weight loss (WL) trial consisting of a single dietary intervention phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown combined protein pacing and intermittent fasting (PP-IF; 1-2 days&#xD;
      per week) combined with moderate (20-30%) caloric restriction (CR) favorably enhance weight&#xD;
      loss, body composition, cardiometabolic disease risk, oxidative stress, and toxin levels&#xD;
      compared to a heart healthy diet in obese individuals following both weight loss and weight&#xD;
      loss maintenance (Arciero et al. 2016; He et al. 2017; Zuo et al. 2016). However, less is&#xD;
      known about whether a low sugar intake with this dietary pattern induces other significant&#xD;
      health improvements, such as enhanced brain health (mood state), as well as gut microbiome&#xD;
      and anti-aging indices, compared to a heart healthy diet. The novelty of the current proposal&#xD;
      is of particular relevance and importance given the heightened popularity of low sugar&#xD;
      dietary patterns shown to enhance health status. Most notably, among these low sugar diets&#xD;
      touting the health benefits, are the ketogenic, paleolithic and Mediterranean diets. In&#xD;
      addition, there is a great deal of public health emphasis on reducing overall carbohydrate&#xD;
      intake, especially simple sugars, to improve cardiometabolic, gut, and body composition&#xD;
      health. The dangers of high simple sugar intake are numerous, including increased risk for&#xD;
      cardiometabolic disease (high blood lipids, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, oxidative stress, obesity, elevated visceral fat, etc.). Thus, improvements in&#xD;
      body composition and reductions in disease risk provides compelling evidence to pursue this&#xD;
      study with vigor so as to generate a viable and healthy weight and fat loss strategy over the&#xD;
      long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a low sugar protein pacing,&#xD;
      intermittent fasting (PP-IF) diet versus a heart healthy (HH) diet on indices of body weight,&#xD;
      total and regional body composition, mood state, anti-aging, and cardiometabolic outcomes,&#xD;
      and the gut microbiome during weight loss (0-8 weeks). Specifically, this study aims to&#xD;
      compare a PP-IF diet comprised of a calorie-restricted (1500 calories/day women; 1800&#xD;
      calories/day men) protein pacing diet (PP, 4 meals/day women, 5 meals/day men) followed by a&#xD;
      fast (IF, ~350-450 kcals/day) compared to an established calorie-restricted (1200&#xD;
      calories/day for women; 1500 calories/day men) heart healthy (HH) diet. The PP-IF group will&#xD;
      be divided into two subgroups for weeks 1-4. One subgroup will consist of five days of PP and&#xD;
      two days of IF, and the second subgroup will consist of six days of PP and one day of IF. For&#xD;
      weeks 5-8 both subgroups will follow 6 days of a PP diet and 1 day IF.&#xD;

    <description>During the 8-week weight loss (WL) phase, participants assigned to the PP-IF will consist of PP days, whereby female participants will consume four and male participants will consume five meals/snacks total, two of which (breakfast and lunch) will include a protein powder meal replacement mixed with water (240-400 kcals per meal) along with an evening dinner meal (~500 kcals), an afternoon snack (men only), and an evening snack (250 kcals). Subjects will be calorie restricted to ~1500 and ~1800 calories per day, women and men, respectively during PP days. For each IF day, subjects will be provided a variety of supplements/snacks made by Isagenix International LLC. The PP-IF group will be further divided into two subgroups for weeks 1-4. One subgroup will consist of five days of PP and two days of IF, and the second subgroup will consist of six days of PP and one day of IF. For weeks 5-8 both subgroups will follow 6 days of a PP diet and 1 day IF.</description>
