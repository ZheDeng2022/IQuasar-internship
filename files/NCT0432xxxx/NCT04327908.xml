  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MSTS is an evaluation tool used worldwide to assess physical function in patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal tumors. The questionnaire has already been successfully translated and&#xD;
      validated in Portuguese and Japanese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the TESS and the MSTS have already been used in many studies that examined bone and soft&#xD;
      tissue tumors - also in German-speaking populations. So far, however, there is no validated&#xD;
      German version of these questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study at hand is to translate the TESS and the MSTS into German and to&#xD;
      validate them for patients with bone and soft tissue tumors / sarcomas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and chondrosarcoma.&#xD;
      The main symptom in patients with primary bone tumors is pain that can occur at rest or at&#xD;
      night. The physical examination often shows swelling and restricted movement of the joints.&#xD;
      Malignant bone tumors require multidisciplinary treatment that focuses on the surgical&#xD;
      removal of the tumor. The extremity-preserving procedure contrasts with the amputation.&#xD;
      Studies show that the functional result after restoration of the limb is superior to the&#xD;
      amputation and that the relapse rate and mortality are comparable in both procedures. The&#xD;
      goal of tumor resection is therefore to keep the treatment-related restrictions as low as&#xD;
      possible, especially with regard to quality of life, function of the extremity and&#xD;
      recurrence-free survival of the patients. The improvement of the functional results and&#xD;
      longevity of reconstructive procedures remains a major challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same applies to the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. However, early diagnosis is often&#xD;
      hampered by atypical symptoms such as soft tissue swelling, painful lesions or no symptoms at&#xD;
      all and is reported in the literature with an average period of time until the final&#xD;
      diagnosis of 3 to 6 months. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice. Radiation therapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy and isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion can be used depending on tumor&#xD;
      histology, degree and extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of the clinical outcome is of great importance. In order to objectify,&#xD;
      measure and compare the success or failure of treatment with current literature and other&#xD;
      tumor centers and to evaluate the invasive surgical procedures. Questionnaires such as the&#xD;
      Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) were&#xD;
      developed to measure the functional results after surgery and heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TESS is a valid and disease-specific measure for evaluating functional disorders in&#xD;
      patients between 12-85 years of age who are treated surgically for a bone or soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma of the extremities. The questionnaire measures parameters such as Mobility,&#xD;
      independence in everyday life, participation in social life and the pursuit of leisure&#xD;
      activities. There is a version for the upper and one for the lower extremity with 30&#xD;
      questions each. Each question is rated on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being the value for normal&#xD;
      performance. So far there have been studies to validate the TESS in Portuguese, Danish,&#xD;
      Korean and Japanese.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSTS is an evaluation tool used worldwide to assess physical function in patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal tumors. The questionnaire has already been successfully translated and&#xD;
      validated in Portuguese and Japanese.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The questionnaire will be tested on patients who are undergoing extremity-conserving&#xD;
             surgery for sarcomas at one of the participating centers as part of the clinical&#xD;
             routine. The patients are addressed preoperatively by a member of the study team and&#xD;
             during their stay in the clinic whether they participate in the study.&#xD;
