    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect and report in human preliminary safety and device&#xD;
      performance data of the TISSIUM™ Nerve Coaptation Device for the repair of digital nerve&#xD;
      discontinuities where gap closure can be achieved by flexion of the extremity. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted at up to 4 centres and will enroll up to 12 subjects.&#xD;
