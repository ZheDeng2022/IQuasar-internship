    <textblock>
      there is a need for improving chemotherapy regimen for metastatic G3 NEC of GEP and Unknown&#xD;
      origin and this goal may be achieved through more &quot;personalized&quot; chemotherapy regimen.the&#xD;
      hypothesis is that mFOLFIRINOX regimen could be a good candidate for challenging the&#xD;
      platinum-etoposide regimen in patients with metastatic G3 NEC of GEP or unknown origin.&#xD;
      Furthermore, in order to get insights in the putative predictive biomarkers of efficacy of&#xD;
      these two regimens, an effort toward a precise molecular characterization of these tumors is&#xD;
      required in order to be able to define which subgroup of G3 NEC needs to be treated by which&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. The FOLFIRINEC trial is set up in order to try to answer these&#xD;
      questions&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grade 3 poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (G3 NEC) are rare diseases. The&#xD;
      diagnosis is often done at the metastatic stage and the prognosis is poor. The standard&#xD;
      first-line treatment is the platinum-etoposide chemotherapy regimen, mostly based on&#xD;
      retrospective studies .With this regimen, response rate (RR) is 40 to 70% but the median&#xD;
      progression-free survival is between 4 and 9 months. Disease progression almost always occurs&#xD;
      during or just after treatment and median overall survival (OS) is only about 12-15 months&#xD;
      for gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NEC with similar efficacy of either cisplatin or&#xD;
      carboplatin in the NORDIC study and of 8 to 10 months for pulmonary NEC. After progression,&#xD;
      only 40 to 45% of patients will receive a second line chemotherapy which will include&#xD;
      5-fluoro-uracil (5FU) and irinotecan (FOLFIRI or oxaliplatin (XELOX, FOLFOX).This second line&#xD;
      treatment can provide around 30% of responses and a median progression-free survival of 4&#xD;
      months. Taken together, these data indicate a major medical need for improving G3 NEC&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few trials have tried to challenge the standard platinum-etoposide first-line treatment.&#xD;
      Clinical trials challenging the platinum-etoposide combination in the first-line setting&#xD;
      feasibility has already been demonstrated with paclitaxel-carboplatin-etoposide combination&#xD;
      and the cisplatin-irinotecan phase III trials. However, these trials have shown equivalent&#xD;
      activities between experimental group and platinum-etoposide regimen. Furthermore, the lack&#xD;
      of randomization precluded any definitive conclusion. Therefore, prospective randomized&#xD;
      studies aiming at improving first-line chemotherapy remains challenging and clinically&#xD;
      meaningful. Currently, the only randomized trial in progress in first line treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic G3 GEP NEC compares platinum-etoposide to temozolomide-capecitabine. Other&#xD;
      mono-arm phase II studies evaluate carboplatin - nab-paclitaxel and everolimus - temozolomide&#xD;
      combinations. FOLFIRINOX is also planned to be evaluated in a mono-arm first or subsequent&#xD;
      line setting at Lee. H Moffit Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the second-line treatment studies of metastatic G3 NEC of GEP or unknown origin were&#xD;
      retrospective, they have suggested that both irinotecan and oxaliplatin, in conjunction with&#xD;
      5FU can have anti-tumor effect in G3 NEC. In recent years, the intensified chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimen FOLFIRINOX, which associates 5FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, has shown great&#xD;
      efficacy in several digestive cancer such as pancreas or colorectal adenocarcinoma. Tolerance&#xD;
      of this regimen has improved over the years with better management and dose adaptations that&#xD;
      has led to the development of the mFOLFIRINOX regimen . mFOLFIRINOX could be a good&#xD;
      first-line treatment candidate in metastatic GEP NEC because: (i) Oxaliplatin, irinotecan and&#xD;
      5FU have anti tumor effect in metastatic GEP NEC; (ii) trichemotherapy with a potential high&#xD;
      RR could be efficient in these chemosensitive cancers; (iii) the degradation of performance&#xD;
      status following tumor progression after first-line treatment makes access to a second line&#xD;
      uncertain which argue for the use of an aggressive first-line treatment; (iiii)&#xD;
      administration on a one-day outpatient basis (day hospital) as well as acceptable and&#xD;
      manageable side effects, could have an impact on quality of life in these patients with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis. the hypothesis is that the intensive trichemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX, improves&#xD;
      the prognosis of patients with metastatic G3 NEC from GEP or unknown primary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known on the predictive factors of first-line chemotherapy in metastatic G3 NEC and&#xD;
      few trials have tried to challenge the platinum-etoposide standard. Among G3 NEC, there are 2&#xD;
      histological subtypes; eg. small cell NEC (SCNEC) and large cell NEC (LCNEC). These two&#xD;
      subtypes are treated with the same platinum-etoposide regimen, whatever the primary, although&#xD;
      RR seem to differ between SCNEC and LCNEC. This difference has been reported for pulmonary G3&#xD;
      NEC: the RR to platinum-etoposide was 34% in the French phase II trial on LCNEC and 37% in a&#xD;
      recent retrospective study, while the RR of SCNEC was 50 to 60% in different reports.&#xD;
      Moreover, the difference in RR to platinum based chemotherapy has also been recently reported&#xD;
      in a Japanese retrospective study of pancreatic NEC with RR of 68 and 44% for SCNEC and LCNEC&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results suggest that there could be some biological differences among G3 NEC, which&#xD;
      could be responsible for the different responses to treatment and that G3 NEC could be a&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of tumors. While pulmonary SCNEC are fairly homogeneous tumors and are&#xD;
      characterized by a quasi-constant Rb loss of expression, LCNEC are more heterogeneous. A&#xD;
      sequencing study of 45 pulmonary LCNEC samples has shown that 40% of the tumors had a&#xD;
      mutational profile which looks like small cell lung cancer (SCLC) while 58% of the tumors had&#xD;
      a mutation profile like those found in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Rekhtman et al.&#xD;
      2016). According to their molecular profiles, LCNEC could be divided between &quot;NSCLC-like&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;SCLC-like&quot; tumors. &quot;SCLC-like&quot; tumors were characterized by p53 and Rb inactivating&#xD;
      mutations while &quot;NSCLC-like&quot; tumors were characterized by p53 inactivating mutations but also&#xD;
      KRAS and STK11 mutations like those found in lung adenocarcinomas. Therefore, when&#xD;
      considering the pulmonary NEC model, it could be hypothesized that, among LCNEC, some tumors&#xD;
      may be &quot;adenocarcinoma-like&quot; and some other may be really &quot;SCNEC-like&quot;. This hypothesis is&#xD;
      supported by some data from digestive tract G3 NEC. Rb loss of expression is found in 100% of&#xD;
      SCNEC of the colon versus 31% of LCNEC of the colon; Rb loss is also found in 89% of SCNEC&#xD;
      versus 60% of LCNEC of the pancreas . These data seem to parallel the pulmonary NEC data and&#xD;
      suggest that G3 NEC, especially LCNEC, is a heterogeneous group of tumors with some of them&#xD;
      being biologically very close to SCNEC with Rb loss and others being more biologically close&#xD;
      to adenocarcinoma. G3 SCNEC are probably more homogeneous but some heterogeneity is also&#xD;
      possible within this group because the pathological diagnosis of &quot;large&quot;versus &quot;small cell&quot;&#xD;
      is challenging. This has led to the hypothesis that LCNEC could arise from different cell of&#xD;
      origin, i.e; from neuroendocrine precursors and/or from trans-differentiation of&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma cells as already described in prostate and lung cancer while SCNEC would&#xD;
      represent the bona fide poorly differentiated NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking together the putative biological heterogeneity of G3 NEC and the need, in clinical&#xD;
      practice, for more effective chemotherapy regimen, it can be hypothesized that a more&#xD;
      &quot;tailored&quot; chemotherapy regimen is needed for G3 NEC patients. This is supported by the&#xD;
      retrospective analysis from the Dutch registry of pulmonary NEC which have suggested that&#xD;
      &quot;NSCLC-like&quot; chemotherapy regimen without pemetrexed were more effective than &quot;SCLC-like&quot;&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of pulmonary LCNEC. Moreover, the same group has&#xD;
      recently reported that the better efficacy of &quot;NSCLC-like&quot; chemotherapy was observed for&#xD;
      pulmonary LCNEC without Rb mutation (the so-called &quot;NSCLC-like&quot; tumors in the Rekhtman et al&#xD;
      study) while Rb mutated LCNEC did not have significantly different response to &quot;SCLC-like&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;NSCLC like&quot; chemotherapy regimens. This has also been shown in pancreatic LCNEC with a&#xD;
      RR to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy of 80% in case of Rb loss of expression, and&#xD;
      38.4% in case of retained Rb expression.&#xD;
