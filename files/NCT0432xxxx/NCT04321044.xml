      Many attempts to identify predictors of blood pressure response after renal denervation&#xD;
      failed to identify a meaningful determination of blood pressure response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These attempts have been based on demographic parameters, clinical parameters, endocrine&#xD;
      inflammatory and other biochemical variables, comorbidities and disease factors. So far the&#xD;
      only predictor of blood pressure response is the pre-treatment blood pressure. According to&#xD;
      Wilder's law the pre-treatment baseline value is always a determinant for any change due to&#xD;
      an intervention, irrespective which biological variable is examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a genetic approach to identify predictors of blood pressure&#xD;
      response after renal denervation. Genetic factors are not subject to changes of clinical&#xD;
      parameters, previous or current antihypertensive therapy, hypertension associated organ&#xD;
      damages, comorbidities and other potential clinical variables.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to now numerous attempts to identify predictors of blood pressure response after renal&#xD;
      denervation failed to identify a meaningful and consistent determinant of blood pressure&#xD;
      response. These approaches have been based on demographic parameters, clinical parameters,&#xD;
      comorbidities and disease factors as well as numerous endocrine inflammatory and other&#xD;
      biochemical variables. Only the pre-treatment blood pressure emerged as a predictor of blood&#xD;
      pressure response which is no surprise since according to Wilder's law the pre-treatment&#xD;
      baseline value is always a determinant for any change due to an intervention, irrespective&#xD;
      which biological variable is examined, e.g. blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HbA1c and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators suggest a genetic approach to identify predictors of blood pressure&#xD;
      response after renal denervation. The rationale is quite simple: Genetic factors are not&#xD;
      subject to changes of clinical parameters, previous or current antihypertensive therapy,&#xD;
      hypertension associated organ damages, comorbidities, and other potential clinical variables.&#xD;
      By such an approach the investigators previously were very successful to identify several&#xD;
      parameters of modulators hypertensive organ damage that could not have been identified by&#xD;
      pathophysiological or pharmaceutical maneuvers. THE INVESTIGATORS PREFER TO RUN A GENOM WIDE&#xD;
      ASSOCIATION STUDY AND THE PARTNERS IN GLASGOW AND EDINBURGH HAVE THE DEEP KNOWLWEDGE;&#xD;
      EXPERIENCE AND CAPACITY TO RUN A NGS (next generation sequencing, so that's the complete&#xD;
      genome)) INCLUDING ALL BIOINFORMATICS AND OTHER ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators attempt to identify predictors of blood pressure response to renal&#xD;
      denervation by using a GWAS (genome wide association study) approach. This allows to identify&#xD;
      various suspected and unexpected polymorphism that are of interest and potentially being&#xD;
      strong predictors of blood pressure response. By that approach the investigators will&#xD;
      identify novel mechanism of action that are important for blood pressure response (by&#xD;
      identifying polymorphism that are beyond the classical thinking how renal denervation may&#xD;
      exert blood pressure lowering effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with the Homburg Group (Prof. Dr. Felix Mahfoud), the investigators will&#xD;
      extract DNA from stored samples of patients with uncontrolled treatment resistant&#xD;
      hypertension and perform a genome wide association study analysis (GWAS) in two cohorts:&#xD;
      no/low responders vs. high/excellent responders. NGS will be applied by the partners in&#xD;
      Glasgow and Edinburgh. All patients with renal denervation will be categorized according to&#xD;
      their pretreatment adjusted blood pressure response and the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      upper quartile vs. the lower quartile of all patients that has been so far studied in Homburg&#xD;
      and Erlangen. By excluding those patients with a medium or average blood pressure response,&#xD;
      the investigators will have two distinct response patterns: low/no response vs.&#xD;
      high/excellent response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By applying standard biostatistics analysis, the investigators will come up with a pattern of&#xD;
      polymorphism that are significantly different between the two groups. These identified&#xD;
      polymorphisms (or a pattern of it) may be refer, not unexpectedly, to renin angiotensin&#xD;
      aldosterone system, sodium and water balance, sympathetic nervous system or other endocrine&#xD;
      parameters related to hypertension. In addition to that, the investigators may find&#xD;
      significant results of polymorphisms involved in other pathophysiologic pathways not related&#xD;
      to hypertension (by our current knowledge) and that the Investigators have not thought about&#xD;
      to be related to uncontrolled hypertension. These novel mechanism need to be subsequently&#xD;
      further analyzed, but they will offer the opportunity to find novel predictors of blood&#xD;
      pressure response.&#xD;
