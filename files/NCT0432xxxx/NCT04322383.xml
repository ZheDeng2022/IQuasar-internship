      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with hairy cell leukemia have a BRAF gene mutation. They can be treated with BRAF&#xD;
      inhibitors, drugs that target this mutation. For people who do not have this mutation, BRAF&#xD;
      inhibitors are not a treatment option. We found that in hairy cell leukemia, when BRAF is not&#xD;
      mutated, the MEK gene frequently is. Binimetinib is a MEK inhibitor which targets MEK. It is&#xD;
      important to determine if this drug can be a good treatment option in those who cannot&#xD;
      benefit treatment with BRAF inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if binimetinib is an effective treatment for hairy cell leukemia that does not have a&#xD;
      BRAF mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with hairy cell leukemia without a mutation in the BRAF gene and&#xD;
      whose disease either did not respond to treatment or came back after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow biopsy: A needle will be injected through the participant s skin into the&#xD;
           bone to remove a sample of marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT or MRI scan: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the body. They&#xD;
           might receive a contrast agent by vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before they start treatment, participants will have an abdominal ultrasound, pulmonary&#xD;
      function tests, and exercise stress tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take binimetinib by mouth twice daily in 28-day cycles. They will keep a&#xD;
      medication diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least one visit before every cycle. Visits will include repeats of&#xD;
      some screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue treatment as long as their disease does not get worse and they do&#xD;
      not have bad side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About a month after their last dose of treatment, participants will have a follow-up visit.&#xD;
      They will then have visits once a year.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell leukemia comprising 2% of all leukemias,&#xD;
           or approximately 1900 new cases per year in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRAF V600E mutation is very common in classic HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HCL variant (HCLv) is wild type for BRAF and is more aggressive compared to classic HCL&#xD;
           due to its lower response and shorter duration of response to standard purine analog&#xD;
           chemotherapy. The median survival is only ~6 years compared to &gt;25 years for classic&#xD;
           HCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD25+ classic-appearing HCL-cells that express unmutated IGHV4-34+ immunoglobulin&#xD;
           rearrangement, are wild-type for BRAF, and confer a poor prognosis when treated with&#xD;
           standard purine analog chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While BRAF and MEK combination inhibition is making an impact in the treatment of BRAF&#xD;
           V600E mutated HCL, this treatment is not applicable for patients with BRAF-WT HCL/HCLv.&#xD;
           Furthermore, with poor survival outcomes in this patient population, lack of targeted&#xD;
           therapy constitutes a clear unmet need.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recently, several BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients have received MEK inhibitors by&#xD;
           compassionate use and have had lifesaving partial to complete remission, however the&#xD;
           response has not been assessed systematically in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binimetinib (also known as MEK162) is an orally bioavailable, selective and potent&#xD;
           mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK1 and MEK2) inhibitor, which is&#xD;
           approved for use in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with&#xD;
           BRAF-mutant melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have described MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations which may drive the aggressive clinical&#xD;
           behavior of BRAF WT HCL/HCLv patients, but MEK inhibition may be clinically useful even&#xD;
           in these patients without known MAP2K1 (MEK) mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine the overall response rate (ORR) to binimetinib, in patients with BRAF WT HCL&#xD;
      and HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRAF WT HCL or HCLv with at least 1 prior purine analog treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Need for treatment as evidenced by any one of the following: ANC &lt;1 x10^3/mcL, Hgb&#xD;
           &lt;10g/dL, Platelet count &lt;100 x10^3/mcL, leukemia cell count &gt;5 x10^3/mcL, symptomatic&#xD;
           splenomegaly, enlarging HCL mass &gt; 2cm in short axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No uncontrolled infection, cardiopulmonary dysfunction, or secondary malignancy&#xD;
           requiring treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No chemotherapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent or radiotherapy within 4 weeks&#xD;
           prior to the start of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single arm phase 2 trial to determine ORR in patients with relapsed/refractory BRAF WT&#xD;
           HCL and HCLv.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2-phase minimax design will be used to rule out an unacceptable 10% in favor of an&#xD;
           improved 25% ORR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initially 16 evaluable patients will be enrolled. If 2 or more achieve a major response,&#xD;
           then accrual will continue to a total of 31 evaluable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binimetinib will be given at a dose of 45mg BID for as long as patients can continue&#xD;
           dosing chronically without significant toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of binimetinib on the developing human fetus are unknown therefore&#xD;
             participants must use effective methods of contraception as directed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) who are sexually active with a&#xD;
                  nonsterilized male partner must use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
                  and not donate ova prior to study entry and or the duration of study treatment&#xD;
                  and until 30 days after the last dose of binimetinib. Periodic abstinence, the&#xD;
                  rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception. Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not&#xD;
                  surgically sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
                  complete hysterectomy) or those who are premenarchal or postmenopausal (defined&#xD;
                  as 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause). A highly&#xD;
                  effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low failure&#xD;
                  rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Not all&#xD;
                  methods of contraception are highly effective. Female subjects must use a&#xD;
                  hormonal method in addition to a barrier method alone, to minimize the chance of&#xD;
                  pregnancy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
                  her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
                  physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-sterilized male participants who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
                  childbearing potential must agree to use methods of contraception that are highly&#xD;
                  effective or acceptable, and not donate sperm from study entry until 90 days&#xD;
                  after the last dose of binimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must co-enroll in study 10-C-0066: Collection of Human Samples to Study Hairy Cell and&#xD;
             other Leukemias, and to Develop Recombinant Immunotoxins for Cancer Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             the study treatment, starting with the screening visit . Pregnant women are excluded&#xD;
             from this study because binimetinib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient&#xD;
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with binimetinib, breastfeeding should be&#xD;
