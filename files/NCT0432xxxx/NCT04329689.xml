      Hypertrophic Obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is the most common genetic cardiomyopathy,&#xD;
      heterogeneous in phenotype and clinical course. The genotype-phenotype relationship and&#xD;
      associated molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood. In the HOCM milieu,&#xD;
      increased energy cost of force production, impairing performance and mitochondrial function,&#xD;
      may be associated to patients' genotype and/or phenotype (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a clinical entity was first described by Brock in 1957 (2).&#xD;
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people,&#xD;
      including competitive athletes (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristic pathologic features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are asymmetric&#xD;
      hypertrophy, especially of the interventricular septum myocardial fiber hypertrophy and&#xD;
      disorganisation of myocardial cells, abnormal thickened intramyocardial coronary vessels&#xD;
      (&quot;small vessel disease&quot;) and interstitial fibrosis (4). In the majority of patients&#xD;
      (approximately 90%), hypertrophy mainly involves the interventricular septum and&#xD;
      anterolateral wall. In a minority of patients myocardial hypertrophy is confined to the&#xD;
      apical part of the left ventricle (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial hypertrophy is not the only hallmark of hypertrophic Obsructive cardiomyopathy.&#xD;
      Klues et al. have described anatomic alterations in the mitral apparatus which may be present&#xD;
      in this disorder: an increase of the mitral valve area, increase in length of the anterior&#xD;
      leaflet, abnormal laxity and anterior displacement of the valve (5). Mitral valve (MV)&#xD;
      leaflets have an important role in the pathophysiological process of left ventricular (LV)&#xD;
      outflow tract obstruction in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM).&#xD;
      Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral apparatus and contact of the leaflets with the&#xD;
      hypertrophied septum narrow the LV outflow, leading to dynamic pressure gradients and in many&#xD;
      patients, mitral regurgitation (MR) (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, surgery is the gold standard treatment for most drug refractory and severely&#xD;
      symptomatic patients [New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV] with obstructive&#xD;
      HOCM [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Septal myectomy is the preferred treatment of most patients with HOCM, and many studies&#xD;
      have documented relief of symptoms and satisfactory late patient survival after relief of&#xD;
      outflow tract gradients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      valve repair or replacement may be necessary (7). However, adequate septal myectomy relieves&#xD;
      outflow tract gradients, SAM of the MV, and MR in many patients (6). Nevertheless, several&#xD;
      reports have described adjunctive techniques of mitral valvuloplasty aimed at eliminating SAM&#xD;
      of the MV (8,9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines support decisions to select surgery for patients with mitral structural&#xD;
      abnormalities. The 2011 American guidelines state: &quot;Additionally, specific abnormalities of&#xD;
      the mitral valve and its support apparatus can contribute significantly to the generation of&#xD;
      outflow tract obstruction, suggesting the potential value of additional surgical approaches&#xD;
      (e.g., plication, valvuloplasty, and papillary muscle relocation) and making myectomy more&#xD;
      appropriate than alcohol septal ablation in some patients&quot; (10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, An appreciation of mitral abnormalities in HCM has accumulated over the past 20&#xD;
      years (11). There has been a natural response by surgeons to this greater understanding of&#xD;
      the contribution of mitral pathology to SAM. At myectomy, they have tried to avoid leaving&#xD;
      unrepaired pathology by repairing the mitral valve (12).&#xD;
