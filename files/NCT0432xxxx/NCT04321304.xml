  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a painless,non-invasive means of increasing&#xD;
      brain excitability. It has been used for several years and in many populations to improve&#xD;
      physical and psychological outcomes. Although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of&#xD;
      stimulation intensities (e.g., 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently employed in most tDCS&#xD;
      research are â‰¤ 2 mA, which are sufficient to elicit measurable improvements; but, these&#xD;
      improvements might be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of&#xD;
      tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate approaches to&#xD;
      stimulation protocols were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher&#xD;
      intensities, i.e. up to 4 mA, has been performed in many populations and was found to have no&#xD;
      additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better&#xD;
      established, work exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e. 2 mA) and&#xD;
      higher (i.e. 4 mA) intensities is necessary to determine if increasing intensity increases&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the desired outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective participants will include 40 healthy young adults (all right-side dominant) that&#xD;
      will be recruited to complete four randomly ordered stimulation sessions (Baseline, 2 mA, 4&#xD;
      mA, and sham), separated by at least 5 days. Each session will involve one visit to the&#xD;
      Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one hour. We&#xD;
      expect data collection to last 6 months. The first session includes leg strength measurements&#xD;
      and fatigue tasks of both legs, as well as a baseline 6 min walk test (6MWT) to determine&#xD;
      fatigued walking characteristics. The following three sessions will include performing a&#xD;
      random tDCS condition (2 mA, 4 mA, or sham) over the brain area that controls the&#xD;
      participant's dominant leg for 15 minutes prior to and then throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      fatigue task of the dominant leg (16-20 min total stimulation time). The fatigue task for the&#xD;
      nondominant leg will be performed after a 10 minute energy recovery period. After the fatigue&#xD;
      task has been completed for both legs, the participants will perform the 6MWT.&#xD;
