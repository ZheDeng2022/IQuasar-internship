  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Determine the safety of up to 3 dose levels of a study drug called PEP in patients who have&#xD;
      had a recent (within the last 12 hours) heart attack.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) who undergo percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) at least 4 hours (but no more than 12 hours) after onset of heart attack&#xD;
      symptoms will be treated with a single dose of PEP within 20 minutes after stent placement or&#xD;
      post-dilation (whichever is last). Subjects will be screened at the time of emergency room&#xD;
      presentation. From the emergency room, subjects will proceed to the cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      laboratory where the PCI will be completed and PEP will be administered. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed for one year after PEP administration through clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event there are patients enrolled with unknown COVID-19 status or previously negative&#xD;
      COVID-19 status and subsequently found to be positive by SARS-Cov-2 PCR testing at visit 1,&#xD;
      visit 4, visit 6, or any unscheduled visit within the first 14 days after receiving the study&#xD;
      drug, then those patients will be excluded from the primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
