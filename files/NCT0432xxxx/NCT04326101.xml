  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with heart failure (HF) need multiple guideline-directed medications to control the&#xD;
      systolic and/or diastolic ventricular dysfunction. Laboratory measure the biomarker NT-proBNP&#xD;
      (N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide) to support clinical decision and to guide&#xD;
      treatment at every stage of HF. Many patients (including HF patients) do not follow&#xD;
      therapeutic recommendations. Electronic monitoring of medication intake gives precise&#xD;
      information over time and is the gold standard to unveil inappropriate behaviour. Electronic&#xD;
      Health Records (EHR) are repository of patient health data in digital format and are mostly&#xD;
      locally configured in medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to transmit laboratory results of NT-proBNP and estimates of medication adherence into&#xD;
      the EHR system of primary care providers, with the objective to guide treatment and dose&#xD;
      adjustment of multiple medications in patients with HF. Our project is *not* to develop a&#xD;
      telemonitoring system.&#xD;

      Patients with heart failure (HF) need multiple guideline-directed medications to control the&#xD;
      systolic and/or diastolic ventricular dysfunction. To support clinical decision and to guide&#xD;
      treatment at every stage of HF, the measurement of the biomarker NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B&#xD;
      type natriuretic peptide) has been recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients (including HF patients) do not follow therapeutic recommendations.&#xD;
      Non-adherence to treatment can lead to acute decompensation that often requires urgent&#xD;
      hospitalisation. Electronic monitoring of medication intake gives precise information over&#xD;
      time and is the gold standard to unveil inappropriate behaviour. We developed Time4MedTM, a&#xD;
      small device that records date and time of medication intake. The recorded electronic data&#xD;
      are visualized in a scatter diagram and several adherence estimates can be calculated such as&#xD;
      days with missed doses, taking adherence or timing adherence. Electronic Health Records (EHR)&#xD;
      are repository of patient health data in digital format and are mostly locally configured in&#xD;
      medical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to transmit laboratory results of NT-proBNP and estimates of medication adherence into&#xD;
      the EHR system of primary care providers, with the objective to guide treatment and dose&#xD;
      adjustment of multiple medications in patients with HF. Our project is *not* to develop a&#xD;
      telemonitoring system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, observational, feasibility study one medical practice in Basel-Stadt,&#xD;
      one dedicated laboratory, and one community pharmacy as study centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians will order NT-proBNP measurement and electronic adherence monitoring to patients&#xD;
      with diagnosis New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage II-III, who are under&#xD;
      guidelines-recommended multiple medications and whose clinical and/or biomedical targeted&#xD;
      values are unmet (inadequate control). Laboratory and adherence reports will be generated in&#xD;
      similar encrypted format and transferred via secured platform into physician's EHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to show that electronic adherence reports can be gathered and electronically&#xD;
      transferred by pharmacists into medical EHR in the same way as laboratory reports. The joint&#xD;
      availability of medication adherence estimates and laboratory values in the EHR can guide&#xD;
      physicians in the management and therapy of patients with HF.&#xD;
