  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This qualitative longitudinal study is designed to elicit and thematically analyze the&#xD;
      perspectives of SIMPLIFY subjects about treatment withdrawal research and treatment burden in&#xD;
      the context of triple combination CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)&#xD;
      modulator therapy (TCT). Cohorts will be determined based on sub-groups of the assigned&#xD;
      treatment arms from the SIMPLIFY study. Participants will be asked to participate in two&#xD;
      interviews; the first interview will be conducted at the completion of the SIMPLIFY study and&#xD;
      the second interview will be conducted approximately 4 months after the first interview.&#xD;
      Trained research staff will conduct the semi-structured interviews that will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. Each interview should last between&#xD;
      30-60 minutes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommended daily treatment regimen for CF is complex and results in high treatment&#xD;
      burden for many people with CF (PwCF). Newly developed triple combination CFTR modulator&#xD;
      therapy (TCT) has shown dramatic health benefits on top of standard CF therapies in a pivotal&#xD;
      clinical trial and will soon be a treatment option for a larger population of PwCF.&#xD;
      Widespread implementation of TCT will provide an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously&#xD;
      study whether PwCF can safely discontinue some previously prescribed daily therapies. The&#xD;
      randomized, open-label SIMPLIFY study has been designed to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      withdrawal of dornase alpha and/or nebulized hypertonic saline (HS) is not inferior to&#xD;
      continuation of one or both treatments with respect to short-term change in lung function. As&#xD;
      this is the first of its kind study design in CF, it unknown how people with CF thinking&#xD;
      about withdrawal studies or discontinuing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators intend to conduct a qualitative interview study that complements the&#xD;
      SIMPLIFY protocol in which the investigators aim to assess the experiences of PwCF&#xD;
      participating in a treatment withdrawal study. In particular, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      post-hoc the beliefs and opinions of a representative subgroup of SIMPLIFY participants about&#xD;
      treatment withdrawal research and perceived treatment burden. This qualitative study will&#xD;
      provide the opportunity to learn about behaviors after the SIMPLIFY trial, including&#xD;
      restarting vs. continuing to maintain medications, withdrawing other medications or&#xD;
      therapies, and how patients and families partner with care teams around these decisions.&#xD;
      Through these interviews, the investigators will learn how individuals with CF perceive&#xD;
      taking part in a drug withdrawal study and how participants discern treatment assignment.&#xD;
