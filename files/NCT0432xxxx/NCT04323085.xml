  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypophonia, or reduced speech intensity, is the most prevalent speech symptom in Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) and often leads to significant difficulty communicating in most social&#xD;
      situations. Behavioural treatments for hypophonia can be temporarily effective but many&#xD;
      individuals fail to retain and transfer improvements beyond the context of the speech clinic.&#xD;
      The present study will address the transfer of treatment problem using two new treatment&#xD;
      programs. Both treatments focus on improving speech intensity during conversations in&#xD;
      different social contexts and a wide range of background noise conditions. The&#xD;
      Speech-in-Noise (SIN) treatment program involves training higher speech intensity during&#xD;
      variable levels of background noise while receiving real-time intensity feedback from a&#xD;
      speech therapist. The second treatment, the Speech-to-Noise Feedback (SNF) device treatment&#xD;
      program, involves using a wearable SNF device to provide feedback about an ideal target&#xD;
      speech-to-noise level in a wide range of background noise conditions. Forty individuals with&#xD;
      PD and their communication partners (i.e. spouse) will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment programs. To evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments, a wearable recording&#xD;
      device will measure daily conversational speech intensity and background noise for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days before, 1 week after, and 12 weeks after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and is associated&#xD;
      with several disabling motor and non-motor symptoms. About 70% of individuals with PD will&#xD;
      develop speech impairments. Hypophonia, or reduced speech intensity, is the most prevalent&#xD;
      speech symptom and often leads to significant difficulty communicating in most social&#xD;
      situations. Behavioural treatments for hypophonia can be temporarily effective but many&#xD;
      individuals fail to retain and transfer improvements beyond the context of the speech clinic.&#xD;
      These transfer difficulties may be related to cognitive and sensorimotor deficits associated&#xD;
      with PD that inhibit the incorporation of new speech strategies into habitual speech. This&#xD;
      transfer of treatment problem is a longstanding and major concern in the treatment of speech&#xD;
      in PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will address the transfer of treatment problem using two new treatment&#xD;
      programs. Both treatments focus on improving speech intensity during conversations in&#xD;
      different social contexts and a wide range of background noise conditions. The&#xD;
      Speech-in-Noise (SIN) treatment program involves training higher speech intensity during&#xD;
      variable levels of background noise while receiving real-time intensity feedback from a&#xD;
      speech therapist in social situations inside and outside of the clinic. The second treatment,&#xD;
      the Speech-to-Noise Feedback (SNF) device treatment program, involves using a wearable SNF&#xD;
      device to provide feedback about an ideal target speech-to-noise level in a wide range of&#xD;
      background noise conditions inside and outside of the speech clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty individuals with PD and their communication partners (i.e. spouse) will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two treatment programs. In addition, half of the participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to a 13-week delayed treatment group and serve as both untreated controls&#xD;
      and treated participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the treatments, measures of improvement in speech intensity&#xD;
      and speech-to-noise levels will be obtained during everyday social conversations. A wearable&#xD;
      recording device will measure daily conversational speech intensity and background noise for&#xD;
      7 consecutive days at three time points: before, 1 week after, and 12 weeks after treatment.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of treatment will be also measured using two questionnaires and standard,&#xD;
      lab-based speech assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the evaluation and comparison of these two novel treatment paradigms&#xD;
      will advance our understanding of procedures that are most effective for enhancing the&#xD;
      transfer of treatment for hypophonia into everyday social conversations in individuals with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
