      Background: No criteria define indications for laparoscopic splenectomy in trauma. This&#xD;
      investigation compared characteristics of trauma patients and outcomes between laparoscopic&#xD;
      and open splenectomie Methods: Included patients were 15 or older, with a blunt splenic&#xD;
      injury from January, 2012 to July 2017, and required splenectomy. Variables included&#xD;
      demographics, splenic injury grade, approach (open or laparoscopic), duration of operation,&#xD;
      intra-operative blood loss, transfusions, length of hospital stay, complications and&#xD;
      mortality..&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spleen is liable to injury in trauma to the left lower chest or left upper abdomen. Other&#xD;
      possible injuries that may be occur together with splenic injuries are injuries to the rib&#xD;
      cage, diaphragm, pancreas, and bowel. Hemodynamic instability, a rising pulse rate and low&#xD;
      blood pressure, are reliable signs of an injury but a high index of suspicion based on the&#xD;
      mechanism of injury is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past 2 decades, in the developed world, computed tomography scanning has become the&#xD;
      gold standard for imaging in hemodynamically stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma&#xD;
      especially now that computed tomography scanners are in close vicinity to resuscitation areas&#xD;
      in accident and emergency departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic total splenectomies in trauma patients were initially described as case reports&#xD;
      in 1995 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons'guidelines on laparoscopy&#xD;
      for trauma stated that diagnostic laparoscopy is accept for patients who are haemodynamically&#xD;
      stable,and without evidence of another injury requiring laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring surgery for splenic injury are hemodynamically unstable and/or actively&#xD;
      bleeding, which prohibits the use of laparoscopy because of time and visualization&#xD;
      constraints Advantages of laparoscopic approach are • Less postoperative pain ,Shorter&#xD;
      hospital stay Faster return to a regular, solid food diet Quicker return to normal activities&#xD;
      Better cosmetic results Laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity excluded any&#xD;
      bleeding injuries of the liver or other viscera, confirmed the splenic rupture, and permitted&#xD;
      grading of the lesions for planning of the appropriate treatment.The incidence of missed&#xD;
      injury in laparoscopy for trauma is extremely variable, ranging from 41% to 77%. Part of this&#xD;
      wide variation may be explained by the fact that trauma surgeons typically perform fewer&#xD;
      laparoscopic procedures Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study in 2015, comparing 23 laparoscopic splenectomies and 19 open splenectomies for grade&#xD;
      III lacerations. The results showed longer operating times in the laparoscopic group, but no&#xD;
      difference in complications or mortality, which is similar to the current investigation. A&#xD;
      study with a smaller sample reviewed 11 hemodynamically stable, emergent laparoscopic&#xD;
      splenectomies in grade III injuries The results demonstrated low morbidity and no deaths,&#xD;
      suggesting that, in this population, laparoscopic splenectomy may be a safe alternative&#xD;
      compared with open laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evolving in the role of laparoscopy in splenic trauma management in the last years.&#xD;
      Some of those changes have been related to new technology (harmonic scalpel). A study offered&#xD;
      the advantage of using harmonic scalpel as effective hemostatic cutting where Dissection of&#xD;
      injured viscera and attachments is often hindered by infiltration by hematomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic splenectomy offers many well-documented advantages over open procedures like&#xD;
      decreased postoperative pain, decreased postoperative ICU admission time, and earlier return&#xD;
      to normal daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inspection of the abdominal cavity and solid viscera is relatively easy to perform, complete&#xD;
      examination of the intestine presents a greater challenge, with a 9% to 18% missed injury&#xD;
      rate per patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spleen is delivered by use of commercially puncture resistant bag. The bag is delivered&#xD;
      out through one of the port and the spleen is morcellated before removal. The cost of the bag&#xD;
      prevented us from its routine use. When this endobag is not available,spleen is removed&#xD;
      through 5-8 cm pfannesteinl incision.in our study, the spleen is removed in endobag in all&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
