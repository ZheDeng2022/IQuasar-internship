      This is a multiple oral dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will be conducted in 2 cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2). Cohort transition&#xD;
      will be determined by the Safety Review Team (SRT) before the start of Cohort 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each cohort, the target number of subjects completing the treatment period is defined as&#xD;
      8 for SEP-363856 group and 4 for placebo group. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      group. Dosing of the SEP-363856 group in Cohort 1 will be initiated at 50 mg SEP-363856 as an&#xD;
      oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 75 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once&#xD;
      daily dose for 4 consecutive days, and followed by 100 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once daily&#xD;
      dose for 7 consecutive days. The SEP-363856 group in Cohort 2 will be dosed at 25 mg&#xD;
      SEP-363856 as an oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 50 mg SEP-363856 as&#xD;
      an oral once daily dose for 3 consecutive days, followed by 75 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once&#xD;
      daily dose for 4 consecutive days, and followed by 100 mg SEP-363856 as an oral once daily&#xD;
      dose for 7 consecutive days. In the placebo group, placebo will be orally administered&#xD;
      according to the same administration schedule as the SEP-363856 group in each cohort.&#xD;
