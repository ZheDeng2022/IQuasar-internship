  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic ankle instability is associated with changes in the nervous system that amount to&#xD;
      increased difficulty in activating the stabilizing muscles of the ankle. Neuromuscular&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation involves using electricity to activate those muscles in bursts, and is&#xD;
      commonly used to improve muscle function in those with ACL injury. This study will provide 5&#xD;
      treatments over 2 weeks in patients with Chronic Ankle Instability and determine if&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation can change neural excitability, balance, neuromuscular control, and&#xD;
      perceived function in these individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with joint injuries, including ankle sprain and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)&#xD;
      injury have been observed to exhibit changes in central nervous system function that&#xD;
      potentially predispose them for further injury (Needle et al. 2017). In ankle sprains,&#xD;
      repeated sensations of rolling and giving-way known as chronic ankle instability (CAI)&#xD;
      emerges in nearly 50 percent of those with a history of ankle sprain (Holland et al. 2019),&#xD;
      with symptoms tied to changes in central nervous system function. As the understanding of&#xD;
      these pathologies have expanded, researchers have begun to attempt to identify&#xD;
      neuromodulatory interventions capable of addressing injury-induced maladaptive&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, thus improving function (Bruce et al. 2020, In Press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among those with ACL injury, one of the most common interventions implemented to overcome&#xD;
      muscle activation deficits includes neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) (Lepley et&#xD;
      al. 2015). This intervention is often used in the initial stages of post-surgical recovery to&#xD;
      improve quadriceps function; however, it's use in other populations of joint injury (i.e.&#xD;
      ankle sprain) is far more limited. Some previous research has looked at the effects of NMES&#xD;
      on acute ankle sprains, as this is the timeframe in which muscle activation deficits would be&#xD;
      most evident (Wainwright et al. 2019), but there is very limited evidence in those with CAI.&#xD;
      It was potentially thought that activation deficits are less evident and strengthening may&#xD;
      overcome these deficits in those with chronic injury; however, new insights have identified&#xD;
      additional mechanisms by which NMES may be effective (Lepley et al. 2015). Aside from&#xD;
      generating activation of a generally inactive muscle, NMES when performed at high intensities&#xD;
      has been described to improve neuromuscular function through disinhibitory mechanisms. That&#xD;
      is that increased somatosensation from the electrical stimulation raises the central nervous&#xD;
      sytem's awareness of that muscle's activation, yielding decreased inhibition and ultimately&#xD;
      increased neural excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our previous research using cortically-directed interventions demonstrated that improving&#xD;
      neural excitability yielded better function in patients with chronic ankle instability (Bruce&#xD;
      et al. 2020). This study will follow a similar framework; however, determining if these&#xD;
      changes can be induced via a peripheral intervention. These findings have the ability to&#xD;
      reframe the current treatment for CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are pursuing the following 2 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if NMES changes neural excitability (MEP size, H:M ratio, silent period)&#xD;
           compared to a placebo treatment in participants with chronic ankle instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
           H1: NMES will increase MEP size, H:M ratio, and decrease cortical silent period in&#xD;
           individuals with CAI compared to the placebo treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if changes in neural excitability related to NMES or placebo treatment&#xD;
           result in improved function (balance, muscle activation, outcomes) in participants with&#xD;
           chronic ankle instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Increased neural excitability will yield improved balance (postural stability indices),&#xD;
      muscle activation, and patient-reported function.&#xD;

        of one or more ankle sprains (the first &gt;1 year ago), and repeated sensations of giving-way&#xD;
        as measured by a score &gt;10 on the Identification of Functional Ankle Instability instrument&#xD;
        (IDFAI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of fracture or surgery to the legs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Injury to the lower legs within 3 months prior to reporting for testing that resulted&#xD;
             in modified physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently involved in an ankle rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failing to meet standards for the safe practice of transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
             and transcranial direct current stimulation (See questionnaire). Briefly, this&#xD;
             includes personal or family history of seizure or epilepsy; current medication use&#xD;
             that raises risk of seizure; implanted metal, medication devices, etc.; history of&#xD;
