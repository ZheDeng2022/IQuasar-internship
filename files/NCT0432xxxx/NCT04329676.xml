  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain clinical outcome data on safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      the directSTIM DBS system when used on-label, according to the instructions for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo bilateral implant in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and data&#xD;
      collected in common practice will be recorded during six months post-implant and analyzed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      directSTIM DBS Therapy for Movement Disorders is indicated for patients with disabling tremor&#xD;
      or symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects selected to participate in the study will be Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients who&#xD;
      are eligible for bilateral DBS for STN therapy and meet the inclusion criteria and none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary safety and effectiveness endpoints data will be collected through 6 months of&#xD;
      follow-up. The values used for comparison are derived from a review of literature spanning&#xD;
      from 2001 to 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the 6 month follow-up, subject will exit the study, and continue to be&#xD;
      followed by their physician per usual care.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in UPDRS III score without medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months compared to baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Part 3 of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III), is a series of questions evaluated by the clinician in presence of the patient, focusing on motor symptoms of PD.&#xD;
Score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 108. This score is evaluated at baseline and 6 months post-implant without any anti-Parkinson medication taken.&#xD;
A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement. The average difference of scores between the two time points is calculated for the whole study subject population.&#xD;
This value is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Materiovigilance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Summary statistics on the occurrence of the following categories of adverse events (AEs):&#xD;
Device-related AEs&#xD;
Procedure-related AEs&#xD;
Stimulation-related AEs</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Therapeutic Window (TW)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The therapeutic window is the difference of electrical current values between the stimulation settings that provide maximum alleviation of motor symptoms and the settings for which the first stimulation-induced side effect appears (e.g., eye deviation, muscle contraction, speech impairment).&#xD;
The wider this window, the more flexibility is offered to the patient for stimulation without causing side-effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PDQ-39 score without medication.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39, a patient-filled questionnaire focusing on quality of life, is completed by study subjects at baseline and 6 months post-implant.&#xD;
Score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 100. A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement.&#xD;
The average difference of scores between the two time points is calculated for the whole study subject population.&#xD;
This value is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>UPDRS</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Other parts (I, II and IV) of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale are evaluated at baseline and 6 months post-implant.&#xD;
Part I is a series of 4 questions assessing Mentation, Behavior and Mood. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 16.&#xD;
Part II is a series of 13 questions assessing Quality of Life in daily activities. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 52.&#xD;
Part IV is a series of 10 questions assessing Complications of Therapy. Patient's score is expressed on a scale of 0 to 23.&#xD;
A decrease at 6 months compared to baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dopaminergic medication</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) is expressed as Levodopa equivalent mg/day and measured through the whole study duration.&#xD;
Evolution of this value is followed and the difference between baseline and 6 months post-implant timepoints is to be compared to the results of a meta-analysis performed on data extracted during a literature search.</description>
