    <textblock>
      The investigators study the behavioral consequences of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis or PrEP on&#xD;
      sexual health behaviors, sexual health outcomes, and partner selection preferences. The study&#xD;
      collects observational, self-reported data on PrEP status, PrEP taking-history, PrEP&#xD;
      adherence over the last 30 days, STD diagnosis history dating back to January 2015 up to&#xD;
      December 2019, sexual health behaviors (e.g., positioning, number of lifetime/recent&#xD;
      partners, condom adherence etc.), and various demographic characteristics. The survey&#xD;
      finishes with a conjoint experiment which asks respondents to select between two potential&#xD;
      partners, and follow-up question about each profiles. Potential partners' characteristics&#xD;
      include recreational drug use and condom adherence. Recruitment is conducted via running an&#xD;
      ad on Facebook in New York, London, Toronto and Sydney for comparative purposes, as these&#xD;
      metro areas have varying levels of PrEP use and accessibility.&#xD;

    <description>On PrEP status will be operationalized in multiple ways, and sensitivity analyses will be conducted using multiple definitions as a result of the self-reported nature of the study.&#xD;
Respondents &quot;on PrEP&quot; are respondents who reported that they are currently on PrEP&#xD;
Respondents &quot;on PrEP&quot; are respondents who reported to have ever been on PrEP&#xD;
When respondents are used as their own controls, years on PrEP will be those in which they reported to have been on PrEP for at lest 6 months, and PrEP initiation will be the first such year&#xD;
A comparison group will be constructed by matching on a variety of characteristics, when this method is applied. Most importantly, age, and STD testing frequency among others, which influence the likelihood of being on PrEP and via that avenue sexual practices, as well as the likelihood of detecting STDs (i.e., ascertainment bias). In other models adjustments will be made for these factors.</description>

        The survey is being distributed via Facebook ads, which are geographically targeted in the&#xD;
        above-mentioned metro areas, with filters set up to target specifically males who are&#xD;
        likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM). This latter is achieved by setting up a long&#xD;
        list of sites that have been liked or followed, which map onto sexual orientation. The&#xD;
        survey is incentivized with an Amazon gift card to be given to a randomly selected&#xD;
        participant in each of the geographic areas after completion. Those who click on the ad are&#xD;
        directed to the survey. They first receive questions that gauges their eligibility, and in&#xD;
        case they are not eligible, they are screened out of the survey, and are not eligible to&#xD;
        enroll in the raffle for the gift card, which is only available for those who finished the&#xD;
        sutdy.&#xD;
