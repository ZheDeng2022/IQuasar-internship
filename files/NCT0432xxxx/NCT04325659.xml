  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bridge Device (BD) is a neuromodulator medical device that has been cleared by the FDA&#xD;
      for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) treatment. Importantly, medical devices reviewed by the FDA are&#xD;
      cleared (based on safety) rather than approved (based on efficacy), which means the BD did&#xD;
      not need to demonstrate efficacy before it became commercially available. As a result, the&#xD;
      device was not required to have a sham-controlled trial for FDA clearance and there is no&#xD;
      active research, to the investigators' knowledge, that specifically addresses the degree to&#xD;
      which opioid withdrawal can be treated through neuromodulation. To rigorously evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the BD for treating OUD, the investigators will enroll persons with active OUD,&#xD;
      not currently receiving medications for OUD. Participants will be recruited and admitted to&#xD;
      the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for a 2-3 week period. During participants' residential&#xD;
      stay, participants will be stabilized for 7-11 days on four times daily morphine (30 mg, SC)&#xD;
      and undergo a precipitated withdrawal challenge using the opioid antagonist naloxone,&#xD;
      approximately &gt;= 4 days of morphine maintenance. This is a standard practice for the&#xD;
      investigators' study and allows the investigators to objectively assess dependence. The BD&#xD;
      and study medication will begin following morphine stabilization. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three conditions (1) active BD with placebo (BD/P), (2) sham BD&#xD;
      with lofexidine (SBD/L), or (3) sham BD and placebo (SBD/P). Participants will use the BD for&#xD;
      5 days and will receive study drug for 7 days. Participants will be monitored for an&#xD;
      additional 4 days after device removal to determine whether withdrawal resumes. Participants&#xD;
      will undergo a second naloxone challenge after removal of the device/capsule completion to&#xD;
      verify lack of opioid tolerance and will be encouraged to begin treatment with oral&#xD;
      naltrexone followed by extended release naltrexone. Throughout the residential stay, all&#xD;
      participants will be given referral to and assisted with engaging in outpatient treatment&#xD;
      following study discharge.&#xD;
