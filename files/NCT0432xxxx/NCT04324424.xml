  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label and paralleled study with single oral dose of HMS5552 given to renal&#xD;
      impaired subjects and body index matched healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to access the pharmacokinetic profiles of HMS5552 in 25 mg dose in&#xD;
      renal impaired subjects and (gender, age and BMI) matched healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to characterize the safety profiles of HMS5552 in single dose in&#xD;
      renal impaired subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects include ESRD subjects without dialysis (P1 group), severe (P2 group), moderate&#xD;
      (P3 group), mild (P4 group), and healthy subjects (H Group) matched with renal impairment&#xD;
      subjects in gender, age and BMI. The number of subjects in each group was 6-8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: ESRD subjects without dialysis and matched healthy subjects (P1 and H groups; n&#xD;
           = 8 for each group);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: subjects with severe, moderate and mild renal impairment (P2, P3 and P4 groups;&#xD;
           n = 6-8 in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study initiates from Part 1. The data will be evaluated at the end of Part 1 as the&#xD;
      medium term. Compared with the matched healthy subjects, if the mean AUC of HMS5552 (either&#xD;
      AUClast or AUCinf) increased by ≥ 100% in ESRD subjects without dialysis, which means Part 2&#xD;
      will need to be conducted. The process of Part 2 is the same as that of Part 1&#xD;
