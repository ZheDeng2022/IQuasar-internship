  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the available molecular and cellular evidence of impaired wound healing due to&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, investigators postulate hypothesis asking whether intensive glycemic control&#xD;
      could improve diabetic foot ulcer healing rates. A study showed improvement in phagocytic&#xD;
      activity of macrophages after 5 days of intensive glycemic improvement in 21 patients of&#xD;
      diabetes. Another retrospective cohort study studied the effect on HbA1c as predictor of&#xD;
      healing rate in DFU. Latter found significant association of HbA1c with wound area healing&#xD;
      rate. However a recent systematic review failed to find any randomized control trial&#xD;
      comparing the effect of intensive versus conventional glycemic control for treating DFU.&#xD;
      Hence, investigators want to explore the hypothesis by conducting a randomized control trial&#xD;
      with the primary aim of wound healing in patients of diabetic foot ulcer in response to&#xD;
      intensive glycemic control in comparison to conventional glycemic management.&#xD;

      BURDEN OF DIABETIC FOOT According to International Diabetic Federation, there will be over&#xD;
      642 million people with diabetes in the world by 2040.Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) is one of the&#xD;
      most serious, most costly and at times life threatening complication of diabetes. The&#xD;
      lifetime incidence of foot ulcer occurrence in diabetes is up to 25%. Both prevalence and&#xD;
      incidence of DFU is higher in developing countries due to multitude of factors like poverty,&#xD;
      poor sanitation &amp; hygiene, barefoot walking, lack of education, poor healthcare access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DFU related morbidity and hospitalization has shown a meteoric rise. One study showed that&#xD;
      20% of admissions in patients of diabetes were due to DFU. 56%of ulcers become infected and 1&#xD;
      in 5 of these will requiresome level of amputation.In addition, it has been projected that&#xD;
      15% of diabetic foot ulcers result in lowerextremity amputations and 85% of diabetic&#xD;
      patientswho undergo lower extremity amputations had an ulcerprior to amputation.The 5-year&#xD;
      relative mortality afterdiabetic foot ulcer is 48%, second only to lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple risk factors have been attributed to the development of DFU including male gender,&#xD;
      duration of diabetes &gt;10 years, older age, diminished vision, peripheral vascular disease,&#xD;
      high BMI, sensory neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, HbA1c, foot deformity, high plantar&#xD;
      pressures, poor foot care habits, barefoot walking etc. From DCCT there exists robust&#xD;
      evidence that strict glycemic control can decrease all diabetic related complications. There&#xD;
      are other studies demonstrating improvements in neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease as&#xD;
      a result of strict glycemic control. However, there is no specific evidence/intervention for&#xD;
      DFU prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPAIRED WOUND HEALING IN DIABETES Wound healing is impaired in diabetes at multiple stages.&#xD;
      The defects are observed at both cellular and molecular levels. Extrinsic factors like&#xD;
      mechanical stress, trauma and ischemia negatively influence the healing process.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia itself has been shown to have deleterious effect on wound healing through&#xD;
      formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) &amp; reactive oxygen species (ROS) which&#xD;
      induce the production of inﬂammatory molecules (TNF-α, IL-1) and interfere with collagen&#xD;
      synthesis. There is interference in collagen synthesis due to increased expression of matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHALLENGES WITH RESEARCH IN THIS AREA With the clinical benchmarks set by major trials like&#xD;
      UKPDS, it is often difficult for clinicians to ethically conduct any study investigating the&#xD;
      effects of intensive versus conventional glycemic control. Even on demonstrating the clinical&#xD;
      benefit involving intensive glycemic control, it is a difficult task to recruit as well as&#xD;
      follow up subjects. Many diabetic patients are frail and have multiple co-morbidities that&#xD;
      render them incapable of following such interventions. Intensive glycemic control makes these&#xD;
      individuals prone to the detrimental effects of hypoglycemia. In a trial investigating the&#xD;
      effect of hyperglycemia and intensive glycemic control on DFU healing, the authors faced many&#xD;
      challenges in recruiting and allocating the patients. This trial was completed without any&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is marked variation in the definition of intensive glycemic control between guidelines&#xD;
      and trials.Most of the current glycemic targets for diabetes are based onseveral pioneering&#xD;
      trials that investigated the effects of intensiveglycemic control compared to conventional&#xD;
      treatments. Importantly, the beneficial effects on microvascular complicationsfrom using&#xD;
      intensive glycemic control took more than five yearsto emerge, and the benefits were less&#xD;
      pronounced for people withadvanced type 2 diabetes compared to those with new-onset type2&#xD;
      diabetes. Nevertheless, diabetic foot ulcer specific outcomes were not studied or neglected&#xD;
      in these trials. Hence, the onus is on new investigators to study the outcomes in DFU through&#xD;
      the prism of intensive glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many trials investigating intensive versus conventional glycemic control,lower limb&#xD;
      amputation was an outcome measure. This outcome was not reported in relation to presentation&#xD;
      with, development of, or healing of foot ulceration. Amputation was due to the ease of&#xD;
      measurement and definitive nature of such a practical end-point. However, there are&#xD;
      inconsistencies in the true estimation of amputation as an outcome. The UKPDS defined&#xD;
      amputation as a major limbcomplication requiring lower limb amputation of a digit or anylimb&#xD;
      for any reason and included digital amputations which areusually classified as minor&#xD;
      amputations. A Cochrane review concluded that intensive glucose control reduced the risk of&#xD;
      amputation by 36% in type 2 diabetes (RR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.95; 6960 participants&#xD;
      ineight trials). However, this information was based on amputations defined in several ways&#xD;
      (including both minor and major amputations). Although this data provides evidence to endorse&#xD;
      the efficacy of intensive glycemic control in preventing amputations, its exact correlation&#xD;
      to foot ulcer healing remains unanswered.It is a known fact that foot ulceration often&#xD;
      precedes amputation, therefore, ulcer specific measures like time to ulcer healing, percent&#xD;
      reduction in ulcer area, need to be measured as an outcome. From a patient and HRQoL point of&#xD;
      view, foot ulcer healing can be seen as a beneficial outcome over a damaging endpoint like&#xD;
      amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a meta-analysis of the six control arms ofwound-healing trials in patients with a&#xD;
      neuropathic ulcer, 24% of the ulcers were healed at 12 weeks and only 31%at 20 weeks. But&#xD;
      these data were likely influenced by selection bias, as the elderly patient with multiple&#xD;
      co-morbidities is usually excluded from such trials, follow-up was short and treatment was&#xD;
      suboptimal and non- EVIDENCE OFNEED FOR INTENSIVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN DFU Various studies&#xD;
      highlighting the importance of hyperglycemia and glycemic control in diabetic foot ulcer&#xD;
      healing are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multi-center study, poor glycemic (blood glucose) control was evident in nearly half of&#xD;
      the participants who had foot ulcers, with 49% having an HbA1c (glycemic measure) level above&#xD;
      8.4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a retrospective cohort study of 183 diabetic patients conducted at the John Hopkins Wound&#xD;
      Center, it was seen that HbA1c was an important clinical predictor of the rate of wound&#xD;
      healing. The mean HbA1c was 8.0%. For each 1%-point increase in HbA1c level,the daily wound&#xD;
      healing ratedecreased by 0.028 cm² per day (95% CI: 0.003 to 0.054). This was irrespective of&#xD;
      presence of neuropathy (n=109), smoking status (n=121) and peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      (n=53). The study didn't throw any light on anti-diabetic treatment received by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another retrospective study of 63 diabetic patients conducted at a Midwestern outpatient&#xD;
      wound care clinic in USA for 3 years, it was seen that the HbA1c values closest to ulcer&#xD;
      closure ranged from 5.3 to12.3 (mean, 7.68 [SD, 1.81]). It was also found that patients with&#xD;
      higher HbA1c levels did experience wound healing, but in a significantlylonger period than&#xD;
      those with lower HbA1c. Approximately 80% of this sample (n = 50)had peripheral vascular&#xD;
      disease, and more than 60% (n = 39) hadrenal disease. Here also the investigators didn't&#xD;
      mention the anti-diabetic treatment being received by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Indian prospective study (over 2 years) has explored the concept of HbA1c as a predictor&#xD;
      of healing rate in diabetic ulcers. 100 diabetic patients were equally divided into 2 groups&#xD;
      with mean HbA1c levels of 6.50 ± 0.441 in Group A and Group B with the mean value of 10.40 ±&#xD;
      1.550. Subsequently, standard treatment protocols were followed, and mean reduction in ulcer&#xD;
      area, length, and width were measured; a statistically significant difference was found in&#xD;
      the mean area change per day between the two groups with P&lt;0.0001. However, the study did not&#xD;
      explore the effect of intensive glycemic treatment in the uncontrolled diabetic subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators in Barcelona, Spain addressed the issue of impairment in phagocytic activity in&#xD;
      relation to glycemic control and, whether or not this impairment could be reversible after&#xD;
      improving blood glucose levels. In their case control study, 21 type 2 DM and 21 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers were prospectively recruited. Baseline HbA1c was 8.78 ± 2.01 in T2DM patients&#xD;
      whereas it was 5.79 ± 0.45 in healthy volunteers. Baseline FBG was 9.49 ± 3.15 in T2DM&#xD;
      patients whereas it was 5.73 ± 0.83 in healthy volunteers. By use of flow cytometry they were&#xD;
      able to deduce that Type 2 diabetic patients showed a lower percentage of activated&#xD;
      macrophages in comparison with non-diabetic subjects (54.00618.93 vs 68.53612.77%; p =&#xD;
      0.006). Also,significant negative correlations between phagocytic activity and fastingglucose&#xD;
      (r = 20.619, p = 0.004) and HbA1c (r = 20.506, p = 0.019) were detected. In their&#xD;
      intervention study 12 previous T2DM patients were admitted and treated intensively (9-point&#xD;
      blood glucose profile) for 5 days. In these patients who underwent metabolic optimization, a&#xD;
      significant increase in phagocytic activitywas observed (p = 0.029). The investigators&#xD;
      postulated that the reversibility of phagocytosis dysfunction after a short period of&#xD;
      glycemic control may have been attributable not only to the normalization of the diabetic&#xD;
      milieu but also to the effect of exogenous insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another prospective study conducted in Oregon, USA investigated whether different diabetic&#xD;
      treatment regimens affect diabetic foot ulcer healing. In this study 85 patients were&#xD;
      followed up for a period of 2 years. Insulin treatment was apart of diabetes management in 52&#xD;
      (61.2%) cases. Insulin therapy significantly increased thewound healing rate (30.3% [20/66&#xD;
      ulcers] vs. 9.8% [4/41 ulcers]) (p=0.013). In multivariaterandom-effect logistic regression&#xD;
      model, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, type of diabetes, hypertension, chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, oral hypoglycemic use, wound infection, involved&#xD;
      side, presence of Charcot's deformity, gangrene, osteomyelitis on x-ray, and serum hemoglobin&#xD;
      A1C levels, insulin treatment was associated with a higher chance of complete healing&#xD;
      (beta±SE: 15.2±6.1, P=0.013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Cochrane systematic review aimed to assess the effects of intensive glycemic control&#xD;
      compared to conventional control on the treatment of foot ulcers in people with type 1 and&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes. The authors searched for evidence in both published and unpublished&#xD;
      material. They were unable to find any clinical trials which had successfully investigated&#xD;
      the impact of intensive versus conventional glycemic control on foot ulcer outcomes.&#xD;
      Investigators want to fill this lacuna by conducting a randomized control trial with the&#xD;
      primary aim of wound healing in participants of diabetic foot ulcer on intensive glycemic&#xD;
      control versus conventional treatment.&#xD;
