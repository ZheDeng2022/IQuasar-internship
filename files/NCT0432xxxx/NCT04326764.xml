  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this prospective randomized trial is to compare maintenance treatment with&#xD;
      panobinostat interspersed with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) versus the standard approach&#xD;
      of pre-emptive DLI alone in patients with poor-risk AML/MDS having favorably received an&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT followed by engraftment, donor chimerism and hematopoietic reconstitution.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been shown to improve the&#xD;
      outcome of poor-risk AML and MDS in both younger and older patients. Reduced-intensity&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) regimen have partially abrogated the problem of regimen-related toxicity.&#xD;
      However, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a major cause of non-relapse morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Despite a strong graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic HSCT, the&#xD;
      relapse rate after transplantation in poor-risk leukemia patients is still too high,&#xD;
      necessitating new approaches to exploit GvL in a more optimized way. In addition, minimizing&#xD;
      the GvHD reaction remains an important goal. One attractive strategy may be the&#xD;
      administration of epigenetic therapy early after HSCT in order to optimize the GvL effect, to&#xD;
      provide a direct anti-leukemic effect, and to control GvHD. Two preceding phase I/II studies&#xD;
      have suggested that post-transplant administration of the histone deacetylase (HDAC)&#xD;
      inhibitor panobinostat may be associated with a reduced relapse rate, while allowing for&#xD;
      control of GvHD. Based on these two studies, the hypothesis of the present trial is that&#xD;
      panobinostat can be an effective drug in preventing relapse by optimizing GvL in MDS and AML&#xD;
      patients with high-risk features after HSCT, while at the same time reducing GvHD. It has&#xD;
      been designed to test this hypothesis in a prospective randomized trial comparing maintenance&#xD;
      with panobinostat interspersed with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) versus the standard&#xD;
      approach of pre-emptive DLI alone in patients with poor-risk AML/MDS having favorably&#xD;
      received an allogeneic HSCT followed by engraftment, donor chimerism and hematopoietic&#xD;
      reconstitution.&#xD;

    <description>Panobinostat should be taken orally once on each scheduled day at about the same time, either with or without food. Each dose of panobinostat should be taken with a cup of water.&#xD;
The capsules should be swallowed as whole. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re-dosing is allowed before the next scheduled dose. If one dose is forgotten during the morning on a scheduled treatment day then the missed dose should be taken on that same day within 12 hours. After more than 12 hours, that day's dose should be withheld, and the patient should wait to take panobinostat until the next schedule treatment day. The patient should then continue treatment with the original dosing schedule.&#xD;
Panobinostat will be administered at a dose of 20 mg three times weekly (TIW) every second week and will be dosed on a flat scale of mg/day and not by weight or body surface area.&#xD;
Panobinostat will be dispensed as a 20 mg capsule or as two 10 mg capsules.</description>
