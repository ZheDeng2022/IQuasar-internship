        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed salivary gland carcinoma (SGC) by local pathology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Androgen receptor (AR) expressing SGC: Local testing of AR-positivity will be&#xD;
             performed as standard of care for the eligibility confirmation. AR-positivity will be&#xD;
             defined according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor tissue with at least&#xD;
             1 percent (%) of cell nuclei staining positive. Tissue should be available for the&#xD;
             central confirmation of AR-positivity, but the central result of AR positivity will&#xD;
             not be required for initiating the study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Locally advanced or recurrent/metastatic SGC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable lesion(s) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;

             and hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement therapy to be Grade 2 or less). If&#xD;
             corticosteroids are administered for any reasons such as the management of toxicities&#xD;

             intracranial masses such as schwannomas and meningiomas that are causing edema or mass&#xD;
             effect)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with drugs known to lower the seizure threshold within 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             first dose&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected contraindications or hypersensitivity to apalutamide,&#xD;
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) analogues or any of the components of&#xD;
             the formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received prior ADT including a GnRH analogue, AR blocker such as bicalutamide,&#xD;
             enzalutamide or 17alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitor such as abiraterone&#xD;
             acetate etc. Chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery as part of curative intent therapy&#xD;
             are allowed so long as prior therapy did not include ADT. Prior chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
             cancer therapy or immunotherapy within 1 week or 4 half-lives whichever is longer,&#xD;
             before the first administration of study drug. For agents with long half-lives, the&#xD;
             maximum required time since last dose is 2 weeks&#xD;
