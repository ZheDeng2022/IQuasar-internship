    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to develop an Indonesian computer-based game prototype that targets&#xD;
      the clinical symptoms of ADHD as well as executive function and to investigate effectiveness&#xD;
      through fMRI BOLD examination. This was a mix-method study design; the first step was an&#xD;
      exploratory qualitative study using focused group discussion. The second step was 'the one&#xD;
      group pre- and post-test design study' without any control. Ten primary school children who&#xD;
      were drug-naïve and had a diagnosis of ADHD with no other mental or physical disorders&#xD;
      participated in the study. Clinical improvement was measured by the CATPRS, BRIEF, and fMRI&#xD;
      BOLD examination that focused on DLPFC-Hippocampus functional connectivity before and after&#xD;
      20 sessions of the Indonesian computer-based game prototype training. Data were analyzed&#xD;
      using the paired t test and Pearson's correlation in SPSS for Mac version 21, and fMRI BOLD&#xD;
      functional analysis was performed using SPM software version 12 and CONN Toolbox version 17.&#xD;
      The hypothesis was: the Indonesian computer-based game prototype had an effect towards ADHD&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and executive function that correlated with DLPFC-Hippocampus functional&#xD;
      connectivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study had two phases and was designed as a mix-method study. The first step was an&#xD;
      exploratory qualitative study, and the second was a quasi-experimental study without any&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First Phase On the first phase, study conducted by using qualitative explorative design&#xD;
           to develop and create computer-based game with Indonesian content in order to increase&#xD;
           working memory capacity. This phase was done by focus group discussion (FGD) approach&#xD;
           which involve participation from Indonesian Game Laboratorium from Faculty of Computer&#xD;
           Science of Binus University International; and child and adolescent psychiatrist from&#xD;
           Department of Psychiatry dr Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital - Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
           Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second phase of the study, it used ' the one group pre- and post-test' without control&#xD;
      design which aims to prove that the predeveloped game has impact to executive function of the&#xD;
      child and impact to DLPFC region of the brain. The inclusion criteria was child with ADHD age&#xD;
      5 to 12 years old that never taken medication prior to the study and willing to undergo&#xD;
      training with computer based game which developed from phase one of the study for about 20&#xD;
      sessions with approximately 30 minutes per each session for 4 weeks consecutively. The&#xD;
      training was conducted at school where the sample attended school so it would not disturb the&#xD;
      learning and teaching process at school. The training would be guided and supervised directly&#xD;
      by the researcher team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of ADHD was conducted by trained child and adolescent psychiatrist guided by&#xD;
      Mini-Kids which was structured interview guide built based on ICD-X. Children which included&#xD;
      on the study were child with ADHD without any other mental disorder comorbidity and does not&#xD;
      has chronic physical illness during the interview with the parents. Child which does not&#xD;
      complete 90% of the numbers of the training that planned will not included in data analysis.&#xD;
      Number of study's subject which needed on this research was obtained by using sample size&#xD;
      table formula for clinical studies', with α = 0,05, β=0,2, 2-sided and consider that Δ&#xD;
      (effect size) = 1 resulting that 10 subjects were needed. This formula was used because to&#xD;
      date, similar study has not found or conducted ( training with game and imaging with fMRI&#xD;
      BOLD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definition which used in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ADHD (Attetion Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) defines as neurodevelopmental disorder&#xD;
           which marked by hyperactivity, impulsive behaviour and difficulty in concentrate which&#xD;
           happens more often and severe compares to peer group from same age group. This disorder&#xD;
           causes impairment and distress to the child and his/her family. Diagnosis of ADHD and&#xD;
           exclusion of other mental disorder was conducted by trained child and adolescent&#xD;
           psychiatrist which established by structured interview using MINI kids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Working memory deficit defines as deficit in ability to store and manipulate information&#xD;
           for a short period of time and to be able to look upon, memorize, and take action on an&#xD;
           information simultaneously. Clinical measuring of working memory deficit is done by&#xD;
           BRIEF questionnaire which have been validated into Indonesion language 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Imaging with fMRI was conducted by special stimuli to stimulate child's executive&#xD;
           function with go and no-go modification which were images that had to be memorized in&#xD;
           accordance to specific order and truth of the image. fMRI was conducted at Radiology&#xD;
           Unit, Abdi Waluyo Hospital, using MRI scanner from GE Health care, 3 Tesla,&#xD;
           8-channel-coil. Sequence which used was Echo Plannar Imaging (EPI), with some&#xD;
           modification; TR 3 seconds, TE 30, bandwidth 250kHZ, FOV 240 x 240, slice thickness 3&#xD;
           mm, space 1 mm, matrix 84 x 84 (frequency x phase), NEX 1, total slices 36, time 312&#xD;
           seconds. The measuring would be changes in activity by imaging result of fMRI BOLD (blod&#xD;
           Oxygen-Level Dependent Contrast), which the level will increase on the more active brain&#xD;
           part and decrease on the less active brain part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Qualitative data was analysed by qualitative approach and described in a form&#xD;
      of text. Data analysis for quantitative study was conducted by 't' test analytic for variable&#xD;
      dependent by SPSS version 21 for Mac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from MRI result would undergo pre-processing process which are realignment, writing and&#xD;
      smoothing with FHWM 8 mm, then processed with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software&#xD;
      version 12 and CONN Toolbox version 17. Analysis method which conducted was ROI-to ROI method&#xD;
      wth the chosen ROI for this studty were lef and right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and&#xD;
      Hippocampus fucntional connectivity.&#xD;
