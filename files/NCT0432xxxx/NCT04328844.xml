  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of study IOA-244-101 is to determine whether IOA-244 is safe and tolerable in&#xD;
      cancer patients (Part A). In addition, the study will assess whether IOA-244 can increase the&#xD;
      anti-tumour immune response in patients both as monotherapy and in combination with&#xD;
      pemetrexed/cisplatin (Part B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive IOA-244 for a period of 6 months. After treatment completion,&#xD;
      participants will continue in the study for a follow-up period of 6 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Inability to swallow food or any condition of the upper gastrointestinal tract that&#xD;
             precludes administration of oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. History of a prior Grade 3 or 4 immune-related AE (irAE) or any grade ocular irAE&#xD;
                  from prior immunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Active autoimmune process (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, moderate or severe&#xD;
                  psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease) (i.e., use of&#xD;
                  disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs).&#xD;
                  Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
                  replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc) is not&#xD;
                  considered a form of systemic treatment. For patients with NHL ongoing treatment&#xD;
                  with chronic immunosuppressants (eg, cyclosporine) or systemic steroids &gt; 20 mg&#xD;

                  negative diagnostic lumbar puncture prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Note: Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
                  they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
                  before the first dose of study treatment and any neurologic symptoms have&#xD;

                  ECGs is &lt; 480 milliseconds. For patients with an intraventricular conduction&#xD;
                  delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 msec), the JTc interval may be used in place of the QTc&#xD;
                  with Sponsor approval. The JTc must be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place&#xD;
                  of the QTc. Patients with left bundle branch block are excluded Note: QTc&#xD;
                  prolongation due to pacemaker may enrol if the JT is normal or with Medical&#xD;
                  Monitor approval&#xD;

                       antimicrobial, antifungal or antiviral agents). Subjects on antimicrobial,&#xD;
                       antifungal or antiviral prophylaxis are not specifically excluded if all&#xD;
                       other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met and there is no evidence of&#xD;
                       active infection at randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection&#xD;
&#xD;

                  cancers: bladder, gastric, colon, endometrial, cervical/dysplasia, melanoma or&#xD;
                  breast) unless a complete remission was achieved at least 2 years prior to study&#xD;
                  entry and no additional therapy is required during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the&#xD;
                  opinion of the Investigator, may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
