  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ASA inhalation powder is an inhaled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-device combination&#xD;
      that has been developed to reduce the risk of vascular mortality in patients with suspected&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction (MI), an FDA approved indication for oral formulations of&#xD;
      aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of study OTP-P0-926 is to collect pharmacokinetic (PK)and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) pilot data to determine onset and extent of aspirin response after administration of&#xD;
      varying doses of inhaled ASA (50-100mg) and 162 mg Non-Enteric-Coated Chewable ASA. PD will&#xD;
      be assessed using standard methods to measure platelet inhibition by aspirin including&#xD;
      platelet aggregation, serum thromboxane,and urinary thromboxane. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASA will be determined and compared to PD measurements. Results of&#xD;
      this pilot study will guide dosing in a subsequent larger Phase II study.&#xD;
