  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the estimated clinical specificity of the&#xD;
      AAD Plus. A secondary objective is to determine the estimated sensitivity of the AAD Plus as&#xD;
      10% of the study subject samples will be contrived to be positive.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site trial assessing the clinical specificity of AAD Plus using&#xD;
      capillary blood, venous blood, and venous serum samples collected from presumptive anthrax&#xD;
      negative subjects who present with symptoms consistent with cold, flu or other bronchial and&#xD;
      febrile infections in the US. At least 440 subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will have 3 blood samples from a single time point tested with the AAD Plus device. The&#xD;
      samples will be: 1) capillary blood collected by finger stick; 2) venous blood collected in a&#xD;
      sodium citrate anticoagulant tube; and, 3) serum obtained from venous blood collected in a&#xD;
      serum separator tube. The capillary blood sample will be tested immediately to avoid clotting&#xD;
      by an unblinded staff member. The venous blood and serum samples will be tested by a blinded&#xD;
      staff member as soon as possible after preparation. Additional aliquots of the serum sample&#xD;
      will be prepared and stored frozen at -20 ± 2°C or colder for possible additional reference&#xD;
      testing [CDC reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (K140426)] in the&#xD;
      event that any of the subject's capillary blood, venous blood, or serum sample is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each clinical site, subjects' paired venous whole blood and serum samples will be randomly&#xD;
      selected such that 10% of all subjects' samples (total of 40) will be spiked with recombinant&#xD;
      anthrax lethal factor (LF) to prepare a contrived positive sample. Each clinical site will be&#xD;
      provided a unique randomization list by the Data Management Center that identifies, which&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized for spiking with LF. The numbers of spiked samples will be&#xD;
      distributed approximately equally between all sites. An unblinded site staff member will&#xD;
      prepare the blinded, spiked (from 40 subjects selected for spiking) and unspiked (from 400&#xD;
      subjects that are not selected for spiking) venous blood and serum specimens to be tested by&#xD;
      a blinded staff member. Before the venous blood sample and serum specimens (from subjects&#xD;
      selected for spiking) are spiked; the unblinded staff member will also test all unspiked&#xD;
      samples on the AAD Plus and record the results. Then the spiked venous blood and serum sample&#xD;
      will be given to the blinded staff member for testing. Thus, blinded staff will receive whole&#xD;
      blood and serum samples that could be either unspiked (presumed negative) or spiked (presumed&#xD;
      positive) to preserve the blind. In the rare event that the AAD Plus test result is positive&#xD;
      on the unspiked sample tested by the unblinded staff member, then the unblinded staff member&#xD;
      will give the unspiked sample from this subject to the blinded operator for AAD Plus testing&#xD;
      and the subject's serum sample will be sent for reference testing as described above. Blinded&#xD;
      staff will remain blinded throughout the study to the contrived spiking of the whole blood&#xD;
      and serum samples as to which samples were contrived.&#xD;
