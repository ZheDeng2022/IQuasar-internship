    <textblock>
      This research is being done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant lenvatinib on&#xD;
      surgical outcomes of patients with invasive extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer&#xD;
      (DTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves a study drug called lenvatinib&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, phase II, open-label study examining the effect of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      lenvatinib being given to patients with extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)&#xD;
      prior to surgery to remove cancerous tumors (thyroidectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves a study drug called lenvatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is anticipated that 30 people will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved lenvatinib for the specific&#xD;
      disease of extrathyroidal differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) but it has been approved for&#xD;
      other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to&#xD;
      learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      drug is being studied.&#xD;
