  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Learning chronic pain self-management skills can help patients improve daily functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life, while avoiding risks associated with opioids and other pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments. Community health workers (CHWs) may help make chronic pain self-management&#xD;
      interventions more accessible to older adults living in underserved communities. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to conduct a randomized pilot and feasibility trial of a positive&#xD;
      psychology-based chronic pain self-management intervention delivered by CHWs, in conjunction&#xD;
      with mobile health tools, in a sample of 50 older adults recruited from community sites in&#xD;
      Detroit, Michigan. This study will involve the use of mixed quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      methods to assess participant engagement and satisfaction, and change in pain-related&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Interference 6-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-43 Adult Profile. Items ask how much pain in the last 7 days has interfered with daily activities such as household chores and social activities (1=not at all to 5=very much); raw total scale scores range from 6 (low interference) to 30 (high interference). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 42 to 76, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Functioning 4-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Adult Profile. Items ask how much difficulty participant has in doing daily activities such as household chores, using stairs, and walking 15 minutes (1=without any difficulty to 5=unable to do); raw total scale scores range from 4 (high functioning) to 20 (low functioning). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 23 to 57, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Individuals in the intervention group will meet with a community health worker at an in-person or virtual study orientation session. At this session, they will be introduced to the program, learn how to use the online modules and any associated materials, and choose a day and time for future weekly telephone sessions. Participants will also be given a wearable physical activity tracker at the orientation session to use throughout the course of the program. They can choose to report daily step counts either by automatically syncing to an app or by manual reporting via text message. The program will be delivered over 6 weeks. Each week participants will complete a web-based module and have one telephone session with the community health worker to discuss that module and to set a related goal. Participants will also set weekly goals related to walking, which will be informed and tracked by daily step-counts from the physical activity tracker.</description>

    <ipd_description>Self-reported survey data (baseline and 8 weeks from baseline) on pain and functioning, as well as other health and demographic information from a telephone survey of 50 pilot study participants. For 25 of these participants, we will also have up to six weeks of daily activity (step count) data. Two anonymized datasets will be created: 1) survey data only; 2) survey data plus, for the subset of 25 participants, activity data linked to survey data. In order to maintain confidentiality, outliers, dates, and personal identifiers will be removed from the data set.&#xD;
Notes from post-program qualitative interviews (n=25). These are in-depth, semi-structured interviews about challenges, facilitators, and satisfaction with various aspects of the program and its implementation. We will share de-identified copies of detailed notes from these interviews (we do not plan on producing verbatim transcripts) but not audiorecordings.</ipd_description>

          <description>The Pain Interference 6-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-43 Adult Profile. Items ask how much pain in the last 7 days has interfered with daily activities such as household chores and social activities (1=not at all to 5=very much); raw total scale scores range from 6 (low interference) to 30 (high interference). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 42 to 76, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Change in Pain Interference</title>
        <description>The Pain Interference 6-item subscale of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-43 Adult Profile. Items ask how much pain in the last 7 days has interfered with daily activities such as household chores and social activities (1=not at all to 5=very much); raw total scale scores range from 6 (low interference) to 30 (high interference). When converted to T-scores (normed such that a score of 50 is the population mean and 10 T-score points=1 standard deviation), the possible range is 42 to 76, with a higher score representing worse outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>Participants who had data on both baseline and follow-up measure. Change score is the follow-up minus baseline score, such that a greater, negative change value is a better outcome.</population>

Positive STEPS: Individuals in the intervention group will meet with a community health worker at an in-person or virtual study orientation session. At this session, they will be introduced to the program, learn how to use the online modules and any associated materials, and choose a day and time for future weekly telephone sessions. Participants will also be given a wearable physical activity tracker at the orientation session to use throughout the course of the program. They will report daily step counts via text message. The program will be delivered over 6 weeks. Each week participants will complete a web-based module and have one telephone session with the community health worker to discuss that module and to set a related goal. Participants may also set weekly goals related to walking, which will be informed and tracked by daily step-counts from the physical activity tracker.</description>

Participants will also be given a wearable physical activity tracker at the orientation session to use throughout the course of the program. They will report daily step counts via text message. The program will be delivered over 6 weeks. Each week participants will complete a web-based module and have one telephone session with the community health worker to discuss that module and to set a related goal. Participants may also set weekly goals related to walking, which will be informed and tracked by daily step-counts from the physical activity tracker.</description>
