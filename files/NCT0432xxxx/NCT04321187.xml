  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have reported that cancer survivors develop age-related chronic conditions&#xD;
      like frailty, sarcopenia, cardiac dysfunction, and cognitive impairment earlier and/or at a&#xD;
      greater burden than similarly aged individuals never diagnosed with cancer or exposed to&#xD;
      cancer therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the knowledge about aging-associated consequences of cancer treatment and the&#xD;
      processes that underlie differential responses to therapy is very limited. In 2018, a think&#xD;
      tank established by the National Cancer Institute has defined various research needs to&#xD;
      expand the evidence base for aging-related consequences of cancer treatment, such as studies&#xD;
      to examine aging-related processes that include regularly performed assessments capturing&#xD;
      factors associated with physical function or studies to elucidate pathways that lead to the&#xD;
      emergence of aging phenotypes and to understand the relationships between biomarkers of aging&#xD;
      and functional outcomes in cancer survivors. In addition, study inclusion of older adults&#xD;
      with comorbidities and higher levels of frailty has been proposed to achieve an improved&#xD;
      understanding of functional outcomes at any age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses / objectives We hypothesize that prostate cancer radiotherapy accelerates&#xD;
      aging-related processes, furthermore, aging-related biomarkers may predict functional&#xD;
      outcomes and represent early indicators of aging phenotypes. Primary objectives of the&#xD;
      proposed study are the determination of the aging-related consequences of radiotherapy in&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients and the evaluation of the relationship between biomarkers of aging&#xD;
      and age-related clinical conditions.&#xD;

      Systematic evaluations of functional and cognitive status, comorbidities, health status,&#xD;
      mobility, nutritional status, psychological status, and social circumstances as well as&#xD;
      measurements of cellular senescence and chronic inflammation will be performed in a cohort of&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients at baseline (before radiotherapy), at the end of radiotherapy and at&#xD;
      follow-up intervals thereafter. The evaluation of aging-related biomarkers will include&#xD;
      determination of markers of cellular senescence and markers of systemic inflammation. The&#xD;
      correlation between genetic variants modulating telomere length and the risk of developing&#xD;
      age-related phenotypes will also be analyzed.&#xD;
