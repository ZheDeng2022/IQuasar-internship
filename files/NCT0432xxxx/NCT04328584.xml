  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While undergoing chest wall resection, a surgeon's major concern is obtaining an appropriate&#xD;
      surgical margin. Difficulty or failure to do so can result in prolonged operative time, need&#xD;
      for re-operation due to a positive resection margin, or need for complex chest wall&#xD;
      reconstruction due to unnecessarily wide resection. Over the last decades, surgical&#xD;
      navigation systems have been developed to improve operative precision in various surgical&#xD;
      fields. This is achieved by integrating patient images with intraoperative findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integration of CT imaging systems into the operating room now provide real-time 3D images of&#xD;
      patient anatomy during surgery. This better adjusts for anatomical deformation and tissue&#xD;
      excision compared to using preoperative images alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients scheduled for chest wall resection will be enrolled over the study duration&#xD;
      of 2 years. Patients will undergo imaging and surgery in the GTx-OR at Toronto General&#xD;
      Hospital, as part of the GTx Program of the TECHNA Institute. All patients will be asked to&#xD;
      consent to receiving their care in a research environment. They will also be asked to consent&#xD;
      to having the intraoperative image acquired and used to generate a navigation view in the&#xD;
      GTx-OR. Instead of resecting the chest wall lesion according to the preoperative images alone&#xD;
      with intraoperative findings as per standard-care procedures, the navigation view will be&#xD;
      used as an additional reference for surgeons during the operation.&#xD;
