  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is a popular &quot;party drug&quot; because it is inexpensive and easy&#xD;
      to ingest. The calming and euphoric effects of GHB in low doses have given the drug the&#xD;
      nickname &quot;liquid ecstasy&quot;. However, at doses &gt;60 mg/kg coma, convulsions, and respiratory&#xD;
      depression can occur. If the drug combinates with alcohol these effects intensify, especially&#xD;
      respiratory depression and hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lately a phenomenon called Chemsex has been spreading across big European cities. This is a&#xD;
      form of recreational drug use and it is believed that can be, in part, the cause of the&#xD;
      increasing in consumption of GHB. Chemsex is especially common among men who have sex with&#xD;
      other men (MSM) and in people living with HIV, with up to 50% of HIV-positive MSM reporting&#xD;
      to be engaged in chemsex in recent months. This population is specially concerning since the&#xD;
      combination of ART with the drug can cause pharmacological interactions leading to overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this study intends to evaluate the drug interaction with low doses of&#xD;
      cobicistat, an antiretroviral drug enhancer, since there are two case reports of&#xD;
      life-threatening overdoses in patients on treatment with high doses of another enhancer that&#xD;
      has a similar effect than cobicistat, but there are no studies about interactions with low&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is an endogenous compound present in most mammalian tissues&#xD;
      at nanomolar concentrations and a minor metabolite or precursor of gammaaminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA). GHB was first synthesized in 1960 by the French biochemist H.-M. Laborit who was&#xD;
      searching for analogues of GABA. Currently, medically formulated GHB sodium oxybate (Xyrem®)&#xD;
      is approved in different countries for such varied uses as general anaesthesia, the treatment&#xD;
      of alcohol withdrawal and addiction, and cataplexy associated with narcolepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of GHB are characterized by rapid oral absorption, with peak concentrations&#xD;
      in plasma 20-45 min after dosing, and half-life of 20-30 min. The majority of the dose is&#xD;
      eliminated completely within 4-8 h. Metabolism of GHB occurs via GHB dehydrogenase, which&#xD;
      transforms it into succinic semialdehyde and, by a second oxidation step with transformation&#xD;
      into succinic acid, it is then ultimately metabolized to water and excreted through breath as&#xD;
      carbon dioxide. However, GHB exposure is increased in patients with liver function impairment&#xD;
      and has been suggested presystemic (hepatic first pass) metabolism mediated by the CYP450&#xD;
      system in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 1980s, easy access to GHB-containing products led to various unapproved uses,&#xD;
      including weight loss, bodybuilding and the treatment of sleeplessness, sometimes with&#xD;
      serious long-term effects. During the last years, GHB has become a major concern in emergency&#xD;
      rooms of some countries due to an important increase in the number of cases of intoxications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the drug is both inexpensive and easy to ingest, it has been popular as a &quot;party drug.&quot;&#xD;
      The calming and euphoric effects of GHB in low doses (20-30 mg/kg) have given the drug the&#xD;
      nickname &quot;liquid ecstasy&quot;. At higher doses (&gt; 50 mg/kg), the hypnotic effects are more&#xD;
      prominent and at doses &gt;60 mg/kg coma, convulsions, and respiratory depression can occur. The&#xD;
      clinical hallmark of GHB poisoning is rapid onset of coma, with respiratory depression,&#xD;
      hypoventilation and bradycardia. Combination with alcohol potentiates these effects,&#xD;
      especially respiratory depression and hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular use of GHB is thought to be relatively higher in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and&#xD;
      transgender community. Anecdotal evidence suggests that GHB use is increasing and this may be&#xD;
      driven in part by an increase in the incidence of chemsex. Chemsex is a specific form of&#xD;
      recreational drug use involving specific drugs such as GHB/γ-butyrolactone (GBL),&#xD;
      methylamphetamine and mephedrone, alone or in combination, to enhance or prolong sexual&#xD;
      sessions. Such sessions can last for several days, involve multiple partners and include high&#xD;
      risk behaviour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the phenomenon of chemsex was initially limited to the metropolitan area of London,&#xD;
      it is getting spread across other big European cities, making of this an emerging global&#xD;
      health issue. Chemsex is especially common among men who have sex with other men (MSM) and in&#xD;
      people living with HIV (PLWH), with up to 50% of HIV-positive MSM reporting to be engaged in&#xD;
      chemsex in recent months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of recreational drugs in PLWH has been associated with high-risk practices for&#xD;
      sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, use of drugs in patients taking antiretroviral&#xD;
      therapy (ART) might result in pharmacological interactions with potential risk of overdosing.&#xD;
      Noteworthy, widespread use of chemsex drugs has resulted in increased rates of overdose and&#xD;
      associated deaths, and Handley &amp; Flanagan have reported an increase in the number of cases of&#xD;
      fatal poisoning with GHB, mephedrone and ketamine in England and Wales since 2008. Also,&#xD;
      GHB-associated deaths have been reported from the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cobicistat (GS-9350) is a pharmacokinetic enhancer that was developed to inhibit CYP3A&#xD;
      activity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, thus boosting other antiretroviral&#xD;
      drugs. Results from clinical trials showed that it can increase the plasma exposure of&#xD;
      elvitegravir, atazanavir, and darunavir. Similarly, cobicistat increases the exposure to many&#xD;
      other xenobiotics. For example, it is well known that CYP3A4 inhibition leads to a&#xD;
      significant increase in concentrations of sildenafil and other erectile dysfunction agents,&#xD;
      and that a dose adjustment is needed in this scenario. Similarly, CYP3A4 inhibition increased&#xD;
      ketamine exposure in a small clinical trial in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two case reports in the literature of well documented life-threatening overdoses on&#xD;
      GHB and MDMA in HIV-positive patients on treatment with high-doses of ritonavir (600 mg bid).&#xD;
      However, the possibility for this drug interaction with the low doses of pharmacoenhancers&#xD;
      currently used (ritonavir 100 mg qd, cobicistat 150 mg qd) is still a matter for debate,&#xD;
      Despite data suggesting the possibility of drug interactions between cobicistat and GHB,&#xD;
      formal pharmacokinetic studies assessing this issue are lacking.&#xD;
