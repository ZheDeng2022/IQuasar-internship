  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare associated infections linked to the use of indwelling medical devices increase&#xD;
      hospital morbidity, mortality and the Intensive Care treatment costs. The essential strategy&#xD;
      for mitigating these consequences are prompt source identifcation and control, with&#xD;
      appropriate antimicrobial therapy initiation as soon as possible. Removing the source is one&#xD;
      of the golden rule for infection control. Early identification of the responsible germs is&#xD;
      the other major guiding element for the appropriate anti-infectious treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite multiple detection/identification methods, there are no clear recommendations for&#xD;
      biofilm identification in clinical practice. The gold standard method is bacterial/fungal&#xD;
      culturing, with disadvantages related to late results, especially for slow growing,&#xD;
      fastidious germs or related to the existence of uncultivable strains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain more sensitive, specific results and to increase the chances of better&#xD;
      biofilm characterization, in the present study the investigators compare biofilm&#xD;
      identification results obtained by standard cultivation methods with those by DNA&#xD;
      amplification and next generation gene sequencing. The studied biofilm is associated to four&#xD;
      criticallly ill oncological patients indwelling devices (endotracheal tube, central venous&#xD;
      catheter, arterial catheter and urinary catheter).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to Regional Institute of Oncology, Iasi protocols, all septic patients with the&#xD;
      need of invasive ventilatory support (endotracheal intubation), have concomitantly inserted a&#xD;
      CVC, an AC and a UC, as standard of care. All patients undergo the protocol for the&#xD;
      management of suspected/proven sepsis: initial resuscitation, specimen collection for&#xD;
      microbiology/molecular biology tests, empirical/targeted anti-infectious treatment, source&#xD;
      control, multiple organ support and treatment of the underlying disease/comorbidities. All&#xD;
      RIO patients are screened for nasal, pharyngeal and rectal pathogen colonization at the time&#xD;
      of hospital/ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent - During the first 24 hours of ICU admission, all eligible patients will&#xD;
      receive written information about the study: its implementation, aims, expected advantages&#xD;
      and possible risks, and they will be asked to sign an informed consent. If the patient is&#xD;
      unable to give consent at ICU admission due to pathological or drug-induced acute alteration&#xD;
      of consciousness, a legal representative may give authorization. Once the participant regains&#xD;
      the decision capacity, the individual will be asked to confirm or withdraw consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swab sampling - The nasal, pharyngeal and rectal screening swab sampling is collected&#xD;
      according to standard methods. In addition to this standard screening, in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      of ICU admission cutaneous samples from the groin area of enrolled patients will be obtained,&#xD;
      with sterile Copan eSwabTM swabs, a product recommended for aerobic, anaerobic and fastidious&#xD;
      microbial agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biofilm sampling and transport - The extraction of the four ID (ET, CVC, AC, UC) will be&#xD;
      performed when the clinical condition of the patient dictates it (suspected catheter&#xD;
      infection/no further need due to improvement or death). These devices will be extracted by&#xD;
      medical ICU personnel, only at the indication and according to the medical judgment of the&#xD;
      clinician, without being influenced by the patient's study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological processing and analysis of the biofilm - Microbiological analysis will be&#xD;
      performed by standard method: sample seeding on standard culture media, then biochemical&#xD;
      identification test and AST according to CLSI standards and guidelines using MicroScan Walk&#xD;
      Away 40 plus®, Beckmann Coulter automatic system compatible pannels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular biology processing and analysis of the biofilm - After complete sample collection,&#xD;
      gene sequencing of the variable regions V3-V4 16S rRNA gene will be performed using Illumina&#xD;
      MiSeq® Next Generation Sequencer System.&#xD;
