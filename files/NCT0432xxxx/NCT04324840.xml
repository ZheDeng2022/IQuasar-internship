  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CC-90010-GBM-002 is for newly diagnosed WHO Grade IV glioblastoma to determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and evaluate escalating doses of the investigational drug CC-90010&#xD;
      when combined with standard of care treatment temozolomide (TMZ) with or without radiotherapy&#xD;
      (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for ndGBM includes surgical resection to the extent that is safely&#xD;
      feasible, followed by RT plus concomitant TMZ chemotherapy, and up to 6 months of adjuvant&#xD;
      TMZ. The study also aims to determine whether the addition of CC-90010 can control the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will initially explore escalating oral doses&#xD;
      of CC-90010 in combination with adjuvant TMZ to estimate the MTD (Maximum tolerated dose)&#xD;
      and/or the RP2D (recommended Phase 2 Dose) of CC-90010 as adjuvant therapy. After two dose&#xD;
      escalation levels (or earlier as decided by the Safety Review Committee ) are assessed as&#xD;
      safe and tolerated in the Adjuvant Therapy dose escalation, the Concomitant Therapy dose&#xD;
      escalation will start, exploring escalating oral doses of CC-90010 in combination with&#xD;
      concomitant TMZ+RT, to estimate the MTD and/or the RP2D of CC-90010 as concomitant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of CC-90010&#xD;
      administered at or below the MTD determined for the Adjuvant Therapy and the Concomitant&#xD;
      Therapy in Part A, in expansion cohorts of approximately 20-30 evaluable subjects each, in&#xD;
      order to further define the RP2D. Parts A and B will consist of three periods: Screening,&#xD;
      Treatment, and Follow-up periods.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE.</description>
