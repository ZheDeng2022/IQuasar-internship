      Reducing hypoglycemia is an important aspect of management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in older&#xD;
      adults, many of whom have hypoglycemic unawareness, cognitive impairment, or both. Continuous&#xD;
      Glucose Monitoring (CGM) offers the opportunity to reduce hypoglycemia and its related&#xD;
      complications such as fractures from falls and hospitalizations and improve QOL including&#xD;
      reducing hypoglycemic fear and diabetes distress. The potential benefit of CGM in reducing&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in the older adult population has not been well studied. Prior and on-going&#xD;
      trials compare CGM to self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, but none look at remote daily&#xD;
      monitoring of CGM data or provision of telemedicine based on clinic notification of&#xD;
      hypoglycemic events. This study is a 14 week, single center, pilot study of 10 subjects 65-75&#xD;
      yrs old with type 1 diabetes. The primary aim is to determine the effect of continuous remote&#xD;
      CGM reporting coupled with a telemedicine intervention (Tele-CGM program) on rates of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in adults with T1D &gt;65 years old. Study staff will review Tidepool uploads and&#xD;
      call/email to the patient if one of the following occur has occurred in the past 24 hours: ≥4&#xD;
      hours without CGM signal, ≥2 hours 54 - 70 mg/dl and/or 15 minutes &lt;54 mg/dl. Tele-monitoring&#xD;
      call will include questions to find out why the event happened and then suggestions on how to&#xD;
      trouble shoot to avoid issues in the future. As this is a feasibility study, statistical&#xD;
      considerations were not used.&#xD;

      SUMMARY OF STUDY RATIONAL - Reducing hypoglycemia is an important aspect of management of T1D&#xD;
      in older adults, many of whom have hypoglycemic unawareness, cognitive impairment, or both.&#xD;
      CGM offers the opportunity to reduce hypoglycemia and its related complications such as&#xD;
      fractures from falls and hospitalizations and improve QOL including reducing hypoglycemic&#xD;
      fear and diabetes distress. Despite these potential benefits, CGM is used by only a small&#xD;
      proportion of older adults with T1D (19% in the T1D Exchange registry). Previous studies&#xD;
      assessing CGM efficacy have included only a small number of adults ≥ 60 years of age,&#xD;
      excluded patients most prone to severe hypoglycemia (SH), focused on improving HbA1c rather&#xD;
      than hypoglycemia, and used older generation CGM sensors. These studies are not generalizable&#xD;
      to the population of older adults with T1D. The potential benefit of CGM in reducing&#xD;
      hypoglycemia in the older adult population has not been well studied. Prior and on-going&#xD;
      trials compare CGM to self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, but none look at remote daily&#xD;
      monitoring of CGM data. Moreover, in none of the studies is education standardized. The&#xD;
      follow-up of patients is done only at routine clinic visits, without any particular oversight&#xD;
      of glucose values on an on-going basis. In some cases individual patients may share their&#xD;
      data with a family member, but these are generally not trained medical personnel and the&#xD;
      Dexcom provided by Medicare has the &quot;share&quot; feature disabled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION Baseline Visit: Participants will sign informed consent, complete&#xD;
      questionnaires, measure HbA1C, start new CGM sensor and be signed in to the Tidepool&#xD;
      application for TeleMonitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1- will occur at Week @ 2 where 14 days of CGM data will be downloaded from&#xD;
      participants' device, systems will be checked for functioning status, remote monitoring&#xD;
      program will be activated, telemedicine procedure will be discussed with patient; emergency&#xD;
      contact numbers will be obtained in case patient cannot be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TeleMonitoring -This will consist of an out going call/email to the patient if one of the&#xD;
      following occur has occurred in the past 24 hours: ≥4 hours without CGM signal, ≥2 hours 54 -&#xD;
      70 mg/dl and/or 15 minutes &lt;54 mg/dl. The study coordinator will be alerted each morning&#xD;
      though the Tidepool program to patients who fit these criteria. The outgoing call/email will&#xD;
      consist of questions to find out why the event happened and then suggestions on how to&#xD;
      trouble shoot to avoid issues in the future. If needed the patient will be seen in person for&#xD;
      an education/training session. If the patient cannot be reached within 6 hours, the patient's&#xD;
      emergency contact will be notified if the PI feels that such out reach is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - will occur at 14 weeks. Questionnaires will be administered, A1C measured and CGM&#xD;
      data and compare to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION AND TESTING PROCEDURES (Baseline, and 14 weeks) HbA1c - HbA1c will be&#xD;
      obtained using the point of care Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)- A commercially available DexCom G5 or G6 CGM device will&#xD;
      be provided and a sensor will be inserted. The participant will receive instructions on&#xD;
      calibration, insertions, maintenance, use, and removal of the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1D REDEEM Diabetes Distress Questionnaire- The T1D REDEEM Diabetes Distress Questionnaire&#xD;
      measures several dimensions of stress related to having type 1 diabetes. It consists of the&#xD;
      following 7 subscales: Subscale 1 - Powerlessness (5 items); Subscale 2 - Management Distress&#xD;
      (4 items); Subscale 3 - Hypoglycemia Distress (4 items); Subscale 4 - Negative Social&#xD;
      Perceptions (4 items); Subscale 5 - Eating Distress (3 items); Subscale 6 - Physician&#xD;
      Distress (4 items); Subscale 7 - Friend/Family Distress (4 items). Each question has a&#xD;
      6-choice Likert response format. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia Fear Survey - The Hypoglycemia Fear Survey measures several dimensions of fear&#xD;
      of hypoglycemia among adults with type 1 diabetes. It consists of a 10-item Behavior subscale&#xD;
      that measured behaviors involved in avoidance and over-treatment of hypoglycemia and a&#xD;
      13-item Worry subscale that measures anxiety and fear surrounding hypoglycemia, each with a&#xD;
      5-choice Likert response format. Administration time is approximately 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simplified Diabetes Knowledge Test -The Simplified Diabetes Knowledge Test consists of 23&#xD;
      knowledge test items developed by the Michigan Diabetes Research Training Center (MDRTC).&#xD;
      These items represent a test of general knowledge of diabetes and are answered in a&#xD;
      true/false/don't know format. The psychometric properties provide information regarding the&#xD;
      reliability of the various groups of items, as well as a difficulty index (percent of&#xD;
      patients who scored this item correctly), and an item to group total correlation for each&#xD;
      item. These data can be reported when describing the use of the test. Administration time is&#xD;
      approximately 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Sever Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis -The Assessment of Severe&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis is an interviewer administered survey assessing if the&#xD;
      subject had any episodes of severe hypoglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis since their last&#xD;
      study visit. Events are recorded to assess frequency, as is type of assistance required to&#xD;
      treat the event. Administration time is approximately 5 minutes.&#xD;

      encouraged to upload their data to Tidepool for analysis. Currently we have over 250 patients&#xD;
      streaming data into Tidepool. However, data is not analyzed on a daily basis, but rather on&#xD;
      as &quot;as needed&quot; basis if a patient contacts the clinic with a problem.&#xD;
