  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin barrier impairment and familial atopy have been implicated as crucial risk factors for&#xD;
      the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). Additional risk factors have been explored,&#xD;
      including gestational weight, height, age, familial smoking habits, proximity to urban&#xD;
      centers and others. However, a comprehensive study focusing on the entire spectrum of risk&#xD;
      factors has yet to be undertaken. Such a study could enable predictive capabilities able to&#xD;
      inform medical professionals as to a newborn's inherent risk to develop AD, and potentially&#xD;
      recommend appropriate preventative modalities to prevent or delay disease onset.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Any other reason that, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from&#xD;
             participating in the study or compromise the patient safety&#xD;
