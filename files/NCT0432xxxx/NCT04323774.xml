  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is a need to improve cancer risk communication and&#xD;
      decision-making among adolescents and young adults. In this study, the investigators are&#xD;
      looking at whether using a chatbot and online portal for cancer risk information helps&#xD;
      improve communication and decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Over 70,000 adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S.&#xD;
           every year and up to 10% have genetic changes (or, mutations) that put them at a higher&#xD;
           risk of developing new cancers during their lifetimes. These genetic mutations can&#xD;
           result in cancer risk syndromes (such as, Lynch Syndrome or Li-Fraumeni Syndrome).&#xD;
           Identifying cancer risk syndromes can allow for screening and early diagnosis of future&#xD;
           cancers, which could ultimately save lives and offer more care choices for patients. As&#xD;
           a result, genetic counseling and testing for cancer risk syndromes is being recommended&#xD;
           more for Adolescents and Young Adults with new cancer diagnoses, regardless of family&#xD;
           history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study to develop an intervention called AYA-RISE that aims to assist AYAs&#xD;
           with cancer risk communication and decision-making around their caregivers.&#xD;

      This research study involves three aims (Aims 1, 2, and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1, Part 1, which focuses on finding the best format for the study intervention&#xD;
           (called AYA-RISE); whether AYA-RISE is easy to use; and whether patients, family&#xD;
           caregivers, and providers find AYA-RISE acceptable.The research study procedures&#xD;
           include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participating in audio-recorded, 30-minute interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1, Part 2, which is a pilot study of the study intervention (called AYA-RISE). In&#xD;
           this pilot study, the investigators are looking at whether AYA-RISE is easy to use and&#xD;
           what participants think of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- The activities involved in this part of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Using and reviewing AYA-RISE&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow-up Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brief feedback interviews on AYA-RISE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Aim 2, participants will be randomized trial into one of two groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 1: Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group 2 : Standard Genetic Counseling/follow-up visit and Access to AYA-Rise&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: Semi-Structured Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluate implementation outcomes using 28 semi-structured interviews with patients,&#xD;
                family members, providers, and site principal investigators&#xD;
