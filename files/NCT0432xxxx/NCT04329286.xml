      Iron demand: The average daily demand to fit the cell biological metabolism is balanced&#xD;
      between intake and lost which about 1-2 mg. One unit of packed red blood cells contains&#xD;
      approximately 200-250 mg of iron.Thus, patients who arereceiving an average of 2 to 4 units&#xD;
      of blood monthly willhave an iron intake of 5000to 10 000 mg of iron per year. Iron&#xD;
      overload(IO) A condition in which the body takes up and stores more iron than it needs from&#xD;
      any cause. Iron overload constitutes a major problem in patients receivingregular blood&#xD;
      transfusion. Patients with β-thalassemia,sickle cell anemia, and congenital and refractory&#xD;
      anemiasonchronic transfusion programs accumulate iron in variousbody organs. Untreated iron&#xD;
      overload will eventually lead todamage of the liver, endocrine organs, and most seriously&#xD;
      theheart(1).Acquired platelet function defect might be one of thecomplications of iron&#xD;
      overload. This could occur indirectlythrough the effect of iron load on the liver and other&#xD;
      organsor might occur due to effect of iron load on platelet functiondirectly.&#xD;
      Dleteriouscomlications contributed by chemical reactive deregulated iron may affect cellular&#xD;
      homeostasis systematically lead to tissue and organ damage when this toxicity occurred in&#xD;
      blood cells ,alteration of peripheral hematological profile concerning erythrocyte,leucocyte&#xD;
      and Platelet. On the other hand, acquired platelet function defects are classified broadly&#xD;
      into defects that are intrinsic or extrinsic to the platelets. Acquired platelets defect are&#xD;
      due to medications, medical conditions, underlying hematologic diseases, and are more&#xD;
      frequent than inherited causes of platelets defects. (2) Platelet function is also influenced&#xD;
      by changes in membranefluidity that has an important role in the expressionof platelet&#xD;
      receptors and in modulating the activity ofproteins like phospholipase C or proteinkinase&#xD;
      C(3). Ithas been shown (4) that changes in membrane fluidityare associated to altered&#xD;
      aggregation/agglutination functionof freshly prepared platelets. The platelet&#xD;
      aggregationresponse is modified by monovalent cations (whichalter fibrinogen binding) and&#xD;
      monovalent anions thatenhance hydroxyl radicals production of platelets inducing platelet&#xD;
      activation (5) Reactive oxygen species(ROS) are involved in integrin aIIbb3 activation(6,7).&#xD;
      Moreover, bursts of ROS are generated in platelets exposed to thrombin (8). We herein report&#xD;
      the case of a patient with acquired plateletfunction defect associated with iron overload as&#xD;
      a consequenceof chronic blood transfusion. Therefore, we emphasizethe necessity of further&#xD;
      studies to confirm directcorrelation between iron overload as a causative agent andplatelets&#xD;
      dysfunction. And we recommend screening forplatelet function in patients receiving chronic&#xD;
      blood transfusionaiming at possible prevention of any lifethreateningbleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most commonly used laboratorymarkers to early characterize platelet functionis the&#xD;
      mean platelet volume (MPV). Increasedplatelet volume mayindicate its greater content&#xD;
      ingranules, showing a platelet activation also betteraggregation and more reactive than the&#xD;
      ordinarysize one. Limited study and the inconsistent resultare available regarding the&#xD;
      platelet function studyin IO complicated condition. Higher MPV wasidentified in heterozygous&#xD;
      beta-thalassemiapatientswith no correlation with cardiovascularrelatedrisks( 9). However, but&#xD;
      in line with this study, adefect in platelet aggregation indicated by ahyporeactivityof&#xD;
      platelet after induction withADP, ristocetin, and collagen was showed in majorthalassemia&#xD;
      children patients&#xD;
