  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of walking capacity is a key objective of the rehabilitation of children with&#xD;
      PC. There are different approaches from physiotherapy to address this need, including walking&#xD;
      on the ground and on treadmill with partial weight support. Currently, there are robotic&#xD;
      technologies adapted to the functional rehabilitation of patients. Assisted gait training&#xD;
      with robotic devices such as the Walkbot allows a longer duration of training, at more&#xD;
      variable speeds, and with a constant gait pattern adapted to the patient. This training,&#xD;
      based on the intensity and repetition of the movement, has beneficial effects on the recovery&#xD;
      and improvement of the patient's postural and locomotor functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some studies that evaluate walking interventions on treadmill with partial weight&#xD;
      support, on the ground and in assisted walking robot in patients with PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no studies conducted that report the effectiveness of interventions&#xD;
      performed with robotic walking training device Walkbot K on PC. However, studies in adults&#xD;
      with Walkbot S, affected with neurological injury, have reported good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assisted gait training with robotic devices such as the Walkbot, based on the intensity and&#xD;
      repetition of the movement, has beneficial effects on the recovery and improvement of the&#xD;
      patient's postural and locomotor functions. However, due to the little evidence that exists,&#xD;
      it is necessary to know the effectiveness of the Walkbot assisted walking robot in these&#xD;
      patients by means of a clinical trial that allows to firmly establish the scope of its&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
