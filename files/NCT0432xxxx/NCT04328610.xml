  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema is the Build-up of Lymph Fluid in the Body's Tissue Causing Chronic, Debilitating&#xD;
      Swelling. This Commonly Occurs as a Result of a Disruption of the Lymphatic System During&#xD;
      Lymph Node Dissection Surgeries. LYMPHA (LYmphatic Microsurgical Preventive Healing Approach)&#xD;
      is an Innovative Microsurgical Technique Where Blocked Lymphatic Vessels Are Drained Into the&#xD;
      Blood Circulation by Surgically Creating a Shunt Between a Lymphatic Channel and a Blood&#xD;
      Vessel Called a Lymphatic-venous Bypass. Recently, LYMPHA Technique Has Been Shown to Prevent&#xD;
      Lymphedema When Performed at the Time of Nodal Dissection. We Propose a Prospective Study&#xD;
      Evaluating the Effectiveness of LYMPHA Technique Using Objective Clinical Protocol.&#xD;

      Consenting patients will have the LYMPHA procedure at the time of planned axillary dissection&#xD;
      surgery for the prevention of upper and extremity lymphedema. The node dissection will be&#xD;
      performed by Dr. Kang while the LYMPHA technique will be performed by the plastic surgeon,&#xD;
      Dr. Kim. The LYMPHA procedure consist of performing LVA at the time of the node dissection.&#xD;
      Patent blue dye will be injected in the volar surface of the upper third of the arm in a&#xD;
      quantity of about 1-2 ml intradermally, subcutaneously, and under muscular fascia into&#xD;
      patient approximately 10 minutes before skin incision. This will allow mapping of the&#xD;
      lymphatic channels for identification for bypass. The node dissection will then be performed&#xD;
      with preservation of the anterior branch of the axillary vein in the axilla. Afferent&#xD;
      lymphatic vessels will be sutured into a branch of the axillary vein distal to a competen&#xD;
      valve. The total duration of the surgery is approximately 3 hours. The LYMPHA technique&#xD;
      accounts for an additional 30 min to the standard 2-2.5 hours allocated to the node&#xD;
      dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-surgery, patients will have baseline limb circumference measurements of both the&#xD;
      surgery-affected and unaffected arms and by lymphoscintigraphy. Patients will be followed up&#xD;
      clinically at every 6 months up to a year. At each follow-up visit, patients will have a&#xD;
      physical examination and their circumference of their limbs taken. Patients will also fill&#xD;
      out a LyQLI, SF-36, DASH administered by the Clinical Research Coordinator pre-and&#xD;
      post-surgery. Each patient will have a total of 1 years of participation time.&#xD;
