  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune anemia (AIA), including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), EVENs' syndrome (ES),&#xD;
      acquired pure red aplastic anemia (PRCA), is a kind of anemia disease mediated by&#xD;
      autoimmunity, which can be primary or secondary to other diseases including autoimmune&#xD;
      disease, malignant tumor, infection, etc. Glucocorticoid is the first-line treatment.&#xD;
      However, the recurrence rate is very high and some patients may not response to steroids, the&#xD;
      latter defined as refractory autoimmune anemia (RAIA). Second-line therapies include&#xD;
      cyclosporine A (CSA), cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, CD20 monoclonal antibody, anti&#xD;
      human lymphocyte immunoglobulin (ATG), and even splenectomy. Cyclosporine A is easy to accept&#xD;
      while some patients may have side effects such as renal function damage, gingival&#xD;
      hyperplasia, hypertension and so on. Other second-line drugs also have many problems, such as&#xD;
      low effective rate, slow onset, expensive price, and large side effects, and some patients do&#xD;
      not response to these treatments. The refractory/relapsed AIA patients have increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, increased opportunities for infections, decreased quality of life, and&#xD;
      even death. At present, there is still no effective treatment for these patients. Our&#xD;
      previous retrospective study showed that sirolimus was effective in cyclosporine refractory&#xD;
      PRCA with an effective rate of 70% and slight side effects. In addition, we used sirolimus in&#xD;
      refractory AIHA and ES, with an effective rate of 60-70%. However, there are still some&#xD;
      non-responsive patients. Recently, it has been reported that all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)&#xD;
      combined with danazol was effective in the treatment of refractory immune thrombocytopenic&#xD;
      purpura (ITP). Therefore, we plans to combine sirolimus and ATRA in the treatment of&#xD;
      refractory AIA to improve the efficacy. Since both sirolimus and ATRA are cheap and have&#xD;
      slight side effects, this combination may reduce the economic burden of patients and reduce&#xD;
      the side effects related to treatment.&#xD;
