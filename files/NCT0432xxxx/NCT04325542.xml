  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a neglected disease with devastating&#xD;
      consequences, particularly in countries with limited resources for the health sector.&#xD;
      Mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) is responsible for around 50 % of the HBV infections in&#xD;
      Tanzania which, in 90 % of the cases, lead to a chronic HBV infection of the child. This&#xD;
      infection rate could be reduced with an active immunization directly after birth which is&#xD;
      recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the Tanzanian national&#xD;
      immunization programme schedules the first Hepatitis B vaccination for the fourth week after&#xD;
      birth which is too late to prevent a perinatal transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in&#xD;
      pregnant women in rural and urban study sites in the region of Mwanza, Tanzania. The blood&#xD;
      from the positive -testing mothers should be further examined for viral load, genotype of the&#xD;
      virus and for liver transaminases in order to conceive a better understanding of the&#xD;
      progression of the infection. Beside the laboratory parameters, risk factors for the&#xD;
      infection should be determined with the use of a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore we would like to assess the number of children who were already infected, during&#xD;
      the intrauterine period or during birth.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, more than 2 billion people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Of these,&#xD;
      240 million are chronic carriers of HBV and are at risk of death from acute fulminant liver&#xD;
      disease, liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) has stated that the prevalence of hepatitis B is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and East&#xD;
      Asia and estimates that between 5-10% of the adult population are chronically infected.&#xD;
      Currently, several drugs have been approved in industrialized countries for treating chronic&#xD;
      HBV infection and these follow established guidelines from professional medical&#xD;
      organizations. Antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection significantly delays the&#xD;
      progression of cirrhosis, reduces the incidence of HCC and improves long-term survival.&#xD;
      However, in many resource-constrained settings, including Tanzania, the implementation of&#xD;
      this treatment has not yet occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of treatment opportunities in resource-constrained settings means that the&#xD;
      prevention of HBV infection is crucial. In countries with high HBV prevalence, most HBV&#xD;
      transmission occurs during childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Tanzania, the prevalence of acute or chronic HBV infection (as defined by a positive&#xD;
      hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg, test) among blood donors or adults in Dar es Salaam,&#xD;
      Tanzania was found to be 8.8% and 6%, respectively. People suffering from chronic HBV have a&#xD;
      lifelong risk of developing complications like liver cirrhosis, liver failure or&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chronic hepatitis B infection is the main cause for HCC in&#xD;
      Tanzania and there is no therapy available. There are no national recommendations or&#xD;
      vaccination program against HBV for HCWs in Tanzania. However, in 2002,Tanzania implemented&#xD;
      the WHO policy of general HBV vaccination for children as part of the extended program on&#xD;
      immunization (known as EPI). According to notified data, a vaccination coverage of 84% among&#xD;
      one year-old children was achieved in 2008 with an immunization schedule of 4, 8, 12 weeks&#xD;
      after birth . Above 60% of the infections are acquired in the early childhood by transmission&#xD;
      from mother to newborn. This early transmission leads to a chronic Hepatitis B infection&#xD;
      among 90% of the infected newborn and, therefore, a vaccination at the earliest 4 weeks after&#xD;
      birth might be too late to prevent MTCT. As a matter of fact, in Tanzania, we can estimate&#xD;
      1.4 million chronic Hepatitis B infections through mother-to- child transmission in early&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two interventions that could prevent MTCT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementation of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIg) to the child directly after birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Active immunization against HBV within 24 hours after birth. The first intervention is&#xD;
           very expensive (100€/per child) and is therefore not sustainable for the Tanzanian&#xD;
           health system. The second intervention is cheaper and recommended by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV infection is a neglected disease in low income countries and has been rarely studied in&#xD;
      Tanzania. One of the main ways of infection is MTCT and there are several ideas on how to&#xD;
      reduce the transmission. Antiviral drugs for infected pregnant women, implementation of HBIg&#xD;
      directly after birth or active immunization within 24 hours after birth are the most popular&#xD;
      approaches. Unfortunately, none of these is yet implemented in Tanzania due to several&#xD;
      reasons. The cost of all the interventions is one argument against their implementation&#xD;
      despite the fact that prevention of the infection was proven more cost efficient rather than&#xD;
      facing the long-term costs of people suffering from the disease. Another problem is the&#xD;
      insufficient knowledge about this topic in the Tanzanian context. More studies with a larger&#xD;
      population are necessary to show the importance of an early intervention and the problem&#xD;
      resulting from a vaccination happening too late for the cases of MTCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each avoided infection is a benefit for the whole population, as there is a reduced&#xD;
      possibility for other children or family members to get infected. To identify the infants at&#xD;
      risk a screening program is needed. Therefore, rapid HBsAg tests should be offered for every&#xD;
      pregnant woman at public health facilities. With better information, the awareness about the&#xD;
      disease improves and the number of fully vaccinated children rises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study we would like to determine the prevalence of HBsAg in pregnant women attending&#xD;
      the antenatal clinic in a tertiary hospital, a regional hospital or a district hospital in&#xD;
      Tanzania. The study population should be identified with an HBsAg rapid test at the&#xD;
      department of gynaecology. Blood will be taken from the mothers with positive HBsAg rapid&#xD;
      test and from the cord blood of their children. Furthermore, we want to assess the risk&#xD;
      factors that might lead to an increased risk of hepatitis B infection. Therefore, our&#xD;
      research assistants will inquire among the participants about several risk factors. To give&#xD;
      some benefit to the patient, we will vaccinate the child of HBsAg positive mothers within 24&#xD;
      hours after birth with an active immunization which is proven to reduce the possibility of&#xD;
      MCTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laboratory examination of the blood will give us more details about the serology,&#xD;
      genotype and viral load of the HBV infection. This might show us the relation between the&#xD;
      risk factors and possible intrauterine HBV transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Tanzania, there is not enough data on prevalence, risk factors, viral load and genotypes&#xD;
      of HBV. This study will give additional data on intrauterine infection of the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
      antigen (HBsAg) in women attending antenatal clinic in four different study sites in the&#xD;
      region of Mwanza, Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the viral load and genotype of HBV infection in pregnant woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the risk factors associated with HBV infections in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the prevalence of intrauterine infection by positive HBV PCR of cord blood&#xD;
           of the children of HBsAg positive mothers attending BMC, Seka Toure or Sengerema&#xD;
           hospital for delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the influence of HBV genotypes, viral load and HBeAg status of the mother&#xD;
           attending BMC for delivery on the probability of the transmission to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in three different study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in&#xD;
      Mwanza, Tanzania. The department has every year 6000 deliveries, for the second part of the&#xD;
      study we choose only the HBsAg positive women diagnosed with a rapid test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second sites will be the Mwanza regional hospital Seka Toure and the third will be the&#xD;
      district hospital in Sengerema. About 500 woman will be tested in BMC and 250 women will be&#xD;
      tested on each other study site, Altogether 1000 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborating Institutions are the BMC, and the Catholic University of Health and Allied&#xD;
      Sciences (CUHAS) in Mwanza, Tanzania, the division of Medical Virology, Faculty of Medicine &amp;&#xD;
      Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University and NHLS Tygerberg, Cape Town, South Africa, the&#xD;
      Medical Mission Institute and the University of Würzburg/Institute of Virology and&#xD;
      Immunobiology, Würzburg, Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a cross-sectional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patient groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women aged 18 years and above attending the antenatal clinics at Bugando Medical&#xD;
      Center, regional hospital Seka Toure and district hospital in Sengerema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size For a cross-sectional study sample size was calculated with an expected&#xD;
      prevalence of 3,5 % based on previous studies (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of significance = 5%, Power = 80%, Type of test = cross-sectional Formula of&#xD;
      calculating sample size is (38) n = [Z1-α/2²p(1-p)]/d²&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning a study of 1000 woman. If the true prevalence is 3.5 % we will need to study&#xD;
      at least 51.9 patients to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the exposure rates for&#xD;
      case and controls are equal with probability (power) 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and duration To diagnose the hepatitis B positive mothers, a finger prick&#xD;
      test will be conducted with pregnant women to assess whether there is HBsAg or not. If the&#xD;
      test is positive, 12 ml of EDTA-blood will be taken (3 times 4 ml)), centrifuged and plasma&#xD;
      will be stored at -20°C for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second part of the study, cord blood of children born at the BMC 1.5 ml will be&#xD;
      collected after birth and stored at -20°C for further analysis. After 24 months, another&#xD;
      blood sample will be taken and stored at -20°C for further analysis. The blood from all HBsAg&#xD;
      positive mothers will be analysed including serology for Hepatitis B (HBsAg, HBeAg), HBV-DNA&#xD;
      PCR and liver transaminases for the women from the primary health care clinics. The blood&#xD;
      from the children will be analysed with HBV-DNA PCR. Taking cord blood and proceeding it&#xD;
      immediately after birth will be logistical only possible in BMC so that these analyses will&#xD;
      be done in the children born at the BMC and not of the other study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire and blood samples will be labelled with the study number only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection A questionnaire will used to collect information concerning the risk factors&#xD;
      information, including HIV status, age, residence, marital status, level of education,&#xD;
      occupation, parity and gravity, history of life-time sexual partners, age at first sexual&#xD;
      contact, history of risk factors (blood transfusion, operation, drug use, iv injection), HBV&#xD;
      vaccination, history of STIs, condom use, genital circumcision, sharing toothbrush or razors&#xD;
      and history of jaundice in the family or for themselves (Case report form). The patients'&#xD;
      data will be collected at the time of the enrolment. CRF forms will be supplied. These forms&#xD;
      must be printed legibly. A copy will remain at the investigator's files. CRF and all original&#xD;
      data should be readily available for review during scheduled monitoring visits. For patient&#xD;
      identification, all patients included in the study will have their hospital record number,&#xD;
      their date of birth and a patient allocation number entered chronologically into the study&#xD;
      file. Copies of all pertinent information will be retained by the investigator for a period&#xD;
      of at least 10 years after study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Analyses Analysis of the blood On the day of enrolment, a point-of-care Hepatitis&#xD;
      B surface antibody tests will be performed. The test (Nal Diagnostics) is CE certified.&#xD;
      According to data of the manufacturer, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the test are&#xD;
      &gt; 99% with a cut off value of m10 IU anti-HBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be frozen at -20°C and shipped for further analysis after enrolment is&#xD;
      completed. In the Division of Medical Virology, University of Stellenbosch, the following&#xD;
      tests will be carried out for all samples using ELISA-techniques for serological testing and&#xD;
      PCR for viral load measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B - surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B - surface antibody (anti-HBs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B - core antibodies (anti-HBc)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test panel will allow differentiation between naturally-acquired infection, antibodies&#xD;
      due to vaccination and chronic hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases of chronic hepatitis B will undergo further testing for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B e- antigen (HBeAg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B e- antibodies (anti-HBe)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HBV DNA PCR, the DNA will be isolated from the plasma by the column extraction method and&#xD;
      PCR amplification will be carried out. A positive PCR reaction will be sequenced with the&#xD;
      ABI-Prism-310-Genetic-Analyzer-System. Sequences will be submitted to GenBank. With these&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatitis B genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be determined. To detect the amount of liver transaminases in the plasma, it will be&#xD;
      analysed with spectrophotometric measurements for&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/GOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/GPT) Statistical Analysis The entries of the Questionnaire&#xD;
           will be transferred to an EXCEL Sheet by double entry. The second entry will be&#xD;
           completed timely independently from the first entry and will be compared with the first&#xD;
           entry. P &lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically different. The 95% confidence&#xD;
           intervals (CI) will be calculated using SPSS and GraphPad Prism Software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical committee/institutional review board The final approved&#xD;
      protocol including the informed consent form will be submitted for Ethical Clearance to the&#xD;
      joint Bugando Medical Centre/Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences (BMC/CUHAS)&#xD;
      Ethics and Review Committee. The investigator will agree to make required progress reports to&#xD;
      the Ethics and Review committee, as well as report any serious adverse events,&#xD;
      life-threatening problems or deaths. The Ethics Committee/ must be informed by the&#xD;
      investigator of the termination of the study. Permission will be sought from the relevant&#xD;
      authorities of the study sites clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient informed consent Prior to inclusion into the study, the patient will be informed of&#xD;
      the nature of the study and will be given pertinent information as to the intended purpose,&#xD;
      possible benefits, and possible adverse experiences. The procedure and possible hazards to&#xD;
      which the patient is exposed will be explained. An informed consent statement will then be&#xD;
      read and signed by the patient, a witness, and the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible benefits for the patients Directly after birth, vaccination is one of the most&#xD;
      effective methods to reduce the Hepatitis B transmission from the infected mother to her&#xD;
      child. Our study will give all the pregnant women the opportunity to do a rapid test free of&#xD;
      any costs. If it is positive, the mother can protect the new-born child from HBV infection&#xD;
      via active immunization (in case she will give birth at the study site. and the devastating&#xD;
      consequences with a free of cost follow-up screening at the BMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the women themselves cannot get any treatment for their disease, the diagnosis&#xD;
      may increase their awareness of this infection and possibly contribute to the reduction of&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child born at the study site gets the benefit of an extra protection with the vaccination&#xD;
      directly after birth.&#xD;
