  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of Remote Ischemic Conditioning(RIC) as&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy for Parkinson's Disease(PD). Sixty patients will be randomized into 2groups:&#xD;
      RIC group receiving Remote Ischemic Conditioning except conventional therapy（n=30）and control&#xD;
      group with conventional therapy (n=30).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is a procedure whereby ischaemia is induced to a limb for&#xD;
      short periods of time by inflating pressure cuffs around arms to above systolic pressures&#xD;
      (mmHg). This procedure induce neurohormonal, systemic or vascular changes in the body. Such&#xD;
      changes often result in improved collateralisation of blood supply to various areas of the&#xD;
      body, as well as improved efficiencies of cellular metabolism. RIC has been shown to improve&#xD;
      outcomes in patients with heart attacks, strokes, but is not investigated for PD. We argue&#xD;
      that RIC may exert neuroprotective effect on PD due to its multiple mechanisms. The aim of&#xD;
      the study is to evaluate the impact of RIC on long term outcomes in patients with PD.&#xD;

    <description>The Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale Part Ⅲ is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson´s disease. Each of the 27 sub-items in the UPDRS III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total scores therefore ranges from 0 (Best score possible) to 108 (Worst score possible).</description>

    <description>5 cycles of 5 minutes of upper limb ischaemia followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion. This will be delivered using a manual sphygmomanometer applied to the upper arm and activated to go through 5 such cycles automatically. The blood pressure cuff in the active treatment arm will inflate to 200 mmHg. RIC will be completed 1-2 times per day for six months.</description>
