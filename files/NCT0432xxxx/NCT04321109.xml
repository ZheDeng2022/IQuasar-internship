      Seven Patients who need implants to replace non-restorable teeth in the esthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group (1): Seven extraction sockets that received the collagen matrix (Collagen&#xD;
      cone) for alveolar ridge preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison Group (2): Seven extraction sockets that were treated with mineralized&#xD;
      cortico-cancellous bone allograft for alveolar ridge preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Alveolar ridge preservation both in height and in width to improve implant success rate&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The height of alveolar ridge was assessed clinically using a periodontal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The width of the alveolar ridge was measured after three months after extraction&#xD;
                using a caliper clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Changes in the width and height of alveolar bone were evaluated in merged axial and&#xD;
                sagittal views using the I-CAT superimposition system (CBCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
                2- Evaluation of newly formed bone quality was performed by histological&#xD;
                examination and histomorphometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3- Immuno-histochemical staining was done using polyclonal antibody to detect&#xD;
                (BMP-2) marker of bone formation&#xD;

      The aim of the present study was to compare three months post-extraction augmented ridge&#xD;
      using collagen matrix versus mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft. This comparison&#xD;
      was done clinically, histologically, immunohisto-chemically and radiologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Clinical parameters included; vertical bone height and bone width that were recorded at&#xD;
      baseline and at three months after extraction. Moreover, histomorphometric parameters&#xD;
      included; area fraction of osteoid and mature bone three months after extraction by&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis using polyclonal antibody to detect&#xD;
      BMP-2 marker of bone formation. Radiographic parameters included superimposition of baseline&#xD;
      CBCT, three months after extraction and another one six months after loading with subsequent&#xD;
      measurement of bone height, bone width and bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A core biopsy was taken three months after tooth extraction which has undergone&#xD;
      histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analysis; implant placement was also done at the&#xD;
      same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, it was found that the mean bone height decreased with a higher percent&#xD;
      in collagen matrix group than mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft group with a non&#xD;
      significant difference between both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study showed that the mean bone width decreased more in collagen matrix&#xD;
      group than mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft group with a non significant&#xD;
      difference between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, in the present study, Histomorphometric analysis revealed new bone trabeculae&#xD;
      formation with osteoblastic rimming, the surrounding fibrous tissue is cellular and remnants&#xD;
      of the graft materials was detected , with no marked difference in the amount of newly formed&#xD;
      bone between two groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding immunohistochemical analysis in both groups, the osteoblasts in the fibrous tissue&#xD;
      and osteocytes in newly formed bone are showing nuclear staining, with increasing area of&#xD;
      immunopositive cells in mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographically, CBCT superimposition revealed that a greater percent decrease in bone&#xD;
      height was denoted in collagen matrix than mineralized cortico-cancellous bone allograft&#xD;
      group with a significant difference between both groups after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly bone width showed a higher decrease in mineralized cortico-cancellous bone&#xD;
      allograft group than Collagen matrix group with a non significant difference between both&#xD;
      groups after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, bone density showed a greater decrease in Collagen matrix group than mineralized&#xD;
      cortico-cancellous bone allograft group with a non significant difference after 3 months but&#xD;
      significant difference was found after 6 months between both groups.&#xD;
