  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators compared the surgical outcomes according to the type of&#xD;
      antibiotics before surgery in patients who did not have evidence of systemic infection during&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study was to determine the type of preoperative antibiotics in&#xD;
      patients who were scheduled for cholecystectomy, because of the mild (grade I) or moderate&#xD;
      (grade 2) acute inflammatory gallbladder disease without gallbladder perforation. The&#xD;
      investigators compared the incidence of postoperative complications according to the types of&#xD;
      preoperative antibiotics(the first-generation vs second-generation cephalosporin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purpose of the study was to confirm the clinical efficacy of first-generation&#xD;
      cephalosporins following the use of empirical antibiotics. And the investigators compare with&#xD;
      postoperative pain, postoperative hospital stay, re-hospitalization, and need for additional&#xD;
      treatment. In addition, the investigators compare the postoperative complications, such as&#xD;
      atelectasis and postoperative ileus.&#xD;

      1. Background In the case of acute cholecystitis, in which acute inflammation was&#xD;
           manifested in patients with gallstones and was accompanied by pain and fever,&#xD;
           cholecystectomy through surgery was the standard treatment, and the use of empirical&#xD;
           antibiotics to treat inflammation and prevent exacerbation until surgery was performed&#xD;
           It was essential. However, as to which antibiotics were used as empirical antibiotics&#xD;
           before cholecystectomy among various types of antibiotics, a variety of first-generation&#xD;
           cephalosporins or second-generation cephalosporins had been selected and used depending&#xD;
           on the existing practice or a physician's supervision. There was insufficient objective&#xD;
           research and rationale for the selection of these empirical antibiotics. In addition,&#xD;
           the use of high-grade antibiotics that are not required (eg, second-generation&#xD;
           cephalosporins) might lead to prolonged hospital stays, wasted medical resources,&#xD;
           increased medical expenses, and the occurrence of multi-drug resistant bacteria. In&#xD;
           fact, the second-generation cephalosporin antibiotics had a price that was about two to&#xD;
           four times higher depending on the product than the first-generation cephalosporin&#xD;
           antibiotics. Therefore, in the use of empirical antibiotics before surgery for acute&#xD;
           inflammatory gallbladder disease, if the same anti-inflammatory effect and postoperative&#xD;
           results could be obtained with the first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics, there was&#xD;
           no need to use expensive high-grade antibiotics required as empirical antibiotics before&#xD;
           surgery. Moreover, side effects which could caused by high-grade antibiotics would be&#xD;
           prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, in this study, the investigators tried to determine the effective and&#xD;
           rational type of empirical antibiotics through random comparison experiments of two&#xD;
           groups of patients according to the type of empirical antibiotics used in laparoscopic&#xD;
           surgery in patients with acute cholecystitis without evidence of systemic infection. In&#xD;
           addition, a double-blind prospective randomized control study comparing the&#xD;
           first-generation and second-generation cephalosporin antibiotics commonly used in&#xD;
           practice in clinical practice had not been published in Korea, and its clinical&#xD;
           usefulness was expected to be great.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Code name of clinical trial drug or medical device or generic name of main ingredient,&#xD;
           raw material drug (raw material in case of medical device) and its quantity, formulation&#xD;
           (form / structure / number in case of medical device), etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test drug ; Cefazolin inj., 1 g, Cefazolin sodium, white crystal, vial injection with&#xD;
           crystalline powder or lump&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. control drug ; Shincef inj., 750mg, Cefuroxime sodium, colorless transparent vial&#xD;
           injection with light yellow powder&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Target disease Acute cholecystitis without evidence of gallbladder perforation among mild&#xD;
      (Grade I) and severe (Grade II) classification of acute cholecystitis according to Tokyo&#xD;
      guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Subject selection criteria, exclusion criteria, number of target subjects and their&#xD;
      rationale &lt;Inclusion criteria&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. among patients with mild acute cholecystitis (grade I by Tokyo guidelines) or moderate&#xD;
           acute cholecystitis without evidence of gallbladder perforation(grade II)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. cholecystitis with a thickness of 4 mm or more on gallbladder in preoperative imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gallbladder with surrounding organs due to gallbladder inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients over 19 years of age &lt;Exclusion criteria&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) patients with elective gallbladder surgery (chronic cholecystitis) 2) gallbladder disease&#xD;
      not inflammatory disease (GB cancer, GB polyp) 3) pregnant women, patients under 18 years of&#xD;
      age, over 70 years of age 4) patients with simultaneous surgery due to other organ diseases&#xD;
      5) immunosuppressed patients; liver transplant patients, kidney transplant patients, acquired&#xD;
      immunodeficiency syndrome patients 6) patients with hemorrhagic tendency, or with hematologic&#xD;
      diseases 7) Patients who underwent percutaneous cholecystectomy (PTGBD) 8) Patients with&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis who had gallbladder perforation, grade II or III by Tokyo guidelines 9)&#xD;
      Drain tube is required during surgery (eg. if delayed biliary leakage was concerned, hepatic&#xD;
      duct injury was suspected or cystic duct ligation was incomplete during operation.)&#xD;
      &lt;Calculation and basis of the number of target subjects&gt; In the previous studies, infectious&#xD;
      complications after laparoscopic surgery for acute inflammatory gallbladder disease have been&#xD;
      reported as 18.5%. The investigators designed a non-inferiority test (non-inferiority limit&#xD;
      of 13%) assuming postoperative infectious complication of 18.5% confidence level of 95%, and&#xD;
      assigned 167 to each group considering the dropout rate of 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Random allocation schedule and operation Randomization was performed using block&#xD;
      randomization without stratification, and a block size of 2, 4 or 6 was applied to complete&#xD;
      the randomization table to maintain unpredictability, which was the basic principle of&#xD;
      randomization. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment bags with random assignment numbers and assigned groups were made of opaque&#xD;
      material so that they could be blinded and remain sealed until random assignment was&#xD;
      performed for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The person in charge of the clinical trial or the person in charge of the clinical trial&#xD;
      finally checked the exclusion criteria and, if it was a suitable subject, a random number was&#xD;
      assigned and stored in the allocation bag. Thereafter, the management pharmacist receives the&#xD;
      assignment bag with the assignment number, releases the seal of the assignment bag, and&#xD;
      prescribes antibiotics according to the administration group assigned to the subject&#xD;
      according to each random assignment number. Afterwards, the managed pharmacist brought the&#xD;
      antibiotics according to the newly developed drug code for the clinical trial in accordance&#xD;
      with the [Medical Clinical Trial Management Standards (related to Article 30, Paragraph 1)],&#xD;
      and then administered to the patient. The management pharmacist should record the release&#xD;
      information (release date and releaser) immediately after the release of the assignment bag&#xD;
      which the random assignment enveloped, when it had already been released once, it could not&#xD;
      reassign the randomization code to other subjects even if the subject withdraws consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Clinical trial period clinical trial approval date-2021-04-30&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Clinical trial method (administration / dosage, administration / use method,&#xD;
      administration / use period, combination therapy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Research Design Prospective randomized controlled trial in two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe what treatment is performed for the experimental group / control group A.&#xD;
           Clinical trial flow&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before the patient's surgery, hematology, blood chemistry, blood coagulation, urine,&#xD;
           Chest X-ray, EKG, and Abdomen CT were performed in accordance with current clinical&#xD;
           practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Select the patient group that met the diagnostic criteria according to the test results&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Select a random patient group to determine the type of empirical antibiotic to use&#xD;
           before surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For each selected group, intravenous antibiotics (Cefazolin inj., 1 g, Cefazolin sodium&#xD;
           versus. Shincef inj., 750 mg, Cefuroxime sodium) were used as before and during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The clinical trial manager or the clinical trial manager finally checked the criteria&#xD;
           for selection exclusion and, if it was a suitable subject, a random number was assigned&#xD;
           and stored in the allocation bag. Thereafter, the management pharmacist received the&#xD;
           assignment bag with the assignment number, released the seal of the assignment bag, and&#xD;
           prescribed antibiotics according to the administration group assigned to the subject&#xD;
           according to each random assignment number. Afterwards, the managed pharmacist brought&#xD;
           the antibiotics according to the newly developed drug code for the clinical trial in&#xD;
           accordance with the [Medical Clinical Trial Management Standards (related to Article 30,&#xD;
           Paragraph 1)], and then administered to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After surgery, both groups were discharged through the same recovery process after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. On the 1st day after surgery, hematology, blood chemistry, urine, blood clotting, and&#xD;
           chest x-rays were performed. (Inspection and treatment were performed according to the&#xD;
           current clinical pathway of gallbladder surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If there are no specifics, a fluid diet was performed starting from lunch on the first&#xD;
           day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If there were no specifics, patient would be discharged on the second day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Stability and effectiveness were monitored during hospitalization and after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Method of operation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgery was started under general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A trocar of 10 mm was placed on the navel, 5 mm under the blade, and 5 mm trocar was&#xD;
           placed on the right upper abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pneumoperitoneum was performed using CO2 gas in the abdominal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Double pressure through CO2 gas was maintained at 12mmHg / and 2L / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dissection started from Calot's triangle and the operation was performed by retrograde&#xD;
           cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The cystic duct was ligated with a 10mm clip and the cystic artery was ligated with&#xD;
                a 10mm clip as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the cystic duct was unstablely ligated, ligation was performed through an&#xD;
                endoloop.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After ligation, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Washed the surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The excised gallbladder was placed in a laparoscopic pocket and extracted through the&#xD;
           umbilicus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The trocar was removed, the skin was sutured, and the operation was completed. C.&#xD;
           Discharge Principle&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When hematologically stable and vital signs were stable&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. When the patient's condition was stable by proceeding to the normal diet&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. characteristics of observational and clinical test &lt;Observation test&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Medical history investigation Before entering the clinical trial, checked the following&#xD;
      items through interviews, chart and questions about the subject's background (demographic&#xD;
      information), medical history, etc., and recorded them in the record.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Background investigation: Subject's initials, date of birth, sex, feasibility of&#xD;
           pregnancy, pregnancy, lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History history: History of other diseases 2) Physical examination, vital signs&#xD;
           examination Investigators checked whether the body organs were normal or abnormal&#xD;
           through medical examination and examination and any significant findings found during&#xD;
           the examination should be recorded in the physical examination column of the record&#xD;
           sheet, and confirmed to be suitable for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, the pain level was measured by questioning the patient himself using the VAS&#xD;
      score, and the amount of analgesics (injection drugs; tramadol and oral drugs; ircodon)&#xD;
      administered after surgery to the patient was recorded through medication records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was performed during the hospitalization after decision to perform cholecystectomy. Blood&#xD;
      sampling for the subjects was performed aseptically. Investigators recorded the test results,&#xD;
      determined whether they were normal or abnormal, and record the opinions of researchers&#xD;
      regarding abnormal values. Clinical tests included :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hematology tests: Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, MCV, MCH, MCHC, Platelet, WBC &amp; Differential&#xD;
           count, ESR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood coagulation test: PT INR, aPTT, BT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood chemistry test: SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, γ-GTP, bilirubin&#xD;
           (total / direct), fasting plasma glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride,&#xD;

           Urobilinogen, Bilirubin, Microscopy (RBC, WBC) 4) Imaging medical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Before surgery, chest X-ray and electrocardiography were performed to evaluate whether&#xD;
           surgery was possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging studies such as CT, Sonogram, and MRCP were conducted. 5) Postoperative hospital&#xD;
           stay The day after surgery, hematology, blood chemistry, urine, blood clotting, Chest&#xD;
           x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6) Check for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical site infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Confirmation at every patient visit. Troca insertion site was defined as&#xD;
                superficial surgical site infection if there was redness, heat sensation and&#xD;
                abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If there was fluid retention and abscess around the surgical site in the abdominal&#xD;
                cavity, it was defined as deep surgical site infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distant infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Respiratory, urinary system infections and bacteremia or lymphangitis 7) Check for&#xD;
                leakage of bile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Groups who had drainage catheter would be checked through the drainage pattern. In the&#xD;
           group without drainage catheter, after surgery, if there is epigastric pain,&#xD;
           indigestion, fever, and jaundice, a selective medical imaging test (CT, sonogram, MRCP)&#xD;
           was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8) Surgery time, bleeding amount were described. 9) Postoperative complications (things&#xD;
           other than those described above) were described.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Predicted side effects and precautions&#xD;
&#xD;
           1) Side effects that might occur in the experimental group (the first-generation&#xD;
           cephalosporin use group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound infections and deep infections : Since antibiotics were used, the possibility was&#xD;
           very low.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of antibiotics (allergic reaction) 2) Side effects that could be occurred&#xD;
           in the control group (2nd generation cephalosporin use group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension of the period of stay&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased hospitalization costs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase of multi-drug resistant bacteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of antibiotics (allergic reaction) (In the event of side effects, medical&#xD;
           judgment was used to actively select a therapeutic method.)&#xD;
&#xD;
           10. Stop or drop the test Dosing and testing should be discontinued if any of the&#xD;
           following occurs, and the reasons for discontinuation and findings should be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. After surgery, when a side effect that was life-threatening, the investigator&#xD;
                determined that it was necessary to stop&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. When the patient refused or withdrew consent after starting the test&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If the patient was inadequate after starting the test&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. After the start of the test, if patient had received treatment that might affect&#xD;
                the course of treatment, such as other combination drugs and herbal treatments,&#xD;
                without the permission of the test manager&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. After the start of the test, it was judged that it was impossible to conduct&#xD;
                inspection or investigation due to the circumstances&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. After surgery, when surgery was required due to a disease of another organ not&#xD;
                related to gallbladder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           11. Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Analysis of validity variables A. Analysis of primary efficacy variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  During the postoperative hospital stay, the incidence of wound infection and&#xD;
                     deep infection rates in the group using the first-generation cephalosporin and&#xD;
                     the second-generation cephalosporin as an empirical antibiotic before surgery&#xD;
                     was determined by the student's t-test or according to the satisfaction of the&#xD;
                     normal distribution assumption. Test using wilcoxn's rank sum test, and&#xD;
                     present the descriptive statistics (average, standard deviation, median,&#xD;
                     minimum, and maximum). Also, the difference in the incidence of infection&#xD;
                     between the two groups (test group-control group) was presented as the mean&#xD;
                     and 95% confidence interval, and if it was less than the non-inferiority limit&#xD;
                     of 13%, the group using the first-generation cephalosporin antibiotics was the&#xD;
                     second-generation cephalosporin. It was not inferior to the group using&#xD;
                     antibiotics. That was, it would decide that it was not inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
                B. Complications after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Complications will be defined and analyzed through researchers' experience and&#xD;

                                    antiemetic after 24 hours of surgery, or if patient had vomited&#xD;
                                    even once.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                      -  Sustained shoulder pain after surgery: If patient&#xD;
                                         complained of a stiff shoulder until the outpatient&#xD;

&#xD;
                                         ⑥ Bleeding after surgery: When the patient's vital signs&#xD;
                                         change or there was a decrease in Hb 2.0 or higher on the&#xD;
                                         hemoglobin test the day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                         ⑦ Abscess in the abdominal cavity after surgery: When an&#xD;
                                         abscess in the abdominal cavity was confirmed by image&#xD;
                                         examination (ultrasound, CT, etc.) accompanied by fever&#xD;
                                         and pain in the physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                         ⑧ Persistent bowel obstruction: If the meal could not be&#xD;
                                         started even after 2 days of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analysis of secondary efficacy variables In the case of categorical variables for&#xD;
                the length of stay, surgical time, and complication data obtained as secondary&#xD;
                endpoints, n (%) was presented, and the ratio difference between the two groups was&#xD;
                tested using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. In addition, for continuous&#xD;
                variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values were&#xD;
                presented, and the normality test was performed to test with Student's t-test for&#xD;
                normal distribution, and for the non-normal distribution, Wilcoxon rank-sum test&#xD;
                The difference between the two groups would be tested. All statistical analysis&#xD;
                would use SPSS version 21.0, and it would be judged that it was statistically&#xD;
                significant below the significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Analysis target group&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. intention to treat analysis group Randomization would be performed only if the&#xD;
                selection criteria described above were met, and all randomized subjects would be&#xD;
                included in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. per protocol analysis group The Per protocol analysis group was defined as a&#xD;
                patient who had undergone randomization and had undergone chest imaging the next&#xD;
                day after surgery, and whose pain had been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4) How to deal with missing values This study was a prospective study, and it was&#xD;
           expected that there would be no missing values of the main or secondary endpoints during&#xD;
           the experiment. However, if a missing value occurred, the missing value was substituted&#xD;
           with the average value.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5) How to deal with compliance Since the intervention applied to this study was an&#xD;
           intervention performed during surgery while the patient had general anesthesia, there&#xD;
           would be no difference in treatment compliance. In addition, postoperative thoracic&#xD;
           imaging and pain assessment were also included in the clinical pathway for laparoscopic&#xD;
           cholecystectomy, so there was no difference in treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           12. Safety evaluation of side effects and reporting method In the event of adverse&#xD;
           reactions and adverse reactions after surgery, trained the subject to report to the&#xD;
           researcher, checked and recorded the occurrence of adverse reactions at each visit,&#xD;
           symptoms, appearance time, duration, severity of adverse reactions, and causal&#xD;
           relationship with the test drug Record in the report. In the event of a serious adverse&#xD;
           event or unexpected problem, the responsible researcher should report it to the clinical&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           13. Compensation Protocol of victim Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was a safe operation&#xD;
           with a very low risk of surgery. Also, there are basically no additional risks&#xD;
           accompanying the study. Antibiotics were drugs that had been used before, so there are&#xD;
           no additional complications beyond the known complications. If patient got injury or&#xD;
           illness by participating in this study, medical treatment would be provided. In order to&#xD;
           receive medical treatment related to the clinical symptoms or signs, investigators would&#xD;
           make a quick diagnosis and receive treatment when needed through consultation.&#xD;
