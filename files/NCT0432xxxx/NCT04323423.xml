  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Older adults spend the majority of their time in sedentary behaviours (SB). High&#xD;
      amounts of SB have been correlated with reduced cognitive performance. Long periods of time&#xD;
      spent sitting results in excessive glycemic variability, potentially contributing to&#xD;
      cognitive decline. Reducing/replacing SB with short intermittent bouts of light physical&#xD;
      activity have shown positive effects on glycemic variability. Thus, interrupting prolonged&#xD;
      sitting with bouts of light physical activity may regulate blood glucose and thus mitigate&#xD;
      cognitive decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study intends to investigate the appropriate interval frequency of&#xD;
      post-prandial SB reduction, by light physical activity needed to optimize total and&#xD;
      incremental area under the curve for glucose response in overweight older adults at risk for&#xD;
      glucose intolerance with mild cognitive impairment in both lab and free-living environments.&#xD;
      Second, this study aims to investigate the acute impact of reducing SB on glycemic&#xD;
      variability and its relationship with cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: First, there will be a dose-dependent response of more frequent interruptions of&#xD;
      SB (more frequent intervals of light physical activity) with better glycemic control. Second,&#xD;
      reducing SB will result in less glycemic variability, which will translate into better levels&#xD;
      of cognitive performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      differential effects of the experimental conditions on the selected outcomes.&#xD;

      This study will be a randomized crossover trial and reported in accordance with CONSORT&#xD;
      guidelines. The study will involve a total of three seven-day conditions (2 experimental and&#xD;
      1 control) with a three-week washout period in-between to minimize practice effects for a&#xD;
      total intervention period of nine weeks (see figure 1). Each condition will consist of one&#xD;
      day supervised in the laboratory followed by six at-home days, following lab protocol as&#xD;
      closely as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be referred to the study by their physician. Interested participants will&#xD;
      be asked to contact the researcher by email or phone call. Interested Participants will be&#xD;
      invited into the lab for a familiarization session. They will be instructed to avoid&#xD;
      caffeine, alcohol and MVPA for 48 hours prior to this session. During this session the&#xD;
      following information will be obtained;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height using a stadiometer and weight using a standard beam scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics questionnaire (education, ethnicity, family background, comorbidities)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PARQ+) (Bredin, Gledhill, Jamnik, &amp;&#xD;
           Warburton, 2013)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting blood pressure- will be measured once on each arm and then twice on the left arm&#xD;
           with an automated BP monitor The participants will be educated/familiarized on the&#xD;
           following;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive assessments - Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fitting with an inclinometer (activPAL4)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be visited at their home ~72hrs prior to each condition to be fitted with&#xD;
      the CGM and ActivPal. They will also be instructed to avoid caffeine, alcohol and MVPA for 48&#xD;
      hours prior to each of the three conditions. Dinner will be consumed between 7:00 and 9:00&#xD;
      pm, allowing for a 10 hour fast prior to the experimental condition the next morning. All&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to arrive at the laboratory (with minimal activity during&#xD;
      commute) at approximately 7:00 am. Upon arrival, participants will be asked to use the&#xD;
      washroom and then rest for 30 minutes preceding a blood pressure measurement and first&#xD;
      cognitive assessment. The participants will undergo the CANTAB cognitive assessments (at&#xD;
      ~7:30 am) before meal consumption. A standardized breakfast meal will be consumed at 8:00 am,&#xD;
      followed by lunch at 12:00 pm and dinner at 5:00 pm. Participants will be allotted 20 minutes&#xD;
      for full meal consumption. The CANTAB cognitive assessments will then be re-administered at&#xD;
      approximately 7:30 pm. Participants will be supervised throughout the conditions to ensure&#xD;
      adherence to the protocols and will be permitted to watch DVDs, read books, magazines,&#xD;
      newspapers, talk and/or work on a laptop computer. However, what they do during the first&#xD;
      condition will be documented and then replicated for the remaining experimental conditions.&#xD;
      Intensity of the bout intervals will be kept to an RPE of 6-9 using the Borg RPE scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the 12- hour laboratory component is complete, participants will be sent home (still&#xD;
      wearing the CGM and activPAL) with the intension of replicating the laboratory-based protocol&#xD;
      after each meal in their own free-living environment. Participants will track their mealtimes&#xD;
      by sending photos to the researcher before consumption during the 6 at home days. The&#xD;
      researcher will then go to the participants house on the last day (day 7) of each condition&#xD;
      to re-administer the CANTAB cognitive assessments and collect the CGM, and activPal. There&#xD;
      will then be a 3-week washout period, followed by replication of protocol for the remaining&#xD;
      two conditions.&#xD;

    <description>CANTAB will be used to measure change in cognitive function. This is a computerized battery of neuropsychological tests utilizing touch sensitive screen technology that has been shown to be highly sensitive and a precise measure of cognitive function, correlated to neural networks (CANTAB, 2017). The following three cognitive domains were selected for testing; attention and psychomotor function (Motor Screening Task (MOT) and Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP)), memory (Delayed Matching to Sample (DMS)) and executive function (Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift (IED))</description>
