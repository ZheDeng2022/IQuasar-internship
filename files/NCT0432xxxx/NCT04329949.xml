  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR), in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treated with relacorilant in combination with&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel, according to blinded independent central review.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relacorilant is a small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The goals of&#xD;
      this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of relacorilant in&#xD;
      combination with nab-paclitaxel in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are those with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) who have&#xD;
      received at least 2 prior lines of therapy for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in any&#xD;
      setting, including at least 1 prior gemcitabine-based therapy and at least 1 prior&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment until progressive disease (PD) (per RECIST v1.1) as&#xD;
      determined by the Investigator, experiencing unmanageable toxicity, or until other treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria are met. All patients will be followed for documentation of disease&#xD;
      progression and survival information (i.e., date and cause of death) and subsequent&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

             virus (HBV). (Patients with chronic or active hepatitis B as diagnosed by serologic&#xD;
             tests are excluded from the study. In equivocal cases, hepatitis B or C polymerase&#xD;
             chain reaction results may be performed and must be negative for enrollment.) A rapid&#xD;
             decline in KPS score or serum albumin (≥20%), or have progressive pain symptoms&#xD;
