      This study proposed by increasing dosage and expand the &quot;3 + 3&quot; queue, main component is&#xD;
      divided into two phases, phase 1 for dose escalation, according to preliminary data&#xD;
      recommended doses starting dose of climbing, the purpose is to evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      combination therapy, tolerance, and explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and right dose&#xD;
      recommended development stage;Phase 2 was the expansion phase. Patients were included in the&#xD;
      expansion study according to the appropriate dose recommended in phase 1, to further evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of combination therapy, recommend appropriate dose for phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial, and preliminarily explore the efficacy of combination therapy.&#xD;

      1. Phase 1 was the dose increasing phase, which was divided into three queues (A, B and C).&#xD;
           Each team was included in the group of three people.Cohort B: pd-l1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
           900mg q3w+ lenalidomide 25mg/d, administration for 21 days/discontinuation for 7&#xD;
           days;Cohort C: pd-l1 monoclonal antibody 20mg/kg q3w+ lenalidomide 25mg/d,&#xD;
           administration for 21 days/discontinuation for 7 days.If none of the 3 patients in&#xD;
           cohort A in phase 1 showed dose limited toxicity (DLT) within 21 days of their first&#xD;
           use, they were enrolled in cohort B, and so on.If 1 of the first 3 subjects in a dose&#xD;
           group developed DLT during the DLT observation period after the first combination&#xD;
           administration, an additional 3 subjects were added to the dose group.If none of the&#xD;
           additional 3 subjects developed DLT, the next incremental dose group was entered.If DLT&#xD;
           appears in 1 or more of the additional 3 subjects, the investigator shall decide whether&#xD;
           to adjust the regimen, or increase the regimen, or terminate the climb.If DLT appears in&#xD;
           2 or more subjects in the initial 3 subjects of a dose group during the observation&#xD;
           period of the first combined DLT, the investigator shall decide whether to adjust the&#xD;
           dosing regimen, or increase the dosing regimen, or terminate the climbing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In phase 2, 24 patients will be further included under the initially determined dose&#xD;
           level and the appropriate administration regimen. Disease control rate (DCR) will be&#xD;
           calculated according to the data obtained in phase 1, and the group with the highest DCR&#xD;
           dose will be selected for the expansion study.&#xD;
