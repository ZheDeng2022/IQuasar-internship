  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive sensors have been used in research in the United States (US) to aid in the&#xD;
      assessment of a subject's heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and fluid volume status.&#xD;
      This estimate and its trended value over time, when used along with clinical signs and&#xD;
      symptoms and other subject test results, can aid in the process of reaching a diagnosis and&#xD;
      formulating a therapeutic plan when abnormalities of volume status, or RR are suspected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive sensors like the Peripheral IntraVenous Analysis (PIVA) sensor under development&#xD;
      by Baxter and the Deltran blood pressure (BP) transducer, capture waveforms created by&#xD;
      physiological mechanisms such as blood flow and breathing. An algorithm is then applied to&#xD;
      the captured waveform to give clinicians an idea of hemodynamic (volume) status, and RR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the functional robustness (e.g., subjects sitting, elevated leg positions,&#xD;
      etc.) of the PIVA algorithm/technology will be demonstrated by evaluating the impact of&#xD;
      various common interventions on the venous pressure signal. All subjects will undergo 33&#xD;
      interventions expected to take approximately 4 - 6 hours.&#xD;

    <description>After device setup, subjects will be guided through a series of manipulations of the IV set while waveforms, pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR) are collected at the start and stop of each test. At the end of the study, the PIVA algorithm will then be applied to the waveforms and calculated values will be compared with those from bedside monitors to understand the effect of common manipulations on the waveforms and determine most optimal conditions for capturing RR and PR through peripheral IV analysis.</description>
