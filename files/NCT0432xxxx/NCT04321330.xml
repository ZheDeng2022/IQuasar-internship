    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 3.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. PFS will be calculated based on disease status evaluated by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1.</description>
