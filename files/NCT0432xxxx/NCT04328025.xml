  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transgender women (TGW) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important,&#xD;
      under-researched population in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, HIV acquisition risk among TGW&#xD;
      is 13 times higher than other adults aged 15-49 years. In Uganda, HIV prevalence among TGW is&#xD;
      22% compared to 5.9% in the general population. Encouraging use of self-controlled HIV&#xD;
      prevention tools - specifically, HIV self-testing (HIVST), STI self-sampling (STISS) and&#xD;
      antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - to those testing HIV negative could decrease&#xD;
      HIV incidence among African TGW. This R34 application proposes formative research and a pilot&#xD;
      trial to develop an HIV prevention intervention for African transgender women (TGW). The&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate whether peer-delivered combination HIV prevention increases&#xD;
      testing uptake and empowers effective prevention decision making in TGW. Peer-led&#xD;
      interventions are effective in increasing HIV and STI testing among other hard-to-reach&#xD;
      vulnerable populations with high HIV prevalence but low testing coverage and are recommended&#xD;
      by the World Health Organization. Exploring peer-delivery approaches to increase coverage of&#xD;
      combination HIV prevention interventions is key to addressing research gaps in HIV epidemic&#xD;
      control. However, little is known about the effectiveness of peer-delivered combination HIV&#xD;
      prevention (HIVST, STISS and PrEP) for African TGW, or the best way to deliver care to this&#xD;
      population. Key knowledge gaps include: 1) whether peer delivery increases testing rates and&#xD;
      status knowledge, 2) the role of peers in creating demand for repeat testing and PrEP, and 3)&#xD;
      how to optimize peer delivery of combination HIV prevention (HIVST, STISS and PrEP). To&#xD;
      address these questions, this proposal seeks to conduct formative research to inform&#xD;
      implementation of peer-delivered combination HIV prevention for African TGW (Aim 1),&#xD;
      implement a pilot cluster randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness of peer delivered combination HIV prevention (Aim 2), and conduct&#xD;
      in-depth interviews to explore how peer-delivery of HIVST, STISS and PrEP influences&#xD;
      prevention choices among TGW and sexual partners (Aim 3). This will be the first clinical&#xD;
      trial, to our knowledge, to evaluate HIV self-testing and STI self-sampling in HIV-uninfected&#xD;
      TGW. Pilot data from TGW and their partners will provide unique perspectives to inform HIV&#xD;
      prevention delivery. The proposed proof-of-concept evaluation is uniquely positioned to&#xD;
      improve prevention uptake for African TGW - a high-risk, marginalized, and underserved&#xD;
      population. Rigorous application of mixed methodologies will generate actionable data for&#xD;
      policy and programs, and provide a strong foundation for scalable implementation of cutting&#xD;
      edge combination HIV prevention interventions for African TGW. The local transgender&#xD;
      community is involved in study design, planning and implementation. This project is supported&#xD;
      by the Ugandan Ministry of Health.&#xD;

      Transgender women (TGW) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important,&#xD;
      under-researched population in sub-Saharan Africa. Globally, HIV acquisition risk among TGW&#xD;
      is 13 times higher than other adults aged 15-49 years. In Uganda, HIV prevalence among TGW is&#xD;
      22% compared to 5.9% in the general population. Encouraging use of self-controlled HIV&#xD;
      prevention tools - specifically, HIV self-testing (HIVST), STI self-sampling (STISS) and&#xD;
      antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - among those testing HIV negative could&#xD;
      decrease HIV incidence among African TGW and secondary transmission to their sexual partners.&#xD;
      This study comprises formative research and a pilot trial to develop an HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention for African TGW. The investigators will evaluate whether peer-delivered&#xD;
      combination HIV prevention increases testing uptake and empowers effective prevention&#xD;
      decision making in TGW. Peer-led interventions are effective in increasing HIV and STI&#xD;
      testing among other hard-to-reach vulnerable populations with high HIV prevalence but low&#xD;
      testing coverage and are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Exploring&#xD;
      peer-delivery approaches to increase coverage of combination HIV prevention interventions is&#xD;
      key to addressing research gaps in HIV epidemic control. However, little is known about the&#xD;
      effectiveness of peer-delivered combination HIV prevention (HIVST, STISS and PrEP) for&#xD;
      African TGW, or the best way to deliver care to this population. Key knowledge gaps include:&#xD;
      1) whether peer delivery increases testing rates and status knowledge, 2) the role of peers&#xD;
      in creating demand for repeat testing and PrEP, and 3) how to optimize peer delivery of&#xD;
      combination HIV prevention (HIVST, STISS and PrEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these questions, this protocol describes formative research to inform&#xD;
      implementation of peer-delivered combination HIV prevention for African TGW, followed by&#xD;
      implementation of a pilot cluster randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and preliminary effectiveness of peer delivered combination HIV prevention, and in-depth&#xD;
      interviews to explore how peer-delivery of HIVST, STISS and PrEP influences prevention&#xD;
      choices among TGW and sexual partners. This will be the first clinical trial, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, to evaluate HIV self-testing and STI self-sampling in HIV-uninfected TGW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct formative research to inform implementation of peer-delivered combination HIV&#xD;
      prevention for African TGW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: Using the Social Ecological framework, the investigators will conduct in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with TG peers, healthcare providers, civil society members, and Ministry of Health&#xD;
      officials to: a) explore barriers and likely facilitators of HIVST, STISS and PrEP; and b)&#xD;
      assess feasibility of respondent-driven sampling (RDS), the recruitment strategy for Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Respondents will provide insights into the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      peer-delivered HIVST, STISS and PrEP, and RDS recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of&#xD;
      peer-delivered combination HIV prevention (HIVST, STISS and PrEP) for African TGW by&#xD;
      implementing a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: To pilot-test the effectiveness of this peer-delivered combination HIV prevention&#xD;
      intervention, 10 TGW peer groups (1 peer and 8 participants) will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either monthly peer delivery of HIVST, STISS and PrEP (intervention arm) or&#xD;
      quarterly in-clinic HIV testing and PrEP prescription (control arm). All will enroll at&#xD;
      clinic and initiate PrEP. In between quarterly clinic visits, trained peers will: a) deliver&#xD;
      additional HIVST kits and PrEP refills; b) distribute STI self-sampling kits to TGW for own&#xD;
      use and with regular partners; and c) use smart phone instructional videos showing TGW how to&#xD;
      self-collect pharyngeal, rectal &amp; urine specimens. The investigators will provide: i) free&#xD;
      testing and treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis; and ii)&#xD;
      peer-assisted partner notification services. Primary outcomes are intervention feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability &amp; PrEP adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Peer delivery will be feasible and acceptable, with higher uptake of testing and&#xD;
      PrEP compared with control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Explore how peer-delivery of HIVST, STISS and PrEP influences prevention choices among&#xD;
      TGW and sexual partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach: To clarify the process through which peer-delivery may influence prevention&#xD;
      choices, the investigators will conduct in-depth interviews with participants and their&#xD;
      partners to assess perceptions and experiences with peer-delivered HIV/STI services, status&#xD;
      disclosure, partner notification, behavior change and PrEP use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Peer-delivered combination HIV prevention will empower TGW to engage in&#xD;
      prevention services, facilitate partner testing and efficiently identify persons with&#xD;
      undiagnosed HIV and/or STIs.&#xD;

    <description>For TGW in the intervention arm, peers will deliver HIVST and PrEP medications monthly in between quarterly clinic visits. Quarterly clinic-based testing will confirm accuracy of self-tests and identify inaccurate test results. Additionally, peers will remind TGW to self-test before opening a new PrEP bottle. They will also distribute STI self-sampling kits to TGW for own use, and with regular partners as needed. They will present smart phone instructional videos showing trans women how to self-collect pharyngeal, rectal and urine specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis testing.&#xD;
Peers will: a) motivate ongoing adherence; b) promote repeat HIV testing; and c) support PrEP use as problems arise. Self-sampling for STIs will be performed monthly by participants (with questions answered by the peer or other study staff as needed).</description>
