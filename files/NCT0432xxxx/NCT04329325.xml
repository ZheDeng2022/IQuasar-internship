  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : The purpose of this study is to test whether blinatumomab in combination with TKI therapy&#xD;
      (such as dasatinib) is an effective treatment for people with Ph+ ALL. Researchers want to&#xD;
      improve the response to standard-of-care treatment of corticosteroids + TKI therapy by adding&#xD;
      the study drug, blinatumomab.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PRE-PHASE: Patients may receive corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician prior to beginning induction therapy. A seven-day corticosteroid&#xD;
      pre-phase, which can include days of corticosteroid receipt prior to protocol registration,&#xD;
      will precede initiation of TKI therapy on day 1. Corticosteroid dose and schedule are at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigator during the pre-phase, with dosing caps of prednisone 120&#xD;
      mg/day, dexamethasone 24 mg/day, or biologic equivalents thereof. In the event the treating&#xD;
      investigator feels delaying induction therapy (TKI + dexamethasone) would be unsafe (e.g. ALL&#xD;
      progressing despite corticosteroids), the patient may proceed to day 1 (begin TKI +&#xD;
      dexamethasone) before completion of 7-day pre-phase if investigator feels delay would be&#xD;
      unsafe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Induction therapy consists of dexamethasone in combination with TKI. TKI&#xD;
      therapy will generally begin with dasatinib 140 mg daily (dose changes or transition to&#xD;
      alternative TKI permitted subject to the provisions in the protocol). Patients will receive&#xD;
      dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day (up to 24 mg /day) in single or divided doses, days 1-24.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will be tapered days 25-32 (±3 days for start and end of taper); the TKI will&#xD;
      be continued during and following the dexamethasone taper. Recommended CNS prophylaxis&#xD;
      consists of intrathecal (IT) or intra-Ommaya (IO) methotrexate 12 mg day 22 and day 43 (±7&#xD;
      days); of note, methotrexate 12 mg is recommended though agent/dosing left to discretion of&#xD;
      investigator. Hydrocortisone IT may be given along with methotrexate at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Bone marrow evaluations will be performed on days 22 (±3 days) and day 43 (±3&#xD;
      days) and will include minimal residual disease (MRD) assessment by BCR-ABL1 transcript&#xD;
      studies and flow cytometry. Under certain circumstances, the induction period may be extended&#xD;
      for up to 21 days with bone marrow studies repeated at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients in complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic&#xD;
      recovery (CRi) following remission induction, with or without MRD, proceed to consolidation&#xD;
      therapy, defined as day 1 of cycle 1 of blinatumomab, within 21 days of day 43 or the date of&#xD;
      BMA establishing CR/CRi, whichever is later. TKI will be administered continuously. Patients&#xD;
      will begin Blinatumomab 28 mcg/daily IVCI for patients ≥45 kg; patients &lt;45 kg will be&#xD;
      treated at a dose of 15 mcg/m2/day, capped at a dose of 28 mcg/day, given for a 28-day cycle,&#xD;
      with dose adjustments further subject to the provisions outlined in the protocol. Inpatient&#xD;
      admission is recommended for at least days 1-3 of cycle 1 of blinatumomab (≥72 hours from&#xD;
      start of infusion). Following each 28-day infusion of blinatumomab, a mandatory period of 14&#xD;
      days off blinatumomab will follow during which bone marrow evaluation will be performed with&#xD;
      MRD assessment and CNS prophylaxis will be administered. The consolidation period will&#xD;
      consist of 3 cycles of blinatumomab given as such. Patients may come off therapy at any point&#xD;
      to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients in complete molecular response (as defined within the protocol)&#xD;
      following blinatumomab cycle 3 and not proceeding immediately to alloHCT may proceed to&#xD;
      maintenance therapy, defined as day 1 of cycle 4 of blinatumomab, within 28 days of&#xD;
      completion of blinatumomab infusion in cycle 3. TKI will be administered continuously.&#xD;
      Blinatumomab will be given for up to 4 additional 28-day cycles (cycles 4-7) with a mandatory&#xD;
      period of 28 days (±7 days) off blinatumomab between cycles, during which CNS prophylaxis&#xD;
      will be administered. Bone marrow evaluation with MRD assessment will be performed after&#xD;
      cycles 5 and 7 of blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP: TKI maintenance is recommended but not required. Further post-remission therapy,&#xD;
      if any, at the discretion of the treating physician. Following completion of all required&#xD;
      study treatments and assessments, patients enrolled will be followed for long-term survival&#xD;
      and relapse outcomes as outlined in the protocol.&#xD;

    <description>Patients may receive steroids and hydroxyurea pre-study entry and receive a 7-day steroid prephase before starting TKI therapy. Planned initial TKI is dasatinib 140 mg daily; dasatinib dose may be reduced or TKI may be changed to a different agent under certain conditions. Induction consists of continuous TKI + 24 days of dexamethasone, followed by taper of dexamethasone, with bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMA) and CNS prophylaxis at days 22 and 43. Patients achieving morphologic complete response post-induction proceed to consolidation with up to 3 cycles of blinatumomab (28-day cycles, 14 days between cycles) + TKI, with BMA and CNS prophylaxis between cycles. Patients achieving complete molecular response may proceed to maintenance with up to 4 more cycles of blinatumomab (28-day cycles with 28 days between cycles) + TKI, with CNS prophylaxis between cycles and BMA after cycles 5 and 7. Patients can come off study to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation at any time.</description>
