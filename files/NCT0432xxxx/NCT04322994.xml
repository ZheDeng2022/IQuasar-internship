  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THRIVE (Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange) refers to the use of&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula to augment the ability to oxygenate and ventilate a patient under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. The use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during&#xD;
      anesthesia for surgical procedures has been a recent development in the adult population,&#xD;
      with limited data analyzing the pediatric population. This study will determine whether high&#xD;
      flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during surgical or endoscopic procedures can&#xD;
      prevent desaturation events in children under anesthesia and improve the outcomes of that&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment subjects will undergo the scheduled procedure, with the difference being that a high-flow nasal cannula will be applied prior to the start of the procedure and removed following the procedure's conclusion. While applied, the cannula will deliver high- flow rate oxygen, air, or a mixture of variable oxygen concentration (21-100%) depending on the surgical conditions and requirements. The rate will be set at 1-4L/kg/min with a maximum of 70L/min. Participants in the treatment arm will then proceed to the recovery area as usual. Following recovery from anesthesia, a brief questionnaire will be provided to applicable patients or their parents / guardians / representatives.&#xD;
