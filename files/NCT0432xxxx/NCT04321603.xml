  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV are living longer as their disease is controlled with antiretroviral&#xD;
      medications. Yet they are experiencing frailty more often and more than ten years earlier&#xD;
      than those without HIV. In elderly persons without HIV, frailty is associated with decreased&#xD;
      muscle strength and chronic inflammation. Less is known about what is driving early frailty&#xD;
      in HIV or effective prevention measures for aging adults with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It may be that having HIV infection impairs energy production by mitochondria within the&#xD;
      cells and contributes to the muscle weakness and inflammation accompanying frailty in people&#xD;
      living with HIV . This study will examine the impact of six weeks of moderately paced walking&#xD;
      on energy production in the cells, inflammation markers and frailty scores in people living&#xD;
      with well-controlled HIV who are aged 50 to 65.&#xD;
