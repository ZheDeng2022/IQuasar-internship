      The study is a monocentric, open label, phase 1 study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      in particular the dose proportionality of setanaxib and its metabolites after a single oral&#xD;
      dose (400 mg, 800 mg, 1200 mg, and 1600 mg) (Part 1) and after multiple oral doses (Part 2).&#xD;
      The study will include 2 parts conducted in separate cohorts of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1 of the study will be an open label, single dose study evaluating the&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics, and in particular the dose proportionality of setanaxib formulated as&#xD;
           tablets, in 4 separate cohorts of 6 to 8 healthy adult subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2 of the study will assess the pharmacokinetics of setanaxib tablets, expand the&#xD;
           evaluation of potential drug-drug interactions, and assess the safety of setanaxib&#xD;
           tablets at doses up to 1600mg/day for 14 days in separate 2 cohorts. The evaluation of&#xD;
           drug-drug interactions will be carried out only at the top dose. Accordingly, a larger&#xD;
           cohort (i.e. 16 subjects) will be included in Cohort 7.&#xD;
