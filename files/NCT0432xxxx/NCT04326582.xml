      Arthritis is defined as inflammation of the joint, Patients have symptoms of joint pain,&#xD;
      stiffness, swelling, redness, warmth and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.&#xD;
      Arthritis may be caused by transient synovitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA),&#xD;
      reactive arthritis, viral arthritis and other inflammatory diseases; septic arthritis also&#xD;
      occurs as a complication of bacteraemia in children. The overall incidence of arthritis and&#xD;
      its causes are not well documented in children, and have even been reported to be unknown.Two&#xD;
      population-based studies have described the incidence of different diagnoses of arthritis in&#xD;
      childhood. Both of these studies were performed in Northern Europe and reported that&#xD;
      transient synovitis is the most common cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome and treatment of arthritis depend on its etiology. Children with transient&#xD;
      synovitis do not need any surgical procedures and are treated symptomatically at home.&#xD;
      However, children with septic arthritis require early diagnosis and hospital treatment,&#xD;
      including surgical joint drainage and intravenous antibiotics so that septicaemia and joint&#xD;
      damage can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      JIA is one of the more common chronic diseases of childhood with a prevalence of&#xD;
      approximately 1 per 1,000 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria and classification Three groups have developed sets of criteria to classify children&#xD;
      with arthritis: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR), The European League Against&#xD;
      Rheumatism (EULAR), and The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  THE ILAR classification of JIA includes the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systemic-onset JIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  persistent or extended oligoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive polyarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RF-negative polyarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psoriatic JIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undifferentiated(disease does not meet criteria for any of the other subgroups, or it&#xD;
           meets more than 1 criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Septic arthritis was defined as arthritis associated with bacteria isolated from&#xD;
                blood or synovial fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Arthritis that did not retrospectively fulfil criteria for septic arthritis, JIA or&#xD;
                other well-established diagnoses (haemarthrosis, Kawasaki disease, malignant&#xD;
                disease, Gaucher disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, villo-nodular synovitis,&#xD;
                dermatomyositis and chronic recurrent multifocal osteitis) was classified as&#xD;
                'arthritis without any definitive diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although acute monoarthritis (as for instance septic arthritis) is usually considered to&#xD;
           be a medical emergency, it is not often realized that patients with polyarthritis also&#xD;
           need to be evaluated promptly to ensure timely management. Delays in diagnosis and/or&#xD;
           treatment may result in significant morbidity, as for example in rheumatic fever and&#xD;
           Kawasaki disease. It cannot be overemphasized enough that the most important clues to&#xD;
           underlying etiology in a patient with polyarticular disease are found not in the&#xD;
           investigations but in the clinical history and physical examination. Some investigations&#xD;
           (e.g. radiographs of joints) are commonly done but may have little or no role in the&#xD;
           initial assessment of the patient. Polyarticular joint disease has multi-factorial&#xD;
           etiology. It may present acutely as in self limiting viral illnesses or it can be the&#xD;
           beginning of a chronic sinister disease. The underlying etiological process can be&#xD;
           infectious or post infectious, a rheumatological disease or a manifestation of systemic&#xD;
           disease. The disease may evolve over days or sometimes weeks, thereby making the&#xD;
           diagnosis difficult at the time of presentation. Viral infections (for e.g. Parvovirus&#xD;
           B19) are often associated with a self-limiting symmetrical arthritis of small joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic polyarthritis caused by direct invasion of the joint by microbes can occur in&#xD;
      disseminated staphylococcal and streptococcal infections, gram negative sepsis or bacterial&#xD;
      endocarditis. Reactive arthritis, a sterile arthritis mediated by immune mechanisms, is&#xD;
      usually seen after genitourinary (Chlamydia) or gastrointestinal (salmonella, shigella,&#xD;
      yersinia or campylobacter) infections. It is said that arthritis persisting for more than 6&#xD;
      weeks usually rules out an infective pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clues from the history and examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arthritis present for at least 6 weeks before diagnosis (mandatory for diagnosis of&#xD;
           JIA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Either insidious or abrupt disease onset, often with morning stiffness and arthralgia&#xD;
           during the day, joint pain or abnormal joint use, history of school absences or limited&#xD;
           ability to participate in physical education classes, spiking fever occurring once or&#xD;
           twice each day at about the same time of day all are history findings in children with&#xD;
           JIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;How has their general health been?&quot; - Asking about red flags? The presence of systemic&#xD;
           symptoms should raise concerns about multisystem illness (e.g. JSLE or inflammatory&#xD;
           bowel syndromes and further serious pathology such as malignancy, bacterial infection or&#xD;
           trauma (including non-accidental injury; NAI) must be excluded before diagnosing JIA. It&#xD;
           is therefore essential to check for the presence of 'red flags Musculoskeletal red flags&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night time wakening with pain Bone pain Fever Anorexia Weight loss Malaise Features&#xD;
      suggestive of non-accidental injury&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Did anything precede their symptoms?&quot; - Distinguishing reactive and traumatic causes&#xD;
      Typically, reactive arthritis occurs around 7-10 days after the acute illness and&#xD;
      spontaneously remits within 2-3 weeks of onset; gastrointestinal infections may cause a&#xD;
      reactive arthritis but in the older patient sexually acquired infection needs to be&#xD;
      sensitively explored. Falls in children are common and may be a 'red herring' as children&#xD;
      with arthritis are often more prone to falling. It is important to explore further for&#xD;
      inconsistency or discrepancy between circumstance and degree of injury, which should raise&#xD;
      suspicion about NAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;What are they like in the morning?&quot;- Mechanical versus inflammatory features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joint swelling is a prominent symptom of inflammatory conditions such as JIA, but can be&#xD;
      subtle and often missed by parents (as well as health care professionals). To be diagnostic&#xD;
      of JIA, joint swelling needs to persist for several weeks (by definition, more than 6 weeks)&#xD;
      and other conditions excluded. Morning stiffness may manifest itself through functional&#xD;
      change (i.e. difficulty dressing or managing the stairs: &quot;my child walks like an old man&quot;) or&#xD;
      through a noticeable change in behaviour; parents often mention that their child is&#xD;
      particularly miserable in the morning. Prolonged inactivity may precipitate stiffness known&#xD;
      as 'gelling', and the child may describe difficulty getting up after sitting for a sustained&#xD;
      length of time e.g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      following long car journeys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;What can they no longer do?&quot; - Developmental milestones&#xD;
&#xD;
      A history of regression of achieved motor milestones is often present with inflammatory joint&#xD;
      disease and can manifest as the child becoming 'clumsy' or withdrawing from activity (e.g. no&#xD;
      longer walking independently). Regression of a previously attained motor milestone suggests&#xD;
      an acquired condition whereas delay alone might suggest a congenital or inherited condition&#xD;
      (such as development dysplasia of the hip (DDH) or muscular dystrophy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Identifying the cause of polyarthritis may initially look difficult to the uninitiated.&#xD;
      However, clinical clues in patient demographics, disease chronology, inflammatory nature,&#xD;
      progression, distribution of joint involvement and extra-articular manifestations help narrow&#xD;
      the diagnostic possibilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age At the onset of the disease may give clues to the diagnosis. Polyarticular JIA&#xD;
      (rheumatoid factor negative), Kawasaki disease (KD) and Henoch Schonlein purpura (HSP)&#xD;
      usually present in early childhood. In mid-childhood, juvenile psoriatic arthritis, Juvenile&#xD;
      Dermatomyositis (JDMS) and Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN) have their peak frequencies. Juvenile&#xD;
      ankylosing spondylitis (JAS) and SLE typically present in late childhood or early&#xD;
      adolescence. Rheumatoid factor positive polyarticular JIA, mimicking the clinical profile of&#xD;
      adult RA, usually presents only after the age of 10years.Disorders like gout and crystal&#xD;
      deposition disease are extremely uncommon in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sex While many rheumatological disorders (e.g. SLE, polyarticular JIA) have a predilection&#xD;
      for girls, there are others (e.g. vasculitides like KD and PAN; Spondyloarthropathies like&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease and JAS) which are more common in boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onset of Disease and Duration While some arthritides may have an acute onset (e.g. septic&#xD;
      arthritis and arthritis associated with KD/HSP) others may have a subacute or chronic&#xD;
      insidious course as typically seen in polyarticular chronic insidious course as typically&#xD;
      seen in polyarticular JIA or sarcoidosis. Polyarthritis of less than 6 weeks duration is seen&#xD;
      in self limiting viral arthritides, rheumatic fever or reactive arthritis. It may sometimes&#xD;
      be prudent not to give a label in the first few weeks of the illness when the disease process&#xD;
      is still evolving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family History Although Mendelian inheritance is not usually seen in inflammatory&#xD;
      polyarthritis, familial clustering of cases can be seen in ankylosing spondylitis,&#xD;
      inflammatory bowel disease and psoriatic arthritis. The latter condition is especially&#xD;
      intriguing because clinical manifestations of psoriasis can be subtle and very variable&#xD;
      amongst the family members.&#xD;
