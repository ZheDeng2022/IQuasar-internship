    <textblock>
      Lung disease are the most common condition in pediatrics and also the primary cause of death&#xD;
      among children less than 5 years old(Chen Shui-Wen et al.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X ray consider as the first line to evalute the chest disease (Kim O et al. ,2000), in&#xD;
      identified the pulmonary opacities (Ozkaya A et al., 2018),but there is limitation in the&#xD;
      interpretation of the location and nature of an area of increase opacity on chest radiographs&#xD;
      particularly in young infants with varied configuration of thymus and differentiation between&#xD;
      pulmonary , pleural and mediastinal lesions is not always easy(Barillari A et al .,2011),so&#xD;
      the thoracic computed tomography is recommended as diagnostic gold standard to follow up&#xD;
      pediatric chest X ray opacities and masses(Lameh A et al. ,2019),but not consider as first&#xD;
      line of radiological evaluation because each chest computed tomography gives to patient an&#xD;
      effective dose of eight msv equivalent to four hundred chest X ray (Prithviraj D.,2014), also&#xD;
      high cost ,and longe waiting times for imaging (Lameh A et al .,2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest sonography consider as first line investigation in evaluation of diaphragmatic ,pleural&#xD;
      and chest wall lesions due to lack of superficial adipose tissue in pediatric patients (Goh&#xD;
      Y, et al. ,2016),but undervalued for lungs lesion for many years ,because the ribs ,sternum&#xD;
      and aerated lungs had been considered obstacles to ultrasound waves (Dietrich C, et al.,&#xD;
      2015). However improvements in technology have lead to production of higher-resolution&#xD;
      transducers and techniques such as tissue harmonic imaging, which lead to improved spatial&#xD;
      resolution and deeper tissue penetration of ultrasound waves (Lameh A et al. ,2019),also the&#xD;
      pathological processes as inflammations ,trauma or neoplastic within the chest wall ,pleural,&#xD;
      and lungs result in profound changes in tissue composition and improved acoustic transmission&#xD;
      and allow for adequate lungs sonographic evaluation(Dietrich C, et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest sonography serves as a powerful complementary diagnostic tool with advantage of easy&#xD;
      availability ,rapid ,radiation free (Dietrich C, et al., 2015), repeatable and inexpensive&#xD;
      methods, determining the high diagnostic accuracy in detecting pediatric chest lesions (Lameh&#xD;
      A et al .,2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causes of pediatric chest X ray opacity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio-opacities are more common and significant compared to increased radiolucency , can be&#xD;
      caused by many different pathologies and present with different patterns (Gelaw S.,2015), as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caused by replacement of the air in distal airways and the alveoli by fluid or soft tissues.&#xD;
      Radiological, this is seen as opacity of any size and mostly homogenous, it has no volume&#xD;
      loss, has the tendency to coalescence, has ill-defined margins, non-segmental distribution,&#xD;
      irregular shape, air bronchogram (Gelaw S.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By ultrasound its similar in echogenicity and echotexture to liver and spleen. Bronchograms&#xD;
      present within the solid appearing area of echogenicity as multiple bright dot like , and&#xD;
      branching linear structures represent air in bronchi and scattered residual air in&#xD;
      alveoli(Barillari A et al. ,2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differentiate from atelectasia by presence of dynamic air bronchogram (Barillari A et al&#xD;
      .,2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collapse (atelectasis):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may affect the whole hemi-lung or sub-division of the lungs, such as the lobes ,&#xD;
      segments or subsegments of the lung. Radiological, it causes opacity and signs of volume&#xD;
      loss(Gelaw S.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to to differentiate focal areas of cosolidation from those of collapse ,since&#xD;
      collapse may be associated with a foreign body inhalation or other extrinisic obstruction&#xD;
      (Arthur R.,2003) . By chest ultrasound atelectasis similar in echogenicity and echotexture to&#xD;
      liver and the air broncograms appear crowded and parallel (Barillari A et al.,2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interstitial opacities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the common presentation of chronic diffuse interstitial lung diseases (Gelaw&#xD;
      S.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasound is an emerging tool in diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases by evaluation&#xD;
      number of B lines ,pleural irregularities and nodules or consolidation (Falcetta et al.,&#xD;
      2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural/chest wall opacities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural opacities, such as pleural mass lesion, pleural thickening or calcification or mass&#xD;
      arising from soft tissue or bony chest wall (Gelaw S., 2015) , in the pleural effusion is&#xD;
      challenging to differentiate between the pleural effusion and consolidation by the X ray&#xD;
      especially in hemithorax (Prina E., 2014).ultrasound provides detailed information about the&#xD;
      nature of pleural fluid and allows one to determine whether a fluid collection is amenable to&#xD;
      aspiration (Kim O et al., 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nodular opacities or mass:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are rounded increased opacities that can be caused by different pathologies.&#xD;
      Radiological , these can be seen on any location, with sizes ranging from pinpoint to mass&#xD;
      (it is called mass if &gt;3 cm), solitary or multiple (such as miliary nodules, if multiple&#xD;
      small nodules ≈2 mm in diameter), can have different shapes; and margins can be smooth,&#xD;
      umbilicated or lobulated. The outline can be sharp, ill-defined or speculated (Gelaw&#xD;
      S.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ring opacities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are annular opacities with central radiolucency usually due to cavitations of&#xD;
      pre-existing lesion, but also can be caused by bullae, benign air cyst, loculated&#xD;
      pneumothorax or fibrocystic changes (Gelaw S.,2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear opacities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These are thin or thick (band shadow, if 5 mm or more) linear shadows. The most common&#xD;
      abnormal linear opacity is a scar. Post-primary tuberculosis commonly heals with fibrosis&#xD;
      presenting with irregular linear opacities with or without volume loss (Gelaw S.,2015).&#xD;
