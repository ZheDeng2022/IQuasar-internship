  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common pediatric epilepsy&#xD;
      syndrome. Affected children typically have a mild seizure disorder, but yet have moderate&#xD;
      difficulties with language, learning and attention that impact quality of life more than the&#xD;
      seizures. Separate from the seizures, these children have very frequent abnormal activity in&#xD;
      their brain known as interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs, or spikes), which physicians&#xD;
      currently do not treat. These IEDs arise near the motor cortex, a region in the brain that&#xD;
      controls movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use a form of non-invasive brain stimulation called&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to determine the impact of IEDs on brain regions&#xD;
      important for language to investigate: (1) if treatment of IEDs could improve language; and&#xD;
      (2) if brain stimulation may be a treatment option for children with epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating children will wear electroencephalogram (EEG) caps to measure brain activity.&#xD;
      The investigators will use TMS to stimulate the brain region where the IEDs originate to&#xD;
      measure how this region is connected to other brain regions. Children will then receive a&#xD;
      special form of TMS called repetitive TMS (rTMS) that briefly reduces brain excitability. The&#xD;
      study will measure if IEDs decrease and if brain connectivity changes after rTMS is applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the IEDs cause language problems by increasing&#xD;
      connectivity between the motor cortex and language regions. The investigators further&#xD;
      hypothesize that rTMS will reduce the frequency of IEDs and also reduce connectivity between&#xD;
      the motor and language region&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Children will receive active repetitive TMS (rTMS) on one day and sham stimulation on a second day. The order of stimulation will be randomized on a per-participant basis.&#xD;
Children and parents/guardians will not be told if they are receiving sham or inhibitory rTMS on a given day. The research team will know at the time of stimulation, however, as they will have to choose which coil to use. The TMS-EEG files will be coded and the team member analyzing the files for change in IED (spike) frequency and change in connectivity will be blinded to condition.</intervention_model_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes (BECTS), sometimes called&#xD;
             Rolandic Epilepsy. Diagnosis will be based on a history of a focal motor seizure&#xD;
             (affecting the face or causing hypersalivation) or a history of a seizure out of sleep&#xD;
             AND an EEG with unilateral or bilateral centrotemporal spike waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English-speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of prematurity &lt; 35 weeks gestational age;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious neurologic problems (i.e. history of other seizure disorder other&#xD;
             than simple febrile seizure, head trauma with prolonged loss of consciousness,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular accident or neuro-inflammatory disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Focal deficits on neurologic exam&#xD;
