  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      8 young people (aged 12-15yrs) with type 1 diabetes will be interviewed along with their&#xD;
      families during this qualitative study. The interviews will explore factors identified by the&#xD;
      young people and their families as important in diabetes management. Comparison of these&#xD;
      factors will then be made between the young people with higher and lower HbA1c levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family is an important factor in the self-management of type 1 diabetes by children and young&#xD;
      people. Existing research has explored the experience of living with diabetes, considered&#xD;
      from the perspective of children and parents, but has not provided children's diabetes teams&#xD;
      with the information they need to support young people with higher blood glucose levels, and&#xD;
      therefore higher risks of long term complications related to their diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this qualitative study the researcher will meet with young people (aged 12-15yrs) and&#xD;
      their families for a joint interview, held in the family home, exploring the factors which&#xD;
      they consider important in diabetes self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One interview will be held with each family. Recruitment of 8 families is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will be recorded and transcribed to allow thematic analysis, allowing&#xD;
      identification of common factors considered to be important by families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HbA1c of young people with diabetes is checked regularly in clinic and provides an&#xD;
      assessment of blood glucose levels over the preceding months. Higher HbA1c levels are&#xD;
      associated with higher risk of long term complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The index young people will be recruited in 2 groups: one group will have lower risk of long&#xD;
      term complications (identified by an HbA1c level of &lt;58mmol/mol). The other will have higher&#xD;
      risk (HbA1c 75-100mmol/mol). A comparison will be made between the families in each group, to&#xD;
      identify which themes are more common in the lower or higher risk groups.&#xD;
