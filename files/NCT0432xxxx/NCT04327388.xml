    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study was conducted at 46 active centers in 11 countries. A total of 431 participants were screened between 28 March 2020 and 02 July 2020, of which 10 participants were screen failures and 1 participant was randomized twice and thus excluded. Therefore, a total of 420 participants were randomized in the study treatment by the interactive response technology (IRT) (2:2:1 ratio) to receive sarilumab 200 milligrams (mg)/400 mg and placebo. Screen failures were mainly due to exclusion criteria met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by severity of illness (severe disease, critical disease) and use of systemic corticosteroids (Yes/No).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Time to improvement of greater than or equal (&gt;=) 2 points in clinical status assessment was defined as time (in days) from first dose of study drug to the time of first occurrence of improvement of &gt;=2 points in clinical status of participants assessed using 7-point ordinal scale (calculated as: Date of first occurrence/episode of the event - date of first dose + 1). Seven-point ordinal scale for clinical assessment ranges from 1= death; 2= hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation/ECMO; 3= hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation/high flow oxygen devices; 4= hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5= hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related/otherwise); 6= hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer required ongoing medical care; 7= not hospitalized, higher score = less severity. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis.</description>

          <title>Time to Resolution of Fever and Improvement in Oxygenation</title>
          <description>Time to resolution of fever was defined as body temperature &lt;=36.6°C (axilla), or &lt;=37.2 °C (oral), or &lt;=37.8°C (rectal or tympanic) for at least 48 hours without antipyretics or until discharge, whichever was sooner. Improvement in oxygenation was defined as oxygen saturation (SpO2)/FiO2 of 50 or greater compared to the nadir SpO2/FiO2 for at least 48 hours, or until discharge, whichever was sooner. Nadir SpO2/FiO2 was the nadir (lowest value) at any point in the study. Time to resolution of fever and improvement in oxygenation (in days) was calculated as: date of first occurrence/episode of the event (resolution of fever and improvement in oxygenation) - date of first dose + 1. Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation.</description>

        <description>NEWS2: used to standardize assessment of acute-illness severity, track clinical condition of participants and to alert clinical teams to participant deterioration. NEWS2 score was based on 7 clinical parameters: respiration rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness, and temperature. A score of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was allocated to each parameter except supplemental oxygen (a score of 0 or 1 was allocated) and level of consciousness (a score of 0 or 3 was allocated), where 0 = normal health condition to 3 = worst health condition; higher score indicated more severity. All scores were summed to get an aggregate score. Aggregate NEWS2 score ranged from 0 to 19, with higher scores meaning more severity/higher risk. Percentage of participants in following clinical risk categories were reported: low risk (score 0 to 4); low to medium risk (score of 3 in any individual parameter); medium risk (score 5 to 6); high risk (score 7 to 19).</description>

NEWS2 score was based on 7 clinical parameters: respiration rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness, and temperature. A score of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was allocated to each parameter except supplemental oxygen (score of 0 or 1 was allocated) and level of consciousness (score of 0 or 3 was allocated), where 0=normal health condition to 3=worst health condition; higher score=more severity. All scores were summed to get an aggregate score which ranged from 0 to 19, with higher scores=more severity/higher risk. Kaplan-Meier method was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline at Days 4, 7, 15, 21, and 29 in National Early Warning Score 2</title>
        <description>The NEWS2 was used to standardize the assessment of acute-illness severity, track the clinical condition of participants, and to alert clinical teams to participant deterioration. NEWS2 score is based on 7 clinical parameters: respiration rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, level of consciousness, and temperature. A score of 0, 1, 2, and 3 was allocated to each parameter except supplemental oxygen (a score of 0 or 1 was allocated) and level of consciousness (a score of 0 or 3 was allocated), where 0 = normal health condition to 3 = worst health condition; higher score indicated more severity. All scores were summed to get an aggregate score. Aggregate NEWS2 score ranged from 0 to 19, with higher scores meaning more severity/higher risk. LS means and SE were estimated using ANCOVA model with treatment group and randomization strata as fixed effects, and baseline NEWS2 score as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Time-to-improvement in Oxygenation</title>
        <description>Time-to-improvement in oxygenation was defined as increase in SpO2/FiO2 of 50 or greater compared to the nadir SpO2/FiO2 for at least 48 hours or until discharge, whichever was sooner. Nadir SpO2/FiO2 was the nadir (lowest value) at any point in the study. Time to improvement in oxygenation was calculated as: date of first occurrence/episode of the event (oxygenation) - date of first dose + 1. Kaplan-Meier method was used for estimation.</description>

        <description>Resting respiratory rate was measured in terms of number of breaths per minute (bpm) while a person is at rest. Only the days with respiratory rate &gt;24 breath per minute since the first dose were counted and percentage of days with respiratory rate &gt; 24 bpm were calculated as:100*number of days with respiratory rate &gt;24 bpm divided by number of days of follow up (defined as the earlier date of death or discharge or last visit up to Day 29).

Grade 4 neutropenia with concurrent invasive infection was defined as infections and infestations (in participants with Grade 4 neutropenia) within 1 week of ANC &lt;500/mm^3 and was considered as an AESI (defined as an AE [serious or non-serious] of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor's product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor was required).</description>
