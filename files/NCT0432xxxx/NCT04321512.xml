  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to discover the functions of circulating white blood&#xD;
      cells, called monocytes, and associated circulating substances in heart attack and ischemic&#xD;
      stroke patients. Ischemic Strokes (clots) occur as a result of an obstruction within a blood&#xD;
      vessel supplying blood to the brain. A type of monocyte carrying a surface marker called&#xD;
      &quot;P2X4&quot; helps the immune system sense and respond to danger signals from the body such as&#xD;
      heart muscle and brain tissue injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers expect to learn more about how these monocyte cells react to heart and brain&#xD;
      tissue injury, and how the cells may then produce proteins or other chemical substances which&#xD;
      promote the healing of heart muscle after heart attack and brain tissue after an ischemic&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

      The research objective here is to perform a pilot study in determining the level of such&#xD;
      monocytes in MI/stroke patients at various times after the acute ischemic event. As controls,&#xD;
      both stable coronary disease and healthy control subjects will be enrolled in whom these&#xD;
      circulating cells will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research objective will be accomplished via the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aim will determine the levels of P2X4 monocytes, Flt-1/VEGFR-1 and CD13&#xD;
      monocytes. The researchers may collect three blood samples at various time points. The&#xD;
      samples will be collected within 48 hours of admission to the hospital, 2-14, and 30-120 days&#xD;
      following MI/stroke. As a control, levels of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocytes in&#xD;
      age- matched healthy subjects and in SCAD subjects will be used. Additionally for CD13&#xD;
      monocytes, the researchers plan to test if CD13 is phosphorylated in the circulating&#xD;
      monocytes of patients who have undergone myocardial/cerebral infarction and determine its&#xD;
      utility as a biomarker of infarct size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the study is not designed to determine whether those MI/stroke patients within the&#xD;
      top quartile of P2X4 or Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) or CD13 monocyte levels are more prone to develop&#xD;
      severe tissue or organ dysfunction, the study will collect baseline and subsequent clinical&#xD;
      data set and should position the study team to test this hypothesis in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers might expect to show that MI/stroke patients have a higher level of P2X4,&#xD;
      Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and/or CD13 monocytes as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites as&#xD;
      compared to SCAD and age-matched healthy controls. The researchers might also expect that&#xD;
      thrombectomy samples from ischemic stroke patients will have higher inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      and inflammatory monocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain blood samples from STEMI patients for determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+)&#xD;
           and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites on the days:&#xD;
           1(within 48 hours of admission), 2-14, and 30-120 days after the MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain blood samples from NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation MI) patients for&#xD;
           determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating&#xD;
           cytokines and metabolites on the days: 1(within 48 hours of admission hospital), 2-14,&#xD;
           and 30-120 days after the MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain blood samples from ischemic stroke patients for determination of P2X4, Flt-1+&#xD;
           (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte levels as well as circulating cytokines and metabolites on&#xD;
           the days: 1(within 48 hours of admission), 2-14, and 30-120 days after the ischemic&#xD;
           event. In addition, thrombectomy samples which are normally discarded, when obtained and&#xD;
           available, will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain blood samples from age-matched SCAD and healthy control subjects for a&#xD;
           one-time determination of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR-1+) and CD13 monocyte as well as&#xD;
           circulating cytokines and metabolites levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the levels in STEMI, NSTEMI and ischemic stroke vs. those of SCAD and healthy&#xD;
           control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEMI, NSTEMI and stroke subjects will have a higher level of P2X4, Flt-1+ (VEGFR- 1+) and&#xD;
      CD13 monocytes than age-matched SCAD and healthy control subjects.&#xD;

        Recruitment will take place at UConn Health Center. The target populations of 300 will be&#xD;
        those with STEMI (60 subjects), NSTEMI (60 subjects) and SCAD (60 subjects), ischemic&#xD;
        stroke (60 subjects), and age-matched non-disease subjects (60 subjects). The researchers&#xD;
        anticipate that 5% of all recruited subjects will be African American and another 3% will&#xD;
        be Latinos and Asians. This represents the distribution of populations recruited in the&#xD;
        past for heart disease studies.&#xD;
