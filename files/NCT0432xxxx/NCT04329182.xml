  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is the prototype of the spondyloarthropathies as a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory rheumatic disease presenting mainly with inflammation of the axial skeleton,&#xD;
      peripheral arthritis, and enthesitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacroiliitis is an important sign of AS, and it is used to describe unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      involvement of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis of AS is important, since some changes associated with the disease are&#xD;
      irreversible, and early diagnosis can also improve the ultimate clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are frequently used as image tools to investigate&#xD;
      sacroiliitis in AS patients. X-ray could show the structural lesion of sacroiliac joints&#xD;
      (SIJs), but could not show the lesions in the early stage of disease. MRI can quantify active&#xD;
      in¬flammatory lesions of SIJs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, MRI is relatively expensive and time-consuming, and its routine use in patient&#xD;
      visits during ther¬apy would be difficult. Another factor that limits usage of MRI is that an&#xD;
      important proportion of AS patients have prostheses. Therefore, an easier and cheaper method&#xD;
      is needed to detect the degree of spinal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography (US) is an inexpensive, non-invasive and non-radiating technique, which can&#xD;
      be used in daily clinical practice .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal ultrasonography (US) has gained increasing attention in many areas of&#xD;
      rheumatology . In the area of spondyloarthropathy, Doppler US has been used frequently to&#xD;
      assess enthesitis . It was demonstrated that signs of active sacroiliitis could be detected&#xD;
      by the color Doppler ultrasonograpy (CDUS) method including increased vascularization in the&#xD;
      posterior SIJ and a lower resistance index (RI). The RI could be a quantitative indicator of&#xD;
      active sacroiliitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment options to AS are limited and mainly consist of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy .Efficacy of dis¬ease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (DMARDs) such as methotrexate is uncertain to AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of biologic drugs for treatment of AS has led to effective treatment of&#xD;
      disease symptoms and signs. However, the effect of these costly drugs on structural damage in&#xD;
      addition to the clinical findings is not clear .&#xD;
