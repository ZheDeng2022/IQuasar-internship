  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition affecting over 1 million individuals in&#xD;
      North America. SCI often results in severe motor impairments with few available treatments&#xD;
      options. Recent groundbreaking research has demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of&#xD;
      the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) greatly improves locomotion in a rat model with&#xD;
      incomplete SCI. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN - a specific nucleus within the MLR) in&#xD;
      humans has already been established as an auxillary DBS target in Parkinson Disease (PD), to&#xD;
      improve motor control and locomotion. DBS of other targets has also been safely used in&#xD;
      humans with SCI for chronic pain. These findings suggest that DBS of the PPN may have&#xD;
      potential as a therapeutic intervention in the SCI population to improve locomotion. Our goal&#xD;
      is to conduct a pioneering study in 5 select motor-incomplete chronic SCI patients that&#xD;
      cannot functionally ambulate to examine if bilateral DBS of the PPN improves walking&#xD;

      This prospective repeated measures study of the implantation of bilateral PPN electrodes in a&#xD;
      small series of chronic SCI patients will aim to examine safety, feasibility, and potential&#xD;
      efficacy. This research will investigate the effects of electrode implantation, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation and intensive locomotion training over a 1-year period. Motor assessments will be&#xD;
      performed at regular intervals with stimulation on and off in a double-blind fashion&#xD;
      (subjects and researchers will be unaware of stimulation setting), to determine if subjects&#xD;
      have improved ambulation with stimulation on compared with off, and if their ambulation&#xD;
      improves over the course of the study observation period with stimulation on.&#xD;
