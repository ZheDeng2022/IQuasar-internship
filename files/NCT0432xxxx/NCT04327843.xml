  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed, three phase project will refine and test a first-ever care approach in SSA that&#xD;
      combines LAI with a behavioral program specifically intended to promote medication adherence&#xD;
      in chronic psychotic disorders (CPDs). In addition to the novel focus, innovative elements&#xD;
      include: 1.) a manualized curriculum that targets specific barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      medication adherence in Tanzanians with CPD, 2.) targeting known, high-risk individuals with&#xD;
      CPD (those who miss ≥20% of prescribed antipsychotic medication, and 3.) using existing&#xD;
      injection clinic health workers to deliver the adherence promotion program. Strengths include&#xD;
      the highly generalizable methods and use of LAIs that are available in low-resource settings.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase 3 portion, the study team will select appropriate measures, train staff and&#xD;
      build capacity in measure implementation, and finalize the intervention for delivery by&#xD;
      healthcare workers. Finally, in a training/proof-of-concept exercise, the healthcare workers&#xD;
      will implement the adapted CAE-L in a high-risk sample of Tanzanians with CPD (individuals&#xD;
      with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who have had recent medication adherence&#xD;
      problems). Taken together, the proposed project has substantial public health importance. It&#xD;
      will provide the prerequisite materials, training and infrastructure needed for a prospective&#xD;
      trial in reducing CPD burden and improving brain health in Tanzania and other countries in&#xD;
      Sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this project is on feasibility, patient acceptability, and research&#xD;
      capacity-building. Therefore a specific hypothesis is not being tested. The investigators&#xD;
      will assess descriptive statistics and change from baseline in the primary and secondary&#xD;
      measures using standard pre-post techniques.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>The TRQ evaluates adherence to medications via a brief self-report instrument that has been validated in populations with bipolar disorder medication adherence. The TRQ identifies nonadherent individuals, defined as those who miss 20-30% or more of their medication in the last week or month. Total scores are represented as a percentage and range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater level of nonadherence (higher scores indicate worse adherence to medications).</description>

    <intervention_name>Customized Adherence Enhancement</intervention_name>
    <description>Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE): CAE targets key areas relevant to adherence in chronic psychotic disorders (CPD): 1.) inadequate understanding of mental disorder, 2.) lack of adequate medication-taking routines, 3.) poor communication with care providers and 4.) substance use which interferes with adherence and recovery. CAE delivered components are selected based upon findings from the ROMI and AMSQ. CAE will be delivered in approximately 8 sessions by a nurse interventionist, ideally at the same time that the long-acting injectable (LAI) is administered.The intervention is guided by a detailed manual and uses components and resources that are available in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Social worker interventionists will be trained to deliver CAE-L.</description>

    <intervention_name>Haloperidol Decanoate</intervention_name>
    <description>Long-acting injectable (LAI): Patients on oral haloperidol will be switched to haloperidol decanoate per manufacturer's package insert. Individuals not on antipsychotic medication at the time of screening assessment or who are on a different antipsychotic medication, will receive an oral tolerance test (OTT) consisting of up to 14 days of oral haloperidol 2-5 mg once or twice daily. If the OTT suggests good tolerability, the participant will then receive LAI (haloperidol decanoate) intramuscularly after completion of baseline assessments. Dosing of LAI will be as clinically indicated using conservative dosing to minimize drug-related adverse effects. In the CWRU studies, mean end-point dose of haloperidol decanoate was 68.0 mg, SD 21.1, Range 50-100 mg/monthly injection. It is anticipated that patients will continue on the same dose for 6 months, although dose changes will be permitted based upon clinical status. Each study participant will receive up to 8 injections during the study.</description>

          <title>ASSIST score</title>
          <description>ASSIST: Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. The ASSIST is an 8 item questionnaire to screen for use of drugs/substances. The ASSIST determines a risk score for each substance. Current frequency of substance use was calculated here using question 2 only. 0-4 was the scale with increasing numbers indicating more drug use frequency. Higher values are associated with worse outcomes/more frequent drug use. 0-3 is lower risk, 4-26 is moderate risk, and 27+ is high risk of dependence to drugs.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The small sample size, single-site enrollment, and the fact that poor medication adherence was one of the inclusion criterion may make findings less generalizable to the full spectrum of patients with CPD in Tanzania. Additionally, since we did not collect data on family burden, it is not possible to make any conclusions regarding how CAE-L may impact families and communities.</limitations_and_caveats>
