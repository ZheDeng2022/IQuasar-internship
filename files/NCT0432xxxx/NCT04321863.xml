  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a relapsing-remitting condition that requires lifelong monitoring.&#xD;
      Non-invasive tests such as faecal calprotectin (FC) are more acceptable to patients and&#xD;
      cost-effective than invasive tests such as colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FC levels can also accurately predict the degree of healing seen within the bowel at&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FC testing is labour intensive, and results are often indeterminate. There is interest in a&#xD;
      newer test called quantitative Faecal Immunochemical Testing (qFIT) in patients with CD. qFIT&#xD;
      measures the amount of blood within the stool and is used in the Scottish Bowel Cancer&#xD;
      Screening Programme. qFIT is an easier and more acceptable test for patients and is less&#xD;
      labour intensive and cheaper for the lab to process than FC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      qFIT is a useful test to 'rule-out' significant colorectal pathology including bowel cancer,&#xD;
      high risk polyps and inflammatory bowel disease in patients in the primary care setting. It&#xD;
      has also been used to predict the degree of healing seen within the bowel at colonoscopy and&#xD;
      to predict the risk of relapse in patients with UC, but not in CD. There are no studies in&#xD;
      the UK to date comparing FIT to FC as a monitoring test in patients with well-controlled CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unpublished audit data from our group has suggested that low serum zinc has higher predictive&#xD;
      accuracy at determining risk of future flare than both FC and CRP; we are unsure if this is&#xD;
      due to higher faecal losses in 'grumbling' CD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study could identify a cheaper, more acceptable and easier to interpret test to guide&#xD;
      disease activity monitoring, flare risk and treatment decisions in quiescent CD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a relapsing and remitting condition requiring lifelong monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool sampling for disease monitoring in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is non-invasive,&#xD;
      cost-effective and acceptable to patients. Faecal calprotectin (FC) and quantitative Faecal&#xD;
      Immunochemical Testing (qFIT) are both stool-based tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FC is a surrogate marker of neutrophil influx into the gut lumen. It accurately predicts&#xD;
      mucosal healing (MH) at colonoscopy, and thus FC is already widely used in clinical practice&#xD;
      in disease monitoring in CD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      qFIT, testing stool for haemoglobin, has been used in the Scottish Bowel Cancer Screening&#xD;
      Programme since November 2017. A 'negative' qFIT is also a useful 'rule-out' test for&#xD;
      significant colorectal pathology (including colorectal cancer, high-risk adenomas and IBD) in&#xD;
      primary care. qFIT has been shown to predict MH in both CD and ulcerative colitis (UC), and&#xD;
      has been used to predict relapse in patients with UC but not CD. There is no UK study to date&#xD;
      comparing the ability of qFIT and FC to predict flare in CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      qFIT is a cheaper, more stable test with a quicker turn-around time than FC. It is also less&#xD;
      labour intensive for the lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRP is a cheap and easily available biomarker but is insensitive, non-specific and inferior&#xD;
      to FC at predicting relapse in CD. CRP can also be elevated by infective complications or&#xD;
      other concomitant inflammatory disease which makes its interpretation difficult. New data&#xD;
      from our group has suggested that low serum zinc has higher predictive accuracy at&#xD;
      determining risk of future flare than both FC and CRP; we are unsure if this is due to higher&#xD;
      faecal losses in 'grumbling' CD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational, prospective cohort study will recruit patients with luminal (affecting&#xD;
      small and/or large bowel) CD in clinical remission (i.e. asymptomatic). A stool sample will&#xD;
      be used to check a qFIT and faecal zinc in addition to the routinely monitored FC. At the&#xD;
      time of routine blood collection, an additional sample will be taken to check plasma zinc.&#xD;
      CRP is already checked routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for one year, or until flare/relapse - this information will be&#xD;
      accessed remotely through electronic patient records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of qFIT, serum zinc and faecal zinc to predict relapse in CD will be compared to&#xD;
      FC using area under the ROC curve (AUC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the ability of qFIT and FC at predicting relapse/flare in patients with quiescent&#xD;
      (inactive) luminal (affecting the small and large bowel) CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse (or flare) is defined as the need for new or additional treatment for CD,&#xD;
      hospitalisation for CD, or CD related surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      qFIT is not inferior to FC at predicting flare in quiescent (inactive) luminal (affecting the&#xD;
      small and large bowel) CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the ability of serum/faecal zinc and CRP at predicting relapse in patients with&#xD;
      quiescent (inactive) luminal (affecting the small and/or large bowel) CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum/faecal zinc is superior to CRP at predicting relapse/flare in patients with quiescent&#xD;
      (inactive) luminal (affecting the small and large bowel) CD.&#xD;
