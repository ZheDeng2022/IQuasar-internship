  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have interviewed more than 120+ candidates and recruited 44 chronic marijuana users and 11&#xD;
      non-user healthy controls: 26 of the 44 MJ users actually participated in the study, 6 of the&#xD;
      26 MJ participants dropped out after their baseline magnetic resonance (MR) visits and the&#xD;
      remaining 20 participants completed the study protocol, namely completed three MR visits for&#xD;
      measurement of brain metabolites (baseline, day 7, and day 21); among the 11 healthy&#xD;
      controls, 10 completed the study protocol. We are currently analyzing collected data and&#xD;
      preparing manuscripts for peer reviewed journals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana (MJ) is the most widely used illicit drug in the US among young adults. A majority&#xD;
      of those who enter treatment for MJ dependence relapse. However, the mechanism of action of&#xD;
      MJ on brain neurochemistry, especially in connection with the reported withdrawal symptoms,&#xD;
      is still not well understood. We hypothesized that brain gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and&#xD;
      glutamate (glu) fluctuate during the transition between active exposure, early abstinence&#xD;
      (1-2 days since last use), and prolonged abstinence (7 days and more), and an imbalance of&#xD;
      GABA and glu during MJ abstinence was the metabolic source of the aforementioned withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms that make MJ abstinence so difficult for many individuals. The investigator's&#xD;
      specific aims were to measure MJ abstinence related changes in levels of GABA and glu and to&#xD;
      correlate the changes in GABA and glu with MJ withdrawal symptoms and clinical measures at&#xD;
      baseline, day 7, and day 21 into abstinence. The MR measures were conducted at 3 tesla and&#xD;
      the abstinence was verified by urinary tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels.&#xD;

        Participants were recruited without regard to sex, race, or ethnicity. Based on prior&#xD;
        research studies at McLean Hospital, in the northwest suburbs of Boston, we expect the&#xD;
        number of men and women to be approximately equal, and about 5-15% of subjects to be&#xD;
        African-American or Hispanic. Overall, these distributions are not very different from the&#xD;
        population statistics for the Greater Boston Area of 82.6% White, 8.3% African American,&#xD;
        6.3% Asian, and 2.8% of other ethnic or racial backgrounds based on 2014 census.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Participants must be 21-40 years of age. 2. Women must not be pregnant, planning to&#xD;
             get pregnant, or lactating. 3. Individuals must meet criteria of chronic, heavy use of&#xD;
             marijuana to be enrolled in the group of MJ-users. Namely, participants in this group&#xD;
             may, but do not have to, meet DSM-5 criteria for cannabis use disorder based on the&#xD;
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID-5) and they have to have had at&#xD;
             least one years of reported use of four out of seven days per week, or greater than 25&#xD;
             episodes per month. An &quot;episode&quot; is defined as an occasion of smoking separated by at&#xD;
             least one hour from another &quot;episode.&quot; 4. Participants must be able to comply with the&#xD;
             study protocol, willing to remain abstinent during the 3-week period, willing to limit&#xD;
             amounts of alcohol and tobacco consumption during the study period, and willing to&#xD;
             commit the time to participate in the study. 5. Participants must be able to provide&#xD;
