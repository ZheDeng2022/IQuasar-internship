      child 0-18 years of age, speaking English or Spanish, and being willing to attend the&#xD;
      program's core parenting workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program consists of Parenting and Healthy Relationship Education (10 Core 24/7 workshops&#xD;
      covering- 15 hours of education), financial and economic mobility programming, comprehensive&#xD;
      case management, and supplemental workshops utilizing the Within My Reach curriculum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four research questions will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What was the magnitude of change in parenting, relationship, and financial&#xD;
           responsibility outcomes from program entrance to exit?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What was the magnitude of change in parenting, relationship, and financial&#xD;
           responsibility outcomes from program entrance to six months post-exit?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How was program dose related to change in parenting, relationships, and financial&#xD;
           responsibility from program entrance to six months post-exit?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. How was program support utilization related to change in parenting, relationships, and&#xD;
           financial responsibility outcomes from program entrance to exit?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion in the sample for research questions involving program exit require completion of&#xD;
      80% of the program, defined as completing 8 out of 10 Core 24/7 workshops and a matched pre&#xD;
      and post on each question. Inclusion in the sample for research questions involving six month&#xD;
      follow-up requires completion of at least 20% of the program, defined as completing two Core&#xD;
