  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to prospectively evaluate the performance of the&#xD;
      electromechanical window according to a phonographic method, as a mean of diagnosis of long&#xD;
      QT syndrome, and to compare its performance with routine tests used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Familial long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a hereditary cardiac disorder in which most affected&#xD;
      family members have delayed ventricular repolarization manifest on the electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (ECG) as QT prolongation. This disease is associated with an increased propensity to&#xD;
      palpitations, syncope, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and sudden arrhythmic death. The&#xD;
      diagnosis relies mostly on resting ECG findings and on genetic testing. In clinical practice&#xD;
      however, this diagnosis is complicated by 2 main reasons: 1) a significant overlap in ECG&#xD;
      findings between healthy and diseased individuals and 2) a frequent identification of genetic&#xD;
      variants of unknown significance. Recent studies have suggested that echocardiographic&#xD;
      measurement of the electromechanical window (EMW - the delay between the end of mechanical&#xD;
      contraction and electrical activation of the heart) has better performance in the diagnosis&#xD;
      of LQTS. The echocardiographic technique is however too complicated for routine clinical use.&#xD;
      Preliminary work conducted at the University Hospital of Bordeaux and at the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Reunion Island has demonstrated that a phonocardiographic approach leads to&#xD;
      similar results with an improved feasibility and a good reproducibility.&#xD;

    <description>A standard ECG is recorded along with a phonocardiographic recording. The phonocardiographic recording is obtained by using a specific electronic stethoscope plugged into the auxiliary port of the ECG machine. The recording takes less than 30 seconds. The two recording methods are concomitant.&#xD;
QT interval is measured on the ECG recording, EMW is measured with ECG coupled to phonocardiography.</description>
