  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to a large disease heterogeneity, the proper management of childhood asthma may be a&#xD;
      challenging task. Despite the screening of lung function is a fundamental tool, spirometry&#xD;
      alone may not allow a reliable prediction of the disease prognosis, such as treatment&#xD;
      response and asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in&#xD;
      exhaled breath (Breathomics) is able to predict asthma exacerbations and to discriminate&#xD;
      children with persistently controlled asthma from those with uncontrolled asthma. These&#xD;
      studies have been realized through gas chromatography / mass spectroscopy techniques, which&#xD;
      also provide information on specific compounds useful for pathophysiologic research; however,&#xD;
      they are expensive and time consuming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach, scarcely adopted so far, is based on cross-reactive nonspecific&#xD;
      sensor arrays (e-noses), which may provide valuable information on disease status through&#xD;
      pattern recognition algorithms or discriminant analyses of the global sensor response pattern&#xD;
      (breath-fingerprint). In particular, the Pneumopipe速 (European patent 12425057.2, Rome,&#xD;
      Italy) is a recent and innovative device allowing direct absorption of VOCs on a cartridge&#xD;
      after an individual has normally breathed in it for 3 min. It is a very simple and cheap&#xD;
      procedure, suitable for non-collaborative populations. Moreover, cartridges may be preferable&#xD;
      over sampling bags in terms of preservation and transportability. This modern breath sampling&#xD;
      system provides repeatable measurements, and negligible overlap has been observed with&#xD;
      information provided by spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the present study is to assess whether baseline (pre-treatment)&#xD;
      spirometry and e-nose measurements may predict asthma prognosis in persistent asthmatic&#xD;
      children, in terms of response to the prescribed treatment with inhaled steroid (ICS), and to&#xD;
      provide simple rules for discriminating treatment responders and non-responders. The&#xD;
      secondary aim is to assess e-nose ability to predict asthma exacerbations, disease control&#xD;
      and adherence.&#xD;
