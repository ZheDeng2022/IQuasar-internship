  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess foot complications among patients with diabetes in Canada, using&#xD;
      patient data collected during diabetes foot assessments performed by the LMC Chiropody Team&#xD;
      between February 27, 2018 and April 17, 2019.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Among patients with diabetes, one of the major causes of increased morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      include lower-extremity complications. Patients who have peripheral neuropathy and peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease are at risk of developing foot ulcers and infection, which can lead to&#xD;
      lower-extremity amputations. Adults with diabetes in Canada are 20 times more likely to be&#xD;
      hospitalized for a nontraumatic lower limb amputation than adults without diabetes. Thus, the&#xD;
      prevention, education and early treatment of diabetes foot complications are an important&#xD;
      component of caring for patients living with diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease, risk factors for developing foot&#xD;
      ulcers include increased levels of glycated hemoglobin, onychomycosis, microvascular&#xD;
      complications, previous foot ulcer or amputation, structural deformity, and limited joint&#xD;
      mobility. To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence of foot complications, such as&#xD;
      onychomycosis, and the association of diabetes foot complications with glycemic control and&#xD;
      other diabetes risk factors, has not been assessed before in a large sample of Canadian&#xD;
      patients. To better understand foot complications among patients with diabetes in Canada, the&#xD;
      investigators will retrospectively examine patient data collected during diabetes foot&#xD;
      assessments performed by the LMC Chiropody Team. The LMC Chiropody Team is part of LMC&#xD;
      Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, which is one of the largest endocrine practice groups globally.&#xD;

        Patients with diabetes at LMC Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, who were provided with an initial&#xD;
        diabetes foot assessment supported by funding from Bausch Canada. The diabetes foot&#xD;
        assessments were performed by the LMC Chiropody Team at seven of the Ontario LMC clinics&#xD;
        between February 27, 2018 and April 17, 2019.&#xD;
