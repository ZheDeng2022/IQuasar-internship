  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Phase II trial of personalized immunotherapy in R/M HNSCC, gene expression of LAG3&#xD;
      and CTLA4 by RNA seq will be determined to select the appropriate agent (Ipilimumab or&#xD;
      Relatlimab) to add to Nivolumab in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M HNSCC) who have failed prior immunotherapy with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      or PD-L1 mAb therapy. The agent, either Ipilimumab or Relatlimab will be chosen based on the&#xD;
      highest relevant immune gene expression (CTLA4 or LAG-3) as long as the minimum difference&#xD;
      required is met.&#xD;

      In this Phase II non-randomized trial, n=40 eligible patients will have tumor tissue (core or&#xD;
      excisional/incisional) for gene expression of LAG3 and CTLA4 via RNA seq per OmniSeq Immune&#xD;
      Report Card to determine which drug (either Relatlimab or Ipilimumab) will be added to&#xD;
      Nivolumab for treatment. The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously&#xD;
      for up to 24 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). The drug to be added to Nivolumab will be based on&#xD;
      which relevant gene has the highest expression as long as the minimum difference required is&#xD;
      met. If the minimum difference is not met than a patient will be randomized to either&#xD;
      Nivolumab plus Relatlimab or Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will then receive the prescribed therapy continuously for up to 24 cycles (1&#xD;
      cycle = 28 days) with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle until progression of disease.&#xD;
      Response, evaluated by RECIST 1.1, with modifications to allow for continued therapy until&#xD;
      progressive disease is confirmed if the patient is clinically stable, will be used in the&#xD;
      trial. If the patient has confirmed progression the patient may be eligible to undergo a&#xD;
      second biopsy and second treatment on trial. If these criteria are met the patient will then&#xD;
      be treated with this new combination with repeat imaging prior to every 3rd cycle as per&#xD;
      initial treatment, until progression of disease.&#xD;
