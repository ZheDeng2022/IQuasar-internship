  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male circumcision (MC) is a critical HIV prevention intervention with global support for&#xD;
      expansion across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). MC is safe: routine programs in SSA report adverse&#xD;
      event (AE) rates well under 2%. Nevertheless, global MC guidelines require one or more&#xD;
      follow-up visits within 14 days for AE detection. Our prior research in Zimbabwe employed&#xD;
      two-way texting (2wT) between patients and providers to focus follow-up on men with potential&#xD;
      AEs, allowing men healing without complication to opt-out of routine post-operative visits.&#xD;
      2wT safely reduced client visits by 85%, suggesting that 2wT can make MC services&#xD;
      dramatically more efficient while maintaining safety. In the Republic of South Africa (RSA),&#xD;
      high-volume urban clinics, remote service delivery, and low AE identification threaten&#xD;
      quality at scale. Across more than 500,000 annual MCs performed, up to 1 million multi-stage,&#xD;
      unnecessary MC reviews are likely conducted. RSA pressure for MC expansion and severe health&#xD;
      system constraints, combined with good cell coverage, suggest 2wT's impact would be&#xD;
      significant for MC care quality and efficiency, especially in rural areas. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to develop an adaptable 2wT dissemination and implementation model at&#xD;
      scale (2wT-2-SCALE) delivered by routine MC teams, not research teams. First, a randomized&#xD;
      control trial (RCT) (phase 1: test) will rigorously evaluate how 2wT improves AE&#xD;
      ascertainment and follow-up efficiency in urban and rural clinics. Then (phase 2: intensive),&#xD;
      the investigators scale (2wT-2-SCALE) via a one-year, quasi-experimental, step-wedge design&#xD;
      with insights gained from one additional year of 2wT with routine MC teams (phase 3:&#xD;
      maintain). Guided by implementation science, the investigators employ mixed-methods to&#xD;
      evaluate 2wT-2-SCALE's impact on VMMC service quality. Our specific aims are to 1) conduct an&#xD;
      RCT to determine how 2wT increases AE ascertainment while reducing workload in the RSA&#xD;
      implementation context; 2) develop an effective dissemination and implementation strategy at&#xD;
      scale (2WT-2-SCALE) using RE-AIM to evaluate program reach, effectiveness, adoption,&#xD;
      implementation, and maintenance; and 3) use activity based micro-costing to estimate the&#xD;
      payer-perspective budget and program impact from 2wT scale-up compared to routine care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals and procedures overview of the proposed project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Aim 1: Generate SA evidence determining how 2wT increases AE ascertainment while&#xD;
           reducing workload via an un-blinded, prospective, non-inferiority, RCT in urban and&#xD;
           rural contexts comparing moderate or severe AE rate â‰¤ Day 14 post-MC and average number&#xD;
           of in-person follow- ups control and intervention arms. For Aim 1, the investigators&#xD;
           will enroll 50 and 1104 VMMC-seeking, healthy South African men ages 18 and older in a&#xD;
           pilot and the trial, respectively, with cell phones who are seeking VMMC service at up&#xD;
           to 5 health facilities/areas (1 urban and 4 rural) for participation in the randomized&#xD;
           controlled study of the two-way texting (2wT) intervention. Men in the pilot will not be&#xD;
           randomized and will be assigned texting. Men in the RCT will be randomly assigned 1:1 to&#xD;
           intervention or control condition. The investigators will also conduct brief surveys&#xD;
           with a subset up to 100 2wT study participants. Up to 10 key informant interviews will&#xD;
           also be conducted with healthcare workers and NDoH workers. Only Aim 1 is a clinical&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aim 2: To develop an effective dissemination and implementation strategy at scale&#xD;
           (2WT-2-SCALE), using RE-AIM-based evaluation of program Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption,&#xD;
           Implementation, and Maintenance. For aim 2, 800 new human subjects will be involved in&#xD;
           prospective data collection for a 2wT intensive phase that is opt-in - clients will not&#xD;
           be randomized. The investigators will also interview up to 25 new key informants with&#xD;
           healthcare workers and NDoH workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2 sub aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2a) Reach: Proportion of 2wT-2-SCALE outreach-based (rural) MC clients reached&#xD;
           (target:70% of eligible men in 1 Limpopo district by year 4 (maintenance)).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim 2b) Effectiveness: Assess 2wT-2-SCALE effect on MC program process measures (AE&#xD;
           rate,# in-person visits), and at the individual level (2wT response rate, AE severity)&#xD;
           in rural Limpopo (intensive + maintenance); Aim 2c) Adoption: Apply Diffusion of&#xD;
           Innovation 34 via mixed-methods assessment of 2wT-2- SCALE provider acceptability,&#xD;
           appropriateness, and feasibility to predict individual level adoption (target: 95%); Aim&#xD;
           2d) Implementation: Measure fidelity to 2wT-2-SCALE intervention (protocol adherence);&#xD;
           facilitators and barriers to implementation described using the Consolidated Framework&#xD;
           for Implementation Research (CFIR); Aim 2e) Maintenance: % of target MC districts&#xD;
           sustaining 2wT as designed in maintenance phase (target: &gt;90% at 6 months, &gt;80% at 12&#xD;
           months, and &gt;70% at 18 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aim 3: Use activity based micro-costing to estimate the budget and program impact from&#xD;
           the payer perspective to scale-up the 2wT intervention compared to the standard of care.&#xD;
           For Aim 3, no human subjects will be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 STUDY DESIGN: Phase 1 RCT Study overview: Following usability testing with both&#xD;
      healthcare workers and 2wT VMMC clients during a 50-man pilot, the investigators will test if&#xD;
      two-way texting (2wT) reduces unnecessary follow-up visits without compromising patient&#xD;
      safety using a randomized control trial of 1104 men randomized 1:1 in 1 large, urban VMMC&#xD;
      clinic and 4 rural sites clustered within one implementation team. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess acceptability and feasibility working towards system integration and sustainability in&#xD;
      RSA and beyond. Qualitative interviews with 2wT teams help inform acceptability, feasibility,&#xD;
      and usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT OVERVIEW:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on prior experience in Zimbabwe, up to 50 men (25 rural and 25 urban) assigned to&#xD;
           texting intervention will be needed for the pilot depending to reach maximum system&#xD;
           stability (after making adaptations) and to reach healthcare worker efficiency and&#xD;
           comfort. This increases the quality of the full study. Not randomized. Enrolled into&#xD;
           texting. Not included in outcome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1104 men in the full study randomized in a 1:1 ratio of texting and control for 552 men&#xD;
           in texting and 552 in control (routine care).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Same recruitment, consent, and follow-up procedures in pilot and intervention as&#xD;
           outlined, per group, below&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  10 healthcare workers for qualitative interviews for the RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Study preparation: PILOT The investigators will conduct a rapid situation analysis&#xD;
                with healthcare workers, VMMC clients, and stakeholders to assess suitable&#xD;
                responses to VMMC client texts, setting standards for text responses and in-person&#xD;
                follow-up. The investigators will modify existing usability surveys for this public&#xD;
                health context. A small pilot with 50 VMMC clients who will be enrolled in the&#xD;
                texting intervention will include usability testing with both 2wT clients and&#xD;
                nurses implementing the 2wT system, illuminating system experiences from both&#xD;
                perspectives to inform full study implementation. Data from the pilot will not be&#xD;
                included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT (PILOT AND FULL STUDY):&#xD;
&#xD;
                Each site will establish local recruitment and screening methods that&#xD;
                operationalize protocol-specified requirements for eligibility determination in a&#xD;
                manner that is tailored to and most efficient for the local study setting and&#xD;
                target study population. In brief, information about the study will be disseminated&#xD;
                at the selected sites. VMMC demand creation as part of routine program practice&#xD;
                will support study recruitment. HCW recruited for participation in the study will&#xD;
                be reached at their workplaces (the health care facilities) following communication&#xD;
                between the study team and the site leadership. VMMC clients will be recruited in&#xD;
                the VMMC clinic area. Recruitment will be managed by a specifically-trained study&#xD;
                coordinator who will meet with VMMC patients to sensitize them about the&#xD;
                opportunity to participate in a study of text-based follow-up; those meeting&#xD;
                eligibility criteria will be individually informed by study staff about the&#xD;
                opportunity to participate. Interested patients will be referred to the site 2WT&#xD;
                study coordinator. This person will meet with patients in a private setting,&#xD;
                further explain the study, confirm study eligibility, and seek informed consent.&#xD;
                Participant enrollment may be made by teams/clinicians using the Medic Mobile&#xD;
                phone/tablet app or the laptop-based system.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. RANDOMIZATION PROCESS:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The investigators will conduct randomization using a randomized block design,&#xD;
                ensuring that each group of 20 envelopes has 10 intervention and 10 control per&#xD;
                block, shuffling each block to ensure a near random order. The full set of 1104&#xD;
                will be numbered before distribution to sites. Each group assignment envelope will&#xD;
                be selected by the coordinator and then opened by the participant and shown to the&#xD;
                coordinator or 2WT enrollment coordinator. Security envelopes will be used to help&#xD;
                prevent selection of assigned group. Subjects within each block are randomly&#xD;
                assigned to treatment conditions. This design reduces variability within treatment&#xD;
                conditions and potential confounding, allowing for more interim analysis with near&#xD;
                equal size groups and more certain randomization within sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Standard VMMC care (Control arm): For the 552 men randomized into the control arm,&#xD;
                the investigators follow all NDOH protocols based on WHO guidelines 1 including&#xD;
                routine surgical VMMC follow-up on post-surgery days 2, 7 and 21 (Table 1) 2.&#xD;
                Patients may seek care outside scheduled visits for suspicion of AEs at any&#xD;
                healthcare facility at any time but most often return to their VMMC site. Referral&#xD;
                cards for VMMC clients provide local numbers for patients to text, call, or request&#xD;
                a call back for emergencies. A standardized approach is used to assess, identify,&#xD;
                and record the severity of AEs 3. All VMMC care, from assessment of all AEs through&#xD;
                complete healing, is provided free to clients. Clients who do not return to the&#xD;
                clinic for follow-up on Day 2 or Day 7 are considered lost to follow-up (LTFU). For&#xD;
                the purposes of this study, control arm VMMC clients will be asked to come in on&#xD;
                Day 14 for an additional follow-up visit. Active follow-up by phone call is&#xD;
                provided at Day 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. VMMC care procedures (2wT arm): The investigators will conduct a prospective,&#xD;
                un-blinded, randomized control trial (RCT) among VMMC clients in a 1:1 ratio of&#xD;
                control to intervention. Study participants and clinic staff are not masked to&#xD;
                treatment. For the 552 men randomized into the intervention arm, men in the 2wT&#xD;
                will receive routine VMMC surgical care and counseling, including referral cards&#xD;
                for emergencies. 2wT clients will receive automated daily texts from days 1-13. It&#xD;
                is free to receive call and texts; it costs approximately $0.04 to send a SMS in&#xD;
                RSA 4. If they respond that they suspect no adverse event, no immediate follow-up&#xD;
                action will be taken. If a 2wT VMMC client responds affirmatively to any daily text&#xD;
                that he suspects an AE, a VMMC nurse will exchange modifiable, scripted texts with&#xD;
                the client to determine the symptoms, frequency, and severity. Then, if deemed&#xD;
                necessary, the client will be asked to return to clinic the following day or&#xD;
                earlier if an emergency is suspected. AE management will adhere to NDOH standard&#xD;
                care. All study participants will be asked to come to the clinic for&#xD;
                study-specific, Day 14 follow-up to review healing and verify adverse event&#xD;
                reporting. If 2wT patients do not respond to texts or phone and do not return on&#xD;
                Day 14, they will be traced by SMS, Phone and up to 2 visits to their home after&#xD;
                which they will be considered LTFU. Day 14 was chosen for verification because 95%&#xD;
                of all AEs within a similar VMMC program in Zimbabwe are reported Day 14 or earlier&#xD;
                5, suggesting that most AEs have occurred by this time point. In a previous field&#xD;
                study of AEs, the most common AEs of bleeding and infection were found a mean of&#xD;
                6.7 and 9.0 days, respectively, after VMMC, further supporting the 14 day period&#xD;
                used in this and a previous study. The Day 14 review will be conducted by routine&#xD;
                VMMC providers according to NDOH review guidelines. At Day 21, The investigators&#xD;
                will implement a brief text-based survey with 2wT clients to ascertain complete&#xD;
                healing, providing stronger inferences at study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCW: Brief Qualitative interviews with staff will occur on or after the study mid-point when&#xD;
      the system will be optimal. Interviews are only to solicit feedback for 2WT implementation,&#xD;
      acceptability, and feasibility. Up to Ten HCWs will be interviewed, selected by convenience.&#xD;
      HCWs can decline without repercussion on their employment. Interviews will be conducted in a&#xD;
      private location by a trained interviewer who has extensive experience conducting qualitative&#xD;
      interviews and will be able to effectively sensitize HCWs to the interview process. The&#xD;
      interviews are brief. They are likely to take 5-15 minutes, but the investigators allow for&#xD;
      30 in case there is sufficient interest in sharing. They have a separate informed consent.&#xD;
