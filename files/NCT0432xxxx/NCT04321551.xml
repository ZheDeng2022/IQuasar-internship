  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Significant proportions of TGM report desired child-bearing and many engage in receptive&#xD;
      vaginal intercourse with cisgender men or transgender women. Despite the frequency of desired&#xD;
      fertility among TGM, secondary amenorrhea and associated infertility are common in those&#xD;
      undergoing treatment with testosterone. Although testosterone is the mainstay of gender&#xD;
      affirming care in this population, the mechanism of androgen-induced menstrual suppression is&#xD;
      unknown due to the limited quantity of well-designed, clinical research investigating&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function in testosterone-treated TGM. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      gender affirming testosterone therapy causes infertility in transgender men through impaired&#xD;
      gonadotropin secretion, altered ovarian function, or a combination of these effects. We&#xD;
      therefore propose to study the effect of high-dose, exogenous androgen administration on&#xD;
      pituitary function, ovarian folliculogenesis, and ovulatory function in transgender men.&#xD;
      Please note that administration of testosterone cyprionate, at a dose of 50 mg (T50) per&#xD;
      week, will be done at Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest by Dr. Kyle Bukowski. Who&#xD;
      is the Associate Medical Director. In the first of our studies, in order to determine whether&#xD;
      normal feedback mechanisms responsible for induction of gonadotropin responses to circulating&#xD;
      steroid hormones are altered in TGM on testosterone, we will transiently administer steroid&#xD;
      hormones and measure resultant changes in gonadotropin secretion among TGM before and during&#xD;
      testosterone therapy, and in untreated cisgender female control subjects. In the next study,&#xD;
      to determine whether testosterone alters ovarian follicle function and steroidogenesis, we&#xD;
      will assess granulosa cell production of estradiol in response to FSH stimulation in TGM&#xD;
      before and during testosterone therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thirteen transgender men (TGM) and 13 cisgender female (CGF) control subjects with congruent&#xD;
      female gender identity and sex will be enrolled in the following studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Ovarian follicle responses to FSH stimulation All subjects in each study group will&#xD;
      undergo assessment of follicle responsiveness to intravenous (i.v.) recombinant FSH (r-FSH)&#xD;
      stimulation 150 IU based on our previously published studies. Prior to testosterone treatment&#xD;
      in TGM, r-FSH stimulation will be performed in the early follicular phase (EFP) of the cycle&#xD;
      to approximate basal serum estradiol levels observed in the testosterone-treated TGM. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be obtained before, and at 12 and 24 hours following each i.v. r-FSH injection&#xD;
      for measurements of gonadotropins and sex steroid hormones. Subsequent r-FSH stimulation will&#xD;
      be conducted on a random day at three- and six- months after testosterone treatment as we&#xD;
      expect testosterone-treated TGM to be anovulatory. Blood samples will be obtained before, and&#xD;
      at 12 and 24 hours following each i.v. r-FSH injection for measurements of sex steroid&#xD;
      hormones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Gonadotropin responses to steroid hormone feedback On the morning of study day 1 (t=0) of&#xD;
      study each subject will have a blood sample drawn in the morning for baseline hormone&#xD;
      determinations. Subsequently, an intramuscular (i.m.) injection of estradiol valerate, 5 mg,&#xD;
      will be administered. On study day 2 (t=48 hr), each subject will be administered an i.m.&#xD;
      injection of progesterone in oil, 50 mg. Blood samples will be obtained t=0, +24, +48, +60,&#xD;
      and +72 hr for the assessment of gonadotropin and steroid hormone levels. Serum FSH and LH&#xD;
      levels following steroid administration in TGM will be compared to those observed in&#xD;
      untreated TGM and CGF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in each study group will undergo the same intervention as described above. TGM&#xD;
      subjects will be studied during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle before and&#xD;
      after three and six months of testosterone therapy. Should amenorrhea occur during T50&#xD;
      therapy, then study will be performed on a random day within one week of the three- and six-&#xD;
      month time points. Untreated CGF controls will be studied once during the early follicular&#xD;
      phase of the menstrual cycle.&#xD;
