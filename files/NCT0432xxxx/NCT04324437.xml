  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related ill-health and death in the United Kingdom&#xD;
      (UK), but with advances in systemic anti-cancer therapies the prognosis for people in later&#xD;
      stages is improving. There is growing evidence that electronic systems which enable patients&#xD;
      to monitor and report symptoms can help improve symptom control and patient care. This study&#xD;
      aims to investigate optimal ways of introducing an electronic symptom reporting system&#xD;
      (eRAPID) in lung cancer care at Leeds Cancer Centre. eRAPID was developed by the University&#xD;
      of Leeds and its integration with the electronic health records at Leeds Cancer Centre&#xD;
      enables staff to view patient symptom reports directly. eRAPID provides advice to patients&#xD;
      about self-management of milder symptoms, for serious symptoms patients are encouraged to&#xD;
      contact the hospital and an alert is sent to the nurse or doctor by email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility and usefulness of an electronic symptom&#xD;
      reporting system (eRAPID) for lung cancer patients and healthcare professionals during the&#xD;
      treatment of lung cancer and during one year follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two groups of patients will be recruited on the basis of their access to the internet at home&#xD;
      (rather than randomisation). It is anticipated that approximately 100 patients will enrol&#xD;
      into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Patients with online access at home will be asked to report weekly using their&#xD;
           own devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Patients without online access will be asked to report on a tablet computer&#xD;
           before their planned clinic appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eRAPID questionnaire is based on existing eRAPID items with the addition of new items&#xD;
      specific to lung cancer. These have been developed by the clinical team and patient groups&#xD;
      have been consulted over the suitability of the wording used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of patient reported symptoms, quality of life and clinical information will be&#xD;
      descriptive. Disease-related symptoms and health-related quality of life will be compared&#xD;
      across groups of patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer. Treatment-related side effects of&#xD;
      patients will be compared across the different types of treatment received. To determine the&#xD;
      best means of engaging patients in systematic electronic reporting, the recruitment and&#xD;
      compliance rate will be compared between the two patient groups. The utility of patient&#xD;
      reported information to healthcare staff will be assessed through staff interviews.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. There&#xD;
      are 2 main categories of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer diagnoses, almost 70% of&#xD;
      NSCLC cases are diagnosed in the advanced/metastatic stages (IIIB-IV) of the disease. Pleural&#xD;
      mesothelioma is another rare form of lung cancer, the average incidence across European&#xD;
      countries is 20 cases per million people. Historically, patients with NSCLC were treated with&#xD;
      the same algorithm, without consideration of their histological sub-type or their molecular&#xD;
      profile. More recently, personalised therapies based on histology and/or molecular pathology&#xD;
      have become the standard of care. The stage of NSCLC determines treatment options, with&#xD;
      surgery being the mainstay of treatment for patients in early stages of the disease (stages&#xD;
      I-IIIA). Additionally, those with localised disease spread (stages II and IIIA) may receive&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy [11]. In patients with advanced/metastatic disease (stages IIIB-IV) and a&#xD;
      performance status (PS) score of 0-2, the first line treatment options include chemotherapy&#xD;
      regimens with or without immunotherapy or targeted biological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) encompass data self-reported by patients about how&#xD;
      they feel and function and include symptoms, physical function, emotional distress and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL). PROMs are becoming important for patient care, as&#xD;
      they provide the means of recording the experience of the patient in a structured format&#xD;
      readily available to relevant clinical staff. Recently a randomised control trial (RCT) in&#xD;
      advanced lung cancer using web-mediated follow-up showed overall survival benefit of 7-9&#xD;
      months compared to usual care, whilst maintaining cost-effectiveness. The relapses were&#xD;
      detected earlier in patients in the intervention arm facilitating earlier and appropriate&#xD;
      treatment initiation compared to patients in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims: This study will systematically capture patient reported disease-related symptoms,&#xD;
      treatment-related side effects and HRQoL in a cohort of patients treated with systemic&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy (SACT) for thoracic cancer. The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare disease-related symptoms and HRQoL across groups of patients stratified by&#xD;
           patient and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare treatment-related side effects of patients prescribed chemotherapy, tyrosine&#xD;
           kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare outcomes, such as healthcare resource utilisation (HCRU), in patients&#xD;
           systematically self-reporting symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To examine patient acceptance, feasibility of this approach and optimal means of&#xD;
           engaging with patients in the systematic PROMs reporting in a real world setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the utility of PROMs reported by patients to their healthcare professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an interventional, prospective study conducted at a single cancer&#xD;
      centre. Patients with a diagnosis of thoracic cancer prescribed SACT will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study at oncology clinic visits. The intervention is an electronic patient self-report of&#xD;
      disease-related symptoms, treatment-related side effects and HRQoL. This design allows the&#xD;
      assessment of the utility to clinicians of PROMs reporting in the real world setting and&#xD;
      provides an opportunity to study customised patient interventions based on PROMs reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1: Patients with online access at home, able to&#xD;
      report PROMs from a location of their choice, using their own devices (laptop, tablet, smart&#xD;
      phone). They will be requested to report weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Cohort 2: Patients without online access who will complete PROMs on a tablet before their&#xD;
      scheduled clinic appointment in a private space at Leeds Cancer Centre (LCC). Reporting&#xD;
      frequency will be governed by frequency of routine clinical visits.&#xD;
&#xD;

        -  Cisplatin-based Non-platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pemetrexed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: All patients meeting patient selection criteria during the recruitment&#xD;
      period will be invited to participate. Approximately 100 patients are expected to be enrolled&#xD;
      (70 patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC, 20 patients with a diagnosis of SCLC, and 10 patients&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma). This estimation is based on the number of thoracic&#xD;
      cancer patients receiving SACT at LCC, the proportion who relapse, and 75% of eligible&#xD;
      patients enrolling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and study duration: Index date is defined in both cohorts as the initiation of a&#xD;
      line of SACT within the study period. For patients newly diagnosed within the study period,&#xD;
      this will be the initiation of their 1st line of therapy (LoT). For patients diagnosed prior&#xD;
      to the study period, the index date will be initiation of 1st or subsequent LoT. Collecting&#xD;
      baseline PROMs at the start of a LoT allows the analysis of change from baseline in disease-&#xD;
      and treatment-related side effects with each new LoT. If the patient wishes to be enrolled,&#xD;
      they will be trained how to use the system. The formal consent will be completed&#xD;
      electronically and then participant complete baseline questionnaires on the electronic&#xD;
      platform. Recruitment will occur over 12-months with 12-month follow-up. There will be an&#xD;
      interim study review to assess the number of patients enrolled, description of patients&#xD;
      enrolled, systematic PROMs reporting compliance, and interim participant feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments' reporting frequency: Three instruments will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. eRAPID Patient reported adverse events (PRAE) CTCAE adapted symptom questionnaire for&#xD;
           lung cancer, including disease-related symptoms and treatment-related side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. EuroQol General Quality of Life questionnaire Cohort 1 Patients (Online access) symptom&#xD;
           questionnaire is to be completed weekly, and the quality of life questionnaires at&#xD;
           baseline and then every 12 weeks over the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 Patients' (In clinic access) symptom questionnaire to be completed online before&#xD;
      routine clinic appointment. Type of treatment and frequency of clinics will determine the&#xD;
      frequency of questionnaire completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Software: eRAPID uses a web-based questionnaire builder system (QTool) to support the&#xD;
      collection and clinical integration of patients' reports. Algorithmic questionnaire scoring&#xD;
      generates severity-dependent management advice to patients and staff when patients&#xD;
      self-reports using the PRAE CTCAE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients login to QTool using a unique user name and password, complete the&#xD;
           questionnaires remotely on computers/mobile phones/tablets or on a tablet provided in&#xD;
           clinic at LCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate, tailored advice derived from a series of algorithms is generated in response&#xD;
           to reported symptoms and toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If severe symptoms are reported, patients are advised to contact the hospital&#xD;
           immediately and an alert is sent to a member of the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For mild/moderate complications, information about self-managing these issues are&#xD;
           provided in QTool and hyperlinks to more detailed advice on the eRAPID patient websites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMs are available for patients to view in their QTool login and for clinicians to&#xD;
           review in the individuals' electronic medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare professionals' and patient feedback: Interviews will be conducted with healthcare&#xD;
      professionals and patients about their views of using the eRAPID system. Five members of&#xD;
      staff will be interviewed (n=3 oncologists, n=2 nurses) twice during the study period to gain&#xD;
      feedback on the usefulness of the eRAPID system in lung cancer care. Approximately 12&#xD;
      patients will be interviewed at different stages of using the system from home or from&#xD;
      clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables: Patient characteristics, clinical characteristics, treatment variables&#xD;
      will be captured either prospectively in a study case report form (CRF) or retrospectively by&#xD;
      extracting the data from hospital electronic systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Baseline demographic and clinical data will be tabulated using frequencies and&#xD;
      summary by age, gender, cancer pathology type, stage and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy feasibility will be evaluated by summarising the eligibility and consent&#xD;
      processes. The proportion of patients who meet the eligibility criteria in terms of cancer&#xD;
      site, treatment type and timescale will be reported using information from the electronic&#xD;
      health record. The number of patients completing the adverse events (AE) online vs those in&#xD;
      clinic will be summarised. Where available, reasons for ineligibility and non-participation&#xD;
      in the study will be summarised. Retention during the study, including the number of&#xD;
      participants withdrawing from the study and the timing of and reasons for withdrawal will&#xD;
      also be presented. The number of participants involved at each stage will be summarised&#xD;
      (patients identified, approached, consented, completed symptoms and side effects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrity of systems will be assessed by exploring any technical issues encountered&#xD;
      during the study, summarising the rates of questionnaires not being fully completed (assessed&#xD;
      by incomplete calls or time-outs depending on the system used). Reasons for patients&#xD;
      completing symptoms and side effects in clinic rather than from home will be presented. Time&#xD;
      taken to complete the questionnaires will be summarised using time stamps of start and end of&#xD;
      calls/online sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The numbers of expected and additional AE reports and severe AE alerts generated will be&#xD;
      summarised overall, by cancer type, treatment and completion modality (online vs clinic). The&#xD;
      number of telephone calls to hospital staff, acute admissions, ward stays, contacts with&#xD;
      general practitioner and/or community services (where available) and number of deaths will be&#xD;
      summarised overall and by treatment modality. Changes to supportive medication, treatment&#xD;
      (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies) doses and treatment plans and the&#xD;
      percentage of planned therapy received will be summarised overall and by treatment&#xD;
      modalities. Differences between treatments may be explored using logistic or linear&#xD;
      regression (as appropriate) adjusted for stratification factors. Clinician/staff&#xD;
      acceptability will be explored by content analysis of the interviews and field notes.&#xD;
