    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test different interventions to determine the most&#xD;
      effective way to promote flu vaccine uptake in a high-risk population identified by an&#xD;
      &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI) or machine learning (ML) algorithm. The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect on flu vaccination rates of informing health-system patients who are&#xD;
           identified by an ML analysis of EHR data to be at high risk for flu complications that&#xD;
           they are at high risk with either (a) no additional explanation, (b) an explanation that&#xD;
           this determination comes from an analysis of their medical records, and (c) the&#xD;
           additional explanation that an AI or ML algorithm made this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effects of the same three interventions on diagnoses of flu in the same&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      On average, 8% of the US population gets sick from flu each flu season (Tokars et al. 2018).&#xD;
      Since 2010, the annual disease burden of influenza has included 9-45 million illnesses,&#xD;
      140,000-810,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000-61,000 deaths (CDC 2020). The CDC recommends the&#xD;
      flu vaccination to everyone aged 6+ months, with rare exception; almost anyone can benefit&#xD;
      from the vaccine, which can reduce illnesses, missed work, hospitalizations, and death (CDC&#xD;
      2019a). Flu vaccination will be especially important for high-risk patients during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic so that flu cases are reduced and resources conserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most recover from influenza without treatment, the elderly, those with comorbidities,&#xD;
      and other high-risk individuals can experience complications such as pneumonia, other&#xD;
      respiratory illness, and death. Geisinger, a large health system in Pennsylvania and New&#xD;
      Jersey, has partnered with Medial EarlySign (Medial; www.earlysign.com) to develop a machine&#xD;
      learning (ML) algorithm to identify patients at risk for serious (moderate to severe)&#xD;
      flu-associated complications on the basis of their existing electronic health record (EHR)&#xD;
      data. Geisinger will deploy this system during the 2020-21 flu season and contact the&#xD;
      identified patients with special messages (in addition to standard efforts made by the health&#xD;
      system every flu season) to encourage vaccination. Flu vaccination will be especially&#xD;
      important for high-risk patients during the COVID-19 pandemic so that flu cases are reduced&#xD;
      and resources conserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published results suggest Medial's ML systems identify high-risk patients in other contexts&#xD;
      (Goshen et al., 2018; Zack et al., 2019). However, there is little evidence about (a) whether&#xD;
      informing patients they are at high risk makes them more likely to receive vaccination; (b)&#xD;
      how patients react to being told their risk status is the result of an analysis of their&#xD;
      health records; and (c) whether informing patients their risk status has been determined by&#xD;
      an &quot;algorithm,&quot; by &quot;machine learning,&quot; and/or by &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; will increase or&#xD;
      decrease their likelihood of getting vaccinated. This study will address these gaps in the&#xD;
      literature, which are especially important in light of the anticipated future growth of AI/ML&#xD;
      system use throughout healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medial's algorithm is an example of how interoperable health information exchange (HIE)-the&#xD;
      ability for health information technology to share patient data-can improve the efficiency&#xD;
      and effectiveness of healthcare. However, patients may not appreciate these benefits or the&#xD;
      fact that healthcare has become substantially more integrated and collaborative. A systematic&#xD;
      review of patient privacy concerns about HIE found that 15-74% of patients expressed privacy&#xD;
      concerns, depending on the study, and concluded that patient perspectives remain poorly&#xD;
      understood. A flu outreach message that explicitly references a review of patient medical&#xD;
      records might backfire as patients react badly to a sense they have lost control of their&#xD;
      health records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is conflicting evidence on how people respond to advice or information that comes from&#xD;
      an algorithm or machine. Dietvorst et al. (2015) documented a pattern of &quot;algorithm&#xD;
      aversion,&quot; in which people choose inferior human over superior algorithmic forecasts,&#xD;
      especially after they observed the algorithm make an error. In contrast, Logg et al. (2018)&#xD;
      described &quot;algorithm appreciation,&quot; in which people followed advice more when they thought it&#xD;
      came from algorithms than when they thought it came from human beings. Finally, Bigman and&#xD;
      Gray (2019) found aversion to algorithms that make &quot;moral decisions,&quot; including a&#xD;
      (fictitious) medical decision of choosing whether or not to operate on a high-risk patient.&#xD;
      In the current setting, the algorithm is merely advising patients on taking an action (an&#xD;
      annual flu shot) that is already the standard of care, and there is no opportunity to observe&#xD;
      an erroneous recommendation, so the hypothesis is that &quot;algorithm appreciation&quot; will cause&#xD;
      people to react positively to being informed of the algorithm's role. Thus, this study will&#xD;
      address two important research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does informing patients that they are at high risk for flu complications (a) increase&#xD;
           the likelihood that they will receive flu vaccine; and (b) decrease the likelihood that&#xD;
           they receive diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like symptoms in the ensuing flu season?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does informing patients that their high-risk status was determined (a) by analyzing&#xD;
           their medical records (vs. by no specified method); and (b) by an AI/ML algorithm*&#xD;
           analyzing their medical records (as opposed to via unspecified methods or human medical&#xD;
           records analysis) affect the likelihood that they receive the flu vaccine and/or&#xD;
           diagnoses of flu and/or flu-like symptoms in the ensuing flu season?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect on flu vaccination rates of informing health-system patients who are&#xD;
           identified by an ML analysis of EHR data to be at high-risk for flu complications that&#xD;
           they are at high risk with either (a) no additional explanation, (b) an explanation that&#xD;
           this determination comes from an analysis of their medical records, and (c) the&#xD;
           additional explanation that an AI or ML algorithm made this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effects of the same three interventions on diagnoses of flu in the same&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included in the study will be current Geisinger patients 17+ years of age with one or more&#xD;
      visits to a Geisinger primary care physician (PCP) between January 1, 2008 and January 30,&#xD;
      2020 and no contraindications for flu vaccine. Medial will provide flu-complication risk&#xD;
      scores from their ML algorithm (based on coded EHR data), on the basis of which the top 10%&#xD;
      of patients at highest risk will be included. Based on prior behavior and other predictors in&#xD;
      a second ML model, Medial will also provide the likelihood each patient will get vaccinated&#xD;
      during the study flu season; these values and the primary risk scores will be used as&#xD;
      covariates in exploratory data analyses. The anticipated number of patients in the top 10% of&#xD;
      risk is 56,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On average in the last 3 flu seasons, 55% of Geisinger patients aged 65+ are vaccinated each&#xD;
      season, so we will use this as a proxy base rate for a control condition in our power&#xD;
      analysis. The study will have 92% power to detect a 2% absolute difference or greater in the&#xD;
      vaccination outcome between conditions (55% vs 57%, two-tailed alpha of .05), on the&#xD;
      assumption that each condition will have 56,000/4=14,000 patients. For the rarer outcome of&#xD;
      flu diagnosis, we have 95% power to detect a 0.8% absolute difference or greater-from an&#xD;
      estimated 3.9% rate in this high-risk population (based on the CDC estimate for people age&#xD;
      65+ [Tokars et al., 2018]) to a 3.1% rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study outcomes will be the rates of flu vaccination and flu diagnoses during the&#xD;
      2020-21 season (September-March) by targeted patients. Secondary, exploratory outcomes will&#xD;
      also be measured: Rates of flu vaccination and diagnoses by fellow household members of&#xD;
      targeted patients; rates of flu vaccination and diagnoses by non-targeted patients who were&#xD;
      assigned a risk score that fell just below the cutoff of targeted patients (&quot;sub-threshold&#xD;
      risk&quot;); rates of flu complications and flu-like symptoms among targeted patients, household&#xD;
      members, and those at sub-threshold risk; and rates of other relevant healthcare utilization&#xD;
      outcomes such as ER visits and hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) will examine the primary study outcomes as a function&#xD;
      of the study arms (between-subjects), with patient-visited PCPs and/or clinics included as&#xD;
      random effects variables, assuming high intraclass correlation coefficients. GLMMs will&#xD;
      specify a binary distribution and log-link function in the case of dichotomous outcome&#xD;
      variables (e.g., flu vaccination, flu diagnosis), and a negative binomial distribution and&#xD;
      log-link function in the case of any highly positively skewed count variables such as ER&#xD;
      visits and hospitalizations (where over-dispersion typically remains in the case of a Poisson&#xD;
      distribution model). For these exploratory analyses, within-patient change (from the same&#xD;
      period one year earlier) will also be analyzed. Also, each patient will receive the same type&#xD;
      of communication (a/b/c/d) via up to three modalities-printed letter to their mailing&#xD;
      address, SMS to their mobile phone, and/or secure message via Geisinger's patient&#xD;
      portal-depending on what information is on file for each patient. The communication channels&#xD;
      used for each patient will be covariates in later analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Note: The study will not necessarily use the terms &quot;AI,&quot; &quot;ML,&quot; or &quot;algorithm&quot; in the&#xD;
      messages to groups b, c, and d; instead, these messages will be designed to be readable and&#xD;
      comprehensible by the patient audience while still including the key concepts that&#xD;
      differentiate the interventions from one another.&#xD;
