  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the survival rates of both direct and indirect resin-based composite&#xD;
      restorations in the treatment of severe tooth wear.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tooth wear can lead to pain, discomfort and unsatisfying dental attractiveness and when&#xD;
      severe, it can compromise the dentition's prognosis. Restorative therapies for treatment of&#xD;
      severe tooth wear should be preferably minimally invasive and adhesive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares two different treatment techniques for severe tooth wear. The first&#xD;
      technique is regarded as the 'standard' technique. This is a full rehabilitation using only&#xD;
      direct composite restorations (AP-X, Kuraray, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second technique comprises a full rehabilitation using both direct and indirect resin&#xD;
      composite restorations (Estenia C&amp;B, Kuraray, Japan). 10 indirect restorations are placed on&#xD;
      specific elements i.e. first molars and palatal sides of all maxillary anterior teeth. Other&#xD;
      elements are restored conform the direct protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important benefit for the patients is the rehabilitation of their worn dentitions.&#xD;
      Functionality (teeth are less sensitive, improved chewing ability, better occlusal stability,&#xD;
      etc) and aesthetics will be improved immediately after finishing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect techniques have the advantage of a superior control over form of restorations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After written informed consent, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assigned to an experimental group using block randomization with a block size of eight and the trial design had an intended allocation ratio of 1:1. Patients were allocated randomly to one of the two restorative treatment protocols: (1) Direct Composite restorations (DCR): using direct composite restorations on all teeth or (2) Indirect Composite Restorations (ICR): using ICR on all first molars and palatal veneer restorations on maxillary anterior teeth and DCR on remaining teeth.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All teeth were reconstructed with directly applied composite restorations. No preparation of teeth was performed except in cases of sharp occlusal edges.&#xD;
Rubberdam or cotton rolls and suction devices were used for moisture control. For bonding, a 3-step etch-and-rinse adhesive was applied according to manufacturer's instructions, using 37% phosphoric acid (DMG, Hamburg, Germany), Clearfil SA Primer, and Clearfil Photobond (Kuraray, Osaka, Japan). A micro-hybrid composite (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) was used for posterior restorations and palatal veneer restorations. Restorations were placed according to the DSO-technique (Direct Shaping by Occlusion). In front teeth, both a palatal and buccal veneer restoration was placed.&#xD;
Experimental restorations were all restorations on first molars and all palatal veneer restorations on maxillary anterior teeth.</description>

    <description>Indirect 'tabletop' restorations were placed on all first molars (n=4) and palatal veneers ('backings') (n=6) on maxillary anterior teeth. Remaining teeth received directly applied restorations. Preparation of teeth for indirect restorations was limited to removal of sharp edges.&#xD;
All indirect restorations were laboratory manufactured using a micro-hybrid composite (Clearfil Estenia C&amp;B, Kuraray, Osaka, Japan). Adhesive surfaces of the restorations were air-abraded with aluminum-oxide powder (&lt;50 µm). Rubberdam or cotton rolls were used for moisture control during cementation. Seating of indirect restorations was checked intraorally, followed by cleaning of its adhesive surface with phosphoric acid 37% and application of silane (Clearfil Ceramic Primer, Kuraray, Osaka Japan).The adhesive surface of the abutment tooth was etched with phosphoric acid and ED-primer II (Kuraray) was applied. Finally, restorations were cemented, using Panavia F (Kuraray).</description>
