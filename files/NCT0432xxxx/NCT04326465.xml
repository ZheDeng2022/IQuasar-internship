      This is a pilot study that evaluates the use of Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy in&#xD;
      the treatment of Peyronie's Disease. Study participants will be assigned to receive&#xD;
      Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy at 10-15% laser density coverage.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Peyronie's Disease is a fibrosing disorder of the penis where scar tissue known as a &quot;plaque&quot;&#xD;
      forms along the shaft of the penis. This plaque can lead to penile deformity, erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction and pain during intercourse. Furthermore, Peyronie's Disease has been shown to&#xD;
      negatively affect the quality of life and cause psychosocial distress. Currently, treatments&#xD;
      for Peyronie's Disease are invasive (injections or surgery). This study investigates the use&#xD;
      of a non-invasive and extra-dermal Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy to treat chronic&#xD;
      phase Peyronie's Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy works by destroying and reducing abnormal collagen (a&#xD;
      major component found in Peyronie's Disease plaques) in scarred tissue. Although Fractional&#xD;
      Carbon Dioxide Lasers have yet to be used in the field of urology, it has already been used&#xD;
      safely and successfully to treat conditions similar to Peyronie's Disease (ie. hypertrophic&#xD;
      burn scars).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants enrolled in this study will be required to attend 6 study visits. The&#xD;
      first study visit is a 'Screening Visit'. At this visit, a medical history and baseline&#xD;
      penile measurements (degree of curvature, stretched length, and circumference deformity at&#xD;
      flaccid and erect states) will be collected. Study participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete the International Index of Erectile Function Questionnaire and Peyronie's Disease&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 'Screening Visit', study participants will be scheduled for three Fractional&#xD;
      Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy sessions. These sessions will be scheduled once every six weeks&#xD;
      (totalling 12 weeks from the first therapy session).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following, the last Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy session, there will be three&#xD;
      follow-up appointments (Week 18, Week 24, Week 52). At these visits, post-therapy penile&#xD;
      measurements, International Index of Erectile Function, and Peyronie's Disease scores will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital photographs may be taken as part of the study's analysis and to track the progress of&#xD;
      Fractional CO2 Laser Therapy. You will have the option to deny any digital photography.&#xD;

    <description>Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy is an ablative therapy where abnormal collagen in scarred tissue is destroyed to permit the formation of more organized collagen. Previous studies have demonstrated its efficacy in treating medical conditions (ex. hypertrophic scars) similar to Peyronies Disease. There is evidence that Fractional Carbon Dioxide Laser Therapy has the ability to target and alter the molecular pathways that are similar to the ones that lead to Peyronie's Disease.</description>
