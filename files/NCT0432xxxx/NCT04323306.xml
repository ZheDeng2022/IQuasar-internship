    <textblock>
      Phase 1, single -centre study in 2 parts. The study designs for each part are well&#xD;
      established for first-in-human studies and are appropriate to assess safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      preliminary pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending single dose study in&#xD;
      healthy adult participants, 7 cohorts, and 1 additional cohort may be considered if needed&#xD;
      according to the observed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sentinel dosing strategy will be implemented at each dose level to ensure the best&#xD;
      conditions of safety. Each cohort will be divided into at least 2 subgroups. The first group&#xD;
      (sentinel cohort) will include 2 participants that will be dosed on the first day, with 1&#xD;
      participant receiving MMV533 and 1 participant receiving placebo. The safety and tolerability&#xD;
      data from the sentinel cohort up to and including 96 hours post-dose will be reviewed by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, the Medical Monitor and the SponsorÂ´s Medical Director. Following a&#xD;
      satisfactory safety review, dosing of the remaining participants in the cohort may proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open label, 2-period cross-over, randomized, pilot food effect study to provide preliminary&#xD;
      information on the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of a single-dose oral&#xD;
      administration of MMV533 to healthy male and female participants aged between 18-55 years&#xD;
      old. Part 2 may be conducted in parallel to or after completion of Part 1 at the discretion&#xD;
      of the SRC. The dose will be selected by the SRC based on PK and safety results obtained in&#xD;
      Part 1 and also taking into account the human efficacious dose/exposure predicted from&#xD;
      preclinical efficacy studies in rodent malaria models.&#xD;

             Abstinent male participants must agree to start a double method if they begin a sexual&#xD;
             relationship with a female during the trial, and through to 90 days after the last&#xD;
