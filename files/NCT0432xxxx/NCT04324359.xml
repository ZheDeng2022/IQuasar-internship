  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SURF-201 is being studied for the treatment of eye inflammation and pain in people who are&#xD;
      undergoing cataract surgery. SURF-201 is an investigational drug (which means the study drug&#xD;
      is currently being tested) in the form of a sterile eye drop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see how well SURF-201 works and what side effects&#xD;
      there are, and to compare it with Vehicle (placebo). This study will involve about 80 study&#xD;
      participants at several different research sites in the United States.&#xD;
