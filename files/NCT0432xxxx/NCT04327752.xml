  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biological treatments (BT) are commonly prescribed to treat chronic inflammatory diseases in&#xD;
      children. Paradoxical reactions during treatment with a biological agent can be defined as&#xD;
      the appearance or exacerbation of a pathological condition that usually responds to this&#xD;
      class of drug while treating a patient for another condition. Limited data are available in&#xD;
      children treated by BT on cutaneous paradoxical reactions, or any other cutaneous adverse&#xD;
      events occurring during treatment. On the contrary, dermatologists tend to see and manage&#xD;
      increasing numbers of cutaneous adverse events, including paradoxical reactions. The aim of&#xD;
      this project is to describe the incidence of cutaneous adverse events, including cutaneous&#xD;
      paradoxical reactions, occurring in the pediatric population, during a treatment by BT given&#xD;
      for a chronic inflammatory disease.&#xD;

        -  For the children already under biological therapy for an inflammatory chronic disease&#xD;
             : they will benefit of one dermatologic consultation at any time of their treatment.&#xD;
             Other consultations can be asked by the patient or by his parents if any skin&#xD;
             manifestation appears beside the planned date of the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the children who are going to be treated by a biological therapy : they will&#xD;
             benefit of one dermatologic consultation BEFORE the onset of the biological therapy,&#xD;
             and on other one at 4 months afetr the beginning of the treatment. Other consultations&#xD;
             can be asked by the patient or his parents if any skin manifestation appears beside&#xD;
             the planned dates of both consultations.&#xD;
