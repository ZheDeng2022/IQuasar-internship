    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB) diseases&#xD;
      presents further problems to patient's adherence due to high pill burden and adverse effects&#xD;
      in the drug combination therapy. This situation is also a risk of the increase of multi-drug&#xD;
      resistant TB and may affect the quality of life of patients. However, the prevalence of&#xD;
      non-adherence has not been studied much in these patients in Indonesia, especially in West&#xD;
      Java with several HIV patients who are still struggling with TB as their opportunistic&#xD;
      infection. Pharmacist interventions in several studies have resulted in a better outcome of&#xD;
      patients' therapy, especially in patients who need long-term adherence and compliance with&#xD;
      drug treatment. It is hypothesized that patients' quality of life of HIV-TB co-infection&#xD;
      patients will be improved with the intervention conducted by the pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, the study aimed to evaluate the utility of study participants with specific aims&#xD;
      to describe the number of DRP and interventions applied, to describe drug concentration in&#xD;
      selected participants (TB drugs: Rifampicin and Pyrazinamide), to compare changes of CD4+&#xD;
      cell counts and plasma HIV RNA (viral load) between baseline and after of intervention, to&#xD;
      assess participants compliance and persistence to medication therapy, and descriptive&#xD;
      analysis on the direct and indirect costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, cluster-randomized study with a stepped-wedge design. Clusters&#xD;
      correspond to participating centers. A randomly selected center is crossed-over into the&#xD;
      intervention with calculation after the start of inclusions within 6-months follow-up in 3&#xD;
      different clinics in Indonesia (Bekasi City Public Hospital, Persahabatan Public Hospital&#xD;
      Jakarta and Cipto Mangunkusumo general hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions are given by a pharmacist as a drug consultant is an intervention concerning&#xD;
      the drug treatment of HAART and anti-TB. Monthly, patients will have a discussion regarding&#xD;
      their medication and drug-related problems they experience. The pharmacist will identify&#xD;
      drug-related problems before and during treatment and solve the problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: change from baseline utility (quality of life) at 6 months&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: changes from baseline in CD4+, VL, adherence, persistence at 6 months&#xD;
      and total costs.&#xD;

      1. STUDY BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 HIV and TB Diseases Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a global health concern&#xD;
           which the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 36.7 million people are living&#xD;
           with HIV (PLHIV) with 1.1 million deaths of PLHIV in 2015, worldwide. Among them, there&#xD;
           were 2.1 [1.8-2.4] million new HIV infections. Because of its immunosuppressive action,&#xD;
           people living with HIV (PLHIV) are prone to be infected with opportunistic infections,&#xD;
           such as tuberculosis (TB), pneumonia, and toxoplasmosis. TB itself is known as one of&#xD;
           the main risks of death in PLHIV as it considerably accelerates the progression of HIV&#xD;
           to AIDS by not only activating viral replication but also accentuating the decline in&#xD;
           CD4 cell counts. It is also estimated that TB would affect one-third of the world's&#xD;
           population and 9 million new cases of TB are discovered worldwide each year, with more&#xD;
           than 1 million cases occurring in patients with HIV or AIDS. The incidence of TB&#xD;
           globally has risen enormously since 1990, particularly in certain countries where there&#xD;
           is a significant overlap between HIV and TB epidemics. The risk of developing TB is 29&#xD;
           (26-31) times higher in PLHIV than people without HIV as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and&#xD;
           HIV are potentiating one another in accelerating the decrease of the immunological&#xD;
           function and causing early death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           HIV treatments have been implemented since the first production of antiretroviral drugs&#xD;
           and have been developing fast since because of the increasing number of HIV cases&#xD;
           worldwide. The introduction of ARV reduces the development of TB, but this disease&#xD;
           continues to occur among PLHIV. Antiretroviral and anti-TB drugs have their complex&#xD;
           regimens, and the combination of these drugs in HIV-TB co-infection patients has caused&#xD;
           increasingly even more complex regimens, potential toxicities, and issues of adherence&#xD;
           due to potential interaction between antiretroviral and anti-TB medications. In HIV&#xD;
           patients receiving regular antiretroviral drugs and becoming infected with TB,&#xD;
           considerations on the alteration or discontinuation of antiretroviral drugs and&#xD;
           selection of TB agents are based upon the efficacy of each selected drug, drug&#xD;
           interactions, drug resistance, prevention of treatment failure, and patient adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.2 Pharmaceutical Care Interventions Such concerning and life-threatening diseases&#xD;
           treatments have been massively conducted with a significant success worldwide, marked&#xD;
           with the lower incidence of new cases of HIV and TB. However, the major diagnostic and&#xD;
           therapeutic deficiencies remain. Health professionals, such as physicians, nurses,&#xD;
           pharmacists, and other health professionals are required to ensure the success of HIV TB&#xD;
           co-infection therapy based on the guidelines made by international organizations and&#xD;
           local governments.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the past few decades, there has been a shifting perspective of the pharmacist's role&#xD;
           from the traditional role of dispensing medication to the patient-oriented perspective&#xD;
           in collaboration with or without other health providers to achieve improvement of&#xD;
           patient outcomes as well as the improvement of quality of life. The Pharmaceutical Care&#xD;
           (PC) program which involves the specific role of a pharmacist has been implemented&#xD;
           mostly in high-income countries to hospitalized- and out-patients. Several systematic&#xD;
           reviews and meta-analysis are conducted to evaluate the impact of the patients-oriented&#xD;
           intervention in any disease states;8-12 thus the thoroughly and rigorous reviews enable&#xD;
           other researchers or health providers to assess and implement the most valid processes&#xD;
           of pharmacist intervention in their setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.3 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring in TB Drugs TDM is a multi-disciplinary clinical&#xD;
           approach of evaluating and monitoring drug concentration in the blood, defined as the&#xD;
           clinical laboratory measurement with proper medical interpretation. It is generally&#xD;
           aimed to improve the quality of patient care by adjusting a patient's drug dosage&#xD;
           individually within a therapeutic range. A combination of pharmaceutical,&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics knowledge and skills are needed to assess the&#xD;
           efficacy and safety of particular drugs to achieve a maximum benefit of the patient's&#xD;
           drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           By far, TDM has been used in many indications, such as to evaluate drug-drug&#xD;
           interactions, to assess drug efficacy and safety (toxicity level), and adherence or&#xD;
           compliance. However, TDM is not necessarily carried out for all medications. There are&#xD;
           several patients' criteria that may have the advantage of TDM, such as: patients with&#xD;
           low response of drug treatment that may lead to treatment failure, patients with poor&#xD;
           compliance to the treatment, and patients who get treated with narrow therapeutic range&#xD;
           drugs (theophylline, aminoglycoside antibiotic, cyclosporine, and lithium). It is&#xD;
           believed that TDM has a role in improving TB treatment, especially in TB patients with a&#xD;
           low response to the treatment and in HIV/TB co-infection patients. Several studies have&#xD;
           conducted TDM and revealed that it could be used as a useful strategy to identify the&#xD;
           cause of slow response in TB treatment; thus, it may shorten the time to respond and&#xD;
           achieve treatment completion and also optimize ARV dosage when combined with TB drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1.4 Pharmacoeconomics of the pharmacists' interventions There has been an increase in&#xD;
           the number of diseases burden worldwide during the past few years which inevitably&#xD;
           adding the burden of healthcare expenditures. Many strategies in healthcare settings&#xD;
           intended to constrain the expenses, especially to restrict the expenses on drugs.&#xD;
           Several studies try to assess the further impact of the intervention from the economic&#xD;
           perspective point of view whereas pharmacists as the focus or in a multidisciplinary&#xD;
           team. From a public health point of view, pharmacists may actively be involved in health&#xD;
           promotion, such as smoking cessation, prevention and treatment of chronic and infectious&#xD;
           diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the change in utility (quality of life) of study participants.&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the changes of CD4+ cell-counts between baseline and after the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the difference of plasma HIV RNA (viral load) between baseline and after the&#xD;
           study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess participants' adherence or compliance to medication therapy (antiretroviral&#xD;
           and anti-TB drugs);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the direct costs and indirect costs of the pharmacists' interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV-TB IND02017 study is a prospective, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial where&#xD;
      stepwise randomization occurs at a clinic level. Clinics will be randomized to one of three&#xD;
      roll-out schedules, each contributing at least one-month control period and one-month&#xD;
      intervention period to the analysis. Data will be collected at the level of the individual,&#xD;
      even though the randomization will be implemented at a clinic level. A stepped wedge design&#xD;
      (SWD) is a type of crossover design in which different clusters will receive both control and&#xD;
      intervention activities with varying points of time. It usually starts with all clusters in&#xD;
      the control period, and at subsequent time points, each cluster will receive the intervention&#xD;
      period with different duration of the intervention period. This design is being acknowledged&#xD;
      in recent years for pragmatic reasons, such as in the HIV disease where there is a strong&#xD;
      belief that adding new intervention will give good results than harms for patients with a&#xD;
      higher risk of ethical issues if they are randomized into control and intervention groups.&#xD;
      SWD has advantages compared to a parallel and crossover design, whereas SWD only needs fewer&#xD;
      clusters and samples, useful in trial with resources and cost constraints and ethically&#xD;
      acceptable since all the participants in clusters will receive the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 STUDY SETTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the impact of pharmacist intervention on improvement of quality of life of&#xD;
      TB-infected HIV patients will be implemented in 3 hospital clinics in Jakarta and West Java&#xD;
      (Bekasi public hospital, Persahabatan public hospital, and Cipto Mangunkusumo General&#xD;
      Hospital Jakarta). The intervention program across each of these sites is 6-months in length&#xD;
      or until treatment completion and will be operated in community clinics as this study has&#xD;
      targeted HIV/TB outpatients. Pharmacists are the investigators in this study. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for their medication therapy and evaluated by the investigator during the&#xD;
      study with the monthly intervention and counseling session at the time of medicine pick up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include all HIV patients who develop TB disease at the time of the study at&#xD;
      three participating hospital sites, and the follow-up patients will also be applied and&#xD;
      maintained throughout the study. Identification of TB disease classification in HIV patients&#xD;
      is based on the WHO standard guidelines for tuberculosis and Pedoman Nasional Pengendalian&#xD;
      Tuberculosis 2014 (the 2014 Tuberculosis Control National Guidelines), which will include&#xD;
      smear sputum results, chest X-ray, and geneXpert (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA Will be elaborated in the next section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation for the stepped wedge design is based on Hemming et al.48 We&#xD;
      considered a small effect size of 0.30 with the statistical power of 80% and 5% significance&#xD;
      in this study because no studies were investigating the effect of pharmacist intervention in&#xD;
      HIV-TB co-infection patients. Based on the assumption and t-test calculation on individual&#xD;
      randomization, such design would need 352 study participants (176 per arm). An intra-cluster&#xD;
      correlation (ICC) of 0.05 is assumed with the meaning of little correlation between the&#xD;
      clusters, which leads to a design effect of 2.12 in the stepped wedge model. With a fixed&#xD;
      number of 3 clusters (k), time of observation (t) of 5, the number of observations (m) of 2,&#xD;
      and 20% losses of follow-up patients, the sample size is calculated by N = 92 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations of the sample size of stepped wedge model are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design effect (DE-SW) Formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total sample size per cluster : M = m x (t+1) = 2 x (5+1) = 12 participants Total study&#xD;
      sample size : N = M x k = 12 x 3 = 36 participants Total required sample size : N = N x DE =&#xD;
      36 x 2.12 = 76.32 participants Total sample size : N = 76.32 + 20% excess ≈ 92 participants&#xD;
      (anticipated)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      m : the number of observations made in each cluster: 2 = quality of life and&#xD;
      adherence/monitoring drug therapy; k : the number of clusters: 3 clusters (a fixed number of&#xD;
      clusters) t : the number of steps: 5 (5 months) t+1 : the number of time points of study&#xD;
      implementation (6 time points: before starting the study (time point 1), after month 1 (time&#xD;
      point 2), after month 2 (time point 3), etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. MEASUREMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements included in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Drug-Related Problem (DRP);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of interventions;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TB outcome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adherence;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Persistence;&#xD;
