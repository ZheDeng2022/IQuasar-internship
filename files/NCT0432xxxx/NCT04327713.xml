  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish oil contains a large amount of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are&#xD;
      considered an important component of a healthy diet. As many patients do not eat fish,&#xD;
      supplementation with fish oil is a common strategy to provide sufficient amounts of these&#xD;
      particular fatty acids in daily life. Fish oil supplementation has been investigated for&#xD;
      decades for its cardio-protective effects and its ability to lower serum triglycerides.&#xD;
      People with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk for cardiovascular events and show&#xD;
      alterations in lipids with high triglycerides. Whether there is a benefit of fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation in this high risk group remains unclear with major international diabetes&#xD;
      associations recommending against the use of fish oil supplements. The European Association&#xD;
      for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) has not made any recommendations about the use of fish oils&#xD;
      in people with diabetes since 2004. To inform the update of the EASD clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines for nutrition therapy, the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of the EASD&#xD;
      has commissioned the proposed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials of the effect of fish oil supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in people with&#xD;
      diabetes and use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation&#xD;
      (GRADE) approach to assess the certainty of the evidence.&#xD;

      Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for a large proportion of annual deaths&#xD;
      around the world. In both the general population as well as in high-risk subgroups, achieving&#xD;
      a healthy diet is one approach to lower the risk for CVD. Fish oil supplements have been&#xD;
      widely investigated for cardiovascular indications, showing consistent reductions in&#xD;
      triglycerides with variable effects on other intermediate risk factors (glycemia, blood&#xD;
      pressure, inflammation) which have not translated into reductions in patient-important&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the available randomized&#xD;
      trials have failed to show a meaningful cardiovascular benefit of fish oil supplementation.&#xD;
      It is unclear whether this lack of benefit holds across all groups, especially groups with a&#xD;
      high triglyceride phenotype and at high cardiovascular risk such as those with diabetes. No&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis has specifically synthesized the evidence of the effect&#xD;
      of fish oil supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes. On the basis&#xD;
      of several recent large cardiovascular outcomes trials in people with diabetes or that&#xD;
      included subgroups of people with diabetes, the 2019 American Diabetes Association and 2018&#xD;
      Diabetes Canada clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation for cardiovascular risk reduction in people with diabetes. The European&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) have made a similar recommendation but have not&#xD;
      updated their clinical practice guidelines since 2004. To inform the update of the EASD&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group&#xD;
      (DNSG) of the EASD has commissioned a series of evidence syntheses. The proposed systematic&#xD;
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials will assess the effect of fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes and use the Grading of&#xD;
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the&#xD;
      certainty of the evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for proposed research: There is an urgent need for a synthesis of the evidence of the&#xD;
      effect of fish oil supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes to&#xD;
      inform the update of the EASD clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy. High&#xD;
      quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials with assessment&#xD;
      of the certainty of the evidence using GRADE provide the strongest form of evidence synthesis&#xD;
      to support clinical practice guidelines and public health policy development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To inform the update of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy, the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of fish oil&#xD;
      supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes and use the GRADE approach&#xD;
      to assess the certainty of the evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane&#xD;
      handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      databases will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by hand searches of&#xD;
      references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: Randomized controlled trials conducted in humans with a follow-up duration ≥&#xD;
      52 weeks investigating the effect of fish oil supplementation compared to placebo on&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes will be included. Eligible studies will be conducted in people with&#xD;
      diabetes or contain data from a subgroup of people with diabetes. Studies that are not&#xD;
      randomized, have a shorter duration (&lt;52 weeks), use multi-modal interventions that do not&#xD;
      allow for the isolation of the effect of fish oil supplementation, provide fish oil in the&#xD;
      form of a prescription pharmaceutical drug (e.g. icopsant ethyl), lack a suitable control&#xD;
      group/comparator, are not conducted in people with diabetes, and/or do not report viable&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes data will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two investigators will independently extract relevant data and assess risk&#xD;
      of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool Version 2. Events and total participants in&#xD;
      intervention group and control groups will be extracted. When avaialble, risk ratios, odds&#xD;
      ratios and hazard ratios for clinical outcomes will be extracted or derived from clinical&#xD;
      event data across exposure to either fish oil supplementation or placebo. All disagreements&#xD;
      will be resolved by consensus. Corresponding authors of relevant publications will be asked&#xD;
      for additional data if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be total CVD incidence. Secondary outcomes will be major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), CVD mortality, all-cause mortality, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD) incidence, CHD mortality, MI incidence, stroke incidence, and arrhythmia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data synthesis: Risk ratios of clinical outcomes using total events and number of people in&#xD;
      intervention and control groups will be calculated for each RCT. Reported relative ratio&#xD;
      measures will be used for studies not reporting raw numbers and hazard ratio and odds ratios&#xD;
      will be considered equivalent to risk ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel method with random effects models. Results will&#xD;
      be reported as pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity will&#xD;
      be assessed by the Cochrane Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic with I2&gt;50% and&#xD;
      P(Q) &lt;0.1 considered evidence of substantial heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are ≥10 trials, a priori subgroup analyses will be undertaken to explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity including sex, age, type of diabetes (type 1 or type 2 diabetes), prevention&#xD;
      type (primary, secondary), intervention type (supplements, supplemented foods, dietary&#xD;
      advice), comparator, study design, follow-up duration,baseline glycemic control, risk of&#xD;
      bias, funding source. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by&#xD;
      additional post hoc subgroup analyses. Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance&#xD;
      of subgroups analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis will be performed by removing one study at a time. A study will be&#xD;
      considered influential if it changes the direction or significance of effect and/or&#xD;
      heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are ≥10 trials, publication bias will be assessed by the inspection of funnel plots&#xD;
      and using Begg's and Egger's tests. If publication bias is suspected, we will attempt to&#xD;
      adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study data using the Duval and&#xD;
      Tweedie trim and fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence Assessment: The certainty of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through talks or posters at&#xD;
      regional, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact&#xD;
      factor journals. We will target public health and scientific communities interested in&#xD;
      nutrition, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Their feedback will be incorporated in order&#xD;
      to improve the public health message and to define key areas for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applicant/Co-applicant: Decision Makers will network among opinion leaders to increase&#xD;
      awareness and participate directly as committee members in the development of future&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      fish oil supplementation in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the high-risk group&#xD;
      of T2DM patients, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving health&#xD;
      outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and&#xD;
      guiding future research design.&#xD;
