      Effect of Biomechanical Correction of Tibia on Medial Joint space loading, Varus deformity&#xD;
      and functional tasks in patients with medial tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis in which&#xD;
      participants will be taken. The outcome measures taken are Trauma CAD Software, NPRS, WOMAC&#xD;
      and Goniometery will be measured at the baseline after 3rd week of the intervention.&#xD;

      Background: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) are very prevalent chronic disease of the joint which&#xD;
      causing the functional disability and pain specifically in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Purpose of the study is to see that the biomechanical correction on the tibia and&#xD;
      varus deformity is effective in the conventional treatment of participants with the KOA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A Randomized single group Pretest-Post test Clinical Trial. Methodology: Total&#xD;
      '5' subjects were included in the study with the age of 40 to 60 years based on exclusion and&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. For the pain, the NPRS will be taken, goniometer taken for the&#xD;
      measurement of range of motion, WOMAC will be taken for the physical activity measurement and&#xD;
      CAD Software will be taken to see the alignment of the affected limb. Conventional treatment&#xD;
      will also be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Biomechanical correction shows the significant improvement and improves the&#xD;
      subject's physical activity and reduces the pain and stiffness.&#xD;

    <description>This study has evidenced a large percentage of population as borderline OA; therefore, it depends mainly on the prevention of modifiable risk factors to preserve at ease movement in elderly population through awareness programs.</description>

    <description>the atrophic phenotype of knee OA was associated with a decreased likelihood of progression of JSN and cartilage loss compared to the non-atrophic knee OA phenotype.</description>

    <url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15593215</url>
    <description>Although elevated BMI increases the risk of knee OA progression, the effect of BMI is limited to knees in which moderate malalignment exists, presumably because of the combined focus of load from malalignment and the excess load from increased weight.</description>
