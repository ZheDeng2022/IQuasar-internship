  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-angle glaucoma is an ophthalmic disease often characterised by high intraocular&#xD;
      pressures. Traditionally, glaucoma is treated using medication, however, more advanced or&#xD;
      refractory glaucoma requires surgical treatment. In terms of surgery, the current&#xD;
      gold-standard is trabeculectomy. Despite good efficacy, the technique carries relatively high&#xD;
      rates of complications. The eyeWatch system has recently received CE-marking for the&#xD;
      treatment of open-angle glaucoma. During its initial clinical trial, the eyeWatch system&#xD;
      demonstrated good safety and efficacy profile. The present randomized control trial will&#xD;
      assess its safety and efficacy against the current gold-standard: trabeculectomy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the change in intraocular pressure (mmHg) from pre-operative baseline to 12-month post-operatively. Intraocular pressure will be measure at each visit using Goldmann tonometry. Baseline intraocular pressure will be defined as the mean of the last two pre-operative measurements.</description>
