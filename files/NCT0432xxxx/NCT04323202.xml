  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate anti-PD-1 Neoadjuvant therapy in Basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma to provide a better outcome when administered prior to surgery and provide a&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy to avoid surgery altogether. The study team will gather information&#xD;
      about how Basal cell carcinoma responds to Pembrolizumab prior to surgery and to gather&#xD;
      information about recurrence rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab, is an investigational (experimental) drug that may improve the response of the&#xD;
      immune system against cancer. Pembrolizumab is a manufactured antibody, much like the&#xD;
      antibodies usually made by the human body to fight off infection. The idea behind developing&#xD;
      this experimental drug is to stimulate the body's immune system to kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab antibody has been specifically made to block a program cell death-1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      protein receptor, which is found on cells of the immune system. PD-1 receptor seems to slow&#xD;
      down the immune response. Blocking PD-1 with pembrolizumab antibody may make the immune&#xD;
      response more active and may improve the response of the immune system against cancer.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is currently FDA approved for use in other malignancies. It has been used to&#xD;
      treat a number of other diseases such as certain types of lung cancer, cervical cancer and&#xD;
      lymphoma. The use of Pembrolizumab in this study is experimental because it is not approved&#xD;
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of Basal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study looking at anti-PD-1 Neoadjuvant therapy in Basal cell carcinoma in&#xD;
      participants with locoregionally advanced, but resectable basal cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
      and neck. Participants will undergo fine cut CT imaging (head and neck) and treatment with&#xD;
      the study drug pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate pathologic response to pre-operative&#xD;
      treatment of pembrolizumab in the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study include assessing safety of the intervention, and&#xD;
      assessing phenotyping immune infiltrates in non-pathology complete responders (pCRs), as well&#xD;
      as assessment of changes to the systemic immune system (e.g. peripheral blood lymphocytes&#xD;
      (PBLs)) in pCRs vs partial responders (pPR) vs non responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective will include assessing one-year recurrence rates after completion&#xD;
      of NeoAdjuvant-Adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
