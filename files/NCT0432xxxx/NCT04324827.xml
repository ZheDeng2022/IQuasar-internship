  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fascia is a connective tissue that contains a large amount of water and contains blood&#xD;
      vessels, nerves that surround the muscles and connect the various structures of the body. In&#xD;
      the event of an injury, the fascia has to cause some limitations to reduce muscle spasms,&#xD;
      neuromuscular changes and pain. In order to achieve this, it can adhere to muscles and other&#xD;
      body structures. In the physically active population, these facial adhesions may cause a&#xD;
      decrease in performance over time, while the body heals itself after mechanical stresses and&#xD;
      injuries. It is remarkable that various facial techniques are tried and compared with each&#xD;
      other in order to increase performance. The most noteworthy of these techniques is foam&#xD;
      roller (FR) and instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM). As well as myofascial&#xD;
      techniques, a preferred and highly studied method for performance improvement, especially&#xD;
      before competitions, is dynamic stretching. The aim of this study is to compare the effects&#xD;
      of these three techniques on vertical jump performance and their advantages over each other.&#xD;

      Fascia is a connective tissue that contains a large amount of water and contains blood&#xD;
      vessels, nerves that surround the muscles and connect the various structures of the body. In&#xD;
      the event of an injury, the fascia has to cause some limitations to reduce muscle spasms,&#xD;
      neuromuscular changes and pain. In order to achieve this, it can adhere to muscles and other&#xD;
      body structures. In the physically active population, these facial adhesions may cause a&#xD;
      decrease in performance over time, while the body heals itself after mechanical stresses and&#xD;
      injuries. It is remarkable that various facial techniques are tried and compared with each&#xD;
      other in order to increase performance. The most noteworthy of these techniques is foam&#xD;
      roller (FR) and instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IASTM technique is a therapeutic approach developed by James Cyriax. There are many&#xD;
      different instruments used for myofascial release. The most popular one is Graston Technique®&#xD;
      (GT® ). With specially designed instruments, longitudinal pressure is applied along the&#xD;
      fibers of the respective muscles. Damaged tissues are detected by varying tissue vibration&#xD;
      under the instrument. The therapeutic efficacy of the instruments, in particular by&#xD;
      microtrauma created in the damaged areas, induces local inflammation response, enhances scar&#xD;
      tissue destruction, enhances adhesion relaxation, enhances collagen synthesis and stimulates&#xD;
      connective tissue remodeling. In addition to its rehabilitative use, IASTM has been found to&#xD;
      be effective as a method that stimulates the nerves in muscles and increases muscle strength,&#xD;
      performance and endurance. In addition, as tissue mobility and range of motion increase,&#xD;
      performance increases and shortening of the recovery period after physical activity occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to manual therapy methods for myofascial release techniques, there are also&#xD;
      applications that patients can perform on their own. FR and Stick Roller are examples. The&#xD;
      use of pre-competition FR increases joint range of motion, reduces pain and tension,&#xD;
      increases blood flow and joint flexibility, and reduces injury rate when exercising. It also&#xD;
      relaxes scar tissue and facial adhesions, regulates muscle tone, provides relaxation in&#xD;
      excessively active muscles and improves movement quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FR application is carried out with a foam roller which can vary in size, shape and density.&#xD;
      It has become popular in clinics and athletic training halls because of their ease of use and&#xD;
      versatility. They are available in different lengths, making them easier to move and easier&#xD;
      to maneuver in different parts of the body. Best used in the treatment of large muscle&#xD;
      groups. Each muscle group has a defined position and protocol with different starting and&#xD;
      ending points. Individuals with poor collagen load ability and individuals new to FR studies&#xD;
      often have to spend more time on the cylinder to achieve the best results. Foam roller&#xD;
      sessions can be held once or twice a day and can be used as a warm-up tool before a training&#xD;
      session or as a regeneration option after training. It increases tissue extensibility by&#xD;
      opening both IASTM and FR adhesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A preferred and highly studied method for performance improvement, especially before&#xD;
      competitions, is dynamic stretching. Dynamic stretching (DS) exercises are used for warm-up&#xD;
      and relaxation before and after sports exercises. It is one of the common applications used&#xD;
      for preparation before physical exercise. Dynamic stretching exercises are a series of&#xD;
      exercises to prepare the muscles and joints in the body for the activity to be done, to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of possible injuries and to accelerate the regeneration process after&#xD;
      sports. In addition, there are studies showing that dynamic stretching exercises affect&#xD;
      performance positively and it has been found to give better results in areas such as jump and&#xD;
      sprint compared to static stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of these three techniques on vertical jump&#xD;
      performance and their advantages over each other.&#xD;

    <description>The application was applied by a GT® certified therapist with 12 years of experience in orthopedic rehabilitation and soft tissue treatments. Hamstring, gastrosoleus and plantar fascia were scanned with GT® instruments and the treated soft tissue was treated. The instruments used differ according to the application protocol and regions are determined with reference to the GT® manual. The treatment lasted 8 minutes for each leg and was applied to both legs equally and by the same person for a total of 16 minutes.</description>

    <description>FR was applied to gastrosoleus and hamstring muscle groups and plantar fascia. TriggerPoint Grid X Foam Roller and Nano Foot X Roller were used in the application. Hamstring, gastrosoleus and plantar fascia for 3 minutes were performed for a single leg. The treatment lasted 8 minutes on one leg and was applied equally to both legs for a total of 16 minutes. Before the application, the participants were informed with verbal and visual warnings about how to do the applications. During the application, the participant was instructed about the time with a stopwatch. The patient himself regulated the pressure applied to the FR; however, the participant was instructed to apply FR as much body weight as possible. The frequency of application was about 0.5 Hz (ie, each rolling cycle lasted for about 2 seconds).</description>

    <description>DS protocol was prepared with reference to the work of Faigenbaum et al 2005. The protocol consists of 10 dynamic exercises of 10 minutes of medium and high intensity. Each dynamic stretching exercise was performed at a distance of 13 meters. The participants were given a 10-second rest period between each exercise. The participants were given verbal feedback about their postures during the exercises and the video of the exercises was shown to the participant.</description>
