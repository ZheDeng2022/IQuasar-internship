  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current recommendations for dietary amino acid intake in pregnant women are based on&#xD;
      calculations from requirements of adult men. The study aims to determine methionine&#xD;
      requirements during early (11-20 weeks) and late (31-38 weeks) stages of pregnancy.&#xD;
      Methionine, an essential amino acid (building block of body protein), is necessary for&#xD;
      protein synthesis and for DNA related cellular functions. A non-invasive, novel method based&#xD;
      on different diets, stable isotopes (the safe kind) and simple breath collection will be&#xD;
      used. This method has recently been used by our laboratory to study other amino acids during&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;

      Pre-study day protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to meet for a brief (1 hour) pre-study assessment in preparation&#xD;
      for the study day. Participants' eligibility will be assessed during this time. Subjects will&#xD;
      arrive at the British Columbia Children's Hospital Research Institute's Clinical Research and&#xD;
      Evaluation Unit (CREU) having fasted overnight (at least 8 hours since last caloric intake;&#xD;
      no morning exercise, and assisted transportation to minimize stress). The consent form will&#xD;
      be thoroughly explained, with the subject instructed to stop and ask questions at any point&#xD;
      in which they are confused or uncomfortable. If the participants are willing to participate,&#xD;
      verbal consent and a signature will be obtained. On this day, participants will fill out a&#xD;
      questionnaire, and the following measurements will be taken: height (Harpenden Stadiometer;&#xD;
      Holtain Limited, UK) and weight (electric scale; HealthOMeter Professional, Sunbeam Products,&#xD;
      Inc.), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA; Q4 Bioimpedance Analyzer, RJL Systems, MI), 3&#xD;
      site skinfold (Harpenden Calipers; Baty International, UK), blood glucose (One Touch Ultra,&#xD;
      LifeScan, Inc.), and resting energy expenditure (REE; Vmax Encore, Viasys, CA). The REE&#xD;
      describes the caloric requirement for vital function in the absence of physical exertion.&#xD;
      This value will be used to calculate the total energy content of the experimental diets in&#xD;
      order to ensure that the specific caloric needs of each participant will be met. Blood&#xD;
      glucose will be assessed for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM; fasting plasma glucose level&#xD;
      of 5.3 mmol/L indicative of GDM). Skinfold and BIA measurements will be collected to&#xD;
      determine maternal fat and fat free mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study day protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy pregnant women (20-40 y) who have consented and participated in the pre-study day&#xD;
      will be studied at two stages of gestation (n=15/stage) over a range of test methionine&#xD;
      intakes (ranging from 0-40mg/kg/day). At the beginning and end of the day a urine dipstick&#xD;
      test will be performed. Each study day will be separated by a week and will receive a&#xD;
      different, random methionine test intake. On the day of the study, participants will come in&#xD;
      fasted at ~8 am for a total of eight hours. They will receive eight hourly meals, which&#xD;
      represent 1/12 of their balanced nutritional need for the day. The meals consist of an orange&#xD;
      flavoured shake with egg protein composition, balanced with sufficient carbohydrates and&#xD;
      lipids. A tracer amino acid (L-[1-13C] phenylalanine) will be provided with the test meals to&#xD;
      assess oxidation of the tracer to 13CO2 (13C- carbon dioxide) in breath in response to the&#xD;
      test/limiting amino acid (methionine). Open-circuit indirect calorimetry will be performed&#xD;
      until 5 steady state data points will be obtained for the measurement of VCO2 (Carbon Dioxide&#xD;
      Output; Vmax Encore, Viasys, CA). This technique, called the indicator amino acid oxidation&#xD;
      method, is a novel, non-invasive and completely safe approach especially in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the 8-hour study period biological samples (breath, urine, blood) will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed for 13CO2 content and sulfur amino acid metabolites.&#xD;
