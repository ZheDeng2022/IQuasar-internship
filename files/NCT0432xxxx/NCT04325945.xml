  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Suboptimal health status (SHS) is a dynamic state wherein people have not been&#xD;
      diagnosed with a disease but tend to develop diseases. People with SHS often experience&#xD;
      fatigue and other nonspecific symptoms. Early TCM-based interventions in people with SHS can&#xD;
      prevent them from developing chronic diseases, thereby reducing the burden on health&#xD;
      insurance systems. No study has explored the effects of laser acupuncture (LA) on people with&#xD;
      SHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Thirty SHS subjects with pre-hypertension or/and insomnia or/and&#xD;
      obesity will be enrolled and assigned into a experiment group and a control group randomly in&#xD;
      the first year protocol. One week before the start of the experiment, we will use&#xD;
      questionnaires and mobile cloud-based devices to assess the physical status, such as blood&#xD;
      pressure, body mass index, waist girth, hips girth, blood oxygen saturation, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse signal, autonomic nervous function, and sleep patterns. The subjects in the&#xD;
      treatment groups received LA and those in control group received sham LA for 15 minutes per&#xD;
      session twice a week for 8 weeks (16 sessions totally). All questionnaires, physical status&#xD;
      and objective sleep parameters will be assessed in treatment group and control group after&#xD;
      the 16th session. In the second year protocol, seventy SHS subjects will be enrolled and same&#xD;
      procedure will be performed as the first year protocol.&#xD;

      Background: Suboptimal health status (SHS) is a dynamic state. The term refers to an existing&#xD;
      condition of ill health that could lead to a pathological condition but could also be&#xD;
      eliminated, enabling the individual in question to return to a state of good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) emphasizes the importance of health care and the idea that&#xD;
      preventive treatment for diseases is superior to curative treatment. Therefore, TCM&#xD;
      intervention will be eliminated SHS becoming to a chronic disease. According to previous&#xD;
      studies, people with SHS without sports habits have 8 times risk of developing hypertension.&#xD;
      In addition, people with SHS have more rates of sleep disorders, which are associated with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea due to decreased oxygen maturation during sleep, than healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cloud TCM health-care model, which is combined with constitution patterns in TCM and&#xD;
      physiological parameters, applied to Taiwanese with SHS. Taiwanese with SHS, no matter yang&#xD;
      deficiency, Ying deficiency or Phlegm-stasis patterns, have decreased cardiac parasympathetic&#xD;
      activity and high frequency change in pulse power spectrum analysis at right Chi. This&#xD;
      phenomenon implied that people with SHS reduced convergence of the ministerial fire in the&#xD;
      gate of life and then developed a disharmonic status between &quot;Heart&quot; and &quot;Kidney&quot; in TCM.&#xD;
      This theory can explain why SHS has sleep disorders and prehypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser acupuncture (LA) has been used in preventive diseases and many effects. Modern&#xD;
      researches showed LA improved insomnia, circulation, analgesia and metabolism. However, it is&#xD;
      still lacking evidences of objective parameters of sleep and there are no studies about TCM&#xD;
      patterns change in SHS by LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the effects of 8 weeks' LA intervention on people with SHS presented with&#xD;
      pre-hypertension and/or sleep disorders by a cloud health-care system combined with TCM&#xD;
      patterns and physiological parameters will be investigated by 2-years protocols. The result&#xD;
      will be helpful to establish the role of LA for preventive medicine in Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Regular LA intervention can improve sleep quality and regulate blood pressure and&#xD;
      autonomic nervous function of sub-healthy people. Moreover, combining the cloud-based TCM&#xD;
      body constitution and physical healthcare system can help sub-healthy people manage their own&#xD;
      health better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Thirty SHS subjects with pre-hypertension or/and insomnia or/and&#xD;
      obesity will be enrolled and will be assigned into a experiment group and a control group&#xD;
      randomly in the first year protocol. One week before the start of the experiment, we will use&#xD;
      questionnaires and mobile cloud-based devices to assess the physical status, such as blood&#xD;
      pressure, body mass index, waist girth, hips girth, blood oxygen saturation, physical&#xD;
      activity, pulse signal, autonomic nervous function, and sleep patterns. The subjects in the&#xD;
      treatment groups received LA and those in control group received sham LA for 15 minutes per&#xD;
      session twice a week for 8 weeks (16 sessions totally). All questionnaires will assessed in&#xD;
      treatment group and control group before the first session and after the 16th session. In&#xD;
      addition, we using mobile cloud-based devices to assess the physical status, such as blood&#xD;
      pressure, blood oxygen saturation, physical activity, pulse signal, tongue examination, and&#xD;
      autonomic nervous function before and after each sessions. Furthermore, sleep patterns will&#xD;
      assessed for at least 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second year protocol, seventy SHS subjects with pre-hypertension or/and insomnia&#xD;
      or/and obesity will be enrolled. and assigned into a experiment group and a control group&#xD;
      randomly. The evaluation methods are the same as the first year protocol. Besides, we will&#xD;
      build up the cloudy system to present body constitution scores and objective parameters. The&#xD;
      auto-feedback function will be established in the second year protocol.&#xD;
