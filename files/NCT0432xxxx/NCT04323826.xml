    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effects of 1) the emulsification 2) the type of dietary&#xD;
      fat on carotenoid (CAT) absorption employing an in-vitro digestion system (Proof of Concept)&#xD;
      and well-designed randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In all, twenty-five healthy men and women (aged =19 and =45 y, approximately half men and&#xD;
      half women, with the expectation that = 20 subjects will complete the study (= 20 % dropout&#xD;
      rate)) will be recruited and each subject will participate in 4 trials (randomized and&#xD;
      crossover). Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, waist circumference, blood&#xD;
      pressure as well as skin scan carotenoids status will be measured on the screening day as&#xD;
      subject baseline information. Prior to each trial, subjects are required a compliance test&#xD;
      (CT) visit. On that day, fasting blood will be drawn to analysis the CAT concentration and&#xD;
      compare the analyzed CAT concentration to those of testing day baseline to assess the&#xD;
      compliance of the washout diet period. Skin CAT scan status will also be conducted. After the&#xD;
      CT day, subjects will undergo a 7-day washout period and follow low-CAT diet to reduce&#xD;
      circulating, endogenous levels of CAT and minimize the contribution of CAT in the plasma.&#xD;
      During the first 5 days, subjects will consume a low-CAT diet (CAT&lt;750µg), and during the&#xD;
      6-7days, subjects will consume an even low-CAT diet (CAT&lt;500µg). The low-CAT diet menu sheet&#xD;
      will be provided and dietary instruction to achieve the low CAT diet will be given.&#xD;
      Compliance with the low CAT diet will be promoted by daily menu check-off lists and in-person&#xD;
      contact on visit day.Subject will be randomly assigned to consume a carefully portioned&#xD;
      mix-vegetable salad (including tomatoes, shredded carrots, spinach, lettuce, and Chinese&#xD;
      wolfberry) with 4 different oil-water combinations on the 4 meal testing (MT) day. The 4&#xD;
      different oil-water combinations are as follows:1) Olive oil-water mixture (non-emulsified,&#xD;
      rich in unsaturated fat);2) Olive oil-water emulsification (rich in unsaturated fat);3)&#xD;
      Coconut oil-water mixture (non-emulsified, rich in saturated fat);4) Coconut oil-water&#xD;
      emulsification (emulsified, rich in unsaturated fat).On every MT day, fasting blood will be&#xD;
      collected for analyzing the CAT levels every 60 minutes for 10 hours and CAT concentration,&#xD;
      triglycerides will be analyzed from the collected blood samples. Appetite VAS questionnaire&#xD;
      will be conducted every half hour in the first two hours after consuming test meal and hourly&#xD;
      conducted till the 5th hour when lunch ( low-CAT (&lt; 2000 µg), low-fat (&lt;2 g)) provided. After&#xD;
      consuming the lunch, Appetite VAS questionnaire will be conducted every half hour in the&#xD;
      first two hours and hourly till the 10th hour. Thus, the timepoint for appetite VAS&#xD;
      measurement will be at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10 hour.There&#xD;
      are no incidental findings in the current research as we will only collect subject's&#xD;
      biological sample (blood) for testing the carotenoids level and blood triglycerides level&#xD;
      which are the aim of this study. The rest measurements, including blood pressure, weight,&#xD;
      height and waist circumference, they are the baseline information we collect for this study.&#xD;
