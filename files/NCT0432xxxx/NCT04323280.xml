  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of acute pericarditis is empiric and is based on treatment with medications&#xD;
      with anti-inflammatory properties such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and&#xD;
      corticosteroids. However, this therapy is given as a relatively long course of therapy (â‰¥ 3&#xD;
      weeks) and can be associated with substantial side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a potent corticosteroid that has not been investigated an alternative to&#xD;
      conventional therapy in patients with acute pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is an inexpensive drug and can be given in an oral tablet form. It has a quick&#xD;
      onset of action, relatively long duration of action and is therefore often given in high&#xD;
      doses for short periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexamethasone has been shown to be a safe therapeutic option in ITP (Immune&#xD;
      Thrombocytopenia), another disease in which steroids are an accepted treatment option. The&#xD;
      abundant data on using dexamethasone in comparison to longer prednisone-based regimens has&#xD;
      been evaluated in this disease and has shown to be effective and without the longer exposure&#xD;
      time to steroids and potential side effects. This data shows that dexamethasone can be a safe&#xD;
      therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that therapy with short term, high dose dexamethasone will&#xD;
      offer better clinical responses to NSAID therapy in the treatment of acute pericarditis with&#xD;
      less potential side effects compared to NSAID therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to conduct a randomised, non-blinded trial assessing the use of&#xD;
      dexamethasone as an alternative to NSAID for use in patients with acute pericarditis.&#xD;

      Dexamethasone compared to Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of acute&#xD;
      pericarditis: a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial (Dexa-P)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that therapy with short term, high dose dexamethasone will&#xD;
      offer better clinical responses to NSAID therapy with less potential side effects compared to&#xD;
      conventional therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised, non-blinded trial assessing the use of dexamethasone as an alternative to NSAID&#xD;
      therapy for use in patients with acute pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 3 participants have been enrolled and completed a month of follow up, the&#xD;
      preliminary findings will be forwarded to the quality control committee of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Ethics Committee of Rabin Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are free to discontinue their participation in the study at any time and without&#xD;
      prejudice to further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant may withdraw or be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject withdrew consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe Adverse Event (As described below) Reasons for withdrawal will be documented. In&#xD;
           cases of more than one reason for early withdrawal from the study, the most significant&#xD;
           reason will be stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of withdrawn participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawn randomized participants will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant has incessant pericarditis within one month of therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in the dexamethasone arm will be given another cycle of dexamethasone&#xD;
           therapy of 20mg for 4 days can be given. If there is a further persistence, prednisone&#xD;
           therapy will then be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in the NSAID therapy arm will be changes to prednisone therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of incessant pericarditis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence of pleuritic chest pain and one or more of the following signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pericardial friction rub&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Electrocardiographic changes specific to pericarditis (concave ST elevation, PR&#xD;
           depression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiographic evidence of pericardial effusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) An elevation in inflammatory markers (white-cell count, or C-reactive protein level)&#xD;
      without a symptom-free interval of 6 weeks or longer after the first acute event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is hospitalized with a possible side effect, the treating physician will be&#xD;
      notified to assess for modifying the participant allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no prohibited concomitant medications. Participants should continue to take drugs&#xD;
      for other co-morbidities as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The enrollment will be done within 72 hours of initial assessment. Each participant will&#xD;
      undergo eligibility screen and suitable participants will receive informed consent. The&#xD;
      allocation will be determined immediately after the participant will be found to be eligible&#xD;
      and will be made randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants are identified with an initial episode of acute pericarditis and informed&#xD;
      consent is given, an initial assessment will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will include baseline blood tests - including baseline liver and renal function tests,&#xD;
      full blood count and C-reactive protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo echocardiographic imaging at baseline. There are two possible&#xD;
      interventions: dexamethasone therapy or NSAID therapy. Participants will be followed up at 1&#xD;
      weeks, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up will be telephonically at 1 week, 6 months and 12 months. At the 1 month follow&#xD;
      up, clinical assessment, inflammatory marker and a repeat echocardiogram will be performed. A&#xD;
      repeat echocardiogram will be performed at 12 months. This follow up will be at the&#xD;
      pericardial disease clinic at Rabin Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming a success rate 85% in the NSAIDS group and 87% in the Dexamethasone intervention&#xD;
      group, with a margin of non-inferiority of 10%, the sample size calculated was 208. (Alpha =&#xD;
      0.05, beta=0.2). Noninferiority would be shown if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval was 10 percentage points or less. A 10 percentage-point noninferiority margin was&#xD;
      considered to be an acceptable difference in recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will include physicians in the emergency room and admission setting to help&#xD;
      identify and recruit participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Data Collection, management and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First assessment including baseline variables and suitability of the participant to the study&#xD;
      will be made during the enrollment, by the study coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition demographic and clinical characteristics will be recorded. The data will be&#xD;
      collected during an interview of the participant or with assistance of the computerized&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, laboratory tests such as blood count, liver and kidneys functions and C reactive&#xD;
      protein will be made and be recorded for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The type of intervention will be recorded by the study coordinators for each participant&#xD;
      according to the allocation group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments of outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome at each follow up, both telephonically and on clinical follow up The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will be assessed telephonically and using the medical computerized&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data regarding the participant's hospitalization: Baselines variables, interventions and&#xD;
      glucose levels will be stored in secured excel documents for each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the participant's outcomes will be stored in a different secured excel&#xD;
      documents for each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coding of the documents and the separation between the hospitalization and follow up&#xD;
      period data is designated to ensure the investigator blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the occurrence of Recurrent Pericarditis within 12 months. This will&#xD;
      be calculated by bivariate analysis as relative risk. The secondary outcome of time to&#xD;
      recurrence will be plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using the Log-rank test&#xD;
      (unadjusted analysis), Hazard ratio for the risk of the primary analysis between the control&#xD;
      and Dexamethasone arm will be calculated using a univariate cox proportional hazards ratio&#xD;
      model (unadjusted analysis). Further secondary outcomes will be analysed by bivariate&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: monitoring Harms: Side effects will be monitoring during therapy as defined&#xD;
