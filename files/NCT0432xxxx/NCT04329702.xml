  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial involving adult survivors of cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      failure treated in intensive care units (ICUs) that is designed to test the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility, and clinical impact of a coping skills training intervention (Blueprint)&#xD;
      delivered via a mobile app. This trial will allow us to determine if new changes to&#xD;
      intervention delivery, inclusion criteria, and other factors are successful. It will also&#xD;
      inform the development of a next-step efficacy focused trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As survival has improved for the 2 million people with cardiorespiratory failure managed&#xD;
      annually in US intensive care units (ICUs), research has clarified how these survivors suffer&#xD;
      from severe and persistent symptoms of psychological distress-depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-after discharge. However, few interventions exist that&#xD;
      are relevant to patients' experiences and that also accommodate their many physical, social,&#xD;
      and financial barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, we developed a telephone- and&#xD;
      web-based coping skills training (CST) program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CST is an empirically-supported psychosocial intervention that targets the use of the&#xD;
      adaptive coping skills to decrease psychological distress and improve quality of life. We&#xD;
      conducted a multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) called CSTEP that compared CST to an&#xD;
      education program (EP) among a general sample of ICU survivors who received mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation for cardiorespiratory failure. CST reduced depression symptoms and improved&#xD;
      quality of life at 6 months in a pre-specified subgroup with elevated baseline distress. This&#xD;
      RCT also identified key questions regarding best practices for identi-fying patients who are&#xD;
      highly distressed yet whose physical illness is manageable, as well as delivering the&#xD;
      intervention in a more convenient, and scalable manner. In a recent RCT testing a mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention (LIFT), we found that a self-directed mobile app approach increased dose,&#xD;
      adherence, and retention. However, many patients reported low enthusiasm for a&#xD;
      meditation-based intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is needed before a second multicenter RCT is to apply the promising CST content to a&#xD;
      LIFT-inspired mobile app-based delivery system, and then to test it within a targeted patient&#xD;
      population with a high likelihood of response (i.e., high baseline psychological distress).&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose a 2-year R34 mixed-methods project that includes a pilot RCT in which&#xD;
      we will randomize 45 cardiorespiratory failure / insufficiency survivors to one of three arms&#xD;
      in equal ratios: intervention plus therapist for non-responders (n ~15), intervention without&#xD;
      a therapist (n ~15), and usual care control (n ~15). Randomization will be stratified by ICU&#xD;
      service (medical vs. surgical), baseline HADS score (&lt;14 vs. ≥14), and age (&lt;50 vs. ≥50). Our&#xD;
      specific aims will: (1) Optimize the usability of a self-directed mobile app (Blueprint) and&#xD;
      an automated post-discharge distress screening system; (2) Test two promising iterations of&#xD;
      Blueprint vs. usual care in a pilot 3-arm RCT with 3-month follow up, and (3) Explore&#xD;
      facilitators and barriers to Blueprint implementation, using these data to inform any&#xD;
      necessary final revisions to the Blueprint app.&#xD;
