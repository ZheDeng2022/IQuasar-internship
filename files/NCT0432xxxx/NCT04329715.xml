  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the EVeRLAST study is to determine whether expedited resumption of&#xD;
      postoperative activity levels is non-inferior to standard activity restrictions with respect&#xD;
      to short-term anatomic prolapse outcomes. We hypothesize that immediate resumption of&#xD;
      physical activities as tolerated will result in noninferior surgical outcomes following&#xD;
      prolapse surgery when compared to standard postoperative activity restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled and randomized at their preoperative clinic visit to one of two&#xD;
      treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: Standard instructions (no heavy lifting over 10lbs for 6 weeks; return to work at 4&#xD;
      weeks for sedentary work and 6 weeks for manual labor) Arm 2: Liberal instructions (no&#xD;
      restrictions; resume activities and work as soon as able)&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also collect subjective and objective measures of pre- and postoperative physical&#xD;
      activity, through the use of patient-reported physical activity assessments and wrist-worn&#xD;
      accelerometers. Accelerometer data will be collected at the preoperative,&#xD;
      2-week-postoperative, and 6-week-postoperative time points. Accelerometer data will also be&#xD;
      used to calculate time to resumption of normal activities, defined as time at which a patient&#xD;
      resumes greater than 90% of her baseline preoperative level of physical activity. We will&#xD;
      additionally be collecting data on relevant patient-reported outcomes of pelvic floor symptom&#xD;
      severity, health-related quality of life measures, postoperative pain, time to return to work&#xD;
      (where relevant), and patient global impression of improvement. Postoperative anatomic&#xD;
      assessments will be performed at 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively by blinded study&#xD;
      personnel&#xD;

      Specific aim 1: Determine if liberal (ad lib) resumption of postoperative activity levels is&#xD;
      non-inferior to standard restrictions with regards to short-term anatomic and symptomatic&#xD;
      outcome, as measured by maximum pelvic organ prolapse support loss ('SLmax') and the Pelvic&#xD;
      Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory (POPDI) at 3 months. (Co-primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 2: Compare postoperative &quot;Recovery Time&quot; and physical function between women&#xD;
      instructed to resume their activity levels ad lib versus women instructed to restrict&#xD;
      activity levels. &quot;Recovery Time,&quot; defined as the postoperative day at which the patient&#xD;
      resumes 90% of her baseline activity levels will be objectively measured using the Actigraph&#xD;
      accelerometer.8 ,9 Physical function will be measured with the 6-minute walk, chair stand&#xD;
      tests, and through patient-reported outcome measures. (exploratory outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aim 3: Compare timing of return-to-work and health-related QOL in women instructed&#xD;
      to resume activity levels and return to work ad lib versus restrict their activity levels&#xD;
      (exploratory outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will first be briefly explained regarding the research study. If&#xD;
      interested, will then complete the informed consent process. She will first be asked to&#xD;
      complete the International Physical Activity Short Form to confirm study eligibility. For&#xD;
      study eligibility, participants must at least report a baseline of 725 MET-minutes per week&#xD;
      of physical activity according to the IPAQ-SF, which is consistent with the lowest quartile&#xD;
      of activity among elderly women. If she reports greater than 725 MET-minutes per week of&#xD;
      physical activity, she will undergo the remainder of baseline assessments. If she reports&#xD;
      less than 725 MET-minutes per week of physical activity, she will be explained that she does&#xD;
      not meet the activity level criteria for completion of the study at this time. She will then&#xD;
      be asked to complete a series of baseline questionnaires (demographics, past medical history,&#xD;
      POPDI, AAS, PROMIS, PFDI, PFIQ). She will also undergo a baseline POPQ exam and tests of&#xD;
      physical function, including the 6-minute walk test and chair stand test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sealed envelope will then be opened by the research coordinator (or study investigator) in&#xD;
      front of the patient indicating the patient's study allocation. The packet will also include&#xD;
      an accelerometer which the patient will be instructed to wear for a 7-day period&#xD;
      preoperatively. However, to ensure that participants are not given an accelerometer too far&#xD;
      in advance from her surgery (as at times surgery may be scheduled remotely from the initial&#xD;
      decision to proceed with surgery which would potentially result in too many accelerometers&#xD;
      being out of circulation), the envelope containing study allocation and accelerometers may&#xD;
      alternatively be provided at the preoperative &quot;Surgical Workup&quot; visit once the surgery is&#xD;
      scheduled and at a date no greater than 3 weeks from the planned surgery. If a participant&#xD;
      will be undergoing surgery at an interval greater than 1 week from the initial receipt of the&#xD;
      accelerometer, she will only be required to wear the accelerometer for 1 week prior to the&#xD;
      surgery. Patients will be given an opportunity to ask any questions regarding postoperative&#xD;
      activity instructions to research personnel or nurses at the time of study enrollment and at&#xD;
      any point prior to her surgery. Patients will be notified, prior to providing consent, that&#xD;
      her primary surgeon will remain blinded as to her treatment allocation until completion of&#xD;
      her study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any questions related to surgical recovery which arise preoperatively will be addressed by&#xD;
      nurses and research personnel not involved in the patient's intraoperative decision-making.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, fellow and attending surgeons will only be unblinded if necessary to address&#xD;
      any acute postoperative issues. Patients will also be provided with a duplicate set of&#xD;
      postoperative set of activity instructions on the day of her surgery upon discharge which&#xD;
      will be entered in the patient's electronic chart by study personnel on the day of her&#xD;
      surgery as a modification to the standard postoperative discharge instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will wear the activity tracker for 6 weeks postoperatively. At the 1-week&#xD;
      postoperative time point, patient reminder phone calls will be made to remind the patient to&#xD;
      wear and charge the activity tracker (whose battery life is 25 days). She will also be asked&#xD;
      to provide a count of the number of narcotic pills she has left remaining at this time. She&#xD;
      will follow-up for a routine postoperative visit with her primary surgeon at which point a&#xD;
      routine 6-week postoperative POPQ will be performed. Accelerometers will be returned at this&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      She will then follow up for a separate research visit at 3 months postoperatively. At this&#xD;
      time, the patient will complete all follow-up activity, symptom, and HRQOL questionnaires&#xD;
      including the: Activities Assessment Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, Pelvic Floor&#xD;
      Impact Questionnaire, and the PROMIS short form subscales of physical function, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, fatigue, satisfaction with social role, and pain interference. A six-minute walk&#xD;
      and chair stand test will be administered by trained research personnel in the clinic. She&#xD;
      will additionally be inquired regarding timing of return to work. A POPQ will also be&#xD;
      performed at this time by a blinded provider NOT involved in the patient's index surgery.&#xD;
