      This phase I trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab before and after&#xD;
      surgery in treating children and young adults with high grade glioma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or is increasing in scope or severity (progressive). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      between the three arms as well as between each group and archived non-treated recurrent&#xD;
      pediatric HGG samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To explore the correlation of tumor mutational load with clinical response for children&#xD;
      and young adults with recurrent or progressive HGG treated with neoadjuvant nivolumab and&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants with recurrent or progressive high-grade gliomas (HGG) (World Health&#xD;
             Organization (WHO) grade III or grade IV) who are candidates for surgical tumor&#xD;
             debulking will be enrolled in this trial&#xD;
&#xD;

             noted. The participant and their legal parent/guardian must be thoroughly informed&#xD;
             about all aspects of the study, including the study visit schedule and required&#xD;
             evaluations and all regulatory requirements for informed consent. The written informed&#xD;
             consent must be obtained from the participant and legal parent/guardian prior to&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Has tumor primarily localized to the brainstem or spinal cord&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has presence of diffuse leptomeningeal disease or extracranial disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Has received systemic immunosuppressive treatments (such as methotrexate, chloroquine,&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Participants with a concurrent condition requiring systemic treatment with either&#xD;
             corticosteroids (&gt; 0.25 mg/kg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             medications within 14 days of start of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids,&#xD;
             and adrenal replacement steroid doses &gt; 0.25 mg/kg daily prednisone equivalent, are&#xD;
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Unable to taper steroids due to ongoing mass effect; a maximum dexamethasone dose of&#xD;

             potentially curative therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has known history of, or any evidence of active non-infectious pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy&#xD;

             positive, or hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) positive (except if HCV-ribonucleic acid&#xD;
             (RNA) negative)&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Participants who have had prior allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the participant to receive protocol therapy or&#xD;
             interfere with interpretation of study results&#xD;
