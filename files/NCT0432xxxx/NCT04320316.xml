  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KRN23 is a fully human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and inhibits&#xD;
      the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to an increase in serum&#xD;
      phosphorus levels. There are multiple disorders that result in unusually high circulating&#xD;
      levels of FGF23, which in turn result in renal phosphate wasting and reduced levels of&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Across these disorders the clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      similar and often include osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle weakness, fatigue,&#xD;
      bone pain, and fractures. KRN23 has been studied in one of these disorders, X-linked&#xD;
      hypophosphatemia (XLH). In single- and repeat-dose clinical studies in subjects with XLH,&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) administration of KRN23 consistently increased and sustained serum&#xD;
      phosphorus levels and tubular reabsorption of phosphate (TRP) without a major impact on urine&#xD;
      calcium levels or vitamin D metabolism. Positive results were also observed in a nonclinical&#xD;
      pharmacology model of XLH. It is hypothesized that KRN23 may provide clinical benefit in this&#xD;
      patient due to the common underlying feature in this patient and in patients with XLH -&#xD;
      abnormally elevated FGF23 in the context of low age -adjusted serum phosphorous levels. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to study the effect of KRN23 treatment on normalizing age-adjusted&#xD;
      fasting serum phosphorous levels in a single pediatric patient with Epidermal Nevus Syndrome&#xD;
      associated hypophosphatemic rickets.&#xD;

      KRN23 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and&#xD;
      inhibits the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), leading to an increase in serum&#xD;
      phosphorus levels. There are multiple disorders (each with a unique underlying cause) that&#xD;
      result in unusually high circulating levels of FGF23, which in turn result in renal phosphate&#xD;
      wasting and reduced (or aberrantly normal in relationship to elevated FGF23) levels of&#xD;
      1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25[OH]2D). Across these disorders the clinical symptoms are&#xD;
      similar and often include osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle weakness, fatigue,&#xD;
      bone pain, and fractures. KRN23 has been studied in one of these disorders, X-linked&#xD;

    <description>KRN23 is a fully human IgG1monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the activity of FGF23, leading to an increase in serum phosphorus levels. It is a potential therapeutic candidate for the treatment of XLH, Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia (TIO), and the rickets/osteomalacia resulting from Epidermal Nevus Syndrome (ENS). All of these conditions are diseases of bone hypomineralization, caused by urinary phosphate wasting due to elevated levels of FGF23.</description>
