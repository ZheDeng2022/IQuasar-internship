    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of meloxicam eye drops in Chinese healthy&#xD;
      volunteers were evaluated to provide a basis for the formulation of a phase II clinical trial&#xD;
      dosing regimen for this product. Including pre-tests and formal trials, formal trials include&#xD;
      single-dose pharmacokinetics tests and multiple-dose tolerance tests (4 times a day for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days).&#xD;

      Meloxicam eye drops is a new class 2 drug of the country. The main ingredients are meloxicam.&#xD;
      The other ingredients are hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, sodium hydroxide, boric acid, sodium&#xD;
      chloride and water for injection. Among them, hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin can increase the&#xD;
      solubility of meloxicam and improve the stability of the solution. The indication of&#xD;
      meloxicam eye drops is non-infectious ocular inflammation, especially for inflammation and&#xD;
      complications after cataract surgery. The possible adverse reaction is transient tingling in&#xD;
      the eye after eye drops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDS) that selectively inhibits COX-2&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase. It is currently widely used in the treatment of acute and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and pain, and its mechanism of action is to prevent the production of&#xD;
      prostaglandins (PGs) that cause inflammation by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX).&#xD;
      Non-infectious ocular inflammation is usually caused by the synthesis and release of&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin (PG) after eye tissues are stimulated. Because&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic and analgesic&#xD;
      effects, and have no adverse effects of glucocorticoids, their application in ophthalmology&#xD;
      has been valued.&#xD;
