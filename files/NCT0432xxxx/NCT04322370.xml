      To analyze outcomes between patients with Z2FT injuries following repair, randomized to two&#xD;
      groups. The first group will be the negative control, with no tendon wrap. The second group&#xD;
      will have a VersaWrap Tendon Protector applied over the site of the tendon repair. VersaWrap&#xD;
      is current SOC at UF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VersaWrap Tendon Protector is intended to manage and protect tendon injuries where there is&#xD;
      no significant loss of tendon tissue. It functions by separating the healing tendon from&#xD;
      surrounding tissues to facilitate tendon gliding and tendon healing. VersaWrap can be placed&#xD;
      on, over, or around flexor tendons and remains in place until healing is complete and then is&#xD;
      bioresorbed. VersaWrap is FDA cleared for the use in procedures where there is no significant&#xD;
      loss of tendon tissue and is currently one of the standard of care treatments used for this&#xD;
      injury at UF Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VersaWrap Tendon Protector includes a bioresorbable hydrogel sheet and a wetting solution.&#xD;
      The sheet is transparent, flexible, ultrathin, non-sided, and can be cut to the desired size.&#xD;
      It is made of polysaccharides alginate and hyaluronic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tendon adhesions are a major problem following repair, particularly for zone 2 flexor tendon&#xD;
      (Z2FT) lacerations. The purpose of this study is to prospectively analyze outcomes between&#xD;
      patients with Z2FT injuries following repair, randomized to two groups. The first group will&#xD;
      be the negative control, with no tendon wrap. The second group will have a VersaWrap Tendon&#xD;
      Protector applied over the site of the tendon repair. Outcomes will be evaluated during&#xD;
      standard of care post-operative clinic visits at 2 (+/-10 days) weeks, 6 weeks (+/-2 weeks)&#xD;
      and 3 months (+/- 1 month) following surgery. Data will be collected from standard of care&#xD;
      measurements that include the following outcome measures that will be performed at each&#xD;
      follow up visit: range of motion of the affected finger at different joints; total active&#xD;
      motion (TAM) of the finger; Strickland modification of TAM (only including proximal&#xD;
      interphalangeal (PIP); and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints), as well as, DASH score and&#xD;
      Michigan Hand Outcomes questionnaire. A measurement of grip strength will be obtained at the&#xD;
      3 month follow up visit. This is an important study as adhesions are a particularly serious&#xD;
      problem following repair of Z2FT injuries, which can result in persistent finger stiffness&#xD;
      and decreased range of motion reducing the quality of life.&#xD;
