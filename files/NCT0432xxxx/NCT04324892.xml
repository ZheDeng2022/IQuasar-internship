      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To elucidate the effects of achieving sustained simple disease activity index (SDAI)&#xD;
      remission in the progression of joint space outcomes using high-resolution peripheral&#xD;
      quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA), and what the&#xD;
      independent effects of erosion /JSW progression are on patient's function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested: Effective control of inflammation in ERA patients who can achieve&#xD;
      sustained SDAI remission will have less progression of joint damage then patients who cannot&#xD;
      achieve sustained SDAI remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: 110 consecutive ERA patients will participate in this 1-year&#xD;
      prospective, hospital-based, cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments Metacarpophalangeal joints 2-4 will be measured using HR-pQCT Interventions&#xD;
      All participants will receive 1-year tight-control treatment according to a standardized&#xD;
      protocol aiming at SDAI remission. Physical function will be assessed by Health Assessment&#xD;
      Questionnaire (HAQ) at each visit. HR-pQCT and radiographs will be performed at baseline, 6&#xD;
      (HR-pQCT only) and 12 months. Quantitative analysis of joint space width (JSW) and volume,&#xD;
      erosion number and volume, and marginal osteosclerosis (bone apposition at the base of the&#xD;
      erosion) will be evaluated by HR-pQCT. Radiographic progression will be scored using van der&#xD;
      Heijde-Sharp (SvdH) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is the change in JSW and volume over a period of 12&#xD;
      months. Main secondary outcomes include changes in the i) number and size of erosion, ii)&#xD;
      SvdH score and iii) HAQ over a period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: Patients who can achieve sustained SDAI remission will have less joint&#xD;
      damage and functional loss compared&#xD;

        Starting from July 2020, all new cases referrals to the rheumatology clinic of the Prince&#xD;
        of Wales Hospital (PWH) and four other regional hospitals in Hong Kong will be screened by&#xD;
        a research assistant. Patients referred as RA, possible RA or undifferentiated arthritis&#xD;
        will be contacted through telephone. Patients with at least 1 tender and swollen joint and&#xD;
        with duration of symptoms less than 2 years and with no previous use of DMARDs will be&#xD;
        invited to a screening visit at the early arthritis clinic of the PWH within 2 weeks of the&#xD;
        referral, where they will be formally assessed by a rheumatologist.&#xD;
