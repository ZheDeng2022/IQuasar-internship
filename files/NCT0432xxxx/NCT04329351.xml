    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical-laboratorial, paralel, randomized, prospective and controlled study&#xD;
      was determine the impact of of PTFE-d barrier intentionally exposed to bucal environment in&#xD;
      guided bone regeneration to ridge preservation, using microbiological, radiographic,&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes, molecular patter of bone-related markers and implant&#xD;
      stabilization. Fourty individuals with tooth extraction indication and subsequent implant&#xD;
      placement between upper pre-molars were recruited. Patients were randomly allocated in one of&#xD;
      this groups, following tooth extraction: 1) GBR: sockets received GBR with d-PTFE membranes&#xD;
      which was maintained intentionally exposed to bucal environment and removed after 28 days;&#xD;
      and 2) Non-GBR: sockets did not receive additional therapy after extration. After 3 months,&#xD;
      all patients received dental implants and temporary implant-supported prostheses.&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcomes in terms of morbidity, swelling and interference with daily life&#xD;
      were recorded at 3, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 days following dental extraction and in terms of&#xD;
      esthetic outcomes after prosthesis instalation by using questionaries. Samples of biofilm at&#xD;
      surface repair/barrier were obtained in both groups at 3 and 28 days after extraction (in the&#xD;
      moment of barrier removal) to microbiological evaluation using Illumina HiSeq system.&#xD;
      Computed tomography obtained imediatlly after extraction and before implant placement will be&#xD;
      analised to evaluation of changes on ridge dimensions. After 3 months following extration,&#xD;
      bone tissue biopsies will be harvested from the sites designed to receive dental implants to&#xD;
      evaluation of imunoenzimatic pattern (DKK1, OPG, OC, OPN, TNF-α, SOST, RANKL, OSN e TRAP) and&#xD;
      gene expression (TGF-β, BSP e COL-I) of bone-related markers using Luminex/Magpix and PCR&#xD;
      Real-Time, respectivally. Afer imlpant placement, the implant stability quotient (ISQ) was&#xD;
      determined. The results will be statistically compared after normality test, with the level&#xD;
      of significance set at 5%.&#xD;

      Study design This clinical-laboratorial, paralel, randomized, prospective and controlled&#xD;
      study will be determine the impact of of PTFE-d barrier intentionally exposed to bucal&#xD;
      environment in guided bone regeneration to ridge preservation, using microbiological,&#xD;
      radiographic, patient-centered outcomes, molecular patter of bone-related markers and implant&#xD;
      stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following local anesthesia, an intrasulcular incision was made around the tooth to be&#xD;
      extracted and a mucoperiosteal flap was detached for adequate exposure of 3 mm of the&#xD;
      alveolar crest adjacent to the alveolus. After, procedures for dislocation and dental removal&#xD;
      were performed in a minimally invasive manner, using periotomes, levers and extractors, if&#xD;
      necessary. Subsequently, irrigation with saline solution was performed and then, using&#xD;
      specific software, patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following&#xD;
      treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBR Group: After extraction, the PTFE-d membrane (CytoplastTM Ti-250 Titanium-Reinforced,&#xD;
      Anterior Narrow 12 mm x 24 mm, Osteogenics, Lubbock, TX, USA) was customized with scissors&#xD;
      and adjusted over the socket, exceeding three millimeters from its margins. Then, the&#xD;
      membrane was inserted subperiostally under the buccal and palatal flaps with the help of the&#xD;
      Molt detacher. Minimal flap reflection was performed to stabilize the membrane, which was&#xD;
      maintained intentionally exposed to the oral environment. Before suturing, the passive&#xD;
      stability of the membrane over the alveolus was confirmed, as well as the absence of folds or&#xD;
      wrinkles in the membrane. The flaps were then be approached in the pre-extraction position&#xD;
      and sutured with crossed sutures, aiming to increase the stability of the membrane, with PTFE&#xD;
      4-0 thread (Cytoplast PTFE, CS0618PREM, Osteogenics, Lubbock, TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-GBR group: After extraction, no further treatment was performed. The flaps were then&#xD;
      repositioned and sutured with 5.0 nylon thread (Ethicon, Jonhson's Jonhson, São José dos&#xD;
      Campos).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporary adhesive prostheses adapted to adjacent teeth were installed and maintained until&#xD;
      the moment of implant placement. The supragingival biofilm control was performed with&#xD;
      mouthwashes of 0.12% chlorhexidine for a period of 4 weeks in all experimental groups.&#xD;
      Pre-surgical anti-inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone 4 mg, single dose, 1 hour before the&#xD;
      procedure) and postoperative analgesics (sodium dipyrone 500 mg, every 4 hours, for 3 days)&#xD;
      were indicated. Patients were instructed to take analgesic medication only in case of pain&#xD;
      during the period described above, being instructed to record the amount of medications&#xD;
      ingested. Prophylactic systemic antimicrobial therapy was performed 1 hour before surgical&#xD;
      procedures with 2 grams of Amoxicillin and the same medication will be prescribed for 7 days&#xD;
      in the postoperative period, 500 mg every 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sutures were removed after 15 days. In the GBR group, the membrane was removed after the&#xD;
      28-day period, under anesthesia (Hoffmann et al. 2007, Carbonell et al. 2014, Cheon et al.&#xD;
      2017), being removed gently with the traction movement with the aid of a tweezers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were monitored monthly, throughout the study period, to observe periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance and reinforce hygiene instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implants and Prostheses Placement Three months after the extraction, regardless of the&#xD;
      experimental group, patients received dental implants. Therefore, they were molded for&#xD;
      rehabilitation planning and surgical guides were made to be used in the implant placement&#xD;
      surgery. In the surgical procedure, patients were submitted to local anesthesia and&#xD;
      mucoperiosteal flaps were made for access and adequate exposure of the alveolar bone. After,&#xD;
      drilling was performed to insert the implants. In both groups, single-stage implants were&#xD;
      performed, with the immediate placement of provisional prostheses on implants. All surgeries&#xD;
      were performed by the same operator (EKM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the experimental phase of the study, the definitive prostheses were installed. The&#xD;
      sutures of the surgical procedures were performed with 5.0 nylon thread (Ethicon, Jonhson's&#xD;
      Jonhson, São José dos Campos) and it was removed after 7 days. The supragingival biofilm&#xD;
      control was performed with mouthwashes of 0.12% chlorhexidine for a period of 7 days after&#xD;
      the surgery. Pre-surgical anti-inflammatory therapy (dexamethasone 4 mg, single dose, 1 hour&#xD;
      before the procedure) and postoperative analgesics (sodium dipyrone 500 mg, every 4 hours,&#xD;
      for 2 days) were indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination The same examiner (SB) performed all clinical measurements. To perform&#xD;
      the intra-examiner calibration, 15 non-study individuals presenting dental implants were&#xD;
      chosen. The examiner measured the peri-implant probing depth of all individuals twice within&#xD;
      a 24-hour period. The intra-class correlation was calculated as 95% reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a North Carolina/Colorvue probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA), the following parameters&#xD;
      were measured at four sites of the dental implants included in the study at baseline (before&#xD;
      extration and GBR) and at 3-month follow-up: Probing Depth (PPD/mm), which was the distance&#xD;
      from the bottom of the periodontal sulcus/pocket to the periodontal margin; Clinical&#xD;
      Attachment Level (CAL/mm), which was the distance from the cement enamel junction to the&#xD;
      bottom of the periodontal pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbioma evaluation Microbiological assessments of the biofilm present on the barriers (GBR&#xD;
      Group) and in the repair area (non-GBR Group) were made after 3 days of extraction and after&#xD;
      28 days (at the time of removal of the barrier in the GBR group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microbiological analysis will be done through the Sequencing Technique of the 16S gene by&#xD;
      the Illumina HiSeq platform, which allows to determine the diversity and abundance of the&#xD;
      microbial population in the same sample. This evaluation will be carried out at the&#xD;
      Centralized Multi-User Laboratory of Functional Genomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of parameters reported by the patient The assessment of patient-centered&#xD;
      parameters concerning to symptoms related to morbidity and quality of life in the&#xD;
      postoperative period will be carried out after 3, 7, 14, 28, 35 and 42 days of extraction,&#xD;
      using questionnaires, based on a horizontal line of 100 mm (Visual Analog Scale; VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular evaluation of markers related to osteoclast / blastogenesis In the surgical&#xD;
      procedure for placing dental implants, during the milling to prepare the bed, bone tissue&#xD;
      will be removed using a disposable bone collector adapted to the vacuum pump / surgical&#xD;
      aspirator. Part of the bone tissue sample will be used for analysis of gene expression and&#xD;
      another part for immunoenzymatic analysis of different biomarkers related to osteoclast /&#xD;
      blastogenesis. All molecular analyzes related to osteoclast / blastogenesis markers will be&#xD;
      performed at the Dental Research Laboratory of the Headquarters Institution. All biopsies&#xD;
      collected will be stored in a specific solution to avoid degradation of RNA (RNAlater®,&#xD;
      Ambion Inc., Austin, TX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene Expression Analysis RNA extraction: The removed tissues will be properly packed in a&#xD;
      solution to avoid degradation of the RNA (RNAlater®, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The total RNA&#xD;
      will be isolated by the TRIZOL reagent method (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD,&#xD;
      USA). First, the RNAlater solution will be aspirated and the crushed sample will then be&#xD;
      placed in the TRIZOL reagent, shaken for 30 seconds and incubated for 5 minutes at room&#xD;
      temperature. After this period, chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) will be added, stirred&#xD;
      and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes at a temperature of 4oC. The aqueous portion&#xD;
      will be transferred to another tube to which isopropanol will be added, shaken, incubated for&#xD;
      20 minutes at a temperature of -20oC and centrifuged in the same way as described above.&#xD;
      After this process, a pellet will be formed, which will be washed with chilled 75% ethanol&#xD;
      and dried at room temperature. The RNA samples will be resuspended in approximately 50µl of&#xD;
      water treated with diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) and stored at -70oC. The concentration of RNA&#xD;
      will be determined using a spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with DNAase will be performed and Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be conducted.Primers&#xD;
      for GAPDH (reference gene), Transforming growth factor (TGF-β), Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and&#xD;
      Collagen type I (COL-I) will be designed with the aid of a pGBRram developed specifically to&#xD;
      design primers for LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). All primers will&#xD;
      be checked for specificity by checking the Melting curve using positive and negative&#xD;
      controls. The reaction profile will be determined according to the formula suggested by the&#xD;
      equipment manufacturer. For each of the &quot;runs&quot;, water will be used as a negative control, and&#xD;
      the product of the reactions will be quantified using the manufacturer's own pGBRram&#xD;
      (LightCycler Relative Quantification Software - Roche Diagnostics GmbH). GAPDH will be used&#xD;
      as the reference gene (housekeeping) for the normalization of values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunoenzymatic Analysis Part of the bone tissue sample collected at the time of implant&#xD;
      placement will be placed in sterile tubes containing 400μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS)&#xD;
      with 0.05% Tween-20. All samples will be stored at -20 ° C. Then, the tissue will be weighed,&#xD;
      homogenized and dissolved in PBS to a final concentration of 100mg of tissue / mL. After&#xD;
      stirring in Vortex for 10 minutes, each sample will be centrifuged at 370g for 5 minutes, the&#xD;
      supernatant will be collected and stored at -70 ° C until use. To avoid protease activity,&#xD;
      the entire procedure will be performed at 4 ° C. Dickkopf (DKK1), Sclerostin (SOST), Tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF-α), Osteoprotegerin (OPG), Osteocalcin (OC), Osteopontin (OPN)&#xD;
      (HBNMAG-51K, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA ), NF-κB binding activator receptor&#xD;
      (RANKL) (HRNKLMAG-31K-01, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), Osteonectin (OSN) and&#xD;
      Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) (HCMBMAG-22K, Millipore Corporation, Billerica,&#xD;
      MA, USA), will be determined using Luminex / MAGpix technology, which allows to determine the&#xD;
      presence and to quantify in an absolute way the concentration of different markers in the&#xD;
      same sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the analyzes will be performed in 96-well plates, with the help of the&#xD;
      high-sensitivity panels mentioned above, following the manufacturer's instructions.The&#xD;
      samples will be evaluated in duplicate and the average of the values obtained will be used to&#xD;
      calculate the concentrations of each marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tomographic Analysis CT scans of the patients will be obtained immediately after extraction&#xD;
      and 3 months later (before implant placement). Tomographic examinations performed in the&#xD;
      different periods will be analyzed for the rate of bone loss after extraction and&#xD;
      preservation of the socket, both vertically and horizontally, through the Dental Slice&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
