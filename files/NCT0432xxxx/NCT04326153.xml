  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer has always been one of the leading causes of death in the world, and China is facing&#xD;
      more and more severe challenges from cancer. Among all the causes of cancer death, lung&#xD;
      cancer (25.2%) ranks first, among which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about&#xD;
      80% to 85%, of which about 1 / 3 of the patients have been in the local advanced stage (IIIA&#xD;
      stage / IIIB stage) at the time of initial diagnosis. For the patients with stage IIIA NSCLC&#xD;
      who can be operated on, surgery is still the most effective way to treat them. Even so, NSCLC&#xD;
      in stage I-III undergoing radical surgery is the most effective way 30-60% of the patients&#xD;
      eventually had relapse or distant metastasis. Therefore, people began to explore a new&#xD;
      treatment mode, preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to improve the survival rate of NSCLC&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the NCCN guidelines for the new adjuvant treatment of NSCLC mainly recommend&#xD;
      platinum based dual drug chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy will be a potential new adjuvant therapy in the&#xD;
      future, which can improve the resection rate of patients, reduce the recurrence rate after&#xD;
      surgery, and have tolerable adverse reactions.&#xD;

                  anti HBV treatment is not required, but virus reactivation needs to be closely&#xD;

             interfere with the test results, prevent the subjects from participating in the whole&#xD;
             process of the study, or the researchers think that participating in the study is not&#xD;
             in the best interests of the subjects.&#xD;
