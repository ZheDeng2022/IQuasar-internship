  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the rising problem of overweight and obesity, many strategies are implemented to&#xD;
      combat this issue and one of the most common ways is exercise training. Aerobic exercise is a&#xD;
      popular and effective conservative strategy for weight and adiposity management and commonly&#xD;
      used exercise protocols are moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and interval&#xD;
      training (IT). MICT is typically defined as continuous effort that elicits 55%-70% of the&#xD;
      maximal heart rate or promotes oxygen consumption equivalent to 40%-60% of the maximum oxygen&#xD;
      intake. IT involves repeated exercise with periods of recovery, which includes high intensity&#xD;
      interval training (HIIT) and Sprint interval training (SIT). HIIT is exercising at 80% to&#xD;
      100% of maximal heart rate while SIT involves &quot;all-out&quot; or &quot;supramaximal&quot; effort at the&#xD;
      intensity of 100% of maximal oxygen uptake. Multiple systematic reviews on the effect of SIT&#xD;
      on aerobic capacity or comparisons between other forms of exercise protocols to reduce body&#xD;
      adiposity has been conducted, but so far no systematic review has been carried out to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of this protocol solely on anthropometric measures on young obese and&#xD;
      overweight adults alone. Hence, in this study, a systematic review of the effect of SIT on&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements in young obese or overweight adults will be reviewed, filtered&#xD;
      and assembled.&#xD;

      &quot;anthropometric measures&quot;,&quot;body mass index&quot;, &quot;fat %&quot; lean muscle mass will be searched&#xD;
      through e-databases namely Pubmed (including MEDLINE), Pedro-search, Science Direct, Google&#xD;
      Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library for the suitable original full text&#xD;
      studies. Only randomized control trails will be included in this study and the &quot;Tool for the&#xD;
      assEssment of Study qualiTy and reporting in EXercise&quot; (TESTEX) would be utilized to assess&#xD;
      each individual study. TESTEX has been validated and is specific to exercise training. The&#xD;
      authors wish to use TESTEX as it addresses several shortcomings that PEDro does not e.g.&#xD;
      exercise adherence, withdrawal, relative exercise training intensity. In addition, study&#xD;
      quality assessment of training studies is more robust with TESTEX. 2 independent evaluators&#xD;
      will examine and screen each study for its efficacy to be included in the data analysis.&#xD;
