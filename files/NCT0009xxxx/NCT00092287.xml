  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of lanreotide Autogel and&#xD;
      Sandostatin LAR Depot, to see whether these two 28-day prolonged release formulations produce&#xD;
      a similar clinical response in patients with carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor of the carcinoid type.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented evidence of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhea) attributable to a&#xD;
             primary tumor of the lung, stomach or mid-gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous positive Octreoscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance score lower than 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the baseline visit patients MUST satisfy the following criteria before they are&#xD;
        randomized to receive study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Stool and/or flushing frequency of greater than or equal to 3 episodes/day (average&#xD;
             over a minimum five consecutive days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with somatostatin analogues must have&#xD;
             discontinued treatment for a sufficient period of time (a washout period of at least 7&#xD;
             days for immediate release formulations and up to 2 months for prolonged release&#xD;
             formulations is usually required). Compared with their &quot;controlled&quot; state on&#xD;
             treatment, these patients must show a clinically significant deterioration (at least&#xD;
             two episodes) of either symptom. For example, a patient considered to be controlled on&#xD;
             their previous treatment with an estimated stool frequency of two episodes per day,&#xD;
             must achieve a stool frequency of at least four episodes per day (average over a&#xD;
             minimum five consecutive days).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WHO performance score lower than 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  VIPoma or other non-carcinoid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with interferon, chemotherapy or radiotherapy given within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             inclusion, or planned during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radionuclide treatment within three months prior to inclusion, or planned during the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of other active malignant pathology (except basal cellular carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin and/or in situ carcinoma of the cervix/uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgical procedure or embolization procedure (with or without cytotoxic agents) of the&#xD;
             tumor within three months prior to inclusion, or planned during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of less than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any investigational drug given within 30 days prior to inclusion or expected to be&#xD;
             given during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No access to a telephone for completion of the daily telephone diary.&#xD;
