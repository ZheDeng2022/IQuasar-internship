  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study in previously untreated subjects with histologically or&#xD;
      cytologically proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC designed to determine the efficacy of first line&#xD;
      treatment with carboplatin and cetuximab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States.&#xD;
      Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis&#xD;
      for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is&#xD;
      limited. The study will test carboplatin in combination with a newly approved drug called&#xD;
      cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab&#xD;
      is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to work by attaching to an epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It&#xD;
      is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung cancers overexpress EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is built upon the data from the described studies, incorporating cetuximab&#xD;
      into a regimen of single-agent carboplatin. Previous data suggest that single agent&#xD;
      carboplatin is active in NSCLC. The addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent&#xD;
      cetuximab to carboplatin will presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping&#xD;
      toxicity to a minimum in patients with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population being studied in this trial is subjects with previously untreated Stage IIIB&#xD;
      or IV NSCLC. The research hypothesis is that these subjects will achieve a response (based on&#xD;
      RECIST criteria) to therapy with the combination of carboplatin and cetuximab.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed an approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with histologically or cytologically documented stage IIIB (supraclavicular&#xD;
             lymph node, high neck node, or pleural effusion involvement) or IV NSCLC. Disease must&#xD;
             be newly diagnosed or recurrent at least 1 year post adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If diagnostic tissue or slides are available for a subject, these must be submitted&#xD;
             for testing of EGFR status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with asymptomatic brain metastasis are eligible; however, they must have&#xD;
             completed radiotherapy/radiosurgery at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Radiotherapy&#xD;
             must have been completed &gt;2 weeks prior to enrollment and the subject must have&#xD;
             recovered from all adverse effects of prior radiotherapy. No previous irradiation to&#xD;
             the only area of measurable disease. New lesions that developed in a previously&#xD;
             irradiated area will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 4 weeks after the&#xD;
             study in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. WOCBP include any&#xD;
             female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is&#xD;
             not postmenopausal [defined as amenorrhea ≥12 consecutive months; or women on hormone&#xD;
             replacement therapy (HRT) with documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&#xD;
             level &gt;35mIU/mL]. Even women who are using oral, implanted or injectable contraceptive&#xD;
             hormones or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods&#xD;
             (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or&#xD;
             where partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy), should be considered to be of child&#xD;
             bearing potential. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum&#xD;
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physical and Laboratory Test Findings&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with adequate hematologic function defined as: ANC ≥1,500/mm 3 ; WBC&#xD;
&#xD;
             ≥3,000/mm 3 ; platelets ≥100,000/mm 3 ; and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with adequate hepatic function defined as: total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit&#xD;
             of normal (ULN) or AST ≤2.5 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with adequate renal function defined as a serum creatinine level ≤1.5 mg/dL&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any of the following criteria will make the subject ineligible to participate in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method to avoid pregnancy for&#xD;
             the entire study period and for up to 4 weeks after the study. Subjects who are men&#xD;
             must also agree to use effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP using a prohibited contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
