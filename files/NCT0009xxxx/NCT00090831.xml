  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the role of serotonin function in the brain. Serotonin, one of the&#xD;
      brain's natural chemicals, connects with receptors on brain cells to regulate emotion,&#xD;
      anxiety, sleep, stress hormones, and other body functions that are disturbed in various mood&#xD;
      and anxiety disorders. Also, the research will look at the function of particular brain&#xD;
      areas, how they are involved in regulating emotions, and how serotonin is involved in the&#xD;
      regulation of their function. The procedures entailed are tryptophan depletion and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imagining (MRI). Also, researchers' understanding of the genetic causes of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders will increase through examination of participants' DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults in good health, ages 20 through 50, may be eligible for this study. Among those not&#xD;
      eligible are females who are pregnant or breast feeding, patients with psychiatric or central&#xD;
      nervous system disease, and those taking medications that would interfere with study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, patients will be asked about their general mood, degree of nervousness,&#xD;
      thinking skills, and behavior. The session will last from 1.5 to 2.0 hours. A blood sample of&#xD;
      about 2 tablespoons will be drawn, for DNA study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures and tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test of vital signs, lying and standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of blood for chemistry and hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV, urine drug, and hepatitis screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychiatric screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (SqrRoot) -HCG pregnancy test, if applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second visit, patients will receive either tryptophan depletion or placebo, and 5&#xD;
      hours later, the study will begin, to last up to 2 additional hours. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      periodically about their emotional state or changes in their well-being. The MRI system will&#xD;
      create images of the brain's blood flow and measure glucose metabolism as a measure of brain&#xD;
      activity. During the MRI scan, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will&#xD;
      wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at&#xD;
      all times during the scan, and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. The&#xD;
      MRI session lasts up to 1.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of any medical tests or other information will not be provided to participants,&#xD;
      because further research may be needed before such results are meaningful. But if meaningful&#xD;
      information develops from this study that may be important for a participant's health, he or&#xD;
      she will be notified about it when it becomes available.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to use a targeted serotonergic manipulation [acute tryptophan&#xD;
      depletion (ATD)] and specific neurocognitive and neuroimaging paradigms to consider the role&#xD;
      of serotonin (5-HT) in emotional processing. In particular, we wish to evaluate claims that&#xD;
      serotonin has a role in the effective processing of aversive signals. Additionally, we wish&#xD;
      to examine whether tryptophan depletion will attenuate the neural response to aversive&#xD;
      material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy human adult volunteers, ages 20-50 years old, with no DSM-IV-defined Axis I mental&#xD;
      disease and who fulfill the remainder of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, outpatient&#xD;
      study in eligible, healthy volunteers. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to single doses of drug (ATD) or placebo. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical&#xD;
      Center Pharmacy will facilitate randomization and supply the randomization code to the&#xD;
      Clinical Center s Metabolic Nutrition Department (see below). All subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      for adverse events. Participants will give written, informed consent prior to any assessments&#xD;
      and procedures covered by this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the NIH Clinical Center 5SW Day Hospital and the NMRF center&#xD;
      (for the imaging arm of the study). Subjects will arrive in the morning of the testing day&#xD;
      and complete baseline measurements (i.e., mood and anxiety ratings and serum tryptophan&#xD;
      levels). Participants will then receive an oral dose of ATD capsules or placebo. Participants&#xD;
      will consume two meals during the study day; the placebo group (control subjects) will be&#xD;
      given high-tryptophan meals and tryptophan-depleted subjects will receive low-tryptophan&#xD;
      meals. Meals will be designed and supplied by the NIH Clinical Center Metabolic Nutrition&#xD;
      Department. At specified times, subjects will complete primary measures [either&#xD;
      neurocognitive or neuroimaging (fMRI) paradigms] and secondary measures (mood and anxiety&#xD;
      ratings and serum levels of tryptophan) as detailed in the protocol. Adverse events will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study day. A post-study evaluation will occur prior to discharging&#xD;
      the participant to verify that he/she is physically and mentally well and fit to leave the&#xD;
      Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurocognitive Paradigms: Behavioral measures including reaction time and accuracy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuroimaging Paradigms: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum tryptophan levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mood and Anxiety Rating Scales&#xD;
