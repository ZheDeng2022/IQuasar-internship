    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of cortisol (hydrocortisone), melatonin, a combination of&#xD;
      cortisol and melatonin, and placebo (an inactive substance) on jet lag symptoms. Jet lag is a&#xD;
      term used to describe symptoms people commonly experience after rapid travel across several&#xD;
      time zones. The cause of jet lag is not known, but various hormones, including cortisol and&#xD;
      melatonin, have a day-to-night pattern of secretion and play a role in maintaining the body's&#xD;
      internal rhythms. This study will test whether taking cortisol, melatonin, or both can help&#xD;
      re-establish the body's day-night cycle and result in less jet lag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 18 and 65 years of age who are planning a non-stop eastward flight with the&#xD;
      following characteristics may be eligible for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crossing six to eight time zones (6 to 8 hours difference between Eastern Standard Time&#xD;
           and the destination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Destination between 30 and 50 latitudes (approximately Cairo to London)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evening flight (5 PM to midnight) with morning arrival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remaining abroad at least 4-10 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates must have a body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 30 kg/M (not too thin and not&#xD;
      overweight) and must not be taking medicines that affect sleep or cortisol or melatonin&#xD;
      levels. Prospective participants are screened with a medical history, blood tests, and check&#xD;
      of blood pressure, height, and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-flight Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants keep a sleep journal 3 days before the flight. For 1 day within 3 days of the&#xD;
      flight they fill out jet lag and sleepiness questionnaires and collect morning and bedtime&#xD;
      saliva samples for measurement of cortisol and melatonin. The saliva is collected by chewing&#xD;
      on two small cotton pads and spitting them into a tube. Premenopausal women provide a urine&#xD;
      sample the week before the flight to test for pregnancy. On the day of the flight, the&#xD;
      participants do not collect saliva or fill out sleep logs or questionnaires. They are given&#xD;
      two bottles with study medication. One bottle, labeled &quot;AM,&quot; contains either hydrocortisone&#xD;
      or placebo; the other, labeled &quot;PM,&quot; contains either melatonin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-flight Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arriving at their destination in the morning, participants obtain a saliva sample and&#xD;
      take one of the capsules in the &quot;AM&quot; bottle. At bedtime, they collect saliva and then take&#xD;
      one of the &quot;PM&quot; capsules. They repeat the medication doses for a total of 4 days and repeat&#xD;
      the saliva collections on days 2 through 4, 7 and 10 after arrival. In addition, participants&#xD;
      complete jet lag and sleep questionnaires in the morning, afternoon, and just before bedtime&#xD;
      on the day of arrival and on days 2 through 4, 7 and 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they return from their trip, participants are seen at the NIH Clinic to bring in their&#xD;
      saliva specimens and review their questionnaires with study investigators.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Jet lag resulting from rapid flight across several time zones is a common complaint of&#xD;
      travelers. The symptoms of jet lag are primarily described as daytime sleepiness, fatigue,&#xD;
      and impaired mental efficiency and can also include weakness and irritability. It is&#xD;
      considered to be due to the desynchronization between the internal circadian rhythm and the&#xD;
      new local day-night cycle at the traveler's destination. A means of rapidly resynchronizing&#xD;
      the circadian rhythm to the local time would benefit people who suffer severely from this&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What actually underlies jet lag is a question that has not been fully answered. Various&#xD;
      endogenous hormones, including cortisol and melatonin, have a natural circadian rhythmicity&#xD;
      and play a role in maintaining the body's internal clock. Cortisol is produced by the&#xD;
      hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal axis in a circadian manner and in response to stress. Normal&#xD;
      cortisol has a diurnal rhythm with a maximum level in the morning and a nadir during the&#xD;
      night. While a time shift does not change the total daily amount of cortisol that is&#xD;
      secreted, the temporal organization of the cortisol secretions is disrupted and the circadian&#xD;
      rhythm does not re-entrain for several days. Thus, the first few mornings in a new time zone&#xD;
      can be considered relatively cortisol-deficient because the traveler does not experience the&#xD;
      peak of cortisol at the time of awakening. Taking exogenous glucocorticoids at the proper&#xD;
      time may help re-entrain the circadian rhythm faster and result in less jet lag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a hormone that is secreted nocturnally by the pineal gland. Exposure to bright&#xD;
      light diminishes its release while darkness triggers it. A recent meta-analysis has shown&#xD;
      that taking melatonin can alleviate symptoms of jet lag.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is an attempt for the first time to attenuate jet lag symptoms&#xD;
      with hydrocortisone, melatonin, a combination of both hydrocortisone and melatonin or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight normal volunteers will be randomized in blocks of eight to one of four treatment&#xD;
      arms: hydrocortisone (25 mg) alone, melatonin (5 mg) alone, hydrocortisone (25 mg) and&#xD;
      melatonin (5 mg) in combination, and placebo. Volunteers will travel in an eastwardly&#xD;
      direction across 6-8 time zones. Upon morning arrival at the new destination, volunteers will&#xD;
      obtain a saliva sample and then take 25 mg hydrocortisone (or placebo). At the target bedtime&#xD;
      of (10 pm to midnight local time) they will take 5 mg of melatonin (or placebo). Volunteers&#xD;
      will wake up at 7 am-10:30 am (local time) and take 25 mg hydrocortisone (or placebo).&#xD;
      Subjects will repeat these dosages for 3 days for a total of four days. Participants also&#xD;
      will obtain salivary samples of cortisol and melatonin on awakening and at bedtime on one day&#xD;
      before travel and at the new destination for days 1 - 4, 7 and 10 after arrival. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be subjective rating of jet lag and components or correlates of this&#xD;
      such as fatigue and daytime tiredness. Subjects will keep sleep logs and fill out a symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire daily for 3 days before and 4 days after the flight and on days 7 and 10.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be the measurement of salivary cortisol and melatonin. The data&#xD;
      obtained from this study will provide an assessment of effective treatment of jet lag&#xD;
      syndrome and will provide a better understanding of the role of hormones in the disruption of&#xD;
      the circadian rhythm.&#xD;
