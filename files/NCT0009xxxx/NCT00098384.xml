  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of poorly absorbed rifaximin in&#xD;
      the prevention of travelers' diarrhea among U.S. college students in Mexico for five weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated proposal wherein 220 male and female subjects &gt;17 years of&#xD;
      age from industrialized regions were randomized to receive a poorly absorbed antibiotic,&#xD;
      rifaximin, in one of three doses at mealtime (when they are exposed to diarrhea-causing&#xD;
      bacteria), 200 mg once a day, 200 mg twice a day or 200 mg three times a day versus a placebo&#xD;
      starting on arrival (within the first 72 hours) to Mexico and continuing for two weeks with&#xD;
      diaries of symptoms recorded for three weeks. Adverse events in the subjects were followed&#xD;
      for five weeks. If mild diarrhea (1 or 2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) or&#xD;
      diarrheal illness (&gt;2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) developed, subjects&#xD;
      provided a stool sample to determine cause of illness. Forty subjects provided stool samples&#xD;
      after 7 days and 14 days treatment to see if their intestinal bacterial flora had developed&#xD;
      resistance to rifaximin and to see the level of drug achieved. Stool samples from these forty&#xD;
      subjects were studied for enteric pathogens to look for asymptomatic infection during the&#xD;
      period of prophylaxis. The stool samples collected were initially processed in our enteric&#xD;
      laboratories in Guadalajara, Mexico. Specialized tests such as studies of toxigenicity for&#xD;
      enterotoxigenic E. coli and enteroadherence for enteroaggregative E. coli were done in&#xD;
      Houston.&#xD;
