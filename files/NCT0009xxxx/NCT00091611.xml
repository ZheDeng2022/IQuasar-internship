      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some patients with advanced kidney cancer have immune cells that can recognize and kill&#xD;
           their cancer, but the cells are not active enough or numerous enough to accomplish this&#xD;
           on their own.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In recent studies of patients with advanced melanoma, some patients given special&#xD;
           tumor-fighting cells (cells taken from the patient's tumor cells and grown in the&#xD;
           laboratory) showed some anti-tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine whether special tumor-fighting cells taken from the patient's blood or tumor&#xD;
      and grown in the laboratory can cause tumors in patients with kidney cancer to shrink when&#xD;
      they are given back to the patient along with interleukin-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with advanced kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 29 patients will be treated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo tumor biopsy to collect tumor cells for creating special tumor-fighting&#xD;
           cells for later infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo apheresis to collect stem cells for later re-infusion. For apheresis,&#xD;
           whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and circulated through a&#xD;
           cell-separating machine where the stem cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is&#xD;
           returned through the same needle or a needle in the other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before receiving the treated white cells, patients are given two drugs to suppress the&#xD;
           immune system so the treated cells can work without interference from immune system&#xD;
           cells. They are given cyclophosphamide over 2 days through a catheter (plastic tube&#xD;
           inserted into a vein in the arm or neck) and fludarabine through the catheter over 15-30&#xD;
           minutes for the next 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day after the last dose of fludarabine, the tumor-fighting cells are infused through&#xD;
           a vein over 10-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the cell infusion, patients start treatment with high-dose interleukin-2 every&#xD;
           8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are evaluated with x-ray studies about 1 month after receiving the cells and&#xD;
           interleukin 2 (IL-2) to look for tumor response to treatment. Those who show significant&#xD;
           improvement continue to receive treatment until the treated cells are used up or the&#xD;
           patient no longer benefits or develops unacceptable side effects.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One area of therapeutic advancement in immunotherapy has been to identify autologous&#xD;
      tumor-reactive T-cells and expand them in vitro, and administer them in adoptive transfer&#xD;
      back to patients. These T-cells have been obtained either from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes&#xD;
      (TIL) which appear enriched for tumor-reactive T-cells or by in vitro stimulation of&#xD;
      peripheral blood T-cells from cancer patients. Recent success in patients with melanoma has&#xD;
      in large part been due to a T-cell expansion protocol described by Riddell et al. using&#xD;
      anti-CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) and irradiated allogeneic feeder cells and the use of&#xD;
      conditioning chemotherapy prior to cell transfer. This current study uses the results of&#xD;
      these Surgery Branch adoptive cell therapy trials to study their potential in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to determine whether adoptive lymphocyte transfer in&#xD;
      conjunction with preparative lympho-depletion chemotherapy and interleukin-2 (IL-2) may&#xD;
      result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic renal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer who have failed conventional therapy with&#xD;
      interleukin-2, from whom tumor-reactive lymphocytes (from either peripheral blood, lymph&#xD;
      nodes or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) can be obtained and expanded in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must meet specific safety laboratory criteria, be able to tolerate interleukin 2&#xD;
      (IL-2), and have no concurrent major medical illnesses or symptomatic brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day intravenous (IV)) on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine (25&#xD;
      mg/m^2/day intravenous (IV)) on days -5 through -1. On day 0 patients will receive an&#xD;
      infusion of their own tumor-reactive T cells grown in vitro (greater than or equal to 5x10^8&#xD;
      cells for a cycle) and then begin high-dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg intravenous (IV) every 8&#xD;
      hours for up to 15 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and Immunologic response will be evaluated about 3 to 5 weeks after the treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted as a phase II trial using a two-stage MinMax design which will&#xD;
      try to determine whether intravenous (IV) cell administration can produce a modest response&#xD;
      rate targeted to be greater than or equal to 35 % (p1=0.35) as opposed to an undesirably low&#xD;
      response rate of less than 15% (p0=0.15). If at least 3 patients of 15 have an objective&#xD;
      response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) accrual will proceed to 28&#xD;
      patients, with a projected accrual over three years.&#xD;
