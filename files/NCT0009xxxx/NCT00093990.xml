  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of tipifarnib in patients aged 70&#xD;
      or more with acute myeloid leukemia. Tipifarnib belongs to a class of drugs called Farnesyl&#xD;
      Transferase Inhibitors (FTI). It blocks proteins that make leukemia cells grow.&#xD;

      This study tests the safety and effectiveness of the experimental drug, tipifarnib in older&#xD;
      patients who have acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to test if&#xD;
      tipifarnib can make patients with leukemia live longer. In this study, half the patients will&#xD;
      receive tipifarnib and half of the patients will receive the standard treatment. The standard&#xD;
      treatment will help to control the symptoms of AML and may include hydroxyurea to lower&#xD;
      levels of circulating leukemia cells. Tipifarnib or the standard treatment will be given&#xD;
      until the patient's leukemia gets better, or until they experience unacceptable side effects,&#xD;
      or until the patient or study doctor decide to stop the study medication. Patients assigned&#xD;
      to tipifarnib will be given tipifarnib tablets. Patients should take 6 tablets with food in&#xD;
      the morning and 6 tablets with food in the evening, for 21 days in a row. Patients will not&#xD;
      take tipifarnib for the next 7 days. This 28 day period is called a cycle. The rest period&#xD;
      may be extended beyond 7 days depending on how well the patients tolerate the treatment.&#xD;
      Patients will return to the study clinic every week and to visit their study doctor at least&#xD;
      every two weeks. A blood draw for routine tests will be done every week. Depending on how&#xD;
      your disease is doing, a bone marrow aspiration may be done at the end of every cycle. When&#xD;
      patients finish treatment with the study medication, or if they leave the study early, they&#xD;
      will be asked to see your doctor for one last visit. Routine laboratory tests will be done.&#xD;
      After this visit the study doctor will continue to check with patients to see how they are&#xD;
      doing and if they have started a new treatment for leukemia. This check will be made every 30&#xD;
      days and may be made by phone to the patient or to their health care provider. Tipifarnib;&#xD;
      six 100 mg in a film coated, compressed tablets are given orally twice a day at for 21&#xD;
      consecutive days on a 28-day cycle schedule.&#xD;
