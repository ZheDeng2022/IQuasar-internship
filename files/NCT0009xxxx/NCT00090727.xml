      The purposes of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the largest dose of AQ4N that can be safely given once a week for three weeks out of a 4&#xD;
           week cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the side effects of AQ4N when given on the above schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how much AQ4N is in the blood and urine at specific times after administration and how&#xD;
           the body get rids of AQ4N&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if AQ4N helps treat cancer&#xD;

      This study is for people who have advanced cancer for which standard chemotherapy did not&#xD;
      work or for which there are no reliably, effective treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AQ4N is an experimental chemotherapy that is thought to target tumor areas with low oxygen&#xD;
      content and low blood supply; tumor areas that are usually the most resistant to standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment. AQ4N may be beneficial in cancer treatment by&#xD;
      interfering with a protein that is required for cells to grow and divide, causing tumors to&#xD;
      die or to delay their growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in this study will receive AQ4N. The dose will be increased for each new patient&#xD;
      or group of patients until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.&#xD;
