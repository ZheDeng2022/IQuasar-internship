      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of Zemplar® Capsule&#xD;
      versus placebo, in decreasing elevated intact parathyroid hormone levels in chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease stage 5 subjects with secondary hyperparathyroidism on hemodialysis or peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis, while using the revised dose titration scheme.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject was at least 18 years of age, diagnosed with CKD Stage 5 and undergoing HD or&#xD;
             PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, subject was either not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal&#xD;
             for at least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or was of childbearing potential and practicing 1 of&#xD;
             the protocol specified methods of birth control, was not breastfeeding and had a&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test prior to the Treatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For those subjects taking phosphate binders prior to the study, the subject had to&#xD;
             have been on a stable (type and dose) phosphate binder at least 4 weeks prior to the&#xD;
             Pretreatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For entry into the Pretreatment Phase, the subject must have had a calcium level &lt;=&#xD;
             10.5 mg/dL and a CaxP level &lt;= 65 mg2/dL2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For entry into the Treatment Phase, the subject must have had iPTH &gt;= 300 pg/mL&#xD;
             (determined by Nichols iPTH assay), a calcium level of 8.0 to 10.5 mg/dL, inclusive,&#xD;
             and CaxP &lt;= 65 mg2/dL2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent, approved by an Institutional&#xD;
             Review Board (IRB), after the nature of the study was explained and the subject had&#xD;
             the opportunity to ask questions. The informed consent was signed before any&#xD;
             study-specific procedures were performed or any medications were withheld.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria for HD subjects included the following: the subject was diagnosed&#xD;
             with CKD Stage 5 and must have been on maintenance HD 3 times a week (TIW) for at&#xD;
             least 2 months prior to the Screening Phase and was expected to remain on HD for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional criteria for PD subjects, included the following: the subject was diagnosed&#xD;
             with CKD Stage 5 and must have been on continuous PD (either continuous cycling&#xD;
             peritoneal dialysis [CCPD], continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD], or a&#xD;
             combination of the 2) 7 days per week for at least 2 months prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Phase and was expected to remain on this PD regimen for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs&#xD;
             similar to the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject received a partial parathyroidectomy within 1 year prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had acute renal failure within 3 months of the Screening Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had chronic gastrointestinal disease, which in the investigator's opinion, may&#xD;
             have resulted in clinically significant gastrointestinal malabsorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had taken aluminum-containing phosphate binders for &gt; 3 weeks in the last 3&#xD;
             months prior to the Screening Phase, or required such medications for &gt; 3 weeks in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had a current malignancy (with the exception of basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin), or clinically significant liver disease, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had a history of drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had evidence of poor compliance with diet, medication or HD/PD that may have&#xD;
             interfered, in the investigator's opinion, with adherence to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject had participated in any investigational drug or device study within 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to the Treatment Phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject was taking calcitonin, maintenance IV or oral glucocorticoids, cinacalcet,&#xD;
             bisphosphonates, vitamin D compounds (other than study drug), or other drugs that may&#xD;
             have affected calcium or bone metabolism, other than females on stable estrogen and/or&#xD;
             progestin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject was known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For any reason, subject was considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable&#xD;
             candidate to receive Zemplar.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Additional exclusion criteria for PD subjects, were: Subject had active peritonitis&#xD;
             within 1 month prior to the Screening Phase; Subject had more than 1 episode of&#xD;
             peritonitis within 4 months prior to the Screening Phase.&#xD;
