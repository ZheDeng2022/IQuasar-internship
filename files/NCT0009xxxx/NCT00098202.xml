  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a serious health problem in the developing world. This study looks at the&#xD;
      effects of changing the type of basic food staple (corn) used in Guatemala and infant zinc&#xD;
      supplementation on infants' growth, development, and illnesses from infectious diseases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor mineral nutrition, especially deficiencies of iron and zinc, is a major cause of&#xD;
      maternal and, especially, infant morbidity/mortality in developing world countries. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to determine whether: a) linear growth velocity between 6 and 12&#xD;
      months in infants receiving a 5mg Zn supplement will be greater than that for infants&#xD;
      receiving placebo; b) linear growth velocity will be greater for infants receiving&#xD;
      complementary foods containing low phytate maize than for the infants fed wild-type control&#xD;
      maize. In addition, Zn metabolic studies will be performed. The objective of the metabolic&#xD;
      studies are to measure key variables of Zn homeostasis in maternal participants during&#xD;
      changes in the reproductive cycle and in infants during a time when they are most vulnerable&#xD;
      to Zn deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measurement is linear growth velocity between 6 and 12 months. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are weight gain, diarrheal incidence/prevalence and infant neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      measures. Optional maternal and infant biochemical data will be collected from a convenience&#xD;
      sample comprised of willing participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One additional component to this study is to collect information on the nutritional status of&#xD;
      the women receiving low-phytate vs. control maize and the infants enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol for infants in this study specifies measurements of exchangeable zinc&#xD;
      pool (EZP) at 6 and 12 months of age; in order to lessen the burden of study participation we&#xD;
      plan to conduct the metabolic studies in infants at only nine months of age. In addition to&#xD;
      decreasing the number of infant studies, this change will enable families who are only&#xD;
      participating in the metabolic studies (not simultaneously enrolled in the sibling cohort) to&#xD;
      cease all study demands at the end of the nine month measurement (an overall decrease of&#xD;
      three months in study participation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure for this study is the quantity of zinc absorbed (mg/day)from&#xD;
      complementary foods and a Zn supplement at age 9 months. The rationale for measures of zinc&#xD;
      absorption in infants is that the low phytate complementary feeding is expected to have a&#xD;
      beneficial public health effect only if it results in enhanced mineral, especially zinc,&#xD;
      absorption. Therefore, confirmation of increased zinc absorption can be regarded as the first&#xD;
      logical stage of any efficacy study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 420 is required in order to observe a 6% increase in growth rates for Zn&#xD;
      supplemented infants compared to placebo treated infants within each maize group with 80%&#xD;
      power.&#xD;
