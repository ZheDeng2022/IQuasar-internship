      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a multi-organ alloimmune and autoimmune&#xD;
           disorder that occurs following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
           (alloHSCT). It is characterized by immune dysregulation, immunodeficiency, impaired&#xD;
           organ function, and decreased survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Each year about 8000 patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant&#xD;
           (alloHSCT) in North America and about 50% of patients who are transplanted develop&#xD;
           cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic GVHD is also a disorder that simultaneously affects many organ systems in highly&#xD;
           variable fashion and requires complex and coordinated medical management by multiple&#xD;
           medical specialties. There is an urgent need for progress in understanding and effective&#xD;
           treatments for cGVHD as it is one of the most serious complications of cancer therapy&#xD;
           and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a multidisciplinary clinic infrastructure for study of the pathogenesis and&#xD;
           natural history of cGVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively identify clinical and biological prognostic markers in patients with&#xD;
           cGVHD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop clinically relevant cGVHD grading scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify novel biological characteristics of cGVHD and to describe them in the&#xD;
           context of clinical history and presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential clinical and biological markers of cGVHD activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To improve understanding of the biology of cGVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify potential patients for cGVHD treatment protocols at the NCI and NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients age 1 and older referred by the primary transplant physician for the evaluation of&#xD;
      chronic graft-versus-host disease independent of underlying diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient undergoes initial clinical and laboratory multispecialty work-up at the NCI&#xD;
           cGVHD clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Minimally invasive biopsies and rarely, deep tissue biopsy may be obtained to confirm&#xD;
           the diagnosis and/or rule-out other pathologic process (in adults only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long tem data collection for evaluation of long-term outcomes will be conducted anually&#xD;
           as feasible&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Any patient age 1 and older referred by the primary transplant physician for the&#xD;
                  evaluation of chronic graft-versus-host disease independently of age or&#xD;
                  underlying diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patient or the patient's legal representative is able and willing to provide&#xD;
                  consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Significant medical condition or any other significant circumstance that could in the&#xD;
             PIs assessment affect the patient's ability to tolerate, comply, or complete the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who in the PIs assessment have a life expectancy less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Because it is not always possible to make a clear clinical distinction between&#xD;
             acute and chronic GVHD, patients with acute GVHD are not a-priori excluded until the&#xD;
             possibility of chronic GVHD is reliably excluded on the basis of the clinical&#xD;
             assessments in the cGVHD clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because multiple tests would need to be&#xD;
             excluded for safety of the patient and the fetus.&#xD;
