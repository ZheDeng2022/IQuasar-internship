  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether rituximab (RITUXAN (Trademark)) can relieve symptoms of stiff&#xD;
      person syndrome (SPS), a progressive disease that causes stiffness of the muscles and muscle&#xD;
      spasms induced by unexpected noises, touches, or stressful events. People with SPS may have&#xD;
      certain proteins in their blood called anti-GAD antibodies that may cause some of the&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease. Rituximab, a drug approved to treat lymphomas, targets certain white&#xD;
      blood cells that produce antibodies. This study will see if rituximab can also be effective&#xD;
      in patients with SPS who have high anti-GAD antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 25 and 80 years of age with SPS may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. Participants&#xD;
      undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rituximab or placebo treatment: Patients are randomly assigned to receive two infusions&#xD;
           by vein of either rituximab or placebo (a look-alike solution with no active ingredient)&#xD;
           2 weeks apart. The infusions last from 3 to 4 hours, but may take as long as 16 hours if&#xD;
           the rate must be slowed for any reason. Patients are followed monthly for up to 6 months&#xD;
           and then every 2 months for up to 1 year after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and interview, physical and neurological examinations: Patients are&#xD;
           questioned about their vaccination history, medical, surgical, and psychiatric history,&#xD;
           exposure to environmental toxins or viruses, and family and social history, including&#xD;
           habits and employment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood drawing: Blood samples are collected before the two infusions and at all follow-up&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apheresis: For this procedure, which is used to collect white blood cells, blood is&#xD;
           collected through a needle in an arm vein, similar to donating blood. The blood flows&#xD;
           from the vein through a catheter (plastic tube) into a machine that separates it into&#xD;
           its components by centrifugation (spinning). The white cells are removed and the rest of&#xD;
           the blood (red cells, plasma and platelets) is returned to the body through a second&#xD;
           needle in the other arm. The procedure takes about 60 to 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar puncture (spinal tap): Lumbar puncture is done to sample a small amount of&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord), for&#xD;
           analysis. For this procedure, the patient is given a local anesthetic and a needle is&#xD;
           inserted into the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF circulates&#xD;
           below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is withdrawn through the needle.&#xD;

      This study will examine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the humanized monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody Rituximab to induce a clinical and serological remission in patients with Stiff&#xD;
      Person Syndrome (SPS) associated with high anti-GAD antibodies. Rituximab is a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody specific for the common B cell antigen CD20. Its administration depletes pre-B and&#xD;
      mature B lymphocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. In humans with&#xD;
      indolent B cell lymphomas, Rituximab can be safely administered, is well tolerated, promotes&#xD;
      selective B cell depletion and lowers the serum IgG and IgM levels. Preliminary experience in&#xD;
      some non-malignant antibody-mediated disorders has shown that Rituximab was beneficial in&#xD;
      improving the patients' symptoms and reducing antibody level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPS is an antibody-mediated autoimmune disease affecting GABA-ergic transmission resulting in&#xD;
      incapacitating stiffness and spasms. The anti-GAD antibodies are also produced intrathecally&#xD;
      and it is believed to be responsible for the reduction of GABA level in serum and CSF.&#xD;
      Although removal or modulation of serum antibodies by plasmapheresis or IVIg results in&#xD;
      clinical improvement, a number of patients do not respond or their response is modest and&#xD;
      short-lived, and remain with significant disability. The need for more effective therapy&#xD;
      prompted us to conduct the present study to examine in a randomized trial if Rituximab is&#xD;
      effective in patients with GAD-antibody-positive SPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients will be randomized, in a double blind fashion, to receive placebo or&#xD;
      Rituximab given at a fixed dose of 1 GM on Day 1and 1 GM on day 15 (plus or minus 2 days).&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be based on measurements of stiffness using the Distribution of&#xD;
      Stiffness Index. Secondary outcomes will be measured by the Heightened-Sensitivity Scales.&#xD;
      The serum and CSF anti-GAD antibody titers, including intrathecal GAD-specific IgG synthesis,&#xD;
      will be monitored before and after treatment. Clearance of GAD-reactive T cells will be also&#xD;
      examined in the serum and CSF using T cell clones established from PBL and CSF. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the study will: a) provide a new, immune-based and target-oriented therapy&#xD;
      for patients with Stiff Person Syndrome and b) examine the pathogenetic role of anti-GAD&#xD;
      antibodies in the cause of the disease.&#xD;
