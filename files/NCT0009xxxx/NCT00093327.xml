      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture is effective in reducing the&#xD;
      symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&#xD;

      IBS is a disorder that affects colon functioning. Although it does not cause permanent harm&#xD;
      or lead to more serious conditions, IBS can cause a great deal of discomfort and distress.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of acupuncture in treating various conditions has been investigated in&#xD;
      numerous studies. However, little is known about acupuncture's efficacy in treating IBS. This&#xD;
      study will determine whether acupuncture can alleviate the symptoms of IBS, including pain&#xD;
      relief with defecation, changes in stools, and changes in the frequency of bowel movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive bi-weekly sessions of either&#xD;
      active or placebo acupuncture or no treatment for 6 weeks. Study visits will occur at study&#xD;
      start, Week 3, and Week 6 (study completion). At each study visit, blood collection will&#xD;
      occur to measure levels of cortisol, a stress hormone associated with IBS. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete questionnaires about their IBS symptoms. Selected participants will be&#xD;
      interviewed at each visit, in order to determine whether participants' interpretations and&#xD;
      understanding of IBS influences their response to treatment. Any subject who does not receive&#xD;
      active acupuncture during the trial is eligible for 6 free acupuncture treatments after the&#xD;
      study is over.&#xD;
