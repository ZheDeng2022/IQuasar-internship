  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a procedure called selective venous catheterization in patients with&#xD;
      tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) or oncogenic osteomalacia (OOM) to try to locate very small&#xD;
      tumors that produce proteins called phosphatonins. Too much phosphatonin in the blood causes&#xD;
      the kidneys to allow large amounts of phosphorus to be excreted in the urine, leading to low&#xD;
      blood levels of phosphorus and, in turn, to osteomalacia (a condition of soft bones).&#xD;
      Osteomalacia can cause bone fractures requiring many surgical procedures that can leave&#xD;
      patients in pain. Patients may also feel weak and can lose height from massive bone loss.&#xD;
      Selective venous catheterization is a way to measure the amount of phosphatonin in the blood&#xD;
      and may be used as a way to locate phosphatonin-producing tumors that cannot be found using&#xD;
      standard imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with TIO or OOM are screened under NIDR Protocol 01-D-0184 with a medical history,&#xD;
      review of medical records and routine physical examination. Other procedures may include&#xD;
      blood tests, urine tests, and imaging tests, such as x-rays, bone densitometry, bone scan,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study will include mostly&#xD;
      patients whose tumors were not able to be located through imaging procedures, but also a few&#xD;
      patients whose tumors were located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants, regardless of whether or not their tumor was located, undergo selective&#xD;
      venous catheterization. For this procedure, a radiologist inserts a catheter (thin flexible&#xD;
      tube) into the body and uses fluoroscopy (a type of x-ray) to guide the tip of the catheter&#xD;
      to different places in the body to collect small amounts of blood from the different areas.&#xD;
      After the procedure, the patient lies flat for 2 hours and avoids moving his or her leg on&#xD;
      the side where the catheter was placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood is analyzed to measure the amount phosphatonin is in each sample, and the amounts&#xD;
      are compared to the average amount of phosphatonin in the general blood circulation. If a&#xD;
      higher level of phosphatonin is found in one area and the location of the tumor is unknown,&#xD;
      the patient undergoes imaging in that area. If a tumor is found and it is in an area where it&#xD;
      can be removed surgically, the patient is given the option to have the surgery. If the tumor&#xD;
      is not found by imaging done after the first catheterization procedure, the patient has the&#xD;
      option to have a second catheterization, taking samples of blood only from the area where the&#xD;
      phosphatonin was found to be the highest during the sampling procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors elaborate phosphate lowering factors (phosphatonins) which&#xD;
      lead to tumor induced osteomalacia/osteogenic osteomalacia (TIO/OOM). Patients with TIO/OOM&#xD;
      suffer years of significant morbidity and debilitation unless their tumors, which are&#xD;
      notoriously difficult to locate, are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective venous catheterization has been used to localize hormonally active neoplasms by&#xD;
      demonstrating a gradient in the concentration of the hormone of interest between the vessel&#xD;
      immediately draining the tumor site and the peripheral circulation. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this protocol is to evaluate the utility of combining selective venous catheterization with&#xD;
      biochemical assays that identify phosphatonins in the serum as a way to identify phosphatonin&#xD;
      gradients and thereby localize phosphaturic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study population will consist of TIO/OOM patients with non-localized phosphaturic tumors&#xD;
      as well as five patients whose lesions have been identified with some certainty by&#xD;
      conventional imaging techniques. These individuals will undergo selective venous&#xD;
      catheterization during which blood samples will be obtained and processed for the presence of&#xD;
      phosphatonins. The primary endpoint will be met if a gradient indicating a possible tumor is&#xD;
      found, focused clinical imaging in the appropriate anatomical sub-region identifies a lesion,&#xD;
      and the lesion is confirmed to be a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor upon surgical removal.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have the clinical diagnosis of TIO/OOM to be considered for enrollment in&#xD;
        this study. The diagnosis will be based upon a clinical history including some or all of:&#xD;
        rickets (children), pathological fractures, bone pain, muscle weakness, low serum&#xD;
        phosphorus with concomitant inappropriately high urine phosphorus, low or inappropriately&#xD;
        low-normal serum vitamin 1,25 (OH)(2)-vitamin D3, and an elevated FGF-23 level in the&#xD;
        absence of a family history of a phosphate wasting syndrome. Along with the clinical&#xD;
        symptoms listed above, the patient must have undergone routine clinical imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion will be limited to all patients in whom a likely lesion was not localized by&#xD;
        imaging, plus five patients for whom a likely lesion has been identified by imaging.&#xD;
        Patients with a likely lesion identified will serve as positive controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with co-morbidities that would increase the risk of selective venous&#xD;
        catheterization will be excluded from the study. This includes but is not limited to&#xD;
        medical conditions such as: poorly controlled diabetes, renal insufficiency, chronic&#xD;
        obstructive pulmonary disease, anemia, hypertension, clotting disorders, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy is a contraindication to this venous catheterization procedure. A serum Beta-Hcg&#xD;
        will be required for all eligible women of childbearing age unless documentation of a&#xD;
        hysterectomy or other condition that makes pregnancy impossible is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent will exclude patients from this study.&#xD;
        Female patients who will not allow pregnancy testing and will not provide documentation&#xD;
        indicating a medical condition that makes pregnancy impossible will not be eligible for&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
