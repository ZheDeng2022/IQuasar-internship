      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TENOR (The Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimens)&#xD;
      study is an ongoing three-year multi-center observational cohort study of 4756 severe or&#xD;
      difficult-to-treat patients with asthma aged 6 or older. Of this group of asthmatics, 44.6%&#xD;
      meet the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute National Asthma Education and Prevention&#xD;
      Program guidelines for severe persistent asthma, 27.5% for moderate persistent asthma, and&#xD;
      27.8% for mild persistent asthma. All subjects were evaluated initially with comprehensive&#xD;
      questionnaires and laboratory testing, and are then seen every 6 months during the remaining&#xD;
      3 years of the study. Phenotypic information collected includes information on asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations, medication use, urgent care visits, quality of life, pulmonary function tests&#xD;
      (spirometry with reversibility), total serum IgE levels, and history of allergies. If&#xD;
      accessed now, before the termination of the TENOR study, this population represents one of&#xD;
      the largest populations of phenotypically characterized difficult-to-treat and severe&#xD;
      asthmatics potentially available for genomic and pharmacogenetic studies. TENOR will finish&#xD;
      at the end of 2004, thus there is a very short time window in which to obtain DNA samples for&#xD;
      genetic studies before the termination of the study. Isolation and storage of DNA from this&#xD;
      well characterized, longitudinal population will serve as a resource not only for the studies&#xD;
      in this grant but also for future genomics and pharmacogenetic studies in asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigates genetic factors that affect asthma severity in the TENOR subjects. The&#xD;
      study tests the hypothesis that factors which produce difficult-to-treat and severe asthma&#xD;
      are produced by altered inflammatory responses that are related, at least in part, to&#xD;
      sequence variants (polymorphisms) in genes that regulate inflammation, allergic&#xD;
      responsiveness, and/or affect structural components in the airways. The study also tests the&#xD;
      hypothesis that some patients develop more severe asthma because of genetic differences that&#xD;
      modulate their responses to pharmacologic agents. To test these hypotheses, the following&#xD;
      specific aims will be carried out: 1) Obtain DNA samples from at least 4,000 asthmatics&#xD;
      currently enrolled in the ongoing TENOR study; 2) Determine whether sequence variants&#xD;
      (polymorphisms) in genes that regulate inflammation, cellular responses, and/or tissue injury&#xD;
      and repair are more frequently associated with asthma severity using the baseline data; 3)&#xD;
      Determine the importance of genetic polymorphisms in genes that may be important in IgE&#xD;
      regulation in this population of difficult-to-treat patients with asthma; 4) Evaluate&#xD;
      pharmacogenetic relationships between polymorphisms in the a2 adrenergic receptor (a2AR) in&#xD;
      those subjects on long-acting beta-2-agonists to determine the effect on asthma severity; 5)&#xD;
      Evaluate pharmacologic mechanisms by investigating whether polymorphisms in genes that&#xD;
      regulate responses to asthma therapy are more frequent in severe disease.&#xD;
