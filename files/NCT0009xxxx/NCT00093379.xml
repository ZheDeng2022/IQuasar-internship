      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine and oxaliplatin, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Capecitabine&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Capecitabine and oxaliplatin may make tumor&#xD;
      cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining capecitabine and oxaliplatin with&#xD;
      radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving capecitabine and oxaliplatin&#xD;
      together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage II or stage III anal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine time to treatment failure in patients with stage II-IIIB squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma of the anal canal treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy&#xD;
           (i.e. Capecitabine (Xeloda)/Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) With Concomitant Radiotherapy (XRT)&#xD;
           shortened to XELOX/XRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine 2-year local regional control in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine 2-year colostomy-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine 2-year median overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine 2-year progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral capecitabine* twice daily on days 1-2, 6-10, 20-24, 27-31, and&#xD;
      41-42, and undergo radiotherapy* once daily on days 1-3, 6-10, 13-17, 20-24, 27-31, 34-38,&#xD;
      and 41-42. Patients also receive oxaliplatin intravenous (IV) over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 22,&#xD;
      and 29. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Patients with T3-4 lesions also receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo&#xD;
      radiotherapy once daily on days 43 and 44.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed at 4-6 and 12 weeks and then periodically thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 71 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Previously untreated patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of&#xD;
             the anal canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II-IIIB (TX 1-4, NX, MO).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age &gt;/= 16 yrs old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale (PS) 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate organ function including: Absolute neutrophil Count (ANC) &gt;/= 1,500/uL,&#xD;
             Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/uL, Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 * upper limit of normal (ULN),&#xD;
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) &lt;/= 3&#xD;
             * ULN, Creatinine &lt;/= 1.5mg/dL or Creatinine Clearance (CrCL) &gt;/= 50 cc/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease. Patients with measurable&#xD;
             disease, as defined by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
             (RECIST) criteria, have at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at&#xD;
             least one dimension with longest diameter to be recorded &gt;/= 20 mm using conventional&#xD;
             techniques or &gt;/= 10 mm with spiral CT scan (with minimum lesion size no less than&#xD;
             double the slice thickness). Lesions seen on colonoscopy or barium studies are not&#xD;
             considered measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A negative pregnancy test in all women of child-bearing potential, within two weeks of&#xD;
             initiating treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The effects of oxaliplatin and capecitabine on the developing human fetus at the&#xD;
             recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because cytotoxic agents&#xD;
             are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to&#xD;
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign the written informed&#xD;
             consent/authorization document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior chemotherapy with oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or 5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Prior radiation to the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior surgery for anal cancer excluding prior biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known history of dihydropyrimidine (DPD) deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known history of hypersensitivity to platinum-containing compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Peripheral neuropathy of &gt;/= grade 2 by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
             (CTCAE) 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) &lt; 50 cc/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit adherence with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a&#xD;
             requirement for intravenous (IV) alimentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with oxaliplatin or capecitabine, breast feeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Because of the known interaction of capecitabine and coumadin, patients taking&#xD;
             coumadin will be ineligible. Patients will be requested to discontinue coumadin and&#xD;
             utilize Lovenox if agreeable. Patients must have discontinued coumadin for 7 days&#xD;
             before initiating therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. No prior malignancies (excluding non-melanomatous skin neoplasms) over the past 5&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             this study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with capecitabine or&#xD;
             oxaliplatin. This exclusion is for patient safety since patients with immune&#xD;
             deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy, and because very few HIV-positive anal canal cancer&#xD;
             patients are seen at this institution. This hinders us from accruing enough patients&#xD;
             to adequately test the safety of this regimen in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary fibrosis.&#xD;
