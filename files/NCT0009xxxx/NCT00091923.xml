      The objectives of the Spectacle Phase are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In previously untreated pure anisometropic patients (i.e. patients who have not used&#xD;
           spectacles in the last year and who do not have strabismus), to determine&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. the incidence of resolution of amblyopia with spectacle correction alone and&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. the time course of visual acuity improvement with spectacle correction alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In all other patients, to achieve maximal improvement with spectacle correction prior to&#xD;
           entering the randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the Randomized Trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether 5 weeks of patching treatment (2 hours of patching per day of the&#xD;
           sound eye combined with at least one concurrent hour of near activities), compared with&#xD;
           a control group (using spectacle correction only), improves visual acuity in patients&#xD;
           with moderate to severe amblyopia (20/40 to 20/400).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximal improvement and time course of improvement with this patching&#xD;
           treatment regimen.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few data on the improvement that occurs with spectacle correction alone in cases of&#xD;
      anisometropic amblyopia. The only published study of which we are aware is that of Moseley,&#xD;
      et al, who found that 8 of 12 patients prescribed spectacles for the first time improved 3 or&#xD;
      more lines in the amblyopic eye. Therefore, the Spectacle Phase of the current study will&#xD;
      provide important information related to the management of patients with anisometropic&#xD;
      amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, despite clinical experience that strongly indicates that amblyopia can be&#xD;
      improved with treatment, there are those who claim that the benefit of treatment is unproven.&#xD;
      Although improvement with amblyopia therapy has been shown in prospective trials, there have&#xD;
      been no conclusive data published from a randomized trial evaluating the effect of amblyopia&#xD;
      treatment compared with a control group. Therefore, we have designed a randomized trial to&#xD;
      definitively address this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the trial, the effect on amblyopic eye acuity after five weeks of 2 hours of prescribed&#xD;
      daily patching (combined with at least one hour of concurrent near activities) will be&#xD;
      compared with a control group using spectacle correction only. In a study conducted by the&#xD;
      Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group, a 2-hour daily patching treatment regimen improved&#xD;
      moderate amblyopia (20/40 to 20/80) by an amount similar to the improvement seen with 6 hours&#xD;
      of daily patching.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of five weeks, patients whose amblyopic eye has improved from baseline will&#xD;
      continue in follow up, using the assigned treatment, until the amblyopic eye acuity stops&#xD;
      improving or until the amblyopia resolves. This will provide data on the maximum improvement&#xD;
      achievable with this treatment regimen and on the time course to reach maximal improvement.&#xD;
      There is no known harm in deferring treatment of amblyopia for five weeks in the age range to&#xD;
      be included in the trial (3 to &lt;7 years old). Standard care for a patient with amblyopia&#xD;
      includes prescribing spectacle correction and having the patient return in 4 to 6 weeks for&#xD;
      measurement of visual acuity. Spectacles alone are continued as long as the acuity in the&#xD;
      amblyopic eye is improving. Once the acuity stops improving, occlusion or other active&#xD;
      treatment is initiated. The maximum delay in active treatment of the control group beyond the&#xD;
      standard of care is 5 weeks. In our prior Amblyopia Treatment Study protocols on patients in&#xD;
      this age range, we have found no indication that the response to patching treatment is&#xD;
      related to age. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a delay in initiating treatment of&#xD;
      weeks or even months could be harmful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is addressing issues related to the treatment of amblyopia in children 3 to &lt;7&#xD;
      years old with visual acuity 20/40 to 20/400. The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a Spectacle Phase in which patients are prescribed spectacles and followed until maximal&#xD;
           improvement in visual acuity has occurred and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a Randomized Trial comparing a group using patching treatment (in addition to spectacle&#xD;
           correction) with a control group using spectacle correction only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the primary analysis for the randomized trial has been estimated to be&#xD;
      134 patients. Patients will be enrolled into the Spectacle Phase until the recruitment goal&#xD;
      for the Randomized Trial is reached.&#xD;
