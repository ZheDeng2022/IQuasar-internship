  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore what research patients understand about financial collaborations in&#xD;
      the research setting and their concerns about these collaborations. Financial partnerships&#xD;
      are crucial to advancing medical research; however, they are giving rise to increasing&#xD;
      concerns about financial conflicts of interest and possible impacts on the integrity of&#xD;
      research and patient safety. This study will examine patients' views about financial ties&#xD;
      between drug companies and the doctors running research studies, as well as ties between the&#xD;
      drug companies and the cancer centers where the studies are conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who are enrolled in cancer studies at the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute in Bethesda, MD; the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA; the&#xD;
      Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA; the Columbia Comprehensive University Herbert&#xD;
      Irving Cancer Center in New York, NY; and the University of Colorado Cancer Center in Denver,&#xD;
      CO, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are interviewed about the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' awareness and understanding about individual and institutional financial&#xD;
           conflicts of interest, and how such conflicts, if they exist, are being managed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of a researcher's financial ties on the patient's decision to participate in&#xD;
           that researcher's study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The impact of the institution's financial ties on the patient's decision to participate&#xD;
           in research at that institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes about policies and practices regarding conflicts of interest in the research&#xD;
           setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes about disclosure of conflicts of interest in the research setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient symptoms and performance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's cancer trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's cancer history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's trust&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographics (gender, age, race, religion, education, income, health insurance,&#xD;
           employment).&#xD;

      This study seeks to inform deliberation of ethical issues related to financial conflicts of&#xD;
      interest in clinical research through empirical data obtained from patients participating in&#xD;
      cancer studies. In particular, this study endeavors to describe and summarize the views of&#xD;
      patients about both individual and institutional financial conflicts of interest pertaining&#xD;
      to clinical research. This study will assess awareness of financial conflicts of interest and&#xD;
      the current safeguards in place to manage financial ties; assess the impact of hypothetical&#xD;
      financial conflicts of interest on a research subject's decision to participate in a clinical&#xD;
      study; identify the reasons that financial conflicts of interest either do or do not&#xD;
      influence patients' research participation; summarize views regarding the presence of&#xD;
      financial conflicts of interest and what limits should be in place to manage them; identify&#xD;
      interests about disclosure of these financial conflicts of interest; describe demographic&#xD;
      characteristics of subjects enrolled in the survey and evaluate the impact of demographic&#xD;
      information on subjects' views regarding financial conflicts of interest. Participants will&#xD;
      be recruited from all phases of oncology studies being conducted at 5 sites, the National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD; the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, MA; the Fred&#xD;
      Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA; the University of Colorado Cancer Center in&#xD;
      Denver, CO, and the Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center in New&#xD;
      York, NY. The primary methodology for the study is an in-person administration of a&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
