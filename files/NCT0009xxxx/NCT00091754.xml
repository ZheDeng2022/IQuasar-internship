      To identify new cellular, metabolic, and genomic correlates of atherosclerotic plaque and&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study draws upon the existing ARIC cohort of 15,792 members aged 45-64 years at baseline&#xD;
      in 1987-1989 who have completed four clinic exams three years apart with the last exam in&#xD;
      1998. The longitudinal ARIC cohort study focused on new cardiovascular disease [CVD] risk&#xD;
      factors and subclinical measures of atherosclerosis through B-mode ultrasound of the carotid&#xD;
      arteries. The current study collects new and novel risk factors and performs carotid magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) examinations on a stratified random sample of 1,200 ARIC participants&#xD;
      with high (&gt;85th percentile) carotid intimal-medial thickness [IMT] by ultrasound and 800&#xD;
      participants with &lt;85th percentile IMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines an informative subset of the bi-ethnic Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities&#xD;
      (ARIC) cohort to identify cellular, metabolic and genomic correlates of atherosclerotic&#xD;
      plaque characteristics and of early changes in the vascular wall. The longitudinal follow-up&#xD;
      and stored DNA in ARIC will allow testing the ability of the genomic correlates of plaque&#xD;
      characteristics to predict incident coronary heart disease and stroke. One thousand two&#xD;
      hundred individuals with high (&gt;85th percentile) carotid artery wall thickness documented by&#xD;
      B-mode ultrasound and 800 individuals sampled from the remainder of the carotid artery wall&#xD;
      thickness distribution (&lt;85th percentile) will receive a contrast-enhanced carotid MRI&#xD;
      examination. Standardized MRI measures will include carotid artery wall thickness, T2 signal&#xD;
      intensity changes and percent contrast enhancement indicative of endothelial dysfunction, and&#xD;
      for those with plaque, fibrous cap thickness, lipid core volume, and calcification. Novel&#xD;
      cellular, metabolic and genomic measures will be collected and will be related to&#xD;
      MRI-measurable plaque characteristics. In particular, flow cytometry will be used to measure&#xD;
      monocyte and platelet presentation of cytokines, growth factors and adhesion molecules, and&#xD;
      cell-cell aggregation. High throughput genotyping methods will be used to measure 5 to 7&#xD;
      polymorphic sites in each of 150 positional, expressional and biologic candidate genes,&#xD;
      permitting multilocus and haplotype genomic analyses. The depth and breadth of existing risk&#xD;
      factor and lifestyle data, extensive follow-up since 1986-89, and accumulation of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke and arteriosclerosis, contribute&#xD;
      additional strengths to the laboratory and MRI investigations. Inferences will be made both&#xD;
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with a special emphasis on genotype plus environment&#xD;
      interaction. The ARIC cohort is in an ideal age range for the research because of the&#xD;
      frequent and documented occurrence of plaque and the spectrum of clinically relevant stages&#xD;
      from plaque initiation to mature fibrosis, calcification and even erosion and near-rupture.&#xD;
