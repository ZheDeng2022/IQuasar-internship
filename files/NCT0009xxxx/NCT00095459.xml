      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BAY 43-9006 is an inhibitor of wild-type and mutant B-Raf and c-Raf kinase isoforms in&#xD;
           vitro, but it also inhibits p38, c-kit, VEGFR-2 and PDGFR-Beta affecting tumor growth as&#xD;
           well as possibly promoting apoptosis by events downstream of c-Raf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds all biologically&#xD;
           active isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, or VEGF-A) with high&#xD;
           affinity (k(d)= 1.1nM)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The most common adverse events associated with bevacizumab of any severity include&#xD;
           asthenia, pain, headache, hypertension, diarrhea, stomatitis, constipation, epistaxis,&#xD;
           dyspnea, dermatitis and proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This Phase I trial is open to patients with all solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib) and&#xD;
           bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine estimates of biochemical changes in the Ras-Raf-MAPK and VEGF signal&#xD;
           transduction pathways in tumor and stromal cells in response to treatment at the MTD, at&#xD;
           least in a pilot fashion, if those changes are statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adults with histologically documented solid tumor malignancy that is metastatic or&#xD;
           unresectable and for which standard curative therapies do not exist or are no longer&#xD;
           effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be off prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or&#xD;
           biological therapy for at least 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients enrolling in cohort 2 must have at least one lesion amenable to biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 and adequate organ and marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort I will receive BAY 43-9006 and bevacizumab together at the start of study in a&#xD;
           dose escalation fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort II will be randomized as to which agent they receive for cycle one. Cycles 2 and&#xD;
           beyond are treated using both agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsies will be obtained from patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks&#xD;
           into mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DCE-MRI studies will be obtained on patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks&#xD;
           into monotherapy, four weeks into monotherapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FDG-PET studies will be obtained on patients in Cohort II before treatment, two weeks&#xD;
           into mono-therapy, and two weeks into combinatorial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for toxicity in clinic every 2 weeks for Cycles 1 and 2, and&#xD;
           then every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be evaluated for response every 8 weeks using the RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 62 patients will be needed to achieve the objectives of the trial.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a history of remote CNS metastases that have undergone &quot;curative&#xD;
             therapy&quot; by radiation therapy, gamma knife therapy, or surgery and have remained&#xD;

             on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CNS imaging will not be mandated for all patients. However, if there is clinical&#xD;
             suspicion of CNS involvement, a contrast CT or MRI of the brain will be required.&#xD;
             Screening CNS scans should be required for certain tumor types with relatively high&#xD;

        (including transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary embolism, unstable angina, or myocardial&#xD;
        infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (AHA Class II or worse), unstable angina&#xD;
        pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
        compliance with study requirements.&#xD;

        after completing antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the&#xD;
        study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006, bevacizumab,&#xD;
        and/or the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have been treated with BAY 43-9006 or bevacizumab will be excluded&#xD;

        greater than 90 mmHg despite optimal medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Proteinuria defined as a 24-hour urine protein excretion greater than 1000 mg. Spot urine&#xD;
        analysis for protein creatinine ratio (UPC) of 0.5 or greater will require a 24-hour urine&#xD;
        to determine eligibility for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Therapeutic anticoagulation with coumadin, heparins, or heparinoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Serious non-healing wounds (including wounds healing by secondary intention), acute or&#xD;

&#xD;
        History of hemoptysis or surgery within the past 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs will be excluded due to risk of fatal&#xD;
        pulmonary hemorrhage. If a patient has a history of any type primary lung cancer and&#xD;
        hemoptysis, they will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        History of high grade varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Use of herbal supplements are not permitted within 14 days of trial commencement and on&#xD;
        study. Vitamin supplement (above a typical single multi-vitamin) usage is discouraged&#xD;
        unless clearly indicated by an existing medical condition. An Associate or Principal&#xD;
        Investigator will have the discretion regarding which vitamin supplements are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary cell products or other&#xD;
        recombinant human antibodies.&#xD;
