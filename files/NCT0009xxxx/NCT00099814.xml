  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthodontic treatment requires application of force systems to individual teeth or groups of&#xD;
      teeth, which results in a cellular response with periodontal ligament (PDL) and alveolar bone&#xD;
      remodeling. The forces applied must be of sufficient magnitude and duration to exceed the&#xD;
      normal physiologic threshold associated with daily oral function. Excessive force levels will&#xD;
      result in areas of tissue necrosis with delayed tooth movement and increased risk of root&#xD;
      resorption. Although orthodontic tooth movement is achieved in a large segment of the&#xD;
      population, the optimum force level has not been defined. The optimum force for tooth&#xD;
      movement depends on individual root geometry as well as biologic characteristics of&#xD;
      surrounding tissue including bone density, periodontal thickness, and fluid dynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because experimental and clinical techniques are generally limited to known complex force&#xD;
      systems, biomechanical modeling has become a necessity. Such models must be validated with&#xD;
      well-controlled clinical studies that evaluate orthodontic tooth movement over an extended&#xD;
      distance. The ultimate goal would be development of a computer simulation model to predict&#xD;
      tooth movement in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to test controlled clinical data with a biomechanical&#xD;
      model of the tooth and supporting tissues for distal movement of the human maxillary canine&#xD;
      tooth (of known root geometry) in response to various 3D force systems that produce different&#xD;
      levels of stress in the supporting tissues. Secondary objectives include evaluation of rate&#xD;
      of bodily tooth canine movement with two known compressive stress levels (13 and 22 kPa),&#xD;
      evaluation of three different reference systems to measure rate of tooth movement, and&#xD;
      evaluation of an implant placed in the roof of the mouth (palatal implant) for orthodontic&#xD;
      anchorage in adolescent patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of translation (bodily) tooth movement of the maxillary canine tooth will be&#xD;
      significantly greater with 22kPa compared to 13kPa compressive stress applied to the&#xD;
      periodontal ligament, and this difference can be predicted by appropriate&#xD;
      mathematical/numerical models of the tooth and supporting tissues.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be drawn from those recruited for the Graduate Orthodontic Graduate&#xD;
      Program. Clinical academic staff will examine approximately 500 patients seeking orthodontic&#xD;
      care. Patients are categorized by malocclusion type and placed into a patient pool from which&#xD;
      some cases are selected for treatment based on the program teaching and research needs. Each&#xD;
      year approximately 50% of patients seeking care are ultimately accepted. Treatment is&#xD;
      provided at fees that are approximately 60% of those charged in private practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the selection criteria for this study will be randomly selected from the&#xD;
      University of Alberta Graduate Orthodontic Graduate Clinic patient pool. Upper 1st premolar&#xD;
      teeth will be extracted and full fixed orthodontic appliances (Ormco Orthos prescription)&#xD;
      will be placed. After the initial alignment and leveling phase is completed the retraction&#xD;
      phase will begin. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents will be avoided; only extra strength&#xD;
      Tylenol will be prescribed as necessary for any momentary pain or discomfort. Maximum&#xD;
      posterior anchorage will be attained through a palatal implant (Straumann) according to the&#xD;
      protocol described by Papadakis. The implants will be also used as three-dimensional movement&#xD;
      reference points. Other reference systems to be used include the palatal ruggae and occlusal&#xD;
      templates. The cuspid retraction force delivery mechanisms will consist of customized&#xD;
      activated stainless steel T-loops designed to generate the required forces on the bracket.&#xD;
      Approximate compressive stress (based on approximate root surface area) of 13 kPa and 22 kPa&#xD;
      will be applied on the distal aspect of the cuspids. The design will be a split-mouth study&#xD;
      in which both levels of stress will be applied in each patient. The side to which the higher&#xD;
      and lower stress levels are applied will be randomized. This design will allow for inter and&#xD;
      intra-patient comparisons since each patient will see both stress levels. After the initial&#xD;
      activation the subjects will be seen at day 1, 3, 17 and thereafter at 4-week intervals until&#xD;
      the space between the cuspid and second bicuspid is completely closed. In the initial&#xD;
      activation session and each of the follow-up sessions, maxillary impressions and appliance&#xD;
      adjustments to apply the desired force will be made. At each clinical visit impressions will&#xD;
      be made of the activated T-loop and the teeth. The geometry of the T-loop will be measured&#xD;
      from the impressions which will allow for the applied force to be calculated using a&#xD;
      numerical method developed by Raboud. The impression of the teeth will be used to construct&#xD;
      the occlusal templates required to measure tooth movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tooth mobility change during the orthodontic tooth movement will be monitored by means of the&#xD;
      Periotest measuring device. CT volumetric scans with the NewTom machine will be made just&#xD;
      before placement of the implant to ensure adequate palatal bone volume. Extra CT volumetric&#xD;
      scans will be repeated in the middle of the retraction period (based on the space to be&#xD;
      closed) and at the end of the space closure. The CT volumetric scan images will also be used&#xD;
      to determine alveolar bone density, changes in root geometry for calculation of root surface&#xD;
      area and center of resistance. The CT volumetric scans will also be used to determine&#xD;
      alveolar bone density, change in root geometry (root resorption) and to assess movement of&#xD;
      the cuspid in relation to other maxillary structures. The series of models from each subject&#xD;
      and a 3-axis measuring system (MicroVal) will be used to measure tooth position changes&#xD;
      relative to the 3 reference systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of cuspid retraction, the balance of the required orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      will continue. The palatal implant will be retrieved and orthodontic retention delivered.&#xD;
      Data gathered in the patient study will be utilized to validate the biomechanical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomechanical Modeling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two separate biomechanical tooth models developed. The first will be a&#xD;
      parametric three dimensional model of the tooth and supporting tissues which will allow for&#xD;
      variable biological properties of the tooth, PDL and alveolar bone. This model allows the&#xD;
      inputs to be patient specific for both the force systems applied and the individual&#xD;
      biological parameters. The three dimensional force systems that are applied to the tooth will&#xD;
      be calculated using the numerical method described by Raboud and the measured geometry of the&#xD;
      T-loop. The Finite Element Model (FEM) of the tooth and supporting tissue and the applied&#xD;
      force system will allow for an improved description of the stress fields in the tissues, in&#xD;
      particular the PDL. This improved stress field will be compared to the resulting bodily tooth&#xD;
      movement. In order to compare the results from the biomechanical model and the clinical study&#xD;
      it is important that the posterior segment does not move. The palatal implant is to ensure&#xD;
      the absolute anchorage required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As previously mentioned, the accuracy of the FEM model is dependant upon the input&#xD;
      parameters. Consequently, there will be a two dimensional dynamic model of the tooth response&#xD;
      to a mechanical impact. This will model instruments such as the Periotest® which is designed&#xD;
      to measure impact response. Since the tooth response is governed by the characteristics of&#xD;
      the periodontal ligament, analysis of the raw signal obtained from the Periotest® will allow&#xD;
      for the mechanical properties of the PDL to be evaluated during the retraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final mean rate of tooth movement between the two force levels will be compared through&#xD;
      the Independent Samples T Test. To evaluate significant changes of the tooth movement in the&#xD;
      distinctive time intervals, a repeated measure ANOVA will be used. If the underlying&#xD;
      assumptions for both methods are not satisfied, then the non-parametric alternative will be&#xD;
      considered (U Mann-Whitney Test).&#xD;
