  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether sildenafil citrate, commonly known as Viagra, can cause&#xD;
      increased blood flow to the brain in a wide range of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients,&#xD;
      including women. Although people with MS can have reduced blood flow in the brain as part of&#xD;
      the disease process, it has been observed that men with MS may have increased blood flow to&#xD;
      the brain while taking sildenafil citrate. This study will measure brain blood flow or blood&#xD;
      volume in men and women with MS before and after taking Viagra and compare the results to&#xD;
      those in healthy volunteers in an effort to better understand the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older and patients with MS between 18 and 55 years of&#xD;
      age may be eligible for this study. Volunteers are screened with a medical history and&#xD;
      physical examination, and patients with MS are evaluated with a complete neurological&#xD;
      examination and screening for heart disease, including history of chest pain, heart attack,&#xD;
      and use of nitrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after taking Viagra. During&#xD;
      the scanning, subjects lie still on a table that can slide in and out of the cylindrical&#xD;
      metal scanner. Scanning time varies from 20 minutes to 3 hours, with most scans lasting&#xD;
      between 45 and 90 minutes. First, a scan is obtained of the carotid arteries (major arteries&#xD;
      in the neck supplying blood to the brain) to determine if the arteries are narrowed, and then&#xD;
      baseline MRI scans and measures of brain blood flow are obtained. The subject then comes out&#xD;
      of the scanner and takes a Viagra pill. After 1 hour, the subject returns to the scanner and&#xD;
      more scans are obtained to determine changes in brain blood flow and blood volume following&#xD;
      Viagra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A catheter (thin plastic tube) is placed in the subject's arm before he or she enters the&#xD;
      magnet for the second time for injection of a contrast agent called gadolinium DTPA, which&#xD;
      allows brain structures to be distinguished more clearly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in MR perfusion imaging have provided clinical researchers with the opportunity to&#xD;
      quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). It has been shown that cerebral perfusion in&#xD;
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is reduced, particularly in the grey matter. However,&#xD;
      preliminary data in a small number of male secondary progressive (SP) MS patients with&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction suggests that sildenafil citrate (Viagra® (Registered Trademark)) helps&#xD;
      to increase grey matter perfusion. The purpose of this study is to extend these findings to&#xD;
      male MS patients without erectile dysfunction and female MS patients by comparing CBF&#xD;
      measures of MS patients of both sexes, to age and gender-matched healthy controls. CBF will&#xD;
      be measured before and one hour after taking sildenafil citrate.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any healthy normal volunteer above the age of 18 who is capable of giving informed consent&#xD;
        recruited or self referred through the NIH Volunteer office will be eligible for this&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All healthy normal volunteers will be included as long as there is no recorded or&#xD;
        documented signs or symptoms of CNS disease, contraindications to a MRI and have a &quot;normal&#xD;
        age appropriate&quot; MRI of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients seen in the Neuroimmunology MS clinic with a confirmed diagnosis of Multiple&#xD;
        Sclerosis based upon previous history of two clinical neurological attacks separated in&#xD;
        time and in spatial location or combination of Clinical and MRI findings of a single&#xD;
        enhancing lesion in the brain or spine along with multiple T2 hyperintensities in the&#xD;
        juxtacortical, periventricular or infratentorial white matter according to the McDonald&#xD;
        criteria will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who have had more than one relapse within&#xD;
        18 months preceding study enrollment will be recruited from the MS 7th floor clinic in the&#xD;
        NINDS at the NIH. MS patients will have EDSS score between 1.0 - 6.5, inclusive. MS&#xD;
        patients seen and treated in the NINDS MS clinic are representative of the general MS&#xD;
        population that is Female: male ratio of approximately 3:2, Caucasian and African American,&#xD;
        between ages of 18-55 years old.&#xD;
