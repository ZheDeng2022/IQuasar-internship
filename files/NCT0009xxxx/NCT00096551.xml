      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pox viral vectors can induce a PSA-specific T-cell responses and clinical responses in&#xD;
           patients with advanced prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intratumoral vaccines of recombinant fowlpox vectors appear to be more potent in&#xD;
           inducing antitumor effects than the s.c. route of administration, especially when the&#xD;
           recombinant rF-vector given intratumorally is preceded by a rV-recombinant given s.c.&#xD;
           This may be due to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Making the tumor cell an antigen presenting cell via upregulation of both antigen&#xD;
           (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules (signal 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Making the tumor cell more susceptible to killing via upregulation of ICAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The increased expression of perforin in peptide-specific T cells that came into contact&#xD;
           with the TRICOM-infected targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potentially allowing the immune system to select for other tumor encoded antigens to&#xD;
           generate a polyvalent immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1: Safety and feasibility of an intraprostatic vaccine strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: To assess the change in PSA-specific T-cell response as measured by ELISPOT assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2: To evaluate T-cell infiltration histologically in patients who have pre- and&#xD;
           post-vaccine prostate biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have either a) biopsy proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer following local&#xD;
           radiation as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively rising PSA&#xD;
           levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy (surgery or&#xD;
           radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen deprivation&#xD;
           therapy (eg. three increases in PSA over nadir, separated by at least one week). For&#xD;
           patients with previous RT, the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done at least&#xD;
           18 months after the completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Since this may also generate a systemic immune response, patients with minimal&#xD;
           extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatic function: Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dl, AST and ALT&lt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose escalation Phase I design. Each cohort will consist of 3-6 patients, with cohorts 4&#xD;
           &amp; 5 restricted to include only HLA-A2 + patients; maximum accrual is 30&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in all cohorts receive initial priming with rV- PSA(L155)/TRICOM and rF-GM-CSF&#xD;
           s.c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first two cohorts utilize a booster intraprostatic with dose escalation of&#xD;
           rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third and fourth cohorts add dose escalations of rF-GM-CSF along with the highest dose&#xD;
           of rF-PSA(L155)/TRICOM&#xD;

&#xD;
        A. Histopathological documentation of prostate cancer confirmed in the Laboratory of&#xD;
        Pathology at: NIH Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Naval&#xD;
        Medical Center, or Walter Reed Army Medical Center prior to starting this study. If no&#xD;
        pathologic specimen is available, patients may enroll with a pathologist's report showing a&#xD;
        histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer and a clinical course consistent with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B. Must have either a) biopsy proven, locally recurrent prostate cancer following local&#xD;
        radiation or cyrotherapy as defined by the ASTRO consensus criteria as 3 consecutively&#xD;
        rising PSA levels or b) have refused or not be candidates for local definitive therapy&#xD;
        (surgery or radiation therapy) and have clinically progressive disease on androgen&#xD;
        deprivation therapy (e.g., three increases in PSA over nadir, separated by at least one&#xD;
        week). For patients with previous RT, the biopsy confirming local recurrence must be done&#xD;
        at least 18 months after the completion of RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Since this may also generate a systemic immune response, patients with minimal&#xD;
        extraprostatic disease may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        C. Agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for at least 4 months&#xD;
        following the last vaccine injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        D. Life expectancy greater than or equal to 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        E. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        F. Recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy, including surgery, and&#xD;
        radiation (treatment must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to being eligible for&#xD;
        the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        G. Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy, see Appendix&#xD;
        D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lymphocyte count greater than or equal to 500/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hgb greater than or equal to 10 Gm/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        H. Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -A 24-hour urine collection for baseline to measure creatinine clearance, protein and&#xD;
        electrolytes. CrCl greater than 60mL/min, proteinuria less than 1000 milligrams per 24&#xD;
        hours, and no abnormal sediment. Serum creatinine not above normal limits OR creatinine&#xD;
        clearance on a 24 hour urine collection of greater than 60 mL/min. For patients who are not&#xD;
        able to obtain an accurate collection, a calculated creatinine clearance and urine analysis&#xD;
        for protein may be used. Any abnormalities in the sediment or the presence of hematuria&#xD;
        without a likely underlying cause should prompt the investigator to consider an evaluation&#xD;
        by a nephrologist or urologist for evidence of underlying renal pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients may be eligible if the underlying cause of the abnormality is determined to be&#xD;
        non-renal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -Hepatic function: Bilirubin equal to 1.5 mg/dL or patients with Gilbert's syndrome, a&#xD;

        (see Screening Consent for HLA typing). This consent will be mailed to the patient and&#xD;
        discussed with patient. The signed consent will be signed with a non-family member witness&#xD;
        and then mailed to the assigned research nurse at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        O. Concurrent hormonal therapy will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        P. PT / PTT will be drawn prior to any invasive protocol related procedure (i.e., prostate&#xD;
