      To investigate the association of selected genetic markers of inflammation and endothelial&#xD;
      activation with the occurrence of non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease is a major cause of death and disability in westernized societies,&#xD;
      and is growing in importance in countries with emerging economies. Inflammation and&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction are now recognized as important contributors to coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. However, the genetic basis and specific genes involved in the expression of the&#xD;
      hyperinflammatory phenotype are not yet well-understood. Identification and further&#xD;
      characterization of variation in candidate loci that are associated with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease would contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis underlying acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, and may provide novel pathways for prevention and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This case-control study will determine whether the variability in several genes that&#xD;
      influence inflammation and endothelial dysfunction is related to the odds of myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) among 700 men and 229 postmenopausal women from the Western New York Health&#xD;
      Study. The study performs the following: 1) To test the hypothesis that cases of acute MI&#xD;
      will have a higher frequency of specific haplotypes at the C-reactive protein locus composed&#xD;
      of alleles associated with higher levels of CRP production (-732G/A), 1059G/C, and +1444C/T)&#xD;
      than matched controls. MI cases will have a greater frequency of haplotypes composed of&#xD;
      alleles associated with higher levels of interleukin (IL) production, specifically IL-6&#xD;
      production (-597G/A, -572G/C, and -174G/C) than controls, and a lower frequency of specific&#xD;
      haplotypes in the IL1A/IL1 BILL1RN gene region; 2) cases will have a higher frequency of&#xD;
      alleles and haplotypes for specific functional polymorphisms of the E-selectin gene (128R and&#xD;
      G98T) than controls; 3) to utilize DNA pooling strategy for rapid screening of large numbers&#xD;
      of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 29 candidate genes in relevant biological&#xD;
      pathways and test selected loci for association with risk of acute MI; 4) for those loci with&#xD;
      evidence of association, to identify haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (htSNPs) that capture the variation at each locus and test for association between these SNPs&#xD;
      and haplotypes and risk of MI. Secondary aims will a) explore the above associations among&#xD;
      men with premature MI (55 years of age or less) and b) explore gene- gene and gene-&#xD;
      environment interactions. MI case subjects were identified from hospital record review in&#xD;
      Erie and Niagara counties (95% of all eligible cases, ICD9 410-410.9) an average of 4 months&#xD;
      post MI. They were interviewed and examined in 1996-2001. Control subjects were randomly&#xD;
      selected from the same counties (59.5% response rate) and had a contemporaneous clinical&#xD;
      exam. Controls will be individually matched to cases by age, sex, and ethnicity.&#xD;
