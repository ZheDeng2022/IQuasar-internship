  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed for a single specific patient. It uses busulfan as a conditioning&#xD;
      agent in a second stem cell transplant procedure for a patient with chronic granulomatous&#xD;
      disease (CGD), a disorder in which a certain type of white cells, called myeloid cells, do&#xD;
      not function properly. This causes increased risk of serious bacterial and fungal infections&#xD;
      that can lead to organ dysfunction, such as kidney disease, as well as formation of&#xD;
      granulomas-non-cancerous masses that can cause obstructions in the esophagus, stomach, and&#xD;
      intestines, and block urine flow from the kidneys and bladder.). The child in this study has&#xD;
      previously undergone a stem cell transplant to treat CGD, and, as a result, he is now&#xD;
      producing normal lymphocytes (another type of white cell). However, the myeloid cells from&#xD;
      the donor did not engraft successfully, and the patient is still producing his own defective&#xD;
      myeloid cells. In this study, the child will undergo a second stem cell transplant in&#xD;
      combination with busulfan, a drug that targets myeloid cells, killing them to make way for&#xD;
      healthy, donated myeloid cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment includes the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical evaluation to confirm that the patient is healthy enough to undergo the&#xD;
           transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with busulfan, injected through the patient's central venous line&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell transplantation through the central venous line&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests on days 25, 56, and 91 after the transplant to assess how many cells are of&#xD;
           donor origin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspiration on day 100, and then at 12, 24, and 36 months to assess how many&#xD;
           cells are of donor origin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary function (breathing) test at 12 and 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination and blood tests, weekly or twice weekly for the first 2 to 3 months&#xD;
           and at 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months after transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), if this complication develops. GVHD is&#xD;
           the attack of lymphocytes from the donor against the patient's own cells. This is good&#xD;
           if it is against abnormal cells, but bad if serious damage occurs to the patient's vital&#xD;
           organs. GVHD is treated with steroids and cyclosporine, and possibly other drugs if&#xD;
           needed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a single patient study using intravenous busulfan as a conditioning agent for a&#xD;
      second allogeneic stem cell transplant in order to increase myeloid engraftment in a&#xD;
      previously transplanted recipient with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGD is an inherited disorder of neutrophil function leading to increased risk of infections&#xD;
      from both common and rare microorganisms, including fungi. Although these infections can&#xD;
      often be prevented or successfully treated, there are long-term sequelae including organ&#xD;
      dysfunction as a result of both the infections and the treatment. For example, many of the&#xD;
      anti-fungal agents cause renal impairment and can even lead to kidney failure requiring&#xD;
      dialysis. In addition, the abnormal functioning of the neutrophils leads to the development&#xD;
      of granulomas, which can cause obstruction of various organs, in particular within the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and urogenital systems with sometimes serious sequelae. As a result the life&#xD;
      expectancy of patients with CGD is significantly limited with no patients documented reaching&#xD;
      the age of 50 and a 2 percent mortality rate per year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only available cure of CGD is bone marrow transplantation; however given its&#xD;
      own inherent associated morbidities and mortality, as well as the necessity for a matched&#xD;
      (related) donor, this has not been offered to all patients. More recently attempts to reduce&#xD;
      the toxicities of this potentially curative treatment have lead to the development of&#xD;
      non-myeloablative regimens, which as a result, can lead to partial engraftment of the donor&#xD;
      cells into the recipient, a situation referred to as mixed chimerism. In order to achieve an&#xD;
      adequate number of normal neutrophils for clinical benefit, the level of donor chimerism&#xD;
      needs to be at least 5 percent in the myeloid lineage. One of the patients treated on a&#xD;
      previous protocol with a novel nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen, has had 100 percent&#xD;
      engraftment of his lymphoid cells, but less than 1percent engraftment of his myeloid lineage.&#xD;
      As a result, he continues to experience the problems associated with CGD, but has had no&#xD;
      problems of graft versus host disease (GVHD). In order to improve his myeloid engraftment,&#xD;
      while taking advantage of the presence of his 100 percent lymphoid chimerism, we propose to&#xD;
      treat him with moderate dose busulfan and a purified stem cell product from the original&#xD;
      donor as a second transplant. With this study, the goal will be to improve this patient's&#xD;
      myeloid engraftment so as to ostensibly cure him of his CGD.&#xD;
