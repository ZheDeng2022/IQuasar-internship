  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial is studying 4 different tipifarnib regimens to compare how&#xD;
      well they work in treating older patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Tipifarnib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To test whether any or all of four different regimens of R115777 (tipifarnib) is&#xD;
      sufficiently effective therapy for previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in&#xD;
      patients of age 70 or older to warrant Phase III investigation. Additionally, to allow&#xD;
      increased access for patients to an agent that appears promising in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the frequency and severity of toxicities of these regimens in this group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate in a preliminary manner the relationship of cytogenetics with response to&#xD;
      R115777 (tipifarnib) and assess whether karyotype represents a potential prognostic factor&#xD;
      among older AML patients who are not candidates for chemotherapy and are treated with&#xD;
      R1157777.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To collect specimens for future correlations (e.g. RAS and downstream targets) to be&#xD;
      identified at a later date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. ARM II: Patients receive&#xD;
      oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. ARM III: Patients receive tipifarnib as in&#xD;
      arm I, but at a lower dose. ARM IV: Patients receive tipifarnib as in arm II, but at a lower&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease&#xD;
      progression. Patients who achieve a complete remission (CR) receive up to 3 additional&#xD;
      courses beyond CR. Patients in CR who develop recurrent disease after the completion of&#xD;
      therapy are eligible to receive tipifarnib again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually&#xD;
      for 3 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a morphologically confirmed diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
             (AML) with classification other than WHO Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (FAB M3), based&#xD;
             on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed within 14 days prior to registration;&#xD;
             if a diagnostic biopsy has been performed within 28 days prior to registration, the&#xD;
             marrow blast percentage is &gt;= 70%, and no potentially anti-leukemic therapy has been&#xD;
             given in the interim, then this bone marrow examination can be used for registration&#xD;
             purposes; Note: This protocol uses the WHO diagnostic criteria for AML, not the FAB&#xD;
             criteria; patients with WHO Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (FAB M3) or blastic&#xD;
             transformation of chronic myelogenous leukemia are not eligible; patients must not be&#xD;
             candidates for or must have refused standard AML cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens&#xD;

             arsenic trioxide, signal transduction inhibitors, azacitidine, and low dose cytarabine&#xD;
             for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome; however, the dose of cytarabine must be &lt;&#xD;
             100 mg/M2/day; other low intensity therapies for MDS will also be permitted and should&#xD;
             be discussed with the Study Coordinator; patients must be off prior therapy for MDS&#xD;
             (excluding growth factors) and all toxicities must have resolved; if indicated, a&#xD;
             single dose of intrathecal chemotherapy may also be given before or concurrent with&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x Institutional Upper Limit of Normal (IULN),&#xD;
             unless the elevation is due primarily to elevated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  SGOT (AST) =&lt; 2.5 x IULN, or SGPT (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x IULN, or both within 14 days prior to&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x IULN within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Southwest Oncology Group patients must be registered on SWOG-9007, the cytogenetics&#xD;
             protocol; collection of pretreatment marrow specimens must be completed within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to registration; pretreatment specimens of bone marrow must be submitted to an&#xD;
             approved Southwest Oncology Group Cytogenetics Laboratory for cytogenetic analysis;&#xD;
             note that protocol SWOG-9007 also requires submission of remission and relapse&#xD;
             specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG and CALGB have similar cytogenetics studies; please check with your group to find&#xD;
             out about requirements for participation; CTSU sites will not be participating in&#xD;
             SWOG-9007 and will not be submitting specimens for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have cytogenetics performed and - if not registered to SWOG-9007 - a&#xD;
             cytogenetics report submitted to the Cytogenetics Office at the Southwest Oncology&#xD;
             Group Data Operations Center&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Southwest Oncology Group patients must be offered participation in S9910, the leukemia&#xD;
             centralized reference laboratories and tissue repositories ancillary study; if consent&#xD;
             is given, collection of pretreatment blood and/or marrow specimens must be completed&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to registration; if the patient consents to participate in S9910,&#xD;
             pretreatment specimens of marrow and/or peripheral blood must be submitted to the&#xD;
             Southwest Oncology Group Myeloid Repository at the University of New Mexico for&#xD;
             cellular and molecular studies; S9910 also requests submission of remission and&#xD;
             relapse specimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG and CALGB have similar reference laboratories and repository protocols; please&#xD;
             check with your group to find out about requirements for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CTSU sites will not be participating in S9910 and will not be submitting specimens for&#xD;
             this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of reproductive potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior malignancy are eligible; however, the patient must have&#xD;
             completed all chemotherapy and radiotherapy at least 6 months prior to study&#xD;
             registration; there should be no plan to begin therapy for the prior malignancy at the&#xD;
             time of study registration; concurrent hormonal therapy is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are expected to require treatment with enzyme inducing antiepileptic&#xD;
             drugs (EIAED) are not eligible for this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If day 14 or 30 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the next&#xD;
             working day; in calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or&#xD;
             measurement is done is considered Day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the&#xD;
             Monday two weeks later would be considered Day 14; this allows for efficient patient&#xD;
             scheduling without exceeding the guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must&#xD;
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal&#xD;
             guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number&#xD;
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the&#xD;
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study&#xD;
             has been entered into the data base&#xD;
