  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiation therapy together with oxaliplatin&#xD;
      and fluorouracil followed by gemcitabine works in treating patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic cancer. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor&#xD;
      cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Oxaliplatin&#xD;
      may also make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation therapy&#xD;
      with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced, unresectable&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with concurrent external beam radiotherapy,&#xD;
      oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil followed by gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, and confirmed response rate in&#xD;
      patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5.5 weeks. Beginning&#xD;
      concurrently with radiotherapy, patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 15,&#xD;
      and 29 and fluorouracil IV continuously for 5.5 weeks. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1&#xD;
      and 8. Treatment with gemcitabine repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <description>1-year survival will be considered &quot;success&quot;. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. If more than 1 patients is lost to follow-up, we will use Kaplan-Meier estimates for the 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates. 95% confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated according the approach of Duffy and Santner.</description>
