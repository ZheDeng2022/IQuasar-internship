    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of two experimental medicines -&#xD;
      depsipeptide and flavopiridol - given together to treat cancers of the lung, esophagus, and&#xD;
      pleura. It will determine the highest dose that these drugs can safely be given together and&#xD;
      will test whether giving them together works better at shrinking tumors than giving either&#xD;
      one alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with cancer of the lung, esophagus, or pleura, or other&#xD;
      cancers that have spread to the lungs or pleura may be eligible for this study. Candidates&#xD;
      are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG), x-rays and scans, pulmonary function tests, and a tumor biopsy (removal of a small&#xD;
      piece of tumor tissue for microscopic examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the hospital for treatment for approximately 10 days during each&#xD;
      28-day treatment cycle. Depsipeptide is infused through an arm vein or central venous&#xD;
      catheter (tube placed in a large vein in the neck or chest) for 4 hours. When this infusion&#xD;
      is complete, flavopiridol is infused over 72 hours. The dose of depsipeptide is increased&#xD;
      four times over the period of the study with successive groups of patients, and flavopiridol&#xD;
      is increased once to determine the maximum safe dose of giving these drugs together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are done before and after each depsipeptide infusion and 3 more times for the&#xD;
      next 24 hours, and at various times over 4 days during the flavopiridol infusion to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of the medicines. Samples are also drawn periodically throughout the treatment&#xD;
      cycle to evaluate safety. Heart function is monitored with several EKGs before and during the&#xD;
      depsipeptide doses. The drug has shown effects on EKG tracings, but does not appear to injure&#xD;
      the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsies are done before treatment begins and on the fifth day of the first treatment&#xD;
      cycle. The biopsies may be done either in the operating room by passing a tube (bronchoscope)&#xD;
      down the throat and into the lungs or in the Radiology Department using a thin needle put&#xD;
      through the chest wall into the tumor. For the bronchoscopy, numbing medicine is sprayed into&#xD;
      the back of the throat to reduce discomfort, and for the needle biopsy, the skin over the&#xD;
      biopsy area is numbed. Optional repeat biopsies may be requested before the start of the&#xD;
      second treatment cycle and on day 5 of that cycle. (The repeat biopsies are not required for&#xD;
      participation in the study.) At the time of each tumor biopsy, a buccal mucosal biopsy is&#xD;
      also done. This involves scraping a tongue depressor along the inside of the mouth to collect&#xD;
      cells for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first treatment cycle, patients return to NIH for evaluation with a&#xD;
      physical examination, blood work, x-rays, and scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and brain.&#xD;
      Patients who are not experiencing significant drug side effects are offered a second cycle,&#xD;
      exactly like the first. The two cycles complete one course of treatment, after which patients&#xD;
      once again return to NIH for evaluation. Additional treatment cycles may be offered to&#xD;
      patients whose tumors have shrunk or remained stable with therapy. Patients whose tumors have&#xD;
      not responded to therapy or who have developed severe drug side effects are taken off the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preclinical studies we have demonstrated that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor&#xD;
      Depsipeptide FR901228 (DP) mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cultured lung and&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, and malignant pleural mesothelioma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have observed that the cdk inhibitor Flavopiridol (FLA) markedly potentiates&#xD;
      Depsipeptide-mediated apoptosis in cultured cancer cells, but not cultured normal epithelial&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with advanced malignancies involving lungs, esophagus, or pleura will receive 4-hour&#xD;
      Depsipeptide infusion followed by 72-hour FLA infusion using a phase I study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor and buccal mucosa biopsies as well as PBMC may be obtained prior to, and after therapy&#xD;
      to evaluate gene expression using cDNA array long-oligo and protein lysate array techniques,&#xD;
      and determine if sequential DP/FLA mediates apoptosis in target tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of these studies may provide the rationale for phase II evaluation of sequential&#xD;
      DP/FLA infusion in thoracic oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of sequential 4&#xD;
      hour Depsipeptide(DP)/72 hour Flavopiridol (FLA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of sequential DP/FLA infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze gene expression profiles in laser-captured tumor cells, buccal mucosa, and PBMC&#xD;
      before and after sequential DP/FLA exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze mcl-1 protein expression and apoptosis in tumor biopsies before and after&#xD;
      sequential DP/FLA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of tissue and serum proteomic techniques to assess treatment response in&#xD;
      patients receiving sequential DP/FLA infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary small cell or non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancers, esophageal cancers, malignant pleural mesotheliomas or chest wall sarcoma, or&#xD;
      thymomas are eligible for evaluation. In addition, patients with cancers of nonthoracic&#xD;
      origin with metastases to the lungs or pleura, or germ cell tumors refractory to standard&#xD;
      therapy are eligible for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have adequate pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO greater than the 30&#xD;
      percent predicted, and pCO2 less than 50 mm Hg and pO2 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function as evidenced by standard laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient must be willing to sign an informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase 1 study where patient cohorts will receive escalating doses of Depsipeptide,&#xD;
      administered on day 1 and day 21, and a dose of flavopiridol (either 40 mg/m2/d or 50&#xD;
      mg/m2/d) administered on days 1-3, and 21-24 of a 42-day course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and response to therapy will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cycles of therapy (one course) will be administered, following which treatment evaluation&#xD;
      will be performed using standard clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      48 patients will be enrolled over a period of 2-4 years.&#xD;
