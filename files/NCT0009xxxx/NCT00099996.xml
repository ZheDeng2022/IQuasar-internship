  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of 40 mg of ezetimibe (Zetia ) daily in&#xD;
      lowering blood levels of cholesterol and of the plant sterols sitosterol and campesterol in&#xD;
      patients with homozygous sitosterolemia, an inherited disorder of sterol metabolism. (Sterols&#xD;
      are alcohol substances found in animal and plant fats.) In this disorder, an excess of many&#xD;
      plant sterols is absorbed and not enough excreted. Patients can develop atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      coronary heart disease as early as childhood, as well as other problems including arthritis,&#xD;
      arthralgia, and tendon xanthomas (lipid deposits). Current treatment consists of ezetimibe 10&#xD;
      mg, dietary restriction of plant and shellfish sterols, and bile salt binding resins.&#xD;
      Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol&#xD;
      and structurally related plant sterols across the intestinal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia who are between 18 and 85 years of age have completed&#xD;
      NHLBI's 1-year study of ezetimibe at 10 mg a day may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants maintain their current stable diet and take a 10-mg pill of ezetimibe daily&#xD;
      for 26 weeks. They are also randomly selected to take either an additional 30-mg pill of&#xD;
      ezetimibe or a placebo (look-alike pill with no active ingredients). Patients fast for at&#xD;
      least 12 hours before each of 6 visits scheduled during the course of the study. At these&#xD;
      visits, patients undergo some or all of the following procedures for monitoring their health&#xD;
      and evaluating their response to treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and review of medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and temperature)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of dietary maintenance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of height, weight, and waist circumference&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement (with ruler) and photographs of non-Achilles xanthoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-ray of Achilles tendon&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw and urine collection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Homozygous Sitosterolemia is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of sterol metabolism.&#xD;
      Patients with homozygous sitosterolemia experience accelerated atherosclerosis with initial&#xD;
      coronary heart disease (CHD) events occurring in childhood. Plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      sitosterol and other dietary plant sterols are markedly elevated in homozygous sitosterolemic&#xD;
      patients, and are characteristic of this disorder. Sitosterolemic individuals demonstrate a&#xD;
      range of abnormalities in sterol absorption, metabolism, and excretion. Recent reports have&#xD;
      shown that sitosterolemia can result from mutations in 1 of 2 ATP-binding cassette&#xD;
      half-transporters (ABCG5 or ABCG8), which are responsible for regulation of non-cholesterol&#xD;
      sterols in the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment of homozygous sitosterolemia consists of ezetimibe 10 mg, dietary&#xD;
      restriction of plant and shellfish sterols, as well as the use of bile salt binding resins.&#xD;
      Ezetimibe is the first member of a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents that inhibits the&#xD;
      intestinal absorption of cholesterol and structurally-related noncholesterol sterols (plant&#xD;
      sterols) across the intestinal wall. Importantly, ezetimibe is not an inhibitor or inducer of&#xD;
      CYP450, reducing the potential for drug-drug interactions which renders ezetimibe a&#xD;
      particularly appealing candidate with other drugs. Ezetimibe has proved to be generally safe&#xD;
      and well-tolerated as monotherapy or when coadministered with statins, with an overall&#xD;
      clinical adverse experience profile similar to placebo. In clinical studies with&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemic patients, ezetemibe doses ranging from 0.25 to 40 mg daily for periods&#xD;
      of 8 to 12 weeks were more effective than placebo in lowering plasma TC and LDL-C&#xD;
      concentrations. There were no dose-related increase in adverse experiences or laboratory&#xD;
      abnormalities in these studies. We will investigate whether a higher dose of ezetimibe is&#xD;
      safe and efficacious in lowering plant sterols in patients with sitosterolemia.&#xD;
