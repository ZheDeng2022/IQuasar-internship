    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and the drug gabapentin to examine&#xD;
      the role of the brain chemical gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) in regulating emotions in&#xD;
      healthy people. Gabapentin, which is used to treat epilepsy, increases GABA concentrations in&#xD;
      the brain. MRS, similar to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is a diagnostic test that uses a&#xD;
      magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-smoking, healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
      psychiatric evaluation, blood and urine tests, and an electrocardiogram (EKG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At three separate clinic visits, participants are given either gabapentin or a placebo (an&#xD;
      inactive look-alike capsule). They take placebo at one visit, 600 mg of gabapentin at another&#xD;
      visit, and 1200 mg of gabapentin at another visit. One hour after taking the capsules, the&#xD;
      amount of GABA in the brain is measured by MRS. For this procedure, the subject lies on a&#xD;
      table that moves into the MRI scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud&#xD;
      knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts&#xD;
      about 45 to 60 minutes, during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to a few&#xD;
      minutes at a time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the forebrain&#xD;
      structures, and the GABAergic system has been found to have roles in attentional and learning&#xD;
      processes, recognition of aversive stimuli, and regulation of emotion and behavior. Decreases&#xD;
      in GABA have been associated with seizures, anxiety and mood disorders. Enhancement of GABA&#xD;
      may result in anticonvulsive, anxiolytic, and mood-stabilizing effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GABA system has been proposed as a target for novel antidepressant and mood-stabilizing&#xD;
      treatments. Recent studies suggest a GABAergic dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      Specifically, reduced GABA levels have been found in the occipital cortex of patients with&#xD;
      major depression and panic disorder; and after therapy with selective serotonin reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors, an increase in occipital GABA concentrations has been observed in depressed&#xD;
      patients and healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin (GBP) is a relatively novel drug that has been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      epilepsy. The effects of GBP on brain amino acid neurotransmitters are not completely&#xD;
      understood. GBP significantly increases brain GABA levels in humans after one hour of the&#xD;
      first oral dose, although it does not seem to directly affect GABA-specific enzymes, GABA&#xD;
      receptors, and GABA uptake. In vitro, GBP stimulates the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase&#xD;
      that is involved in the synthesis of GABA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, studies that have examined the mechanism of action of GABA enhancing compounds using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measured GABA exclusively in the occipital cortex due&#xD;
      to technical limitations. Not surprisingly, associations between occipital GABA levels and&#xD;
      cognitive measures and psychiatric symptom severity have not been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thanks to a novel MRS method developed by GE and implemented by NIH, reliable measurements of&#xD;
      prefrontal GABA levels are now available. The current study is designed to estimate&#xD;
      prefrontal GABA levels in a placebo-controlled double-blind study of GBP. It is aimed at&#xD;
      evaluating the novel MRS method to estimate prefrontal GABA levels. Prefrontal GABA levels&#xD;
      will be related to prefrontal functions including facial emotion recognition and response&#xD;
      control. GABA MRS after GBP/placebo may be used as challenge paradigm for future studies&#xD;
      aimed at elucidating GABAergic dysfunctions in mood and anxiety disorders. 10 healthy&#xD;
      medication-free human subjects will be examined by GABA magnetic resonance spectroscopy in a&#xD;
      controlled trial using placebo, 600mg, and 1200mg GBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the potential role of GABA in the physiologic stress response, this protocol includes a&#xD;
      pilot study that compares prefrontal GABA levels between shock/threat-of-shock and no-threat&#xD;
      conditions in healthy volunteers. This part of the study may contribute to the elucidation of&#xD;
      the role of the prefrontal GABAergic system in the processing of acute stress.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Family history of mental illness (mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other&#xD;
             psychotic disorders, substance abuse disorders) will be obtained in all 1st degree&#xD;
             relatives using the Family Interview of Genetic Studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy Control Samples: 34 healthy subjects (ages 18-60) without a known personal or&#xD;
             family history of psychiatric disorders in first-degree relatives will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant females will be excluded due to the potential risk of magnetic field exposure&#xD;
             during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If any subject appears incapable of providing informed consent, they will be excluded&#xD;
             from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have taken centrally active medication for at least 3 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects will also be excluded if they have: a) medical or neurological illnesses&#xD;
             likely to affect physiology or anatomy, i.e. hypertension, cardiovascular disorders,&#xD;
             b) a history of drug (including benzodiazepines [BZD]) or alcohol abuse, c) smokers,&#xD;
             d) serious suicidal ideation or behavior, e) lactose intolerance, f) caffeine&#xD;
             dependency, g) history of allergic reaction to GBP, and h) general MRI exclusion&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects beyond age 60 are excluded because of slower elimination of GBP in older&#xD;
             adults, and the age-related increase in brain structural abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In women, there are additional exclusion criteria: i) current pregnancy (as documented&#xD;
             by pregnancy testing at screening or at days of the challenge studies), j) current&#xD;
             breast feeding, k) lack of reliable contraception method.&#xD;
