      This study will explore ways in which employee benefits may be designed to improve people's&#xD;
      health, through examining the viewpoints and preferences of low-income people. A person's&#xD;
      health is affected not only by being able to receive health care but also by several factors&#xD;
      such as income and education. People with lower incomes have been found to be not as healthy&#xD;
      as those with higher incomes. While the governments of many countries in the Organization for&#xD;
      Economic Cooperation and Development are currently working on public policy to address this&#xD;
      topic, the likelihood is small that the United States, given its market-based economy, will&#xD;
      do the same. However, owing to the heavy reliance in the United States on employer-sponsored&#xD;
      health insurance, it would be useful to explore the possibility of insuring some of the&#xD;
      measures that people can take to improve their health, and to do that through employee&#xD;
      benefit packages. Solutions might include extended unemployment insurance, more education,&#xD;
      job training, exercise programs, help for housing, disability insurance, and extra retirement&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults who have a minimum of a sixth-grade reading level, have low incomes, are English&#xD;
      speaking may be eligible for this study. For recruitment, 400 people who live and work in the&#xD;
      Washington, D.C, area will be invited to participate, and about12 people will take part in&#xD;
      each session. Unless people in the study participate during working hours, they will each be&#xD;
      paid $75 at the conclusion of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of one phase, in which participants will engage in a group exercise that&#xD;
      lasts for approximately 2-1/2 hours. During that time, participants will have the chance to&#xD;
      say what employee benefits they would choose, if the opportunity arose, to improve their&#xD;
      health. They will first make those choices by themselves and then make choices along with&#xD;
      other people in the group. While group members talk, the discussion will be recorded on a&#xD;
      tape recorder. Participants will be asked to give information about themselves and their&#xD;
      opinions but will not be asked for any information that identifies them personally, except&#xD;
      for data needed to pay participants with a paycheck. They will also get to use a computer and&#xD;
      will be shown how to use it, if necessary. If videotaping or photographs are done during the&#xD;
      exercise, the investigators of the study will ask for separate signed permission to do so.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to respect the privacy of others in the group and to not discuss&#xD;
      the opinions of others after leaving the session.&#xD;

      An individual's health is affected not only by access to health care but also by a number of&#xD;
      determinants such as income and education. Individuals with low incomes are not as healthy as&#xD;
      those with higher incomes. Thus it seems important to explore possible avenues for improving&#xD;
      the health of low income individuals with an eye toward ameliorating the complicated&#xD;
      determinants of health status, aside from health insurance. Many countries in the&#xD;
      Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are currently developing public&#xD;
      policy to address this issue. In the U.S., however with its market based economy, the&#xD;
      likelihood of adopting this public policy approach is small. Given that reality, is it&#xD;
      possible to explore other avenues such as designing employee benefit packages with the aim of&#xD;
      ameliorating the socio-economic determinants of health?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The goal of this project is to explore the feasibility of designing employee&#xD;
      benefits in a manner that may improve their health, by ascertaining the perspectives and&#xD;
      preferences of low income employees regarding employee benefits designed to ameliorate the&#xD;
      social determinants of health. Four hundred male and female low-income individuals recruited&#xD;
      from clinical, community, and employment settings will participate in small group exercises&#xD;
      in which a facilitated discussion will take place using a previously tested group decision&#xD;
      tool (CHAT: Choosing Health plans All Together) that has been modified for this project. Data&#xD;
      will be anonymously collected regarding socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes toward&#xD;
      health, preferences for possible employee benefits and assessment of the exercise. Group&#xD;
      discussions will be audio-taped. Data will be analyzed quantitatively to determine&#xD;
      preferences of employee benefits and socio-demographic factors associated with these&#xD;
      preferences. Discussions will undergo qualitative analysis go explore the underlying reasons&#xD;
      for participant preferences. Participants will receive $75 dollars as compensation for their&#xD;
      participation unless they participate during working hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks and Benefits: Given the anonymous nature of the data collection we anticipate no risks&#xD;
      other than those entailed in discussion of poor health outcomes associated with lack of&#xD;
      insurance and low income. Participants may benefit from learning about factors that improves&#xD;
      health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome and Meaning to the Field: Study results will yield information about what employee&#xD;
      benefits would be of utmost priority to low income employees. This is unique information that&#xD;
      may contribute to efforts to find affordable strategies for ameliorating the socio-economic&#xD;
      determinants of health for the low-income working population in the US.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women who are between the ages of 18-65, and are employed with an income of up&#xD;
             to three times the federal poverty level will be included in this study so that&#xD;
             information can be learned about the employee benefit preferences of low-income&#xD;
             employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minority individuals, particularly African Americans and English speaking Hispanics&#xD;
             will be included, and will be recruited to represent one third of the study sample&#xD;
             because of the high prevalence of minorities among the low-income population in the&#xD;
             US.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speakers will be excluded because they will be unable to participate in&#xD;
             the discussion that participants engage in about the reasons for their benefit&#xD;
             choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who cannot read at a 6th grade level, will be excluded because they will&#xD;
             have difficulty reading information provided on the computer screen during the&#xD;
             exercise.&#xD;
