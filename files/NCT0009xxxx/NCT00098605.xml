  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their&#xD;
      growth. This phase II trial is studying how well lapatinib works in treating brain metastases&#xD;
      in patients with stage IV breast cancer and brain metastases.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the objective response rate in the central nervous system (CNS) (complete plus&#xD;
      partial responses), as assessed by standard MRI, to oral GW572016 among patients with&#xD;
      progressive brain metastases from HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the site of first failure (CNS, extra-CNS, both, or death) and overall&#xD;
      survival of patients treated with GW572016 for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall objective response rate (complete plus partial response) and time&#xD;
      to first progression at any site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess quality of life (QOL), neurologic QOL, and cause of death in patients treated&#xD;
      with GW572016 for brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with oral GW572016,&#xD;
      given at a dose of 750 mg orally, twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the sensitivity of PET with dedicated brain sequences to detect brain&#xD;
      metastases from breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore the relationship between decline in PET uptake at 1 week and decline in PET&#xD;
      uptake at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To characterize the vessel patterns seen on MRI at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with GW572016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To describe changes in serum HER2 ECD over time. IX. To describe the baseline EGFR,&#xD;
      HER2, IGF-IR, and degree of HER2 gene amplification in primary tumor blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral lapatinib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 0.5-1.5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
