  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well decitabine works in treating&#xD;
      patients with myelofibrosis, a cancer of the blood system associated with fibrosis (scar&#xD;
      tissue) in the bone marrow that is advanced and for which there is no standard therapy.&#xD;
      Decitabine may block the actions of some proteins that are responsible for turning certain&#xD;
      genes off in various cancers including myelofibrosis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine response rate (complete and partial responses and hematological improvement)&#xD;
      to decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety of decitabine in patients with myelofibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of decitabine on specific epigenetic changes including&#xD;
      methylation status of specific target genes and gene re-expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of decitabine on hemoglobin F levels and on the absolute numbers&#xD;
      of circulating cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ progenitor cells and to investigate the&#xD;
      potential utility of these markers as a surrogate for biologic activity of decitabine in&#xD;
      myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every&#xD;
      42 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Complete response is normalization of counts and transfusion-independence.&#xD;
Partial response is hemoglobin increase to normal levels, multilineage improvement including absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and/or platelets.&#xD;
Hematologic improvement is red cell transfusion-independence or &gt;50% increase in platelet levels.</description>

    <description>CD34 positive(+) cells are determined by flow immunostaining and light scatter in peripheral blood. Samples are then analyzed by flow cytometry, and CD34+ cells quantitated after 75,000 CD45 events are studied. (At least 75,000 CD45 events must be studied to ensure accuracy of the assay). Absolute numbers are determined by multiplying the % CD34+ cells by the total white blood cell count obtained on a CBC that is processed simultaneously.</description>

        <description>CD34 positive(+) cells are determined by flow immunostaining and light scatter in peripheral blood. Samples are then analyzed by flow cytometry, and CD34+ cells quantitated after 75,000 CD45 events are studied. (At least 75,000 CD45 events must be studied to ensure accuracy of the assay). Absolute numbers are determined by multiplying the % CD34+ cells by the total white blood cell count obtained on a CBC that is processed simultaneously.</description>

        <description>CD34 positive(+) cells are determined by flow immunostaining and light scatter in peripheral blood. Samples are then analyzed by flow cytometry, and CD34+ cells quantitated after 75,000 CD45 events are studied. (At least 75,000 CD45 events must be studied to ensure accuracy of the assay). Absolute numbers are determined by multiplying the % CD34+ cells by the total white blood cell count obtained on a CBC that is processed simultaneously.</description>
