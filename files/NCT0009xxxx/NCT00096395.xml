  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving sorafenib together with gemcitabine works in&#xD;
      treating patients with recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
      Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their&#xD;
      growth and by stopping blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or&#xD;
      die. Giving sorafenib with gemcitabine may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. Objective tumour response rate (complete plus partial response as&#xD;
      defined by the RECIST criteria) in women with recurrent or refractory advanced ovarian or&#xD;
      primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Median survival time. II. 6-month survival rate. III. Objective tumour stable disease&#xD;
      rate. IV. Response duration. V. Toxicity. VI. Time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course 1 (56 days): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-56 and gemcitabine&#xD;
      IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course 2 and all subsequent courses (28 days): Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on&#xD;
      days 1-28 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a complete or partial response receive at least 2 additional courses beyond&#xD;
      documented response. Patients with stable or responding disease who have received at least 6&#xD;
      courses may discontinue gemcitabine and continue sorafenib alone until disease progression.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer&#xD;
             or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred or is refractory to initial therapy;&#xD;
             patients must have received platinum-based chemotherapy before entry into this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have recurred and are platinum-sensitive (treatment free interval greater&#xD;
             than 12 months) must have been re-treated with platinum-based chemotherapy prior to&#xD;
             entry into this protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received no more than three prior chemotherapy regimens (e.g.&#xD;
             initial chemotherapy and two regimens for subsequent relapses)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;=&#xD;
             20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan; if measurable&#xD;
             disease is in a radiated site, there must be evidence of disease progression in that&#xD;
             lesion post radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status =&lt;1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of BAY 43-9006 on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because raf kinase inhibitor agents&#xD;
             as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are on warfarin anticoagulation are allowed to participate as long as&#xD;
             they fit the following 4 criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They are therapeutic on a stable warfarin dose&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Their INR target range is no greater than 3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They are monitored with weekly INR, PT and PTT testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They have no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries high risk of&#xD;
                  bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because BAY 43-9006 is a kinase inhibitor&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with BAY 43-9006, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with BAY 43-9006&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal or biologic therapy within&#xD;
             4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those&#xD;
             who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4&#xD;
             weeks earlier&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with borderline tumours or tumours of low malignant potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with current bowel obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous radiotherapy to &gt; 30% of bone marrow irradiated in target&#xD;
             volume and/or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study treatment; palliative radiation is&#xD;
             allowed within 4 weeks of treatment, after discussion with the Principal Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or within&#xD;
             4 weeks; patients who have previous exposure to a raf-kinase inhibitor are excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BAY 43-9006 or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have had prior gemcitabine chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent use of itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritanovir, or grapefruit juice&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006; appropriate studies will be undertaken&#xD;
             in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
