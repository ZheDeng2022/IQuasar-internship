      The goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the visual acuity outcome in the amblyopic eye after 17 weeks of daily use of&#xD;
           atropine versus weekend-only use of atropine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the proportion of patients achieving a complete treatment response (defined&#xD;
           as amblyopic eye acuity &gt;20/25 or equal to that of the sound eye in the absence of a&#xD;
           reduction in the sound eye acuity from baseline) with daily atropine versus weekend-only&#xD;
           atropine.&#xD;

      Amblyopia is the most common cause of monocular visual impairment in both children and young&#xD;
      and middle-aged adults. Patching has been the mainstay of amblyopia therapy. It is generally&#xD;
      held that the response to treatment is best when it is instituted at an early age and is poor&#xD;
      when attempted after eight years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study 'Occlusion versus Pharmacologic Therapy for Moderate Amblyopia', a randomized trial&#xD;
      of 419 children meeting entry criteria similar to the current study, found that both atropine&#xD;
      1% (one drop daily) and patching (6 hours to full time daily) produced visual acuity&#xD;
      improvement of similar magnitude and that both are appropriate treatment modalities for the&#xD;
      management of moderate amblyopia in children. Patching has the potential advantage of a more&#xD;
      rapid improvement in visual acuity and possibly a slightly better acuity outcome, whereas&#xD;
      atropine has the potential advantage of easier administration and lower cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through its cycloplegic effect, atropine prevents accommodation, blurring the sound eye at&#xD;
      near fixation. The blurring effect can be augmented by reducing the spectacle correction of&#xD;
      hyperopia in the sound eye. The cycloplegic effect lasts at least partially for a week or&#xD;
      longer. Therefore, some pediatric eye care providers believe that daily use of atropine is&#xD;
      unnecessary and treatment may be effective at a dosage of as little as once a week. One&#xD;
      advantage of less frequent dosing is a potential reduction in side effects, including any&#xD;
      potential adverse effect on the vision in the sound eye (reverse amblyopia), on ocular&#xD;
      alignment, and on binocularity. The current study will assess whether prescribing atropine&#xD;
      once a day produces a better visual outcome than does atropine used only on the two weekend&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 'Occlusion versus Pharmacologic Therapy for Moderate Amblyopia' study, the 6-month&#xD;
      outcome data showed that more patients treated with atropine had a reduction in visual acuity&#xD;
      of 1 or more lines in the sound eye than did patients treated with patching. Visual acuity&#xD;
      was decreased from baseline by 1 line in 15% of the atropine group compared with 7% of the&#xD;
      patching group and by 2 or more lines in 9% of the atropine group and 1% of the patching&#xD;
      group. Only one patient (in the atropine group) was actively treated for a presumed&#xD;
      treatment-related decrease in sound eye acuity, with return of acuity to its baseline level.&#xD;
      Some of the cases of reduced acuity were unequivocally due to the use of improper refractive&#xD;
      correction for the sound eye testing (including nine cases in which the testing was done with&#xD;
      a plano lens prescribed for therapeutic effect rather than the proper corrective lens). In&#xD;
      other cases, we speculated that there was a residual cycloplegic effect of atropine combined&#xD;
      with improper refractive correction related to previously latent hyperopia becoming manifest&#xD;
      hyperopia during the period of atropine treatment, although there were not data to fully&#xD;
      document this in all cases. All 47 atropine group patients with a decrease of one or more&#xD;
      lines at six months have had subsequent follow-up exams. Acuity on the subsequent testing was&#xD;
      the same or better than that at baseline in 42 of the 47 patients: 22 while still on atropine&#xD;
      treatment (11 with the same refractive correction and 11 with a different refractive&#xD;
      correction) and 20 after atropine was discontinued (6 with the same refractive correction and&#xD;
      14 with a different refractive correction). In the other five patients, acuity on subsequent&#xD;
      testing was decreased from baseline by one line (3 on atropine, 2 off atropine). Thus, there&#xD;
      did not appear to be a long-term safety concern for atropine, but the data were inconclusive&#xD;
      as to whether atropine caused an actual, though transient, treatment-related decrease in&#xD;
      sound eye acuity. One of the objectives of the current study will be to provide additional&#xD;
      data on the effect of atropine on the sound eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized trial comparing atropine regimes for children with moderate&#xD;
      amblyopia. It will consist of about 160 children. Patients in the daily atropine group&#xD;
      receive atropine 1% one drop daily in the sound eye. Patients in the weekend atropine group&#xD;
      will receive atropine 1% twice a week (Saturday and Sunday) in the sound eye. Visual acuity&#xD;
      is the major study outcome. It is measured after 17 weeks of treatment with either daily or&#xD;
      weekend atropine.&#xD;
