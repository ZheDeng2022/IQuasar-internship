      in maintaining weight in people with disease-related weight loss and/or cachexia.&#xD;

      The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation with fish oils to maintain weight in patients with disease-related weight&#xD;
      loss (cachexia). Weight loss commonly results in a poorer prognosis, functional status, and&#xD;
      quality of life. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with cachexia,&#xD;
      mainstream treatment does not sustain weight and although nutritional supplements are&#xD;
      commonly used, many of these have not been tested in clinical trials. Recent work in cachexia&#xD;
      has revealed that this is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. There are data that&#xD;
      suggests that fish oils can affect the underlying pathogenic inflammatory response and have&#xD;
      an affect on weight maintenance and nutritional balance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diseases in which cachexia is most common:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Heart Failure (CHF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fish oils vs. corn oil in the maintenance of&#xD;
           weight and lean body mass in patients with disease-related weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To understand the mechanism of fish oil effect on health maintenance by evaluating the&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic, anti-oxidant and anabolic actions of these compounds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effect of our interventions on quality of life and functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either fish oil supplements or corn oil for&#xD;
      the duration of this 3-month study. Participants will have five study visits and two&#xD;
      telephone interviews. During each study visit, participants will undergo laboratory tests, a&#xD;
      physical exam, and a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) bone scan. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to keep a food diary during the study. During the telephone interviews, participants&#xD;
      will be asked health-related questions and discuss their current functional status.&#xD;
