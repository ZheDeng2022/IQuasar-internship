      Regular exercise reduces the risk of heart problems, in part because it improves the work of&#xD;
      the endothelium (the cells that line blood vessels). Exercise appears to release precursor&#xD;
      cells from the bone marrow that will later become endothelial cells. A molecule called nitric&#xD;
      oxide (NO) appears to be involved in this release. However, some heart patients do not&#xD;
      improve their endothelial function despite regular exercise. The researchers believe that the&#xD;
      heart disease in these patients may interfere with the normal relationship between exercise&#xD;
      and endothelial function. This study is designed to test whether giving a patient&#xD;
      nitroglycerin (which is converted to NO in the bloodstream) will increase the release of&#xD;
      endothelial precursor cells from the bone marrow. If the study succeeds, it may lead to&#xD;
      improved healing of arteries in heart disease patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults may be eligible for this study if they have coronary artery disease and do not take&#xD;
      nitroglycerin or nitroglycerin-like medication on a daily basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be admitted to the Clinical Center on 2 separate nights at least 1 week&#xD;
      apart. On the morning after each admission, volunteers will have blood drawn from an arm vein&#xD;
      for laboratory tests, and then walk on a treadmill until fatigue or discomfort prevents&#xD;
      further exercise, or until asked to stop. On one of their admissions, volunteers will receive&#xD;
      1 tablet of nitroglycerin under the tongue shortly before the treadmill test. Volunteers will&#xD;
      be monitored by EKGs and blood pressure tests during the treadmill tests, and will have more&#xD;
      blood drawn at about 15 minutes and 24 hours after each treadmill test. Researchers will&#xD;
      examine the levels of endothelial precursor cells and nitric oxide in the blood samples taken&#xD;
      before and after exercise.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Exercise training has long been recommended as a means of improving cardiac function and&#xD;
      reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). One&#xD;
      mechanism of benefit may be through improved endothelial function and enhanced nitric oxide&#xD;
      (NO) bioactivity, which may improve blood flow to exercising skeletal muscle and to the&#xD;
      myocardium. We have recently determined in a collaborative study with the Suburban Hospital,&#xD;
      however, that many CAD patients do not show improved endothelial function despite compliant&#xD;
      participation in a three month cardiac rehabilitation program with exercise three times&#xD;
      weekly. The initial data from this study suggest that improvement in endothelial function may&#xD;
      be dependent on the release of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from the bone marrow into&#xD;
      the circulation in response to the stimulus of repetitive exercise, with the potential of&#xD;
      repairing damaged endothelium and improving endothelial function and NO release. Thus,&#xD;
      patients who have poor EPC mobilization responses to exercise may have limited capacity to&#xD;
      improve endothelial function over time and, conversely, patients with higher EPC mobilization&#xD;
      responses to exercise may show improved endothelial function as a result of vascular repair.&#xD;
      Animal models indicate that NO is necessary for EPC mobilization during exercise, likely&#xD;
      through nitrosation reactions with key signaling proteins within bone marrow. In many CAD&#xD;
      patients, NO release from endothelium and transport in blood to bone marrow may be&#xD;
      compromised because of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and thus limit EPC mobilization and&#xD;
      vascular repair. We hypothesize that the exogenous administration of NO to CAD patients may&#xD;
      enhance EPC mobilization from bone marrow in response to exercise. If successful,&#xD;
      administration of an NO donor (such as nitroglycerin) prior to exercise may extend the&#xD;
      benefit of exercise to endothelial function-and thus cardiovascular risk-in a larger segment&#xD;
      of CAD patients participating in cardiac rehabilitation programs.&#xD;
