  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for&#xD;
      their growth. Oblimersen may help imatinib mesylate kill more tumor cells by making tumor&#xD;
      cells more sensitive to the drug. This phase II trial is studying how well giving imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate together with oblimersen works in treating patients with advanced gastrointestinal&#xD;
      stromal tumor that cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of G3139 (bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide) plus imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate in GIST patients with limited or generalized progression after therapy with&#xD;
      imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of G3139 plus imatinib mesylate in GIST patients with limited or&#xD;
      generalized progression after therapy with imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether expression of BCL-2 correlates with survival, time to progression&#xD;
      or response rate in patients with GIST treated with G3139 plus imatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to extent of disease&#xD;
      progression (limited vs generalized).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously on days 1-14. Patients also receive oral imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients (48 per stratum) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pre-imatinib paraffin block of tumor or 20 unstained slides should be submitted for&#xD;
             correlative studies if available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have either &quot;limited&quot; progression on imatinib (arm 1, some but not&#xD;
             all tumor foci progressing and are not amenable to local therapy) or &quot;generalized&quot;&#xD;
             progression (arm 2, widespread progression of all tumor foci) after adequate therapy&#xD;
             with imatinib mesylate (&gt; or = 400 mg/day for at least 6 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of Kit-expressing advanced GIST; advanced GIST is&#xD;
             defined by patients who have disease that is unresectable; this includes patients with&#xD;
             metastatic disease or primary tumors that cannot be safely removed by a sarcoma&#xD;
             surgical oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease by CT; tests used to assess disease must be done within 28 days&#xD;
             prior to registration. If a targeted lesion has been previously embolized or&#xD;
             irradiated, or if the patient has received imatinib, there must be objective evidence&#xD;
             of progression to be considered for response assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks and recovery from effects of prior therapy (i.e radiation,&#xD;
             biotherapy, chemotherapy other than imatinib mesylate, or embolization;) recovery from&#xD;
             the effects of prior therapy such that they are less than or equal to grade 1 in&#xD;
             severity for non-hematological toxicities excluding nausea and vomiting controlled&#xD;
             with standard anti-emetic regimens, alopecia, fatigue, and peripheral edema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x ULN if no liver metastases or =&lt; 5 x ULN if liver&#xD;
             metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PT and PTT =&lt; 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and sign written informed consent in accordance with institutional and&#xD;
             federal guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have progressive disease defined as 1) an increase in unidimensional&#xD;
             tumor size of &gt; or = 10% AND did not meet criteria for PR by CT density, 2) any new&#xD;
             lesions, including new tumor nodules in a previous cystic tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with widespread metastatic and progressive disease will be eligible for this&#xD;
             protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients without widespread metastases will be evaluated by a sarcoma surgical&#xD;
             oncologist to determine the benefit of and risk of surgical resection; if surgical&#xD;
             resection is not recommended, the patient will be eligible for therapy with the study&#xD;
             drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or lactation; women or men of reproductive potential must agree to use an&#xD;
             effective barrier contraceptive method during treatment and for three months after the&#xD;
             last dose of drug; women of reproductive potential must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration; post-menopausal women must be&#xD;
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered of non-child bearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Uncontrolled chronic renal or liver disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
