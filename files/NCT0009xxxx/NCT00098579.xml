  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of alvocidib when given with&#xD;
      doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or recurrent sarcoma that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride&#xD;
      and alvocidib, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Alvocidib may also help doxorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving more than&#xD;
      one drug may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of flavopiridol (alvocidib) when administered with a&#xD;
      fixed dose of doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) in patients with unresectable&#xD;
      metastatic or locally recurrent sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the clinical pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine,&#xD;
      preliminarily, the therapeutic activity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Correlate pRb, p53, and p21 protein levels with treatment response and apoptosis in&#xD;
      patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Correlate NMR biochemical patterns with response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of alvocidib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 5-10 minutes and alvocidib&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients reaching a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 600 mg/m^2 or&#xD;
      experiencing cardiotoxicity may receive alvocidib alone at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of alvocidib until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2&#xD;
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Ten additional patients receive&#xD;
      treatment at the MTD. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
