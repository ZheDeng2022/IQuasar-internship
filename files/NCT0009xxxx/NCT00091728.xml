  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are biological reasons to suspect that hormones may affect the risk of a woman becoming&#xD;
      infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The evidence on this issue to date is mixed and&#xD;
      previous studies have methodologic flaws making it difficult to draw conclusions about the&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the risk of developing either Chlamydial or Gonorrheal infection among&#xD;
      three groups of women: those using combined oral contraceptives (birth control pills); those&#xD;
      using the injectable hormone (brand name Depo Provera); and those women using non-hormonal&#xD;
      contraceptive methods.&#xD;

      The study was designed to examine the relationship between hormonal contraceptive use and&#xD;
      possible increased risk of Chlamydial and Gonococcal sexually transmitted infections, and to&#xD;
      determine if any increased risk appeared to be mediated by the extent of cervical ectopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eight hundred and nineteen women, ages 15 to 45 years, were recruited from an inner city&#xD;
      clinic and from a nearby suburban clinic. The women were classified into three groups based&#xD;
      on type of contraceptive used. One group used oral contraceptives; the second used injectable&#xD;
      depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA); and the third group used non-hormonal contraceptive&#xD;
      methods. Women from each group were followed at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment to&#xD;
      determine if a new infection with Chlamydia or Gonorrhea had occurred and to evaluate the&#xD;
      extent of cervical ectopy present.&#xD;
