    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized Phase 2 portion of a study testing ALIMTA and epirubicin in&#xD;
      combination for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Epirubicin is a&#xD;
      well-established drug for the therapy of breast cancer. Both ALIMTA and epirubicin have been&#xD;
      combined with other drugs but they have not yet been combined with each other. It is expected&#xD;
      that the patient will benefit from the different mechanisms of action of the two drugs.&#xD;
