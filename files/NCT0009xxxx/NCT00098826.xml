    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SB-715992 in treating patients who have acute&#xD;
      leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so&#xD;
      they stop growing or die&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SB-715992 given as a daily x 3 infusion&#xD;
      in patients with acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain pharmacokinetic studies of SB-715992 given on a 3 consecutive day schedule&#xD;
      every 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe treatment-related and dose-limiting toxicities of SB-715992 in patients with&#xD;
      acute leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the anti-leukemia activity of SB-715992. V. To correlate treatment-related&#xD;
      toxicities with pharmacokinetic studies of SB-715992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To validate KSP as the major target of SB-715992 by determining the impact of drug&#xD;
      treatment on cytoskeletal morphology in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and circulating&#xD;
      leukemic blasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the expression of tubulin isoforms and KSP in leukemic blasts and explore&#xD;
      possible relationships between gene expression and response to SB-715992.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consolidation chemotherapy: Patients achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR),&#xD;
      or stable disease (SD) after induction chemotherapy receive up to 4 additional courses of&#xD;
      SB-715992 beyond CR, PR, or SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive SB-715992 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is&#xD;
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 9 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5-15&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy of grade 2 or higher are not eligible to&#xD;
             participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SB-715992 is a mitotic inhibitor&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with SB-715992, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with SB-715992&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
