      This study will examine and test healthy volunteers and patients with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      to try to learn more about the disease and find better ways to detect, treat, and, if&#xD;
      possible, slow progression. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare blood vessel disorder of the&#xD;
      lung in which the pressure in the pulmonary artery (the blood vessel that leads from the&#xD;
      heart to the lungs) rises above normal levels and may become life-threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers and patients with pulmonary hypertension 18 years of age and older may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. All candidates are screened with a review of their medical records.&#xD;
      Normal volunteers also have a medical history, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram (heart&#xD;
      ultrasound), and pulmonary function test, in which the subject breathes in and out of a tube&#xD;
      that measures lung volume, mechanics and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram to measure heart function and blood pressure in the lungs. A small probe&#xD;
           held against the chest uses sound waves to obtain pictures of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the heart's pumping action. Subjects lie on&#xD;
           a stretcher that slides into a long, tube-shaped scanner. The machine uses a magnetic&#xD;
           field and radio waves to obtain images of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-minute walk to measure how far the subject can walk in 6 minutes. Subjects walk around&#xD;
           the hospital for 6 minutes at a comfortable pace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise testing to measure the ability to exercise and the subject's oxygen levels&#xD;
           during exercise. Subjects exercise on a bike or treadmill while the oxygen and carbon&#xD;
           dioxide they breathe are measured using a small device placed in the mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Right heart catheterization to measure pressure in the heart and lungs. A small catheter&#xD;
           (plastic tube) is placed in an arm vein. A longer catheter called a central line is&#xD;
           placed in a deeper vein in the neck or just below the neck, or in the leg or arm. A&#xD;
           long, thin catheter that measures blood pressure directly is then inserted into the vein&#xD;
           and advanced through the chambers of the heart into the lung artery to measure all the&#xD;
           pressures in the heart and obtain blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic and protein studies. DNA, RNA, and proteins from blood samples are studied for&#xD;
           genes and proteins that might predict the development or progression of pulmonary&#xD;
           hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the above, patients whose pulmonary hypertension was caused by a blood vessel&#xD;
      injury undergo the tests described below. The right heart catheter inserted for the&#xD;
      catheterization procedure remains in place to obtain measurements of the effects of nitric&#xD;
      oxide and nitrite in the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhalation of nitric oxide (a gas naturally produced by cells lining arteries) at&#xD;
           30-minute intervals to examine its effect on lung and heart pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhalation of aerosolized nitrite at 5-minute intervals to measure its effects on lung&#xD;
           and heart pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhalation of nitric oxide for up to 24 hours to obtain multiple measurements of its&#xD;
           effect on lung and heart pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws for laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients whose pulmonary hypertension was caused by a blood vessel injury, we also plan to&#xD;
      follow response to standard therapy. After the initiation of standard therapy, we will&#xD;
      restudy the same parameters (excluding NO and sodium nitrite studies) in these patients at&#xD;
      approximately 4 months, and yearly for 5 years&#xD;

      Introduction: Primary pulmonary hypertension, now known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (IPAH), a subgroup of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), is a rare disorder&#xD;
      characterized by severe morbidity and high mortality rates. There are no routine screening&#xD;
      tests or validated markers of disease activity in IPAH, or the broader group of PAH.&#xD;
      Therefore, patients usually present at advanced stages of disease. The pathogenesis of IPAH&#xD;
      and other forms of PAH remain unclear. Prior theories stressed a &quot;one-hit&quot; hypothesis.&#xD;
      Current thinking focuses on a &quot;two-hit&quot; hypothesis: 1) genetic susceptibility, and 2) a&#xD;
      triggering stimulus that initiates pulmonary vascular injury, resulting in endothelial cell&#xD;
      (EC) dysfunction and the mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Loss of function&#xD;
      mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene, has been implicated in&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of IPAH. EC dysfunction in IPAH has been associated with decreases in both&#xD;
      endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production.&#xD;
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) interact with an altered endothelial cell surface,&#xD;
      which may also be important in the disease process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: We plan to define a subset of differentially regulated biomarkers in IPAH and PAH&#xD;
      that may lead to earlier diagnosis and better methods for measuring responses to therapy.&#xD;
      Specifically, we hope to identify biomarkers of IPAH and other forms of PAH that is&#xD;
      suggestive of NO therapeutic response and which may be useful in titrating NO therapy. We&#xD;
      also hope to identify novel targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will consist of a pilot study and a primary study. The pilot study will&#xD;
      enroll up to 30 patients and 30 controls in order to obtain completed studies on 10 normal&#xD;
      subjects and 10 patients with PAH. The goal of the pilot study is to determine the best&#xD;
      technique for circulating endothelial cell (CEC) and PBMC identification, quantification, and&#xD;
      isolation and EPC identification and quantification. The subjects in the pilot phase undergo&#xD;
      right heart catheterization to obtain hemodynamics and pulmonary artery blood. Pulmonary&#xD;
      artery and peripheral blood will be used for EPC quantification and CEC and PBMC isolation.&#xD;
      CECs and PBMCs will be studied in depth using high density oligonucleotide microarrays. In&#xD;
      addition, plasma obtained from PAH patients and healthy volunteers will be applied in vitro&#xD;
      to various cell populations suspected to be central to disease pathogenesis including but not&#xD;
      limited to ECs, circulating mononuclear cells, cardiac myocytes and/or vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells. Phenotypic alterations induced by plasma exposure will be assessed using in vitro&#xD;
      assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study will recruit the following subject groups: 1) patients with IPAH and other&#xD;
      forms of PAH (vascular injury-induced pulmonary hypertension) who currently are on no&#xD;
      therapy, less than or equal to 6 months of IV therapy, or less than or equal to one year of&#xD;
      oral therapy, 2) patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) ascribed to a nonvascular injury&#xD;
      process and 3) normal individuals. The following baseline studies will be performed in all&#xD;
      groups: 1) noninvasive assessment of right ventricular (RV) function by echocardiogram and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 2) determination of exercise capacity by cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      stress test and six minute walk, 3) measurement of hemodynamic parameters by right heart&#xD;
      catheterization and 4) characterization of disease phenotype by cell surface markers,&#xD;
      oligonucleotide microarrays, and proteomics using peripheral and pulmonary arterial blood.&#xD;
      EPCs will be quantitated and CECs and PBMCs will be isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry&#xD;
      for expression of cell surface markers involved in coagulation, adhesion, and angiogenesis,&#xD;
      as these are important processes in IPAH and PAH. Furthermore, ECs (identified by positive&#xD;
      and negative selection and isolated by cell sorting) and PBMCs will be studied in depth using&#xD;
      high density oligonucleotide microarrays to more fully characterize their transcriptome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major impediment to the widespread use of chronic home based inhaled NO are related to its&#xD;
      delivery system and duration of effects. In PAH patients we plan to study a novel NO delivery&#xD;
      system (INO pulse delivery device). Patients with PAH will be given inhaled NO (20 and 40&#xD;
      ppm) and then placed on inhaled NO using the INO pulse delivery device for 24 hours.&#xD;
      Hemodynamics will be obtained serially with each dose and upon completion of 24 hours of&#xD;
      therapy, pulmonary artery and peripheral blood will be drawn and reexamined by flow&#xD;
      cytometry, microarrays, and proteomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also plan to follow response to standard therapy (as determined by the referring&#xD;
      physician). After the initial day 0 studies, we will restudy the same parameters (excluding&#xD;
      NO studies) in patients with PAH at approximately 4 months, and yearly for 5 years after&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
