      To use existing longitudinal data from the Chicago Heart Association and Western Electric&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the U.S. with over 50 percent of the adult&#xD;
      population either overweight or obese. Obesity has been studied extensively as a risk factor&#xD;
      for coronary heart disease and stroke, but has received less attention as a risk factor for&#xD;
      congestive heart failure (CHF). Another area of limited investigation is the study of risk&#xD;
      factors for multi morbidity, i.e. the occurrence of several morbid events at the same time,&#xD;
      which is very common in older adults. Other areas of investigation in this study are possible&#xD;
      associations between each of heart rate and dietary patterns with the development of&#xD;
      diabetes. The Chicago Heart Association Detection Project and the Western Electric studies,&#xD;
      both supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, are resources to study the&#xD;
      above associations. Multiple measures of obesity are available at several different time&#xD;
      points and follow-up data are available for 30-40 years which should increase the power of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be used for this project include baseline data collected in 1967-73 from 39,522&#xD;
      subjects from the Chicago Heart Association Study (CHA) and baseline and annual follow-up&#xD;
      data from the Western Electric Study collected from 1957-1966 consisting of 2107 men, age&#xD;
      40-55 years in the Chicago area. Mortality follow-up for those 2 cohorts is accomplished via&#xD;
      the National Death Index. Morbidity follow-up is accomplished by record linkage with Medicare&#xD;
      files and to some extent by followup questionnaires for disease outcomes although the&#xD;
      follow-up rate for the latter approach is only about 60 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses extensive existing data from the Chicago Heart Association (CHA) [20,854 men&#xD;
      and 16,049 women aged 18-64 at baseline (1967-73)] and Western Electric (WE) [2,107 men aged&#xD;
      40- 55 at baseline (1957-58)] that include four comprehensive sources of outcomes: 1)&#xD;
      mortality data from long-term follow-up; 2) morbidity and other data from Medicare claims for&#xD;
      19 years from 1984 to 2000; 3) multiple health questionnaires (CHA); and 4) repeated measures&#xD;
      of adiposity from 8 annual re-examinations after baseline (WE). The study addresses the&#xD;
      following specific aims: 1) to investigate in-depth the longitudinal associations of&#xD;
      adiposity as assessed by several indices (body mass index, weight gain, subscapular and&#xD;
      triceps skinfolds, and derived percent body fat) during young adulthood and middle age with&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity from congestive heart failure later in life; 2) to delineate the&#xD;
      relationships of adiposity assessed earlier in life with older-age multimorbidity, the&#xD;
      coexistence of multiple pathological conditions of varying severity -- a very common but&#xD;
      under-studied phenomenon among older adults; 3) to examine in-depth the associations of heart&#xD;
      rate and changes in heart rate with incident diabetes, stratified by obesity status at&#xD;
      baseline. As an exploratory aim, the study will assess whether a) higher fruit and vegetable&#xD;
      and lower sugar intake; and b) higher dairy and calcium intake are associated with lower&#xD;
      adiposity, smaller weight gain, and lower incidence of diabetes.&#xD;
