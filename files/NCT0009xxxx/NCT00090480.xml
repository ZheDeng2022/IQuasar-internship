      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with breast cancer with the&#xD;
      genetically engineered HyperAcute-Breast cancer vaccine. It will establish the proper vaccine&#xD;
      dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The vaccine&#xD;
      contains killed breast cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the production of a&#xD;
      foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the immune response&#xD;
      to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the patient's own cancer&#xD;
      cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the tumor to remain&#xD;
      stable or shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age or older with breast cancer that has recurred or no longer responds&#xD;
      to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest x-rays and CT scans.&#xD;
      MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive four vaccinations a month apart from each other. The vaccines will&#xD;
      be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase I of&#xD;
      the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the vaccine&#xD;
      cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase II will&#xD;
      look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be safe in&#xD;
      Phase I. Weekly blood samples will be drawn during the 4 months of vaccine treatment. In&#xD;
      addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the first year after&#xD;
      vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2 years for the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACT-B Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's&#xD;
           general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment, before&#xD;
           each vaccination, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It&#xD;
           includes questions on the severity of breast cancer symptoms and the ability to perform&#xD;
           normal activities of daily life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to 2002 statistics of the American Cancer Society, an estimated 203,500 individuals&#xD;
      will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,600 will die of the disease this year despite all&#xD;
      current therapy. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to breast cancer gene therapy&#xD;
      using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in attempt to vaccinate&#xD;
      patients against their breast cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)&#xD;
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha&#xD;
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These&#xD;
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs&#xD;
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing&#xD;
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of&#xD;
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most&#xD;
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally&#xD;
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies&#xD;
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory breast cancer will undergo a series of four intradermal injections with a vaccine&#xD;
      composed of irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell lines (HAB-1 and HAB-2) that have been&#xD;
      transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based retroviral vector&#xD;
      expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include determination of&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and immunological&#xD;
      responses.&#xD;
