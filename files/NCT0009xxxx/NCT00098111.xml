      The purpose of this study is to identify an optimal weight based dose of azathioprine that is&#xD;
      safe and effective in the treatment of subjects with active Crohn's disease requiring&#xD;
      treatment with corticosteroids, and for maintaining remission in those subjects.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION: Medical therapy for Crohn's disease is of variable success in ameliorating the&#xD;
      cardinal symptoms of the disease (diarrhea, abdominal pain), in treating extraintestinal&#xD;
      manifestations (fatigue, anorexia, fever, weight loss, arthralgias, skin, eye, liver and&#xD;
      kidney manifestations), and in preventing complications (stricture, fistula, abscess).&#xD;
      Currently, therapy is most often implemented in a stepwise fashion, progressing through&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications (sulfasalazine, mesalamine), antibiotics (metronidazole,&#xD;
      ciprofloxacin), corticosteroids, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medications, including&#xD;
      thioguanine compounds (6 mercaptopurine or its prodrug azathioprine), methotrexate, and&#xD;
      finally, infliximab (anti-tumor necrosis factor). A common approach is the gradual addition&#xD;
      of more potent medications to agents that are believed to be safer, but may also be less&#xD;
      effective. Despite the current approach to medical therapy in Crohn's disease, a substantial&#xD;
      number of patients-from 20 to 40%-require surgery within 3 years of diagnosis, excluding&#xD;
      those requiring surgery at the time of diagnosis. Nearly 80% of patients require surgery by&#xD;
      20 years from the onset of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids have long been a mainstay of therapy in Crohn's disease although side effects&#xD;
      are frequently observed with both short term and long-term use. Potential side effects are&#xD;
      well-described, and may include relatively minor problems such as insomnia and acne, as well&#xD;
      as more serious adverse effects, including hypertension, narrow-angle glaucoma, depression,&#xD;
      weight gain, adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, diminished bone mineral density, and&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azathioprine is often used to treat patients with steroid resistant or dependent Crohn's&#xD;
      disease. Azathioprine is used as a steroid sparing agent, as treatment for active,&#xD;
      inflammatory disease, for maintenance of remission, as therapy for perforating disease&#xD;
      (fistulae), and for specific extraintestinal manifestations. To date, however, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical studies assessing a range of doses of azathioprine in Crohn's disease&#xD;
      have not been conducted. The optimal weight-based dose is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION: This study will identify an optimal weight based dose of azathioprine&#xD;
      for treatment of patients with active Crohn's disease requiring treatment with&#xD;
      corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY HYPOTHESIS: An optimal weight-based dose of azathioprine will induce and maintain&#xD;
      remission in subjects with steroid-dependent Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPARISON: Three different doses of azathioprine will be compared in this study (0.5, 2.5,&#xD;
      and 3.5mg/kg/day). Subjects will take the study medication for 9 months.&#xD;
