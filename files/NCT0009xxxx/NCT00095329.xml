  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the drug sirolimus&#xD;
      in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have failed other treatments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MS is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system in which myelin, the protein&#xD;
      sheath that protects nerve cells, is degraded by T cells and macrophages, leading to an&#xD;
      eventual loss of neurologic function. MS can be classified as either relapsing-remitting, in&#xD;
      which patients experience worsening in symptoms followed by partial or complete recovery of&#xD;
      function; or progressive, in which patients have a gradual increase in symptoms, with or&#xD;
      without relapses. Standard treatments used to treat relapsing-remitting MS are only modestly&#xD;
      effective and may be associated with significant toxicity. There is a need to develop&#xD;
      therapies with lower toxicities that can be administered early during the course of disease&#xD;
      and have the potential to stop disease progression altogether. Sirolimus has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to provide potent immunosuppression in recent clinical trials involving kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, and may help people with autoimmune diseases like MS. This study will&#xD;
      determine the benefit of sirolimus in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine collection will occur at screening. Participants will take daily doses of&#xD;
      sirolimus for 6 months. There will be nine study visits; they will occur at Days 14, 28, 42,&#xD;
      56, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 225. Medication adverse events, concomitant medications, and vital&#xD;
      signs will be recorded at Visits 1 through 8. At all visits, patient compliance to the&#xD;
      sirolimus regimen will be measured, and blood and urine collection will occur. Physical and&#xD;
      neurological exams, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, MS status tests, and a&#xD;
      chest x-ray will be conducted at selected times throughout the study.&#xD;
