  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine in healthy volunteers how breathing carbon monoxide (CO) affects lung&#xD;
      inflammation. Severe lung inflammation sometimes develops in patients with pneumonia or&#xD;
      patients who develop serious blood stream infections. Studies in the laboratory and in&#xD;
      animals show that CO can decrease lung inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers between 18 and 40 years of age who do not smoke, are not taking any&#xD;
      medications, do not have asthma, are not allergic to sulfa- and penicillin-based drugs, and&#xD;
      are not pregnant may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest&#xD;
      x-ray. Subjects are enrolled in either a pilot study or the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage to study the effects of&#xD;
      endotoxin (a component of bacteria that causes inflammation similar to that in patients with&#xD;
      lung infections) on lung function. Before the procedure, a small plastic tube (catheter) is&#xD;
      placed in a vein to collect blood samples and another is placed in an artery to check blood&#xD;
      pressure. For the bronchoscopy, the mouth and nasal airways are numbed with lidocaine, and a&#xD;
      bronchoscope (thin flexible tube) is passed through the nose into the airways of the lung. A&#xD;
      small amount of salt water is squirted through the bronchoscope into one lung and then salt&#xD;
      water containing endotoxin is squirted into the other lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the bronchoscopy, subjects are treated with either CO or room air (placebo) for 6&#xD;
      hours. (Subjects in the pilot study receive treatment for only 3 hours). The gas is delivered&#xD;
      through a cushioned mask placed over the nose and mouth. The amount of exhaled CO is measured&#xD;
      before, during, and after inhalation of the gas. For this measurement, subjects take a deep&#xD;
      breath to fill up their lungs and slowly exhale into a mouthpiece connected to a measuring&#xD;
      device until they feel their lungs are empty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the CO treatment, a second bronchoscopy is done to examine how the lung responded to&#xD;
      the CO or room air. This is studied in two ways. To sample the air, a large needle is used to&#xD;
      withdraw air through the bronchoscope over about 3 seconds. Then the areas of the lung that&#xD;
      were squirted with salt water alone and with endotoxin and salt water and are rinsed (lavage)&#xD;
      and cells and secretions are collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Of&#xD;
      the many potential predisposing factors, sepsis and pneumonia represent the two main causes&#xD;
      of ARDS. In spite of an increase in survival in recent years mortality in patients with ARDS&#xD;
      is still estimated around 30 to 40%. In this context, development of effective preventive&#xD;
      strategies in patients at high risk of development of ARDS is of paramount importance.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the results of studies evaluating prophylactic regimens for ARDS have been&#xD;
      mostly disappointing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO) has been traditionally viewed as a toxic metabolic&#xD;
      and industrial waste. However, recent studies have demonstrated an important physiologic role&#xD;
      of CO in many biological systems. Specifically, strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and&#xD;
      anti-thrombotic effects of CO gas administration and heme oxygenase activation (the enzyme&#xD;
      that generates endogenous CO gas) have been demonstrated in several animal models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies conducted in our department have demonstrated that bronchoscopic&#xD;
      instillation of endotoxin (LPS) in healthy volunteers elicits a compartmentalized pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammatory response, serving as an excellent model to evaluate interventions directed&#xD;
      towards suppression of lung inflammation at its earliest stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current single blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study, we are planning to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of inhaled carbon monoxide on local pulmonary inflammatory responses&#xD;
      following endotoxin administration. Healthy subjects will undergo local endotoxin&#xD;
      instillation, breathe CO or room air through a mask for 6 hours, and then a repeat&#xD;
      bronchoscopy with lavage will be done at 6 hours to assess the ability of CO to suppress&#xD;
      local inflammation in the lung.&#xD;
