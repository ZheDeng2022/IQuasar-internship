    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with docetaxel&#xD;
      in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. In addition, the study is designed to observe&#xD;
      the potential the combination of ARQ 501 and docetaxel have in treating cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ARQ 501 has demonstrated activity in vitro against a wide range of solid tumors including&#xD;
      lung, colorectal, breast, prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, and myeloma. To date, no&#xD;
      histological cancer type studied appears inherently resistant to treatment with ARQ 501. In&#xD;
      animal xenograft models of human tumors, ARQ 501 monotherapy has been effective in treating&#xD;
      ovarian, colon, prostate, and breast cancer. When used in combination with taxane therapy,&#xD;
      ARQ 501 has demonstrated efficacy in treating a variety of human cancers, including ovarian,&#xD;
      breast, and colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to explore whether the addition of ARQ 501 to a once every three week&#xD;
      schedule of docetaxel is a safe and tolerable regimen. The study is designed to collect&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetic data on the combination regimen and to measure the antitumor&#xD;
      activity observed in patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic carcinoma. (Patients may have either measurable or nonmeasurable disease.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not be eligible for therapy of higher curative potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients. Patients who are fertile agree&#xD;
             to use an effective barrier method of birth control (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or&#xD;
             cervical cap) to avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate organ function as determined per protocol defined laboratory value&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received previous treatment with ARQ 501.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life&#xD;
             threatening, or clinically significant at the time of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation,&#xD;
             or follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, major&#xD;
             surgery, or irradiation, whether conventional or investigational, within 2 weeks of&#xD;
             treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not recovered from acute toxicity of all previous therapy prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator,&#xD;
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known severe hypersensitivity to docetaxel or drugs formulated with polysorbate&#xD;
             80.&#xD;
