      This study will determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect damage to&#xD;
      certain parts of the brain and analyze the thickness of the brain's outer surface in patients&#xD;
      with multiple sclerosis. MRI is a diagnostic test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio&#xD;
      waves to obtain images of body organs and tissues. It can sometimes permit diagnosis even&#xD;
      before symptoms develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS is a disease of white matter, the fatty covering around the nerves in the brain and spinal&#xD;
      cord. The nerves themselves are called gray matter. Damage to white matter impairs nerve&#xD;
      function, leading to a variety of symptoms, such as weakness, vision problems, difficulty&#xD;
      walking, paralysis, and others. MRI can detect some changes in white matter, but changes that&#xD;
      may also appear in gray matter may be more difficult to find. This study will use new MRI&#xD;
      techniques to try to identify gray matter damage in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (an early stage of MS&#xD;
      in which the patient has had just one of the problems MS can cause) who are between 18 and 55&#xD;
      years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history&#xD;
      and neurological examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one month of the screening evaluation, participants undergo MRI scanning on a standard&#xD;
      1.5 Tesla machine to confirm their health status. (The power of the MRI scanner is measured&#xD;
      in Tesla; the higher the Tesla, the better the visualization.) For this procedure, the&#xD;
      subject lies on a table that moves into the scanner (a narrow cylinder with a magnetic&#xD;
      field), and wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the&#xD;
      scanning process. During the procedure, a contrast agent called Gadolinium is injected into&#xD;
      the blood stream to brighten the images. The test lasts about 2 hours, during which time the&#xD;
      subject must lie still for up to a few minutes at a time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within a month after the first MRI, participants repeat the test for a second time. The&#xD;
      procedure is identical to the first scan, except a 3.0 Tesla machine is used.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: Detection of cortical lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging. Their identification might provide more&#xD;
      insight in explaining the level of disability in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of the present study is identifying cortical lesions in patients with MS using&#xD;
      MRI. As a secondary aim, correlation between cortical lesions presence and clinical&#xD;
      disability score (i.e. Expanded Disability Status Score or EDSS scale) will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Tertiary aims will be provided by the relationships between the presence of cortical lesions&#xD;
      and reduction in cortical thickness and extent of remote white matter disease pathology.&#xD;
      Additionally, the role of white matter lesions in causing remote pathology will be studied.&#xD;
      To better characterize this damage, patients with previous stroke, presenting with a single&#xD;
      lesion on the pyramidal tract will be enrolled and diffusion-derived indices of white matter&#xD;
      remote tracts will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Fifty patients with definite MS or with a single attack and an MRI&#xD;
      suggestive of MS (i.e., clinically isolated syndrome) according to McDonald criteria, and 55&#xD;
      healthy volunteers will be enrolled. Fifteen patients with previous ischemic stroke and 15&#xD;
      age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers will also be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: After a clinical evaluation and an MRI at 1.5 Tesla, each individual will be imaged&#xD;
      once at 3.0 Tesla scan. Clinical MRI before and within 15 minutes after contrast injection&#xD;
      will be obtained in each patient at both 1.5 and 3 Tesla scans. In addition, 3 spoiled&#xD;
      gradient-echo sequence, diffusion tensor images and double inversion recovery sequences will&#xD;
      be acquired on the 3 Tesla MRI. Some healthy volunteers (up to 15) and patients (up to 15)&#xD;
      will be required to be imaged twice on the 3T magnet as to optimize the sequences of this&#xD;
      study. Additionally, 20 patients in whom cortical lesions will be identified using the&#xD;
      above-mentioned techniques and 20 healthy volunteers will undergo brain perfusion MRIs. This&#xD;
      may represent the third 3T MRI for the former in some instances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: In MS patients, the number of cortical lesions will be computed. The EDSS&#xD;
      score will serve for investigating the relationship between cortical lesions and clinical&#xD;
      disability. Effect of cortical or white matter lesions in causing remote degeneration will be&#xD;
      studied using diffusion tensor and magnetization transfer imaging in patients with both&#xD;
      stroke and MS.&#xD;
