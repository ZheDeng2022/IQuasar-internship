  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the way valerian, an herbal sleep agent, is absorbed&#xD;
      and distributed in the body. This study will also compare the effects of valerian after 1&#xD;
      week versus after 2 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are common among the elderly and may increase the risk for depression and&#xD;
      early mortality. Use of over-the-counter sleep aids may disrupt sleep patterns and have&#xD;
      serious side effects. Herbal medicines have the potential to improve sleep quality. Evidence&#xD;
      suggests that valerian may improve sleep with a low rate of side effects, but its efficacy&#xD;
      has not been thoroughly examined in the elderly. This study will determine the effectiveness&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics (PK) of valerian in older adults who experience disturbances in their&#xD;
      sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last 8 weeks. At the sleep clinic, participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive either valerian or placebo on the first night of study enrollment. Participants will&#xD;
      have an intravenous (IV) line inserted into their arms and multiple blood draws will be taken&#xD;
      during their sleep for PK studies. The next day, participants will be sent home for a drug&#xD;
      wash-out period and will return after 1 week for a 3-night stay at the clinic on Nights 8, 9,&#xD;
      and 10. On Night 8, participants will adjust to their surroundings and begin a sleep log to&#xD;
      describe the quality of their sleep; they will continue to note observations on their sleep&#xD;
      in the sleep log for the duration of the study. Recordings of each participant's sleeping and&#xD;
      breathing patterns will be taken on Nights 8 and 9 to screen for sleep disorders. On Night&#xD;
      10, participants will again be randomly assigned to receive either valerian or placebo. After&#xD;
      Night 10, participants will be sent home and asked to continue taking their assigned&#xD;
      intervention nightly for 11 nights. Participants will be asked to continue their sleep logs&#xD;
      and begin a symptom log describing insomnia symptoms. After 11 nights, participants will&#xD;
      return for another 3-night stay at the clinic on Nights 22, 23, and 24; participants will&#xD;
      receive either valerian or placebo. Participants will then be sent home for a 12-day drug&#xD;
      wash-out period; participants will return to the clinic for Nights 37 and 38. Night 37 will&#xD;
      be an adaptation night; on Night 38, participants will be given the intervention they were&#xD;
      not yet assigned on Night 24. After Night 38, participants will be asked to go home and&#xD;
      continue their second treatment for 11 nights; participants will come back to the sleep&#xD;
      clinic for another 3-night stay on Nights 50, 51, and 52 for observation and PK studies.&#xD;
      After Night 52, participants will be sent home and asked to continue their sleep and symptoms&#xD;
      logs for two more nights, then mail the logs to study researchers for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, participants will be asked to keep logs of the quality of their sleep and&#xD;
      of the insomnia symptoms they may be experiencing. In addition to the logs, post-sleep&#xD;
      interviews will be used to assess the quality of participants' sleep and the number of&#xD;
      awakenings. Participants' heart and breathing rates and leg movements will be measured during&#xD;
      their stays at the sleep clinic. Participants will also have an activity monitoring device&#xD;
      attached to either their wrist or waist for most of the study.&#xD;
