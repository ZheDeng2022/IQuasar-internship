      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that breast arterial calcification (BAC) seen on mammograms can&#xD;
      identify women with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Annual mammograms are&#xD;
      now routinely obtained on nearly 70% of women over forty years of age. The nearly 40 million&#xD;
      examinations performed every year could be used to evaluate for BAC without any additional&#xD;
      cost or change in current mammographic techniques. Identification of women with BAC has&#xD;
      potential to substantially decrease the rate of heart attack and sudden death due to CAD in&#xD;
      asymptomatic women. Before BAC can be used in a clinical setting, the age-specific prevalence&#xD;
      of BAC needs to be fully defined using state of the art mammographic techniques. BAC then&#xD;
      needs to be compared with well understood CAD risk factors and measures of coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. While this could be accomplished in a prospective study, the same goals can&#xD;
      be attained using data already acquired in the Epidemiology of Coronary Calcification (ECAC)&#xD;
      Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses existing data on 612 non-high risk, non-referred women who are participants in&#xD;
      the community-based ECAC Study funded by NIH from 1991-2006. This database includes&#xD;
      traditional and newer coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors and the results of electron&#xD;
      beam computed tomography (EBCT) examinations for CAC at a baseline examination. Most of the&#xD;
      women also have had risk factors and CAC measured during a follow-up examination, on average,&#xD;
      five years after baseline examinations. The women in the ECAC Study, who do not have a&#xD;
      history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, represent the full age range routinely&#xD;
      evaluated with mammograms. Almost all these women have their usual care, including annual&#xD;
      mammograms, in Rochester, Minnesota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN NARRATIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECAC study has been instrumental in establishing the distribution of presence and&#xD;
      quantity of CAC as well as the predictors of CAC. The database includes clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory assessments of CAD risk factors, results of EBCTs, and findings on physical&#xD;
      examinations. It will ultimately include information on adverse clinical events. There are&#xD;
      612 female participants who had one or more mammograms during the 12-year history of that&#xD;
      study. Many women had 10 or more mammograms. The study will evaluate all of these mammograms&#xD;
      for BAC and compare the findings with information already in the database. The combination of&#xD;
      newly acquired data from mammograms with the existing data allows this to be a very&#xD;
      comprehensive study and still be completed in the two-year time period. The findings can then&#xD;
      be used to help design a future study to prospectively evaluate the impact of instituting&#xD;
      preventive and early therapeutic measures for CAD in asymptomatic women with the appropriate&#xD;
      features of BAC on mammography.&#xD;
