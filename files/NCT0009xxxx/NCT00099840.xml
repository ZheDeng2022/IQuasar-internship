      Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) are among the most frequent reasons for seeking&#xD;
      medical attention in primary care. Although from predominantly viral origin, ARTIs are the&#xD;
      most important condition for the prescription of antibiotics (AB), mainly due to the&#xD;
      difficulty in primary care to differentiate between viral and bacterial etiology. Unnecessary&#xD;
      AB use increases drug expenditures, side effects and AB resistance. A novel approach is to&#xD;
      guide AB use by procalcitonin (ProCT), since serum levels are elevated in bacterial&#xD;
      infections but remain lower in viral infections and inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to compare a strategy based on evidence-based guidelines with ProCT guided AB therapy&#xD;
      in ARTIs with respect to outcome (days with restriction) and AB use. Patients presenting with&#xD;
      ARTIs to primary care physicians and are intended to be treated with AB based on guidelines&#xD;
      will be included and randomized 1:1 either to standard management or to the ProCT guided&#xD;
      prescription of AB. All participating physicians will receive evidence-based guidelines for&#xD;
      the management of patients with ARTIs. Patients with ARTI and in need of ABs by physicians'&#xD;
      clinical judgment and with informed consent will be randomized to ProCT plus guidelines&#xD;
      (&quot;ProCT group&quot;) versus only guidelines guided AB treatment (&quot;control group&quot;). In patients&#xD;
      randomized to the ProCT group, the use of antibiotics will be more or less discouraged (&lt;0.1&#xD;
      or &lt;0.25 ug/L) or encouraged (&gt;0.5 or &gt;0.25 ug/L), respectively. A re-evaluation in patients&#xD;
      with ProCT (&lt;0.1 or &lt;0.25 ug/L) after 6 to 24 hours is mandatory. All patients will be&#xD;
      reassessed at day 3 and it is recommended to stop AB in the ProCT group as described above.&#xD;
      Structured phone interviews at days 14 and 28 will be done in all patients from both groups.&#xD;

      Background: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) (i.e. common cold, pharyngitis,&#xD;
      tonsillitis, rhinosinusitis, tracheo-bronchitis, otitis media, acute exacerbations of asthma&#xD;
      (AEA) and of chronic pulmonary disease (AECOPD), and community acquired pneumonia (CAP)), are&#xD;
      among the most frequent reasons for seeking medical attention in primary care. Although from&#xD;
      predominantly viral origin, ARTIs are the most important condition for the prescription of&#xD;
      antibiotics (AB), mainly due to the difficulty in primary care to differentiate between viral&#xD;
      and bacterial etiology. Unnecessary AB use increases drug expenditures, side effects and AB&#xD;
      resistance. A novel approach is to guide AB use by procalcitonin (ProCT), since serum levels&#xD;
      are elevated in bacterial infections but remain lower in viral infections and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To compare a strategy based on evidence-based guidelines with ProCT guided AB therapy in&#xD;
      ARTIs with respect to outcome (days with restriction) and AB use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized, controlled trial with an open intervention. Patients presenting with&#xD;
      ARTIs to primary care physicians and are intended to be treated with AB based on guidelines&#xD;
      will be included and randomized 1:1 either to standard management or to the ProCT guided&#xD;
      prescription of AB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Primary care providers in the Northwest of Switzerland from cantons with or without&#xD;
      drug self dispensation (Basel-Stadt and Baselland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: 18 years or older, with ARTI of &gt;1 and &lt;28 days duration and in need of ABs based&#xD;
      on the clinical judgment of the primary care physician. Excluded are patients without&#xD;
      informed consent, not fluent in German, with AB pretreatment in previous 28 days or severe&#xD;
      immune-suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints: Primary: Days with restrictions from ARTI. Secondary: Rate of AB prescriptions,&#xD;
      days with AB use, symptoms from ARTI, relapse rate from ARTI within 28 days, days with side&#xD;
      effects from ABs and off work. Endpoints will be assessed at baseline, days 1 to 3 by the&#xD;
      physicians. Structured phone interviews at days 14 and 28 will be done in all patients from&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All participating physicians will receive evidence-based guidelines for the&#xD;
      management of patients with ARTIs. Patients with ARTI and in need of ABs by physicians'&#xD;
      clinical judgment and with informed consent will be randomized to ProCT plus guidelines&#xD;
      (&quot;ProCT group&quot;) versus only guidelines guided AB treatment (&quot;control group&quot;). In patients&#xD;
      randomized to the ProCT group the use of antibiotics will be more or less discouraged (&lt;0.1&#xD;
      or &lt;0.25 ug/L) or encouraged (&gt;0.5 or &gt;0.25 ug/L), respectively. A re-evaluation in patients&#xD;
      with ProCT (&lt;0.1 or &lt;0.25 ug/L) after 6 to 24 hours is mandatory. All patients will be&#xD;
      reassessed at day 3 and it is recommended to stop AB in the ProCT group as described above.&#xD;
      Blood specimens for ProCT, taken from all patients, will be shipped by courier to the central&#xD;
      lab and results will be reported within 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables and measurement: Physicians have to consecutively enroll all patients with ARTI in&#xD;
      whom they consider AB treatment. Baseline data on medical history and clinical items,&#xD;
      additional diagnostic tests, co-morbidity and final prescribed treatment will be collected.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted over a 12 month period in 2005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: We assume noninferiority if at worst the new procedure leads to an increase&#xD;
      on average of one day with restrictions compared to standard procedure with a reduced total&#xD;
      AB use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our null hypothesis is: ProCT guided antibiotic management gives on average more than an&#xD;
      extra day with restrictions than standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative hypothesis: ProCT guided antibiotic management gives on average at most one day&#xD;
      with restrictions more than the standard procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses: Analysis will be done based on the intention-to-treat principle. Sample size for&#xD;
      type I error rate of 5% and type II error rate of 10% (i.e. 90% power) = 171. With allowance&#xD;
      for a loss to followup of 10% the required sample size is 190 per treatment group. We intend&#xD;
      to gain 24 primary care physicians to recruit the total of 380 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Because of the high prevalence of ARTIs, this study will offer potential for&#xD;
      improving the management of ARTIs in primary care by avoiding unnecessary ABs in patients&#xD;
      with ARTIs, along with the prevention of AB resistance. For these reasons, it has high&#xD;
      relevance for the Swiss health care system and for public health in Switzerland.&#xD;
