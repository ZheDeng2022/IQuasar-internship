  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the safety of NS-9 and to see how well it is tolerated in&#xD;
      patients with cancer that has metastasized (spread) to the liver from another primary tumor.&#xD;
      NS-9 is a drug developed to go to the liver to cause cell death specifically in tumor cells.&#xD;
      This study is also set up to determine the best dose to use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study requires subjects to undergo 2 treatment cycles of NS-9. Each cycle consists of&#xD;
      once daily, 1-hour I.V. infusions of the drug for 5 days followed by a 23-day rest period.&#xD;
      During the rest period, subjects are seen at the clinic once weekly for evaluation. Subjects&#xD;
      having favorable or stable results after 2 cycles may continue to receive NS-9 in the&#xD;
      extension phase of the study until the disease progresses or until they get a side effect&#xD;
      that prevents them from continuing with therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each two cycles, if appropriate, the liver tumor will be measured by radiologic imaging&#xD;
      to compare it to its pre-treatment size.&#xD;
