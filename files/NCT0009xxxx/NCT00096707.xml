  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      biologic effect (FDG PET, preliminary efficacy) of daily oral doses of 2DG with and without&#xD;
      weekly docetaxel in subjects with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) is a synthetic glucose analog under development by Threshold&#xD;
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. that exploits the differences in metabolism between normal and&#xD;
      malignant cells. Malignant cells utilize glucose at a much higher rate than normal cells and&#xD;
      are therefore more dependent on aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis. If glycolysis could be&#xD;
      blocked preferentially in malignant cells, 2DG would have potential for anti-tumor therapy.&#xD;
      Hypoxic cells are especially dependent on anaerobic glycolysis and are generally resistant to&#xD;
      anti-tumor therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therefore, combining 2DG with&#xD;
      chemotherapy may be a way to simultaneously target both hypoxic and aerobic cells in tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four factors may play a role in the preferential toxicity of 2DG in malignant cells: (1)&#xD;
      increased uptake and retention of glucose analogs by malignant cells; (2) relative hypoxia of&#xD;
      tumor cells relative to normal cells; (3) malignant cells may be more sensitive to glucose&#xD;
      deprivation than normal cells; and (4) inhibition of glycolysis may increase sensitivity to&#xD;
      some cytotoxic agents. Preliminary data in human tumor xenografts support this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because 2DG is most likely to be effective in combination with chemotherapy, this trial was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2DG both alone and in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy. Docetaxel was chosen because there is evidence in human tumor xenografts&#xD;
      of delayed tumor growth for 2DG in combination with paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel alone&#xD;
      and it has been reported that taxanes may enhance uptake of 2DG into malignant cells.&#xD;
      Patients with advanced solid tumors were chosen because they are appropriate candidates for a&#xD;
      Phase I clinical trial and because their tumors are likely to have areas of hypoxia.&#xD;
