    <textblock>
      This study will examine activity in the brain during the observation of touch. Studies with&#xD;
      animals have shown that mirror neurons, or nerve cells, are active during the observation and&#xD;
      performance of an action. The researchers for this study hypothesize that a similar system&#xD;
      pertains to observing and experiencing touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 18 to 75 years old who are in good health, are right handed, and who are able&#xD;
      to perform simple tasks that require attention may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women&#xD;
      are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have not had a health screening at NIH will undergo a clinical and neurological&#xD;
      exam. Women of childbearing potential will also have a pregnancy test. The screening will&#xD;
      take about 2 to 3 hours. A diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be performed&#xD;
      if patients have not undergone one in the previous 12 months. During the procedure, patients&#xD;
      will lie still on a table that will slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will&#xD;
      be asked to lie as still as possible for up to a few minutes at a time. As the scanner takes&#xD;
      pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and they will wear earplugs to&#xD;
      reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the MRI staff at all times during&#xD;
      the scan, and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at any time. This scan will take&#xD;
      about 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sessions are involved in the study. The first one is intended to familiarize patients&#xD;
      with the procedure. During it, they will learn about hand stimulus, through watching a video&#xD;
      showing the index finger of a hand being touched by a stick repeatedly. Then the activity&#xD;
      will be repeated, but this time, a researcher will also touch the patient's index finger&#xD;
      while he or she is watching the video. This session will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session consists of a functional MRI scan, or fMRI. During it, pictures of the&#xD;
      brain will be taken while patients perform tasks. All tasks will be explained in advance, and&#xD;
      patients will have an opportunity to practice them before entering the scanner. The fMRI scan&#xD;
      will take 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will discuss the results of the tests with the participants. There is not a&#xD;
      direct benefit to those who take part in the study. However, it is hoped that resulting&#xD;
      information will enhance researchers' understanding about how the brain processes observed&#xD;
      information.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that a mirror system for action observation exists. Neurons in the&#xD;
      monkey premotor cortex discharge with performance of goal directed actions and also with&#xD;
      observation of another individual performing a similar action. This mirror neuron system for&#xD;
      action observation seems to be important for the recognition and understanding of actions.&#xD;
      Recently, bimodal neurons, sensitive both for tactile stimulation and for visual stimuli,&#xD;
      were found in the parietal cortex. This suggests the idea that there might be a similar&#xD;
      mirror neuron system for observing and receiving (or experiencing) tactile stimulation. The&#xD;
      neuronal correlates of observing tactile stimulation are mainly unknown. The purpose of this&#xD;
      protocol is to determine the pattern of brain activation related to the observation of a&#xD;
      tactile stimulated hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test our hypothesis by means of a functional MRI (fMRI) experiment in a group of&#xD;
      healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that observation of touch will rely on the activation of a cortical network&#xD;
      that is different form the observation of non-touch and is in part overlapping with cortical&#xD;
      structures active during real tactile stimulation (i.e., somatosensory cortex). Further, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that the observation of touch enhances activation in the somatosensory cortex&#xD;
      during real tactile stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our outcome measure will be an increase in the number of activated voxels in the&#xD;
      somatosensory cortex during the touch observation (for both hypothesis). This would give an&#xD;
      important hint for a mirror system for observed and received touch. A mirror neuron system&#xD;
      for observed touch may become an important tool in rehabilitative treatment for patients with&#xD;
      somatosensory impairments.&#xD;
