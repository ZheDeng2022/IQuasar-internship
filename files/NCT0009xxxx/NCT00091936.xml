  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection common in HIV infected people, is a major problem in&#xD;
      developing countries. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a combined&#xD;
      treatment strategy using directly observed therapy (DOT) for HIV infected patients with TB.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from resource-poor communities in Durban, South Africa.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TB is the most common serious infectious complication associated with HIV in sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa and is also the most common cause of death among HIV infected patients in developing&#xD;
      countries. Furthermore, TB in an HIV infected person accelerates the progression of HIV&#xD;
      disease and hastens death. This study will evaluate a combined TB and antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment (ART) strategy utilizing DOT in HIV infected people coinfected with TB. This study&#xD;
      will compare two treatment strategies: TB and HIV medications given concurrently (integrated&#xD;
      arm) and TB treatment completed first, followed by HIV treatment (sequential arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts. The entire study will last 24 months after participants have been&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two arms. Arm 1 (integrated arm) participants will receive&#xD;
      didanosine (ddI), efavirenz (EFV), and lamivudine (3TC) once daily concurrent with standard&#xD;
      TB therapy. ART and TB medications will be provided through DOT on weekdays; participants&#xD;
      will take their medications without DOT on weekends. Arm 1 participants will also attend four&#xD;
      15- to 20-minute sessions of an adherence study program at study start, Week 2, Month 2, and&#xD;
      1 to 3 weeks prior to the end of TB therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 (sequential arm) participants will first receive DOT-provided TB treatment alone. After&#xD;
      completion of TB treatment, participants will receive ddI, EFV, and 3TC once daily without&#xD;
      DOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits in the first part of the study will occur at screening, study start, Weeks 1, 2,&#xD;
      and 3, and every month until the end of the first part of the study at Month 12. Study visits&#xD;
      will include blood collection, medical and medication history assessment, a physical exam,&#xD;
      and pill counts. Patients will be asked to complete an adherence questionnaire at every study&#xD;
      visit and a sexual behavior survey and quality of life questionnaire at study start and Month&#xD;
      6.&#xD;
