      This study will identify the regions of the brain that are involved in personality trait&#xD;
      knowledge-that is, what a person knows about aspects of personality such as &quot;generous,&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;honest,&quot; and others. It will also examine brain areas relating to a person's knowledge of&#xD;
      how likeable those personality traits are, being familiar with the traits, and the degree of&#xD;
      associating such traits with one's self. There has not been any previous study, through&#xD;
      modern imaging techniques, on the location of the brain and the concepts of personality&#xD;
      traits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients ages 21 to 65 who are in good health, are right handed, and native speakers of&#xD;
      English may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women are not eligible. There will be 200&#xD;
      participants involved in pencil-and-paper or computer tasks. Also, there will be three&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments with 32 participants. Patients may&#xD;
      participate in up to three fMRI experiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through NIH's Normal Control Database. They would need to have had&#xD;
      a neuroexamination conducted by an NIH doctor within the last year. Patients will be&#xD;
      interviewed for any medical, neurological, or psychological condition that would make it&#xD;
      difficult to read the fMRI results. Depending on the studies that patients take part in, they&#xD;
      will have different questionnaires to complete. They may also perform a computerized test&#xD;
      that measures word associations. These tests will take about 1 to 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body&#xD;
      organs and tissues. During the initial MRI scan, patients will lie still on a table that will&#xD;
      slide into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner not longer than 2&#xD;
      hours. During the procedure, they may be asked to lie as still as possible for up to 1 hour&#xD;
      at a time. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping sounds, and&#xD;
      they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate with the&#xD;
      MRI staff at all times during the scan, and they may ask to be moved out of the machine at&#xD;
      any time. Then the functional MRI (fMRI) scan will involve taking pictures of the brain while&#xD;
      patients are performing tasks. All the tasks will be explained, and patients will have the&#xD;
      chance to practice them before entering the scanner. For this activity, patients will be&#xD;
      asked to make decisions about what they are seeing in the tasks presented to them. They will&#xD;
      decide &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; by pressing a left or right button. This scan will take about 1 hour.&#xD;
      Afterward, patients may be asked to fill out written questionnaires or to perform reaction&#xD;
      time tasks by using a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, it is hoped that&#xD;
      information gained will enhance researchers' understanding about which areas of the brain are&#xD;
      necessary to perform certain tasks.&#xD;

      Objective. The purpose of the protocol is to identify the brain regions involved in&#xD;
      personality trait knowledge, associated affective valence and person-trait associations. We&#xD;
      propose using parametric event-related fMRI in addition to classical reaction time measures,&#xD;
      to answer the question of whether a specialized neural system is involved in semantic&#xD;
      processing of personality trait concepts. We will apply methods that have been used in&#xD;
      previous investigations to identify category-specific semantic (meaning) systems for living&#xD;
      and non-living objects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population. Healthy, normal adult, right-handed volunteers will be studied during&#xD;
      functional neuroimaging and in behavioral pre-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Behavioral pre-tests (N=200 subjects) are used to obtain psycholinguistic stimulus&#xD;
      parameters used in the fMRI experiments. Three parametric event-related functional MRI&#xD;
      experiments (for a total of 104 subjects) using personality trait concept words as main input&#xD;
      stimuli will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures. The data collected will consist of questionnaire results, behavioral&#xD;
      measures of cognitive performance and corresponding fMRI images. The results gained from this&#xD;
      protocol will be of value in advancing the neuroscience of person perception and social&#xD;
      cognition.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all the studies, subjects will consist of healthy, native English-speaking, right-handed&#xD;
        volunteers, as measured by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldfield, 1971). Subjects&#xD;
        will range in age from 21 to 65 years old and they will be included regardless of race and&#xD;
        gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-native English speakers and non-right handers will be excluded as mentioned above, as&#xD;
        will non-neurologically normal volunteers. Subjects younger than 21 and older than 65 will&#xD;
        be excluded. A urine pregnancy test will be employed with all women of childbearing age no&#xD;
        more than 24 hours prior to the MRI. The results must be negative in order to proceed with&#xD;
        the MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with any of the following: aneurysm clip; implanted neural stimulator;&#xD;
        implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto-defibrillator; cochlear implant; ocular foreign body,&#xD;
        e.g. metal shavings; permanent eyeliner; insulin pump; or irremovable body piercing will be&#xD;
        excluded from the study due to the possible dangerous effects of the magnet upon metal&#xD;
        objects in the body. Participants taking central nervous system active medications will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
