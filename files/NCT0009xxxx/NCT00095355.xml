      This study will examine whether lithium carbonate, given alone or with divalproex, increases&#xD;
      the amount of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the spinal fluid of patients with&#xD;
      Huntington's disease (HD), a hereditary disorder of the central nervous system. Patients with&#xD;
      this fatal degenerative disease have lower amounts of substances in the brain and spinal&#xD;
      fluid called trophic or growth factors. One of these factors is BDNF. A possible treatment&#xD;
      for HD may be to increase the levels of BDNF. Lithium carbonate, a drug used to treat bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, and divalproex, a drug used to treat mood disorders and seizure disorders, have&#xD;
      both been shown to increase the amount of BDNF protein in laboratory studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 to 70 years old with a DNA-confirmed diagnosis of Huntington's disease may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical&#xD;
      examination, neurological evaluation, blood and urine tests, and electrocardiogram (EKG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take lithium carbonate with and without divalproex. They also receive placebo&#xD;
      (an inactive substance) for portions of the study. On the first day of the study, patients&#xD;
      are given a supply of pills with instructions on how to take them. Blood pressure and pulse&#xD;
      are measured, and blood and urine tests may be done. Patients are evaluated with standardized&#xD;
      tests and scales for assessment of various aspects of HD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic once a week for follow-up evaluations, including blood and&#xD;
      urine tests, physical examinations, disease assessments, and a review of medication side&#xD;
      effects. Each week, they receive a new supply of medications and instructions on how to take&#xD;
      them. At the end of the sixth week, they finish taking the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, patients undergo three lumbar punctures (spinal taps) - at weeks 2, 4, and&#xD;
      6 - to measure BDNF and various other brain chemicals. For this test, a local anesthetic is&#xD;
      given and a needle is inserted in the space between the bones in the lower back where the CSF&#xD;
      circulates below the spinal cord. A small amount of fluid is collected through the needle.&#xD;
      The procedure generally takes from 5 to 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the clinic 2 weeks after completing the study medication for a final&#xD;
      evaluation, including a physical examination and blood and urine tests.&#xD;

      Objective: The overall objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of lithium&#xD;
      alone and/ or in combination with divalproex on markers of neuroprotective activity in&#xD;
      patients with Huntington's disease (HD). It is hypothesized that at safe and tolerable doses&#xD;
      these drugs will enhance depleted levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a&#xD;
      neurotrophin which is necessary for the survival of striatal neurons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients suffering from Huntington's disease will be study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The acute effects of lithium and divalproex on surrogate measures of neuroprotective&#xD;
      activity will be evaluated in up to 24 HD patients. The study, lasting approximately 6 weeks,&#xD;
      will be conducted on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: In this proof-of-principle study, efficacy in restoring BDNF concentrations&#xD;
      will be assessed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements. Safety will be monitored by&#xD;
      means of frequent clinical evaluations and laboratory test.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject will have a diagnosis of HD confirmed by DNA testing [prior to enrollment into&#xD;
             the study].&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Only those subjects will be eligible, who with or without a caregiver, can be assumed&#xD;
             to be able to comply with study requirements and to report on their condition by&#xD;
