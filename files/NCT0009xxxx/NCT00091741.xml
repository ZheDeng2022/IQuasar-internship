  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of conducting this already-FDA approved Phase I clinical trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of etanercept (Enbrel) on the response rate in HIV-infected subjects who&#xD;
      have failed to respond to conventional antiretroviral (HAART) therapy and for whom no&#xD;
      alternative therapy exists. The greatest challenge faced by HIV-treating clinicians today is&#xD;
      the management of virologic failure and metabolic complications of anti-HIV treatment.&#xD;
      Treatment failure can occur because of non-compliance, drug discontinuation, lack of drug&#xD;
      potency, inadequate drug plasma concentration or drug resistance. Of these, drug resistance&#xD;
      remains the single most important reason for virological failure and rapidly limits treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;

      I. Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest challenge faced by HIV-treating clinicians today is the management of virologic&#xD;
      failure and metabolic complications of anti-HIV treatment. Treatment failure can occur&#xD;
      because of non-compliance, drug discontinuation, lack of drug potency, inadequate drug plasma&#xD;
      concentration or drug resistance. Of these, drug resistance remains the single most important&#xD;
      reason for virological failure and rapidly limits treatment options. Virus resistance to all&#xD;
      three major antiretroviral drug classes is now being reported even in primary seroconverters.&#xD;
      Although highly-active antiretroviral (ARV) therapy (HAART) has led to a sharp decline in&#xD;
      AIDS-related morbidity and mortality, treatment failure is a common, significant problem and&#xD;
      as many as 50% of patients have detectable plasma HIV RNA despite being on combination ARV&#xD;
      therapy. Salvage therapy is the term commonly used to define the approach taken when previous&#xD;
      anti-HIV treatments fail to achieve desired goals, which include: 1) undetectable viral load;&#xD;
      2) CD4 cell levels below 200 cells/mm3; and, 3) the prevention of HIV disease progression. It&#xD;
      is one of the most difficult situations to face as a patient, and one of the most problematic&#xD;
      challenges for health-care providers. Although this state of treatment failure is sometimes&#xD;
      euphemistically referred to as &quot;management of treatment-experienced patients,&quot; many HIV&#xD;
      positive patients, having already exhausted the benefits of at least a few drug combinations,&#xD;
      think of their next regimen as salvage or &quot;rescue&quot; therapy. Some physicians argue that due to&#xD;
      cross-resistance among different drugs within the same class, people with HIV infection have&#xD;
      only one good shot at treating it, and that any treatment regimen beyond the first is&#xD;
      therefore salvage therapy. Others see salvage therapy as literally the end of the line--when&#xD;
      an individual's HIV has developed extensive resistance to all currently available treatments.&#xD;
      But most providers consider salvage therapy to be somewhere in between these extremes. Data&#xD;
      on salvage therapy mostly comes from anecdotal reports and retrospective cohort studies. With&#xD;
      a paucity of clinical trial data, clinicians are often forced to prescribe unproven regimens&#xD;
      based on what is anticipated about cross-resistance and drug interactions. It is important,&#xD;
      therefore, that new agents and new approaches continue to be developed as an increasing&#xD;
      number of patients in practice have exhausted all treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this study is based upon the existing literature which indicates that many&#xD;
      of the manifestations and subsequent clinical deterioration of HIV-infected individuals are&#xD;
      related to the immune dysfunction seen in HIV disease, many of which are caused by the&#xD;
      overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, most notable of which is the excessive&#xD;
      production of TNF-α. It is further postulated that removal of this TNF-α by a commercially&#xD;
      available TNF-α-binding medication [ENBREL (etanercept)] may provide therapeutic benefit for&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients who have failed to respond to standard antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Goal and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the project is to assess the safety profile and efficacy of a soluble p75&#xD;
      tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor: Fc fusion protein (Enbrel; Amgen, (etanercept) Thousand&#xD;
      Oaks, CA) [i.e. anti TNF-α] on the response rate of &quot;salvage patients&quot; who are in virologic&#xD;
      failure and who have failed to respond to standard antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in CD4 T-cell enumeration, viral load, and soluble immune activation markers in&#xD;
           HIV-infected patients from baseline to week 24 following treatment with anti-TNF-α.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety and tolerability of anti-TNF-α with respect to treatment-limiting symptoms and&#xD;
           laboratory adverse events through week 24.&#xD;
