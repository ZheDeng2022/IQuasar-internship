      This study will examine whether the anti-diabetes medicine rosiglitazone can safely and&#xD;
      effectively reverse the early problems of type 2 diabetes and delay the onset of disease in&#xD;
      people with pre-diabetes. The underlying problem in people with diabetes or pre-diabetes is&#xD;
      insulin resistance (lowered sensitivity to insulin) resulting in poor glucose (sugar)&#xD;
      regulation. Rosiglitazone improves the body's sensitivity to insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 21 years of age and older who have type 2 diabetes or who are pre-diabetic (glucose&#xD;
      intolerant/insulin resistant) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a&#xD;
      medical history, physical examination, blood tests, echocardiography (heart ultrasound),&#xD;
      exercise test, brachial artery reactivity test (see below), and possibly a muscle biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants take one rosiglitazone tablet daily by mouth for 2 weeks. The dose is then&#xD;
      increased to two tablets daily for another 2 weeks and then to 4 tablets daily for the&#xD;
      remainder of the 12-week treatment period. In addition to treatment, patients undergo the&#xD;
      following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resting and exercise metabolic testing: The amount of oxygen taken in and carbon dioxide&#xD;
           exhaled during breathing is measured while the patient rests in a chair and then while&#xD;
           he or she exercises on a stationary bicycle or treadmill. Both at rest and during&#xD;
           exercise, the patient wears a facemask that measures the amount of oxygen used. During&#xD;
           exercise, heart rate is monitored with electrodes on the chest, arms, and thighs. The&#xD;
           exercise test is repeated three times, once to become familiar with the test, again the&#xD;
           next day to measure exercise capacity, and again 3 days later. The third test is less&#xD;
           strenuous and is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Muscle biopsy (optional): A small area of skin over a calf muscle is numbed with a local&#xD;
           anesthetic and a 1-inch incision is made over the muscle. A small amount of muscle&#xD;
           tissue is taken and the incision is closed with stitches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial reactivity study: This ultrasound study tests how well the patient's arteries&#xD;
           widen. The subject rests on a bed for 30 minutes. An ultrasound measuring device is&#xD;
           placed over the artery just above the elbow. The size of the artery and blood flow&#xD;
           through it are measured before and after inflating a pressure cuff around the forearm.&#xD;
           The pressure cuff stops the flow of blood to the arm for a few minutes. After a&#xD;
           15-minute rest, a nitroglycerin tablet (medicine that causes blood vessels to relax) is&#xD;
           placed under the patient's tongue. Before and 3 minutes after the nitroglycerin is&#xD;
           given, the size of the artery and blood flow through it are measured again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples: Blood samples are collected at the beginning and end of the study and at&#xD;
           study visits in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study visits: Patients come to the Clinical Center biweekly or monthly for a follow-up&#xD;
           history, physical examination, and blood tests. At the end of the3-month treatment&#xD;
           period, they receive recommendations about possible treatment modifications to best&#xD;
           maintain glucose tolerance. Their physicians are informed of how their blood sugar was&#xD;
           controlled. Six months after completing the study, patients undergo a final study&#xD;
           evaluation and blood tests, and are then invited to return for yearly checkups after&#xD;
           that.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The majority of insulin resistant individuals (predominantly individuals with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      - T2DM) develop a disproportionate incidence of cardiovascular disease burden including&#xD;
      hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and heart failure. The&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology is multifactorial but is primarily driven by insulin-resistance&#xD;
      mediated regulatory events. These include augmented oxidative stress, upregulation of&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic signaling pathways, detrimental effects of advanced&#xD;
      glycosylation end-products and perturbations in lipid and fatty acid metabolism. Evidence is&#xD;
      emerging to support a role of perturbed mitochondrial respiratory regulation and subsequent&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction as early events in the insulin-resistance syndrome. These in turn,&#xD;
      are proposed to result in the subsequent development of the cardiovascular clinical sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last few years, pharmacologic compounds have been developed that directly modulate&#xD;
      insulin resistance/sensitivity. Activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor&#xD;
      (PPAR) family of transcription factors has been shown to augment insulin sensitivity. Agents&#xD;
      that activate numerous PPAR family members, i.e. pan-PPAR agonists and PPAR gamma (PPAR&#xD;
      gamma) specific agonists, promote improved insulin sensitivity. Whether these compounds&#xD;
      modify the underlying mitochondrial and endothelial pathophysiology, with the potential of&#xD;
      preventing progression of cardiovascular disease in insulin-resistant subjects has not been&#xD;
      systematically investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis intrinsic to this proposal is that PPAR activation will improve mitochondrial&#xD;
      respiratory and endothelial cell function in parallel with improved insulin sensitization in&#xD;
      insulin-resistant and T2DM subjects. The primary objective of this study is to establish the&#xD;
      effects of the PPAR gamma agonist (rosiglitazone) on exercise-modulated&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary-metabolic function (functional measures of mitochrondrial respiratory&#xD;
      function) in insulin resistant and T2DM subjects that are either naive to hypoglycemic&#xD;
      therapy or are on current therapy with other established classes on anti-diabetic agents with&#xD;
      or without associated cardiovascular disease. As secondary end points we will evaluate&#xD;
      numerous biological assays of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, endothelial function&#xD;
      and changes in parameters of insulin sensitivity. These include: 1) skeletal muscle&#xD;
      mitochondrial respiration, 2) skeletal muscle expression profiles of genes encoding&#xD;
      mitochondrial biogenesis program and mitochondrial respiratory control, 3) brachial artery&#xD;
      reactivity, 4) endothelial progenitor cell number and colony-forming capacity, 5) monocyte&#xD;
      gene expression profiling to evaluate insulin and inflammatory-mediator regulatory events and&#xD;
      6) serological evaluation in change in insulin sensitivity and inflammation. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a phase II clinical trial where subjects will receive rosiglitazone for three&#xD;
      months duration. Baseline and 3 month laboratory studies will include: 1) rest and exercise&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary metabolic testing; 2) skeletal muscle biopsy for mitochondrial function and&#xD;
      gene expression profiling analysis, 3) brachial artery reactivity testing and 4) serological&#xD;
      and blood cell sampling to determine biochemical, cellular and genomic perturbations in&#xD;
      response to insulin-sensitization therapy in this cohort.&#xD;
