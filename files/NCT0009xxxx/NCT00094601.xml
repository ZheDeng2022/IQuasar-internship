      This study will examine how the brain chemical dopamine affects memory, reasoning, and other&#xD;
      thought processes in people with Parkinson's disease with and without dementia and in healthy&#xD;
      control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with Parkinson's disease who are between 40 and 85 years&#xD;
      of age may be eligible for this study. Pregnant women with Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      breastfeeding normal volunteers are excluded. Candidates are screened with a physical and&#xD;
      neurological examination, blood tests, a brief mental test called the Mini Mental Status&#xD;
      Examination, and other tests designed to assess memory, learning, reasoning, and other&#xD;
      thought processes. Patients with Parkinson's disease also undergo a more thorough mental&#xD;
      evaluation called the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale. The study requires about 15 hours over 4&#xD;
      or 5 outpatient visits to NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo two positron emission tomography (PET) scans on two separate days and a&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two PET procedures are done the same way, except one uses a radioactive tracer called&#xD;
      [(18)F]DOPA and one uses a tracer called [(11)C]NNC-112. A catheter (small plastic tube) is&#xD;
      placed in a vein in the subject's arm for injection of the tracer. The subject lies on the&#xD;
      scanner bed and a special mask is fitted to his or her head to hold it in place during the&#xD;
      procedure. Just before injecting the tracer, a 10-minute &quot;transmission scan&quot; is done of the&#xD;
      head using a tracer called (68)Ge. Then, a series of scans using one of the two study tracers&#xD;
      ([(18)F]DOPA or [(11)C]NNC-112 are done for about 90 minutes. About 1 hour before injection&#xD;
      of the [(18)F]DOPA tracer, subjects take 200 mg of the drug carbidopa by mouth to help the&#xD;
      tracer work properly. Blood pressure, breathing and heart are monitored before and after&#xD;
      injection of the [(11)C]NNC-112 tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Parkinson's disease are taken off all Parkinson's medications the night before&#xD;
      the [(18)F]DOPA scan and their motor function is tested the following morning before the&#xD;
      scans are done, using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Patients can resume all&#xD;
      medications except L-DOPA (including Sinemet) after the movement test, and they can resume&#xD;
      L-DOPA after the PET scan is finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of the brain. The subject&#xD;
      lies still on a table that slides inside the scanner, a metal cylinder. They wear ear plugs&#xD;
      to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scanning and can communicate with the&#xD;
      MRI staff at any time through an intercom.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, particularly in the elderly&#xD;
      population. PD is characterized primarily by motor impairment, but cognitive impairment is&#xD;
      common and dementia may occur in about 30% of patients. The pathological hallmark of PD is&#xD;
      the selective degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons and the appearance of&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy Bodies. Dopaminergic dysfunction has been widely&#xD;
      demonstrated in PD patients. Reductions in [18F]FDOPA uptake has been consistently observed&#xD;
      in PD, although it remains to be established whether there are relative differences between&#xD;
      PD with and without dementia, and its association with cognitive function. Furthermore, data&#xD;
      relating to dopamine D1 receptors in PD are limited to post mortem studies and imaging with&#xD;
      the D1 tracer [11C]SCH 23390, and little is known about the role of D1 receptors in vivo and&#xD;
      how it relates to clinical phenomena. The aim of the current study is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and usefulness of imaging of the dopamine D1 receptor and dopamine terminal&#xD;
      function in vivo, using PET (positron emission tomography) in patients with PD, with and&#xD;
      without dementia, and to assess changes in presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic markers&#xD;
      in PD. The long-term goal of the present study is to further our understanding of the role of&#xD;
      the dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of PD and its relationship with cognitive and&#xD;
      motor deficits of PD. Knowledge gained from the present study may assist in the development&#xD;
      of novel therapeutic targets for PD.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        PD patients must meet the diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis will be&#xD;
        based upon the presence of at least two of the four cardinal symptoms (tremor,&#xD;
        bradykinesia, rigidity and instability) as well as a positive response to dopaminergic&#xD;
        agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will be on stable dopaminergic therapy for approximately two weeks prior to&#xD;
        enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Control subjects must be healthy and aged 40 - 85 years and will be age and gender matched&#xD;
        to PD patients.&#xD;
