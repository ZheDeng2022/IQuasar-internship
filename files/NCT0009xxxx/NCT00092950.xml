    <textblock>
      This 2-part study will examine how much exercise people usually do in the course of their&#xD;
      daily lives and how two different types of exercise-stretching and walking-affect the amount&#xD;
      of fat in the body and certain hormones in the blood. It will also examine whether exercise&#xD;
      can be increased by physician counseling with and without the use of a pedometer, and if&#xD;
      exercising changes levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breast cancer survivors and women at high risk for breast cancer who are between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years of age and who exercise less than 3 times per week may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, and their endurance&#xD;
      and flexibility are tested by stretching exercises and by a 6-minute walk or run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants complete study Part 1. Those who are eligible may also participate in Part&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 1: Subjects wear a pedometer (a small device that measures the number of steps&#xD;
           taken) on their waistband during all waking hours for 1 week without changing their&#xD;
           usual level of activity. Depending on their level of activity, subjects may be invited&#xD;
           to participate in Part 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 2: Subjects are placed in either a walking group or a stretching group for 12&#xD;
           weeks. At the end of the 12-week period, those in the walking group are offered&#xD;
           participation in the stretching group, and those in the stretching group are offered&#xD;
           participation in the walking group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Walking group participants wear a pedometer every day for 12 weeks. They are asked to&#xD;
      gradually increase the number of steps they take each day, to keep a record of their daily&#xD;
      step count, and to report periodically to the study staff on their progress. For 1 week&#xD;
      during the study, participants also wear a device called an accelerometer that is used to&#xD;
      verify the accuracy of the pedometer step counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stretching group participants follow a program of stretching exercises for 12 weeks, with&#xD;
      their progress monitored periodically by staff. During week 12, participants wear a pedometer&#xD;
      and accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Part 2 participants also have the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw: collected at the beginning and end of the study to test for certain hormones&#xD;
           and HDL cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires: about stress, anxiety, and depression levels; these are completed at the&#xD;
           beginning and end of the study, and a detailed questionnaire about diet is completed at&#xD;
           home or during a clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition measurement: A &quot;bioelectrical impedance&quot; test, which measures body fat,&#xD;
           is done at the beginning and end of the study. For this test, the subject lies on an&#xD;
           examining table and a small electrical current is passed through electrodes placed on&#xD;
           one hand and one foot. Although a small electrical current is used, this test is not&#xD;
           painful.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endurance and flexibility testing: At the end of the study, participants repeat the&#xD;
           6-minute walk or run endurance test and the stretching flexibility test performed at&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence suggests that high levels of physical activity can decrease breast cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity could therefore represent a viable breast cancer prevention strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk, we must first&#xD;
      develop feasible and efficacious physical activity interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the rate of compliance with a physical activity intervention using a pedometer,&#xD;
      a physician prescription, and a motivational booklet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether this intervention is more effective than a control of stretching&#xD;
      exercises at increasing physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether physical activity as measured by a pedometer correlates with other&#xD;
      measures of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of the physical activity intervention on serum biomarkers, quality of&#xD;
      life, functional capacity and body composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine long-term compliance with a program of increased physical activity and assess post&#xD;
      program exercise motivation and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are women age 18-75 who meet one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of breast cancer without evidence of recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gail model 5 year risk greater than 1.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Claus model lifetime risk greater than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of appropriately treated DCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of high risk lesion on breast biopsy (ADH, ALH, LCIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known or suspected BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must be sedentary at baseline and must be medically fit to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized pilot study designed to assess the feasibility of a physical activity&#xD;
      intervention in breast cancer survivors and women at high risk for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I: Patients undergo a baseline activity evaluation for one week which involves wearing&#xD;
      a sealed pedometer - those that have an average daily step count of less than 5,000 steps are&#xD;
      eligible for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: Patients are assigned to either a walking intervention, (including a pedometer, a&#xD;
      physician exercise prescription with a final goal of walking 10,000 steps per day, and a&#xD;
      motivational booklet) or a control of stretching exercise for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers, functional capacity, body composition and diet are assessed at the beginning and&#xD;
      end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study plans to randomize 80 subjects, and has a greater than 90% power to detect a mean&#xD;
      increase of 3,000 steps per day in intervention subjects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        This study will enroll 40 breast cancer survivors and 40 women at high risk for breast&#xD;
        cancer. All participants must fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age 18 to 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sedentary at baseline, as defined by a weekly leisure-time activity score of 15 or less on&#xD;
        the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. This cutoff is equivalent to engaging in&#xD;
        moderate activity less than 3 times a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to complete all study questionnaires, or a willing friend or family member who will&#xD;
        assist in questionnaire completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ECOG performance status 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to successfully perform the level of physical activity prescribed by the protocol,&#xD;
        as assessed by the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any participant who answers yes to any of the questions in this screening tool will undergo&#xD;
        medical evaluation at the Clinical Center, as appropriate, prior to enrolling on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cardiac risk will be assessed after a complete history and physical exam, and will be&#xD;
        determined by the examining physician. Only patients who are felt to be increased cardiac&#xD;
        risk will have an EKG performed. This will include patients who answer yes to any of the&#xD;
        questions on the PAR-Q that assess cardiac risk (#1,2,3,4,6). Patients with worrisome EKG&#xD;
        findings or findings in the history or physical exam that warrant further work-up in the&#xD;
        opinion of the health care provider will be referred to the cardiology consult service, or&#xD;
        if non-urgent, will be referred back to their source of regular medical care for clearance&#xD;
        prior to enrolling on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        If history of cancer (other than invasive breast cancer, squamous or basal cell skin&#xD;
        cancers), subject must have no evidence of disease at time of enrollment AND no history of&#xD;
        cancer directed treatment in the 2 years preceding enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Breast cancer survivors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligible breast cancer survivors will be women with a documented history of Stage I, II or&#xD;
        III invasive breast cancer who are at least two months from the completion of their primary&#xD;
        therapy, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Current use of hormonal therapy&#xD;
        such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, will be permitted, however subjects must have&#xD;
        completed 2 months of hormonal therapy prior to beginning the study in order to achieve&#xD;
        steady state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women at high risk for breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women will be considered at high risk for developing breast cancer if they fulfill one of&#xD;
        the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A Gail model risk of greater than or equal to1.7 percent over 5 years from study entry or a&#xD;
        Claus model lifetime risk of greater than 20 percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Lobular neoplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Atypical ductal hyperplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that has been previously treated. Patients must be at least&#xD;
        2 months from completion of primary therapy, and if treated with hormonal therapy, they&#xD;
        must have completed at least two months of hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Deleterious mutations in BRCA-1 or 2 OR A priori risk assessment of 20 percent chance or&#xD;
        greater of carrying a BRCA1/2 gene mutation. The BRCAPRO model (109) will be used to assess&#xD;
        this risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period. Pregnancy will&#xD;
        be assessed in women of childbearing potential prior to enrolling in stage II of the study.&#xD;
        Postmenopausal women and women who have had a previous hysterectomy, oophorectomy or tubal&#xD;
        ligation will not be required to undergo a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to: ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, recent myocardial infarction or stroke, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
        situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Physical conditions that preclude the amount of daily walking prescribed by the protocol&#xD;
        (e.g., severe arthritis, use of a walker or cane, wheelchair-bound, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical or psychiatric disorder which would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
        render the subject unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with metastatic or recurrent disease will be excluded because of difficulty&#xD;
        interpreting results in the context of women with a disease burden and/or on chemotherapy.&#xD;
