  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased numbers of white blood cells called eosinophils can cause disease. To investigate&#xD;
      this disease, researchers need blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, skin and/or&#xD;
      bone marrow samples to compare to samples from patients with this problem. Some of the&#xD;
      samples will be used for genetic testing or future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will last for about 10 years and will include a maximum of 50 paid volunteers ages&#xD;
      18 to 65.&#xD;

      This protocol is designed to provide blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid, skin&#xD;
      biopsy and bone marrow aspirate samples from paid, volunteer donors for use in in vitro&#xD;
      studies of eosinophilia and parasitic diseases. Donors meeting standard normal donor&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be recruited to donate blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid, skin biopsy and/or bone marrow using conventional techniques. The investigational&#xD;
      nature of the studies in which their samples will be used, as well as the risks and benefits&#xD;
      of the donation process will be explained to all donors, and a signed informed consent&#xD;
      document will be obtained. Donors will be compensated according to an established schedule&#xD;
      based on the duration and discomfort of the donation. Samples provided through this protocol&#xD;
      will be used solely for in vitro research. Blood, urine, sputum, stool, cerebrospinal fluid,&#xD;
      skin biopsy and bone marrow samples will be assigned a unique product number, and the study&#xD;
      investigators listed on this protocol will serve as the custodians of the code that links the&#xD;
      product with a donor s identity. The nature of the in vitro studies in which the specimens&#xD;
      collected in this study will be used is not the subject of this protocol and will be&#xD;
      described in general terms only, since it involves several IRB-approved LPD protocols.&#xD;
      Because some of these protocols require normal controls without a history of asthma or&#xD;
      allergic disease, all subjects will undergo a standardized allergy/asthma history at&#xD;
      enrollment. Serum immunoglobulin levels and a basic RAST panel may be performed on sera from&#xD;
      some normal donors, and some normal donors may be asked to undergo pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing. This protocol is designed to assure adequate and complete informed consent,&#xD;
      counseling, and protection of the study subjects according to IRB, OHSR, OPRR and other&#xD;
      applicable Federal regulatory standards.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        -  Eligibility criteria for volunteer whole blood donation are based on the Standards of&#xD;
             the AABB(2) and the Code of Federal Regualtions 21 CFR 640(3). Specific criteria&#xD;
             follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (blood, urine, stool and/or sputum donation):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ability to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy, male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-85 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (blood, urine, stool and/or sputum donation):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  weight &lt;110 pounds&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  history of heart, lung, kidney disease, chronic anemia or bleeding disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        Eligibility criteria for volunteer bone marrow, skin and cerebrospinal fluid donation are&#xD;
        more stringent than those for other specimen donations to minimize risk of procedure&#xD;
        complications and maximize utility of specimens for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA (bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and/or skin donation):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ability to sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  healthy, male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-85 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  willingness to provide concurrent blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid and/or skin donation):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a known bleeding disorder, low platelets (&lt;100k) or taking medications that interfere&#xD;
             with blood clotting, such as aspirin, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents or&#xD;
             warfarin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  anemia (hemoglobin less than 12.3 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  evidence of an immune deficiency, such as HIV infection or cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  taking a medication that affects the immune response within the past month, including&#xD;
             oral, intravenous, or injectable steroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  allergic to xylocaine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have taken an investigational drug in the last 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any other medical condition that the investigator feels puts the participant at too&#xD;
             high a risk for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  warfarin and/or heparin treatment will not be stopped so that a subject can&#xD;
                  participate in this protocol. If warfarin or heparin was recently discontinued, a&#xD;
                  subject can be enrolled, but no bone marrow procedures will be performed until&#xD;
                  the PT is &lt; 15.5 seconds and the PTT is within normal range. For other agents&#xD;
                  that interfere with blood clotting without prolonging the PT, a 7- day washout&#xD;
                  period will be required before bone marrow sampling, skin biopsy or lumbar&#xD;
                  puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additonal exclusion criteria (cerebrospinal fluid):&#xD;

        -Previous diagnosis of central nervous system pathology (including tumors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        inflammatory conditions, infection, seizure disorder, spina bifida)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of spinal surgery with hardware placement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any spinal surgery or injections of the lumbosacral spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Headache on the day of donation&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additonal exclusion criteria (skin biopsy):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -History of keloid or abnormal scar formation&#xD;
