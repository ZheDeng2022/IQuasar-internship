  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, randomized, multicenter study designed to compare the efficacy&#xD;
      of 12 weeks of subcutaneously administered efalizumab (monotherapy) with that of combination&#xD;
      therapy (Efalizumab and a topical corticosteroid ointment) in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of 30 months of continuous efalizumab treatment in those subjects&#xD;
      who derive benefit from the initial 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
