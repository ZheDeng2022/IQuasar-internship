  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Elevated eosinophil levels can damage the heart,&#xD;
      nerves, and other organs, in the syndrome known as hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Some&#xD;
      individuals have a hereditary form of HES known as familial eosinophilia (FE). More research&#xD;
      on the causation and mechanisms of HES is needed in order to design more effective and less&#xD;
      toxic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate FE and its genetic causes, damage mechanisms, and disease markers&#xD;
      (such as blood test abnormalities). It will enroll approximately 50 individuals (both adults&#xD;
      and children) from a previously studied family with FE. This is a long-term study of&#xD;
      indefinite duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo yearly clinical examinations including medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, bloodwork, EKG, echocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests, with additional or&#xD;
      more frequent examinations and tests as required. In addition, participants will donate blood&#xD;
      and tissue for research purposes. Both adult and child participants will donate blood. At the&#xD;
      initial evaluation, adult participants will donate bone marrow. During the study, some adult&#xD;
      participants will also undergo a limited number of leukaopheresis sessions, in which blood is&#xD;
      donated from one arm, the blood is separated into red blood cells and other components, and&#xD;
      the red blood cells are returned into the donor's other arm.&#xD;

      Affected and unaffected members of families with familial hypereosinophilia (FE) will be&#xD;
      admitted on this protocol. For affected family members, a thorough clinical evaluation will&#xD;
      be performed every 2 years with emphasis on potential sequelae of eosinophil-mediated tissue&#xD;
      damage. Blood cells, bone marrow and/or serum will also be collected to provide reagents&#xD;
      (such as DNA, RNA, and specific antibodies) for use in the laboratory to address issues&#xD;
      related to the genetic and immunologic basis of FE as well as its pathogenesis. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that affected family members will undergo a more extensive evaluation than is&#xD;
      generally available and that the specimens collected from them will prove to be valuable&#xD;
      reagents for laboratory studies related to eosinophilia, eosinophil activation and function.&#xD;
      While the study is not designed to address the question of therapy for FE, in patients for&#xD;
      whom medical therapy is indicated (for either the hypereosinophilia itself or its sequelae),&#xD;
      appropriate treatment will be instituted by our clinical service or the patients local&#xD;
      physicians. No experimental chemotherapy is involved in this protocol. Unaffected family&#xD;
      members will provide research specimens on this protocol to help determine the underlying&#xD;
      genetic causes of FE.&#xD;
