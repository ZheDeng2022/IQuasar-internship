  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore how bacteria colonize human teeth and how this process changes over&#xD;
      the lifetime of individuals. It will include an investigation of transmission of bacteria&#xD;
      that initiate colonization between adults and from adults to infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selected NIH scientists and members of their immediate families, including infants, are&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants provide a small sample of saliva and a sample of&#xD;
      bacteria collected by rubbing a cotton swab over the surfaces of the lower four incisors.&#xD;
      Adults collect and submit their own specimens; a dentist collects specimens from children.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interactions between different bacteria play an important role in biofilm development during&#xD;
      primary colonization of the human tooth surface. Well studied examples of such interactions&#xD;
      include the receptor polysaccharide (RPS)-mediated interactions between viridans group&#xD;
      streptococci and other oral bacteria including type 2 fimbriated Actinomyces naeslundii.&#xD;
      Previous studies have resulted in the identification of different structural, antigenic and&#xD;
      molecular types of RPS on the streptococci that initiate colonization of the tooth surface.&#xD;
      This information provides the basis for the current protocol, which addresses a number of&#xD;
      important questions involving the nature of the commensal relationship that exists between&#xD;
      biofilm-forming bacteria and the host. For example: (1) How many types of RPS are produced by&#xD;
      the resident flora of an individual at any one time? (2) Does the resident population of&#xD;
      RPS-producing clones change over the lifetime of the host? (3) Do individuals produce&#xD;
      secretory antibodies against bacterial RPS, and if so, does this drive a change in the&#xD;
      antigenic type of RPS produced? (3) When and how do infants acquire RPS-producing bacteria,&#xD;
      before or after tooth eruption? To address these questions, we wish to collect and analyze&#xD;
      samples of early dental plaque from the members of individual families. The collection of&#xD;
      such samples will be accomplished by gently rubbing exposed tooth surfaces with a sterile&#xD;
      cotton swab. Adult volunteers will also be asked to provide small samples of saliva, which&#xD;
      will be assayed for the presence of specific anti-RPS antibodies. The sampling procedures&#xD;
      proposed in this protocol do not present any significant risk to either adult or infant&#xD;
      volunteers. The information gained from these studies, although not directly beneficial to&#xD;
      these individuals, is expected to provide important insights into the commensal relationship&#xD;
      that exists between biofilm-forming bacteria and the host. This in turn will contribute to an&#xD;
      improved understanding of variables associated with the maintenance of oral health and the&#xD;
      initiation of disease.&#xD;
