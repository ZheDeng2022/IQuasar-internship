  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of x-rays to&#xD;
      guide angioplasty in patients who require these treatments to treat blockages in leg&#xD;
      arteries. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a balloon is inflated in a blocked artery to&#xD;
      improve blood flow. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves rather than x-rays to show&#xD;
      pictures of body tissues and organs. MRI shows all soft tissue, including the arteries,&#xD;
      blood, and other organs, while the usual x-ray technique shows only the lumen of the artery&#xD;
      when it is filled with dye, but not the vessel walls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older who require angioplasty with or without stenting to&#xD;
      restore blood flow to the leg may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the usual angioplasty procedure. The skin in the patient's groin area is&#xD;
      numbed and a catheter is placed into the groin artery. The patient is given a blood-thinning&#xD;
      medicine, and then other catheters are inserted to measure blood pressure and to inject a&#xD;
      contrast dye to take pictures. Balloon catheters are inflated to open the blockage and, if&#xD;
      needed, stents are put in place to maintain the opening. When the blood thinner wears off,&#xD;
      the catheters are removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the procedure is conducted using MRI instead of X-rays to visualize the arteries and&#xD;
      blockages. The patient is moved back and forth between the x-ray and MRI machines in a&#xD;
      specially designed laboratory. If necessary, stenting, placement of a wire mesh to hold open&#xD;
      the artery, is done using conventional x-ray techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire procedure, including MRI, takes up to 4 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular interventional procedures are minimally-invasive, catheter-based treatments&#xD;
      such as coronary artery angioplasty and stenting. These procedures generally can be conducted&#xD;
      on awake patients with few complications, and were developed as alternatives to conventional&#xD;
      open surgery. Conventional cardiovascular interventional procedures are conducted by&#xD;
      physician manipulating medical devices inside patients under the guidance of fluoroscopic&#xD;
      x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed minimally-invasive cardiovascular interventional procedures using real-time&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging. These procedures have the advantage of excellent imaging without&#xD;
      surgery and without ionizing radiation exposure or toxic contrast agents (dyes). Moreover,&#xD;
      because real time MRI can produce excellent images of soft tissue, blood, and of&#xD;
      three-dimensional structures, it may be possible to guide minimally-invasive procedures not&#xD;
      possible even with invasive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A state-of-the-art combined X-ray and MRI interventional suite has been constructed and&#xD;
      equipped with real-time MRI image reconstruction for interventional experiments, patient&#xD;
      monitoring and transport equipment for dual imaging modalities, and large-mammal preclinical&#xD;
      simulation experiments. Preclinical experiments in a porcine model of surgical aortic&#xD;
      coarctation have shown that real-time MRI guided percutaneous intervention can be conducted&#xD;
      using entirely commercially-available devices approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this protocol is to test clinical peripheral artery revascularization procedures&#xD;
      guided wholly-or in part by real-time MRI.&#xD;
