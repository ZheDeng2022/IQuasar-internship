  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of the drug Replagal for treating&#xD;
      people with Fabry disease, an inherited metabolic disorder. In this disease, an enzyme called&#xD;
      alpha-galactosidase A, which normally breaks down a lipid (fatty substance) known as&#xD;
      ceramidetrihexoside, is missing or does not function properly. As a result, the lipid&#xD;
      accumulates in the body, causing problems with the kidneys, heart, nerves, and blood vessels.&#xD;
      This study will examine whether replacing the missing alpha-galactosidase A with a&#xD;
      genetically engineered form of the enzyme called Replagal can reverse the illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Fabry disease who are 18 years of age or older and have completed 10 weeks of&#xD;
      Replagal therapy as participants in protocol TKT027 may be eligible for this 6-month study&#xD;
      extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous (IV) infusions of Replagal every other week over 25 weeks for a total of 13&#xD;
           infusions, with close monitoring during and after the infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief safety evaluations at the time of each infusion, including a check of vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate, temperature), review of any side effects, and&#xD;
           review of medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comprehensive evaluations at baseline (before starting Replagal therapy), after 13 and&#xD;
           25 weeks of therapy, and 30 days after completing therapy. These include a medical&#xD;
           history and physical examination, symptoms and pain questionnaire, blood and urine&#xD;
           tests, check of vital signs, electrocardiogram (EKG), 2-hour Holter monitor, and sweat&#xD;
           test (QSART).&#xD;

      Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the current standard Replagal treatment regimen of 0.2&#xD;
      mg/kg given intravenously every two weeks over an additional 6 months in patients who have&#xD;
      completed 10 weeks of Replagal therapy in the TKT027 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Hemizygous males with Fabry disease who are 18 years of age or older who&#xD;
      have completed 10 weeks of Replagal therapy in TKT027.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is an open-label, multi-center study that will assess the safety of 0.2 mg/kg&#xD;
      every two weeks of enzyme replacement therapy with Replagal.&#xD;
