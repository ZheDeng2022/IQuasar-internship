      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a two-dose regimen&#xD;
      (Day 0 and Day 28) of recombinant Botulinum Vaccine (rBV) A/B in healthy volunteers when&#xD;
      given intramuscularly at three ascending dosage levels by cohort and a two-dose regimen (Day&#xD;
      0 and Day 28) of a formulation containing only antigens at the 40 ug total immunizing protein&#xD;
      dosage level.&#xD;

      The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed as a single-center, open-label, non-randomized study&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a two-dose schedule of rBV A/B in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers at three ascending dosage levels, 5 ug, 10 ug and 20 ug serotype-specific&#xD;
      antigen (10 ug, 20 ug and 40 ug total immunizing protein) in three dosing cohorts and a&#xD;
      two-dose regimen (Day 0 and Day 28) of a formulation containing only antigens at the 40 ug&#xD;
      total immunizing protein dosage level. Approximately 44 volunteers (11 per cohort) are&#xD;
      expected to be enrolled. Cohorts will enroll consecutively beginning with the lowest dosage&#xD;
      level. Volunteers in each cohort will receive a two injection series at the assigned dosage&#xD;
      level given as a 0.5 mL intramuscular (i.m.) injection on Day 0 and Day 28. Potential&#xD;
      volunteers for study participation will undergo qualification screening for this study during&#xD;
      the 21 days prior to the date scheduled for vaccination. After successful completion of the&#xD;
      informed consent process and all screening assessments, volunteers will be scheduled for&#xD;
      vaccination. Volunteers will report acute adverse events daily for 28 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination and return to the clinic at regular intervals according to the Schedule of Study&#xD;
      Assessments with the last scheduled follow-up 168 days (± 7 days) after the initial&#xD;
      vaccination (Day 0).&#xD;

          -  The volunteer is between 18 to 40 (inclusive) years of age at the time of the first&#xD;
             dose of rBV A/B.&#xD;
&#xD;

             a medical history and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer has clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis laboratory values&#xD;
             within 10 % above the upper or within 10 % below the lower limit of the normal range&#xD;
             as established by the University of Kentucky clinical laboratory which are not&#xD;
             considered clinically significant by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor Medical&#xD;
             Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer has a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). However, if a potential volunteer&#xD;
             is reported to have a benign ECG abnormality (e.g., sinus bradycardia) the results may&#xD;
             be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. With the agreement of the Sponsor&#xD;
             Medical Monitor and documentation of the consultation in the volunteer's study record,&#xD;
             the Investigator may include the volunteer in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer is willing to have his or her blood samples stored for future botulinum&#xD;
             research studies.&#xD;

          -  The volunteer has signed the Informed Consent Form, successfully completed (at least&#xD;
             90 % correct) the Test of Understanding, and has signed the Health Insurance&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The volunteer agrees not to donate blood for at least 30 days following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female volunteers must be of non-childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized&#xD;
             or postmenopausal), or must not be pregnant (as indicated by a negative serum&#xD;

             intrauterine device (IUD) and 2) an additional barrier type of birth control measure&#xD;
             (i.e. condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, spermicide, etc.) during the period&#xD;
             beginning from 30 days before vaccination through completion of the study. Completion&#xD;
