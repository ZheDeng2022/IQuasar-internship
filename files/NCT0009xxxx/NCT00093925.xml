      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of&#xD;
      postoperative hypertension. Approximately 250-500 patients with postoperative hypertension&#xD;
      after undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), off-pump coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      (OPCAB) or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) surgery and/or valve&#xD;
      replacement/repair procedures were anticipated to be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups: clevidipine or nicardipine.&#xD;

      The primary objective was to establish the safety of clevidipine in the treatment of&#xD;
      postoperative hypertension, as assessed by comparing the incidences of death, stroke, MI and&#xD;
      renal dysfunction in the clevidipine and nicardipine treatment groups from the initiation of&#xD;
      study drug infusion through postoperative Day 30. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of study drug, assessed by the blood pressure (BP) lowering effect, and additional&#xD;
      safety variables.&#xD;

    <description>Clevidipine (0.5 mg/mL in 20% lipid emulsion) was initiated after insertion of an arterial line upon the occurrence of postoperative hypertension, as determined by the investigator, and was administered intravenously (IV) at an initial infusion rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min (non weight-based equivalent is 2 mg/h). Clevidipine was titrated to blood pressure lowering effect by doubling increments approximately every 90 seconds up to a maximum infusion rate of 3.2 μg/kg/min (16 mg/h). Infusion rates above 3.2 μg/kg/min were permitted up to the maximum infusion rate of 8.0 μg/kg/min. Treatment was maintained as long as was deemed clinically necessary or until discharge from the ICU. Infusion rates between 4.4 and 8.0 μg/kg/min were to be administered for no more than 2 hours.</description>
