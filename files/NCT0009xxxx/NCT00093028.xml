      The purpose of this study is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to find out the effects of treating patients with two new chemotherapy drugs (bortezomib&#xD;
           and Revlimid™),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study how many patients' myeloma responds to treatment on this study, and how many&#xD;
           patients survive after this treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to learn if a patient's genetic makeup before and after treatment can predict which&#xD;
           patients will respond to bortezomib and Revlimid™, and to learn more about how the body&#xD;
           responds (gene array studies).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two new drugs BORTEZOMIB (Velcade®, PS-341) and REVLIMID (CC-5013) have been shown in recent&#xD;
      studies to be effective in patients with advanced multiple myeloma. This study is being done&#xD;
      to learn more about the best way to administer these drugs, either alone or in combination.&#xD;
      Since it is not known at this time which treatment is the best, participants will be placed&#xD;
      by chance in one of the three treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BORTEZOMIB alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BORTEZOMIB + REVLIMID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BORTEZOMIB in a lower dose + REVLIMID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This chance selection process is called randomization and is often used in research studies.&#xD;
