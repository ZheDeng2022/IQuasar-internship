  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tanespimycin when given with&#xD;
      cytarabine in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, or&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tanespimycin and cytarabine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Tanespimycin may also help cytarabine kill more cancer cells by&#xD;
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving tanespimycin together with cytarabine&#xD;
      may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)&#xD;
      (tanespimycin) when administered with cytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic&#xD;
      myelomonocytic leukemia, or high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine,&#xD;
      preliminarily, the activity of this regimen in these patients. IV. Correlate the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen with cytochrome p450 3A5 genotype in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the effect of this regimen on client proteins in vivo and ex vivo using leukemic&#xD;
      blasts from patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tanespimycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive induction therapy comprising cytarabine intravenously (IV) continuously on&#xD;
      days 1-5 and tanespimycin IV over 1 hour on days 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving a morphologic complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi)&#xD;
      or partial response may be eligible to receive a second induction course of therapy after day&#xD;
      21 at the discretion of the principal investigator. Patients achieving a complete response&#xD;
      (CR) receive up to 4 courses of consolidation therapy with cytarabine and tanespimycin.&#xD;
      Consolidation therapy repeats approximately every 60 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve CR and remain in remission for ≥ 6&#xD;
      months may be retreated with cytarabine and tanespimycin (at the current dose level or the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) at the time of relapse. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of tanespimycin until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose&#xD;
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      are followed at 3 months.&#xD;
