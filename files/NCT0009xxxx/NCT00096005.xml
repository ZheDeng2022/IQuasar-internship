  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving tanespimycin together&#xD;
      with bortezomib in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. (Accrual for&#xD;
      lymphoma patients closed as of 11/27/09) Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as tanespimycin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.&#xD;
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their&#xD;
      growth. It may also increase the effectiveness of tanespimycin by making cancer cells more&#xD;
      sensitive to the drug. Combining tanespimycin with bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin) and bortezomib in patients&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of&#xD;
      11/27/09).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine changes in biomarkers (e.g., HSP70, client proteins, and ubiquitination of&#xD;
      proteins) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumor specimens from patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors or lymphomas (Accrual for Lymphoma Patients Closed as of 11/27/09)&#xD;
      treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine responses in patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the toxic&#xD;
      effects of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours and bortezomib IV over 3-5&#xD;
      seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of&#xD;
      tanespimycin and bortezomib until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is&#xD;
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, at least 12 additional patients are&#xD;
      treated as above* at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: *Bortezomib is not administered on day 1 of course 1 only. Patients are followed at 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
