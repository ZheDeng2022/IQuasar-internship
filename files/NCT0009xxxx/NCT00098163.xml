  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of and immune response to an HIV-1 vaccine,&#xD;
      ALVAC-HIV vCP1521, given to infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers in Uganda.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV can be caused either by perinatal transmission of&#xD;
      HIV or by breastfeeding, a common practice in poorer regions of the world. HIV preventive&#xD;
      vaccines are currently under investigation as potential solutions to worldwide MTCT of HIV.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV-1 vaccine, ALVAC-HIV&#xD;
      vCP1521, in infants born to HIV-1 infected mothers in Uganda. The vaccine is a preparation of&#xD;
      a live attenuated recombinant canarypox virus, encoding HIV clades B and E envelope proteins.&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at Mulago Hospital in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will enroll in this study during their third trimesters of pregnancy. During&#xD;
      screening, mothers will undergo medical history assessment, a physical exam, and blood&#xD;
      collection. After delivery and prior to infant enrollment, mothers will have another physical&#xD;
      exam; mothers and their infants will be accompanied home by a home visitor who will document&#xD;
      contact information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants will be followed for 24 months after birth. Infants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive 4 injections of vaccine or placebo. Study injections will be given at the start of&#xD;
      the study and at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Infants will be observed for 1 hour after each vaccine&#xD;
      administration to check for body temperature and local and systemic reactions. They will also&#xD;
      be evaluated in the clinic the day after each immunization for any local or systemic&#xD;
      reactions. Infants will be visited at home 2 days after vaccine administration by a trained&#xD;
      study nurse who will assess reactogenicity. Blood will be collected at 9 selected times:&#xD;
      study entry, Weeks 2, 6, 10, and 14, and Months 6, 12, 18, and 24. Sixteen study visits&#xD;
      occurring over 2 years will include medical history assessment and physical exams. Childhood&#xD;
      immunizations will be given to infants at study entry and at Weeks 6, 10, and 14 and Months 6&#xD;
      and 12.&#xD;
