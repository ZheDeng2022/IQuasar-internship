    <textblock>
      This trial is a phase II study in patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies&#xD;
      who will be assigned to one of 4 cohorts (normal, mild, moderate and several renal&#xD;
      dysfunction) based on their baseline measured creatinine clearance then treated with FOLFOX4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard bone marrow and liver function inclusion and exclusion criteria must be met prior to&#xD;
      study treatment. FOLFOX4 in the study is given every 2 weeks (1 cycle = 2 weeks) for up to 12&#xD;
      cycles unless there are treatment delays to allow for recovery from toxic effects. Dose&#xD;
      modifications are included for protocol specified toxicities. After 12 treatment cycles on&#xD;
      study, patients who are having a beneficial disease response may continue to have oxaliplatin&#xD;
      supplied off study to continue the treatment regimen until disease progression, prohibitive&#xD;
      toxicity or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxaliplatin pharmacokinetic studies (plasma and urine) are planned during cycles 1 and 2 on&#xD;
      each patient. Creatinine clearance will be assessed every 2 cycles and disease status will be&#xD;
      assessed every 3 cycles of treatment during the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
             metastatic gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have measurable or non-measurable disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy are allowed,&#xD;
             with the exception that patients cannot have had prior treatment with oxaliplatin,&#xD;
             cisplatin or other nephrotoxic anticancer agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had no chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (28 days) prior&#xD;
             to entering the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 or older;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status of 70% or greater for patients with normal or mildly&#xD;
             abnormal renal function and 50% or greater for patients with moderately or severely&#xD;
             abnormal renal function;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt; or = 3000 cells/mm3, ANC &gt; or = 1500 cells/mm3,&#xD;
             platelets &gt; or = 100,000 cells/mm3);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver function (total bilirubin &lt; or =1.5 times the institutional upper limit&#xD;
             of normal (IULN), AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; or = 2 times the IULN, unless liver&#xD;
             metastases are present and documented at baseline by CT or MRI scan (&lt; or = 5 times&#xD;
             IULN in that case), alkaline phosphatase &lt; or = 2 times the IULN, unless liver&#xD;
             metastases are present and documented at baseline by CT or MRI scan (&lt; or = 5 times&#xD;
             IULN in that case));&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have a Grade 1 neurotoxicity at study entry. Absence of deep tendon&#xD;
             reflexes as a sole neurological abnormality does not render the patient ineligible;&#xD;

             study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had prior therapy with oxaliplatin, cisplatin or other nephrotoxic&#xD;
             anticancer agent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to platinum compounds;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents. Patients who received&#xD;
             any investigational drug must have discontinued the investigational drug 30 days or&#xD;

             myocardial infarction &lt; or = 6 months prior to study entry;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases because of their poor prognosis and because they&#xD;
             often develop progressive neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with interstitial pneumonia or extensive and symptomatic fibrosis of the&#xD;
             lungs;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness (high blood pressure, unstable angina&#xD;
