  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is associated with increased risk of death, prolonged stay, higher cost of care, and&#xD;
      likely long-term brain deficits in survivors. This form of brain dysfunction occurs in&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) patients in epidemic proportions, and the scope of this problem is&#xD;
      likely to worsen in upcoming years due to the aging of our population and increased&#xD;
      utilization of the ICU. Currently, delirium goes unrecognized and untreated in the vast&#xD;
      majority of circumstances in the ICU unless the patient presents with hyperactive delirium&#xD;
      and agitation. In the latter circumstance, a commonly used typical antipsychotic called&#xD;
      haloperidol is considered the principal agent for treating delirium based largely on&#xD;
      anecdotal evidence to support its usefulness, though no placebo controlled trials exist.&#xD;
      There are no FDA approved medications for delirium. The atypical antipsychotics provide a&#xD;
      promising alternative for the treatment of delirium due to their enhanced beneficial effects&#xD;
      on positive (agitated) and negative (quiet) symptoms proven in mania and schizophrenia,&#xD;
      reduced risk for side effects common to haloperidol such as extrapyramidal symptomatology,&#xD;
      and less potentially lethal heart rhythm disturbances. It is imperative that well-designed&#xD;
      phase II studies to determine proof of principle be conducted. A pilot study of feasibility&#xD;
      to begin assessing the role of antipsychotics in the management of ICU delirium.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will be the first placebo controlled trial of delirium&#xD;
      prevention/treatment, in or out of the ICU. As mentioned above, clinical practice guidelines&#xD;
      for medical management of pain, anxiety, and delirium (major determinants of patient comfort)&#xD;
      are endorsed by the major critical care societies. These guidelines will form the template&#xD;
      for this investigation. Pain management is prioritized as a clinicians' first concern. The&#xD;
      assessment and treatment algorithm in the guidelines then places anxiety and delirium,&#xD;
      respectively, as sequential tiers of priority. While delirium monitoring is now available,&#xD;
      recent data indicate that less than 5% of practicing ICU healthcare professionals use a&#xD;
      specific delirium monitoring instrument. Thus, as outlined here, most delirium is not&#xD;
      recognized or treated, which serves as the rationale for this placebo-controlled&#xD;
      investigation. Anxiety is currently treated with drugs such as benzodiazepines. Such anxiety,&#xD;
      however, may be due to delirium, in which case treatment with anxiolytics such as&#xD;
      benzodiazepines might exacerbate this form of brain dysfunction. On the other hand, it is&#xD;
      possible that treatment with antipsychotics will reduce the duration and severity of&#xD;
      delirium, result in less breakthrough sedatives (due to the sedating effects of the&#xD;
      antipsychotics), and improve clinical outcomes. Alternatively, treatment with antipsychotics&#xD;
      may not alter or worsen clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine whether antipsychotics reduce the incidence and duration of delirium in&#xD;
      high risk mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine whether antipsychotics reduce the severity of neuropsychological&#xD;
      dysfunction at hospital discharge in high risk mechanically ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Our primary hypothesis is that in mechanically ventilated patients, the&#xD;
      duration of delirium and the days alive and free of delirium - as measured using the&#xD;
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)- will be significantly improved by early&#xD;
      treatment with antipsychotics (haloperidol or ziprasidone) as compared to placebo.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we hypothesize that delirium duration will be comparable between the two&#xD;
      intervention groups (haloperidol and ziprasidone). To test the primary hypothesis, we propose&#xD;
      to perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the prevention/treatment&#xD;
      of delirium in ICU patients using oral liquid formulations of haloperidol versus ziprasidone&#xD;
      versus placebo. This study is powered to show a 50% improvement in the duration of delirium&#xD;
      (CAM-ICU positive days) and will enroll 102 patients (34 in each group) over a two-year&#xD;
      period. In addition, we will compare between groups the overall incidence of delirium and the&#xD;
      number of delirium free days (DFDs) - defined as days alive and free of coma and delirium to&#xD;
      day 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: We hypothesize that scores on a neuropsychological testing battery administered&#xD;
      at the time of hospital discharge will be better in patients treated with antipsychotics&#xD;
      (either haloperidol or ziprasidone) than those treated with placebo. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that neuropsychological test scores will be comparable between the two&#xD;
      intervention groups (haloperidol and ziprasidone).&#xD;
