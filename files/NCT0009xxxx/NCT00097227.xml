    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the combination of cetuximab, carboplatin and&#xD;
      paclitaxel will shrink a specific type of lung cancer known as non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). The safety of this combination will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed for both genders in the United States.&#xD;
      Approximately 173,770 new cases are estimated for 2004. It is the leading cause of cancer&#xD;
      deaths in both men and women, with approximately 160,440 deaths estimated for 2004. Prognosis&#xD;
      for many is poor if not diagnosed at an early stage, and therapy for advanced disease is&#xD;
      limited. The study will test two chemotherapy agents, carboplatin and paclitaxel, in&#xD;
      combination with a newly approved drug called cetuximab, which is continuing to be tested in&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and other cancers. Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody, which is believed to&#xD;
      work by attaching to an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cells and thereby&#xD;
      blocking tumor cells from reproducing. It is an antibody to the EGFR. Fifty percent of lung&#xD;
      cancers overexpress EGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is built upon the data from previous studies, incorporating cetuximab into&#xD;
      each of two regimens of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. The results of prior studies using&#xD;
      paclitaxel and carboplatin demonstrate that these drugs in combination, using a variety of&#xD;
      schedules, are both safe and effective as therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The&#xD;
      addition of biologic therapy with the anti-EGFR agent cetuximab to the combination will&#xD;
      presumably maximize the therapeutic index while keeping toxicity to a minimum in patients&#xD;
      with Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with previously-untreated stage IIIB/IV NSCLC who receive a combination of&#xD;
      paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab will have a progression-free survival rate greater&#xD;
      than that previously reported for subjects receiving the combination of paclitaxel and&#xD;
      carboplatin.&#xD;
