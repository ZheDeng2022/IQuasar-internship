  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients with HIV/AIDS suffer from a dangerous viral infection of the retina (and other&#xD;
      organs) called cytomegalovirus infection (CMV). The medications currently used to treat CMV&#xD;
      all have serious side effects. AIDS patients are prone to this infection because their immune&#xD;
      system produces a lower number of CD4+T lymphocytes, the type of blood cells that fight viral&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some new HIV medications strengthen the immune system. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      possibility that CMV patients on these HIV medications can develop immune systems strong&#xD;
      enough to fight CMV without CMV medication. The study will enroll a maximum of 15 adult&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS patients who have a CD4+T cell count over 150 cells/microliter and who have inactive&#xD;
      CMV retinitis that is not immediately sight threatening. It is expected to last approximately&#xD;
      2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each prospective participant will have a physical examination and complete eye examination,&#xD;
      including retina photographs, with the eye examination and retina photographs repeated 2&#xD;
      weeks later. If there is no evidence of active CMV retinitis, the participant will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, and CMV medication will be stopped. The participant will have physical&#xD;
      and eye examinations every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of the study, and every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      the next 3 months. After 6 months, the frequency of the examinations will be 2-8 weeks,&#xD;
      depending on the participant's CD4 count. After one year, a participant with a CD4 count&#xD;
      remaining over 150 cells/microliter may return to the care of a local ophthalmologist with&#xD;
      HIV/CMV experience, revisiting the clinical center every 6 months. The participant's CMV&#xD;
      medication will be restarted when CMV retinitis becomes active, which will terminate&#xD;
      participation in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine whether elevated CD4 counts resulting from medications&#xD;
      against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are effective in controlling cytomegalovirus (CMV)&#xD;
      retinitis. Patients with non-progressive retinal disease consistent with inactive CMV&#xD;
      retinitis in a location that is not immediately sight threatening, who are currently&#xD;
      receiving systemic maintenance therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir, and who&#xD;
      have a total CD4 cell count greater than 150 cells per microliter will have their anti-CMV&#xD;
      therapy discontinued. Patients will then be closely followed for progression of their CMV&#xD;
      retinitis. The primary endpoint of the study will be progression of CMV retinitis. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will include the occurrence of extraocular CMV disease, morbidity, mortality,&#xD;
      virologic data, and HIV burden.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of AIDS as defined by the Centers for Disease Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inactive, non-sight-threatening CMV retinitis. Non sight-threatening CMV retinitis is&#xD;
        defined as CMV retinitis not within 1000 microns from the optic disc or 1000 microns from&#xD;
        the fovea. Exception: patients with CMV retinitis within 1000 microns of the fovea or disc&#xD;
        in only one eye, if visual acuity in that eye is worse than 20/400 without the use of&#xD;
        eccentric fixation, and visual acuity in the other eye is 20/400 or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CD4 T cell count greater than 150 cells per microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must be able understand the nature of the study, agree to the provision, and&#xD;
        understand and sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women and men age 18 or older are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Platelets greater than 25,000/microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hemoglobin greater than 8.5 gms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Total neutrophil count greater than 750/mm(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Receiving systemic anti-CMV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Receiving anti-HIV therapy. If the patient is receiving IL-2, at least one month from last&#xD;
        infusion must elapse prior to assessment for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intraocular sustained release ganciclovir implant in the eye for less than 9 months, or&#xD;
        other organ involvement from CMV infection requiring use of systemic ganciclovir or&#xD;
        foscarnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CMV retinitis should not involve the retina solely anterior to the equator, or within 1000&#xD;
        microns from the optic disc, or within 1000 microns from the fovea. Exception: patients&#xD;
        with lesions that have involved the fovea or disc and caused visual acuity worse than&#xD;
        20/400 without the use of eccentric fixation, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Opacification of the cornea, lens, or vitreous in either eye that precludes examination of&#xD;
        the fundus.&#xD;
&#xD;

        toxoplasmosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant psychiatric or emotional disorders that would impair patient understanding or&#xD;
        participation in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Life expectancy less than three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active CMV disease requiring systemic anti-CMV therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CMV retinitis first diagnosised with CD4 T-cell count greater than 150 cells per&#xD;
        microliter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Need for medications with anti-CMV effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participation in conflicting clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Progression of CMV retinitis between screening and baseline examinations.&#xD;
