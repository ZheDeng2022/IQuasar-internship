      This study will examine whether direct current (DC) polarization (electrical stimulation) of&#xD;
      the visual cortex can cause a temporary improvement of vision in an amblyopic eye of an&#xD;
      adult. Amblyopia (also called lazy eye) is reduced vision in an eye, caused by abnormal brain&#xD;
      processing of visual information. In amblyopia, the visual cortex (the part of the brain that&#xD;
      processes visual information) favors the other eye and suppresses the image from the&#xD;
      amblyopic eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amblyopia in children is treated by patching or blurring the good eye, which forces the child&#xD;
      to use the amblyopic eye and overcome suppression by the brain. This treatment only works in&#xD;
      children 8 years old and younger, however. Electrical stimulation of the brain can&#xD;
      temporarily change the function of the visual cortex in adults with good vision, but its&#xD;
      influence on the visual function of people with amblyopia is unknown. If DC polarization can&#xD;
      improve vision in amblyopic eyes in adults, it would show that the visual cortex is still&#xD;
      plastic, and it might help researchers develop a treatment for adults with amblyopia in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years of age and older with amblyopia caused by crossing in or turning out of the&#xD;
      eyes in childhood or by a difference in near- or farsightedness between the eyes may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and complete eye&#xD;
      examination, including a glaucoma screening and checks of vision, in- or out-turning of the&#xD;
      eyes, depth perception, need for glasses, and the interior structures of the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo two study sessions, scheduled at least 24 hours apart, involving the&#xD;
      following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination: Before each session, the patients' distance vision, contrast sensitivity&#xD;
           (ability to see fading letters), and ability to read small print are checked in both&#xD;
           eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DC polarization: Patients receive either 20 minutes of electrical stimulation or 20&#xD;
           minutes of sham stimulation (each patient will receive both electrical and sham&#xD;
           stimulation on different days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Repeat examination: Immediately after the stimulation and again 20 minutes later,&#xD;
           patients undergo repeat visual function testing. Those who show any differences in&#xD;
           visual function 20 minutes after the stimulation are examined again 1 hour after the&#xD;
           stimulation. Patients in whom the effect continues after 1 hour are examined again after&#xD;
           1 week.&#xD;

      Background: Amblyopia is a disorder of reduced visual function in an eye, without ocular&#xD;
      disease, which arises as a result of an abnormal visual experience in early life. It is&#xD;
      attributed to a cortical suppression of the image from the amblyopic eye caused by blur or&#xD;
      diplopia. Amblyopia is the leading cause of preventable monocular vision loss in the US&#xD;
      affecting 2% to 5% of the population. In addition to significant visual deficits, amblyopes&#xD;
      are more likely to loose sight in the other, healthy eye as a result of accidents or ocular&#xD;
      diseases. Accepted treatment of amblyopia, which includes patching or pharmacological, or&#xD;
      optical penalization of the fellow eye, is limited to young children. This treatment is&#xD;
      considered ineffective beyond 8 years of age, and no treatment is offered to older&#xD;
      individuals, who comprise 72% of the population of amblyopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent evidence suggests that some cortical plasticity might be present in older individuals&#xD;
      beyond the accepted age limit for the amblyopia treatment. Spontaneous improvement of visual&#xD;
      acuity in the amblyopic eye was reported in some adults, who lost sight in the good eye&#xD;
      following trauma or disease. However, the chance of spontaneous improvement of visual acuity&#xD;
      to a usable level is relatively low. Therefore, it is important to search for modalities to&#xD;
      improve the vision in amblyopic individuals to prevent incapacitating loss of function&#xD;
      following loss of sight in a sound eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weak direct current (DC) stimulation is a noninvasive method able to induce cortical&#xD;
      excitability changes. It has been previously safely applied in many animal and several human&#xD;
      studies, and was able to modulate activity of primary motor and prefrontal cortices. These&#xD;
      studies revealed that cathodal stimulation reduces spontaneous firing rates of cortical&#xD;
      cells, most likely by hyperpolarizing cortical neurons, whereas anodal stimulation results in&#xD;
      a reverse effect. The number of studies applying DC stimulation over the human visual cortex&#xD;
      is still limited, however these have shown that DC stimulation can induce modulation in the&#xD;
      excitability of the visual cortex, similar to what was observed in motor and prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex. This modulation is reflected by changes in both psychophysical and&#xD;
      electrophysiological parameters of normal volunteers. Because DC stimulation can induce&#xD;
      acute, as well as prolonged modulation in the cortical excitability and activity, it could be&#xD;
      employed as a tool for studying neuroplasticity, and might be beneficial in conditions&#xD;
      accompanied by pathological changes in cortical excitability, such as amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed study we will assess a short-term effect of DC stimulation of the occipital&#xD;
      cortex on the visual function of 10 adult amblyopic subjects. If the study will demonstrate a&#xD;
      favorable effect, then DC stimulation could be used in the future to induce lasting benefits&#xD;
      in amblyopes, because the duration of the after-effects depend on the duration, intensity,&#xD;
      and polarity of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: To gather preliminary data on whether DC stimulation of the occipital cortex can&#xD;
      modulate visual function in adult amblyopic subjects. We will check the short-term effect of&#xD;
      the DC stimulation on the plasticity of the visual cortex and its ability to temporarily&#xD;
      alter the impaired visual functions in amblyopia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm on amblyopic adults that DC stimulation of the visual cortex is safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated, similar to what has been previously established on normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: In the current study we plan to enroll 10 amblyopic subjects ages 18 and older.&#xD;
      Based on the previous reports, anodal stimulation has an excitatory effect, and cathodal&#xD;
      stimulation has an inhibitory effect on the cortex. Therefore, only anodal stimulation of the&#xD;
      visual cortex will be performed on the amblyopic subjects. The stimulation will be applied&#xD;
      over the occipital cortex, duration 20 min at 2mA. As a placebo, a sham stimulation of the&#xD;
      same duration will be applied on the same area of the scalp of all subjects at least 24 hours&#xD;
      before or after the anodal stimulation, in a random order. The stimulation will be done in&#xD;
      the masked fashion, so that neither the study subjects, nor the investigator assessing their&#xD;
      visual function will be aware of the type of stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of visual function will be done before, and immediately and 20 min after the DC&#xD;
      stimulation, and will include measuring visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, reading speed&#xD;
      and reading acuity. In each session both amblyopic and fellow eye will be assessed starting&#xD;
      with the amblyopic eye. If any differences from the pre-stimulation visual function will be&#xD;
      detected 20 min after the stimulation, the patients will also be examined 1 hour after the&#xD;
      stimulation and, if the effect persists, 1 week following that.&#xD;
