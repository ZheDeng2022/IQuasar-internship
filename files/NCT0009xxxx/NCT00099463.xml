  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether an experimental vaccine to protect against severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) is safe, causes any side effects, and causes an immune response.&#xD;
      SARS affects the respiratory system, usually starting with fever and muscle aches. Patients&#xD;
      may get a dry cough and have difficulty breathing. Infection may be mild, but it can lead to&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines contain substances from an infectious agent, such as a virus, that, when injected&#xD;
      into a person's body, stimulates production of antibodies that create resistance, or&#xD;
      immunity, to that agent. The vaccine in this study contains genetic material (DNA) that codes&#xD;
      for a protein found in the virus that causes SARS. Injected into a muscle, it instructs the&#xD;
      body to make a small amount of a SARS protein. The vaccine is made from just one small part&#xD;
      of the code for one SARS protein; a person cannot get SARS from the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal volunteers between 18 and 50 years of age who are in general good health may be&#xD;
      eligible for this 32-week study. Candidates are screened with a physical examination and&#xD;
      blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have nine clinic visits during the study. They receive three vaccine injections,&#xD;
      given with a system called the Bioinjector 2000Â® (Registered Trademark), which delivers the&#xD;
      vaccine through the skin without the use of a needle. Following each injection, participants&#xD;
      take home a diary card, on which they record their temperature and any vaccine side effects&#xD;
      daily for 5 days. Participants must immediately report any symptoms to a study physician,&#xD;
      and, if necessary, go to the clinic for an examination. Participants have the following tests&#xD;
      and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine injections (study day 0, around week 4, and around week 8, with at least 21 days&#xD;
           between injections)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and, if needed, physical examination (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8,&#xD;
           10, 12, 24, and 32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check of vital signs and weight (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node examination (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw (study day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test for women (day 0 and weeks 4, 8 and 32)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample (day 0 and weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a Phase I open label study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immune&#xD;
      response of a recombinant DNA vaccine, VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP. The hypothesis is that this&#xD;
      regimen will be safe for human administration and elicit immune responses to the SARS&#xD;
      coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability in humans of the investigational vaccine. Secondary and exploratory objectives&#xD;
      are related to the immunogenicity of the study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description: VRC-SRSDNA015-00-VP is composed of a single closed, circular DNA plasmid&#xD;
      that is based on the S protein of SARS-CoV. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each&#xD;
      DNA vaccination will be 1 mL of vaccine administered intramuscularly (in deltoid muscle)&#xD;
      using the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Healthy adult volunteers (18 to 50 years old) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan: Ten volunteers will be enrolled and receive 3 injections on the schedule shown in&#xD;
      the schema. The protocol requires nine clinic visits and three telephone follow-up contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 32 weeks clinical follow-up for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint is safety of the regimen; secondary immunogenicity&#xD;
      endpoints are an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for SARS specific T cell&#xD;
      responses and an assay for antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake. The principal&#xD;
      timepoints for ICS are Week 0 (baseline) and Weeks 6, 8, 10 and 12. ICS at other study&#xD;
      timepoints, as well as other immunogenicity assays through Week 32, will be completed as&#xD;
      exploratory evaluations.&#xD;
