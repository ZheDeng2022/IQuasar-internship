      This study will examine whether certain procedures that do not involve the use of medications&#xD;
      can reduce symptoms of neurocardiogenic syncope (SIN-ku-pe), or a condition involving&#xD;
      recurrent fainting. This condition is also known as vasovagal syncope or neurally mediated&#xD;
      hypotension. Neurocardiogenic syncope is a disorder of the autonomic nervous system, which&#xD;
      controls automatic body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating. That&#xD;
      system can be affected by medications, conditions of the mind or body, and by a person's&#xD;
      surroundings. Researchers in this study wish to learn whether hypnosis, hand exercises,&#xD;
      education, or diary keeping can affect the autonomic nervous system and improve symptoms of&#xD;
      neurocardiogenic syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients age 18 or older who have neurocardiogenic syncope may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Those who have a medical illness making it unsafe to participate, who cannot discontinue&#xD;
      certain medications, or who are pregnant are not eligible. Patients will undergo a medical&#xD;
      history and physical examination, complete a questionnaire, and experience Valsalva and tilt&#xD;
      table tests. These tests will take about 5 hours during 1 to 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Valsalva test evaluates some of the reflexes of autonomic nervous system. Patients will&#xD;
      lie flat on a padded table and have sensors placed on the body, to measure blood pressure,&#xD;
      breathing rate, and other functions. They will blow into a sterile tube for 12 seconds while&#xD;
      the body's responses are measured. The procedure may need to be repeated several times.&#xD;
      During the test, an intravenous tube, guided by a needle, will be placed in the patient's&#xD;
      arm. The tube will be used to collect samples of blood (less than 7 tablespoons) to measure&#xD;
      chemicals such as adrenaline. For the tilt table test, a patient will lie on a padded,&#xD;
      motorized table and have sensors placed on the body. Velcro straps will be placed around the&#xD;
      patient's body to help hold him/her on the table. Then the table will tilt the patient from a&#xD;
      flat position to an upright one in about 10 seconds. The patient will stay upright for 45&#xD;
      minutes while symptoms are monitored, measurements are taken, and blood samples are collected&#xD;
      through the intravenous tube. Then the table will be returned to the flat position. If the&#xD;
      patient faints or is about to faint, or if he or she has an unsafe heart rhythm before the 45&#xD;
      minutes is over, the test will be stopped and the table will be returned to the flat&#xD;
      position. Symptoms will be treated as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who qualify for further study will then become familiar with hypnosis and be&#xD;
      evaluated for their natural ability for experiencing it. A professionally trained doctor will&#xD;
      guide patients into a hypnotic state, and patients will be asked to respond to various&#xD;
      suggestions. They will be videotaped, an activity that will require a separate consent form.&#xD;
      Following these procedures, patients will be assigned to one of the four groups in this&#xD;
      study. Those in the hypnosis group will have weekly sessions for 6 weeks, with each session&#xD;
      lasting about 1-1/2 hours. The education group will meet a study investigator for learning&#xD;
      about syncope and the autonomic nervous system, with each session lasting about 1-1/2 hours&#xD;
      once a week for 6 weeks. The hand exercise group will be taught certain hand exercises to&#xD;
      perform, at home and as instructed, for 6 weeks. The diary group will receive instructions on&#xD;
      keeping a diary pertaining to their condition, at home, for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks, patients&#xD;
      will return for an evaluation to include completion of questionnaires and another tilt table&#xD;
      test and blood collection by intravenous tube. This entire study will take about 8 weeks.&#xD;
      There may be direct benefits from participating in this study. The experimental procedures&#xD;
      may help patients' neurocardiogenic syncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing this study, patients will be offered any or all of the experimental&#xD;
      procedures tested in this study upon their request and at the discretion of the principal&#xD;
      investigator. For example, a patient who is assigned to the diary group may be offered&#xD;
      hypnosis, education, and hand exercise instruction after completion of the study.&#xD;

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to test the efficacy of non-pharmacologic&#xD;
      interventions for recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope. Specifically, the interventions tested&#xD;
      in this study are hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, and diary-keeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Subjects are patients ages 18 years or older with recurrent&#xD;
      neurocardiogenic syncope or presyncope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Patients who have a positive screening tilt table test are assigned to one of four&#xD;
      groups: hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, or diary-keeping. Following 6 weeks of&#xD;
      outpatient intervention, all patients undergo repeat tilt table testing to complete the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is occurrence of syncope or presyncope during&#xD;
      upright tilt table testing. Secondary measures are hemodynamic and neurochemical parameters&#xD;
      during upright tilt table testing, and quality of life measures including recurrence of&#xD;
      outpatient syncopal episodes.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are patients referred for neurocardiogenic syncope or presyncope, with or without&#xD;
        postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Patients enter the trial after positive tilt table&#xD;
        testing during the screening evaluation. Participation is offered to individuals 18 years&#xD;
        old or older, independently of gender, race, advanced age, ethnicity, religion, or any&#xD;
        other demographic or sociopolitical classifications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Minors younger than 18 years old are excluded. Advanced age is not an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who have certain illnesses that would interfere or be contraindicated with the&#xD;
        interventions or procedures in this study are excluded. These include significant coronary&#xD;
        artery disease, psychosis, or psychotic depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A candidate is excluded if the subject is unwilling to experience hypnosis or to have&#xD;
        hypnosis sessions recorded; holds religious or other beliefs that would prevent engagement&#xD;
        in hypnosis; is not fluent in spoken English; or has physical or other disabilities that&#xD;
        prevent adequate participation in hypnotic susceptibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements are known or suspected to interfere with&#xD;
        the experimental results, and such herbal medicines or dietary supplements must be&#xD;
        discontinued before enrollment in the study. For many herbal medicines or dietary&#xD;
        supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the possible effects on the&#xD;
        experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish to continue their herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the available medical&#xD;
        literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to interfere with the&#xD;
        experimental results, then the subjects may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A candidate is excluded if clinical considerations require that the patient continue&#xD;
        treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results. Patients who cannot&#xD;
        discontinue medications in the following categories are excluded: certain&#xD;
        anti-hypertensives including beta-blockers, anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants,&#xD;
        barbiturates, and acetaminophen. Patients unable to discontinue nicotine, caffeine, or&#xD;
        alcohol for 24 hours prior to tilt table testing are excluded. Patients with chronic&#xD;
        alcohol intake are excluded. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the&#xD;
        patient or the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator, Accountable&#xD;
        Investigator, an Associate Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided that&#xD;
        discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who pose technical difficulties regarding the testing procedures are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A candidate is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, Accountable&#xD;
        Investigator, or Clinical Director, protocol participation would place the subject at&#xD;
        substantially increased acute medical risk, or if the medical risk outweighs the potential&#xD;
        scientific benefit.&#xD;
