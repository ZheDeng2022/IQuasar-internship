  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if orally-administered recombinant human&#xD;
      lactoferrin is effective in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients&#xD;
      who have failed at least one prior systemic therapy for RCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center Phase 2 study. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled&#xD;
      in a single study arm. RhLF, at a dose of 1.5 g [1 vial], twice a day (b.i.d.), will be&#xD;
      administered orally for two cycles each of 12 consecutive weeks followed by 2 weeks off. A&#xD;
      maximum of two additional cycles may be given if an objective response is obtained or if the&#xD;
      patient has stable disease and no increase in the size of the target tumor(s) relative to&#xD;
      either the Screening CT or the most recent CT measurement, measured according to RECIST prior&#xD;
      to the additional cycle(s). Response and progression-free survival will be evaluated for the&#xD;
      first 20 patients enrolled. If no patient has an objective response and less than 10% of the&#xD;
      patients are alive and progression-free at 14 weeks from the start of Study Drug, then the&#xD;
      study will be terminated. If in either Cycle 3 or Cycle 4, more than three out of the first&#xD;
      ten patients or more than six out of the first twenty patients entering the cycle experience&#xD;
      a Grade 3 or 4 Study-Drug-related adverse event, no further patients will advance into Cycle&#xD;
      3 or Cycle 4.&#xD;
