      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study. Subjects who have received rhuMAb VEGF&#xD;
      therapy in Study AVF2107g, AVF2119g, or AVF2192g and who completed the parent study are&#xD;
      eligible for inclusion in this trial. Subjects who have received placebo in Study AVF2107g or&#xD;
      AVF2192g are also eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  EGOG status of 3 or greater&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned&#xD;
             participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored rhuMAb&#xD;

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved or irreversible rhuMAb VEGF-related ongoing serious adverse event&#xD;
             occurring during the parent study&#xD;
