  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether dark chocolate affects the way patients with hypertension&#xD;
      (high blood pressure) respond to insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates&#xD;
      blood glucose (sugar) levels. In many people with hypertension, insulin is not as effective&#xD;
      in helping the body use glucose. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin also increases&#xD;
      blood flow into muscle by opening inactive blood vessels. Laboratory studies suggest that&#xD;
      eating dark chocolate may improve blood pressure. This study will determine whether dark&#xD;
      chocolate improves insulin resistance or changes how blood vessels react to insulin in&#xD;
      hypertensive people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 21 and 65 years of age who have high blood pressure and are not pregnant may&#xD;
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical&#xD;
      examination, and blood and urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants refrain from eating foods containing chocolate or cocoa for 1 week and then come&#xD;
      to the clinic on three separate occasions 3 weeks apart for a glucose clamp test and contrast&#xD;
      ultrasound, described below. At the first glucose clamp test, subjects are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to drink either a cocoa drink with high anti-oxidant content or one with a very low content&#xD;
      of anti-oxidant. Each drink will be taken twice a day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 2 weeks,&#xD;
      they return for a second glucose clamp test. At the second test, they stop taking the cocoa&#xD;
      drink for 1 week and then start again for another 2 weeks. For this 2-week period, those who&#xD;
      were given the high anti-oxidant content cocoa drink the first 2 weeks will take the placebo,&#xD;
      very low anti-oxidant drink this time, and those who took the placebo will now have the high&#xD;
      anti-oxidant cocoa drink. After this 2 weeks of taking the cocoa drink or placebo, they then&#xD;
      take the third and last glucose clamp test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose clamp test: This test measures how the body responds to insulin. Subjects fast the&#xD;
      night before each test and do not eat until the test is over, usually in the early afternoon.&#xD;
      For the test, the subject lies in a bed or reclines in a chair. A needle is placed in a vein&#xD;
      in each arm - one for collecting blood samples and the other for infusing glucose, insulin,&#xD;
      and a potassium solution. Blood glucose and insulin levels are measured frequently during the&#xD;
      test and the rate of the glucose infusion is adjusted to keep blood glucose at the baseline&#xD;
      (fasting) level. Blood samples are tested for blood count, electrolytes, liver function...&#xD;

      Dark chocolate and other cocoa products contain antioxidants including the polyphenol&#xD;
      epicatechin that have beneficial effects on vascular function. Oral consumption of dark&#xD;
      chocolate lowers blood pressure in elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension while&#xD;
      drinking cocoa acutely improves flow-mediated vasodilation in subjects with cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors. Work from our lab and elsewhere has shown that regulation of hemodynamic and&#xD;
      metabolic homeostasis are coupled such that subjects with essential hypertension are also&#xD;
      insulin resistant. Therefore, we hypothesize that cocoa consumption will improve both blood&#xD;
      pressure and insulin sensitivity in subjects with essential hypertension. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, we will conduct a randomized double-blind, crossover study in subjects with&#xD;
      essential hypertension to evaluate the effects of cocoa versus placebo on blood pressure,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle. After a 7&#xD;
      day cocoa-free run-in period, subjects will be randomized to receive 15 consecutive daily&#xD;
      doses of either cocoa drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 900 mg of polyphenols and 237&#xD;
      kcal) or polyphenol poor placebo drink (150 ml twice a day with a total of 36 mg of&#xD;
      polyphenols and 234 kcal). After the 15 day treatment period, the subjects will enter a 1&#xD;
      week cocoa-free washout period followed by cross-over to the other treatment. Subjects will&#xD;
      be counseled to maintain an isocaloric diet during the study. Blood pressure, insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, and insulin-mediated capillary recruitment will be assessed in each subject&#xD;
      after the run-in period, after 15 days of treatment, and after completion of the cross-over.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will also be measured every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for the duration of&#xD;
      the study. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose&#xD;
      clamp technique. Insulin-stimulated capillary recruitment in forearm skeletal muscle will be&#xD;
      measured by ultrasound with &quot;microbubble&quot; contrast during the glucose clamp studies. Peak and&#xD;
      trough plasma epicatechin levels will be measured prior to each glucose clamp study using an&#xD;
      HPLC assay. This study will determine if short-term oral administration of cocoa is effective&#xD;
      at lowering blood pressure, improving insulin sensitivity, and restoring vascular function in&#xD;
      subjects with essential hypertension. This is highly relevant to major public health problems&#xD;
      such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases where insulin resistance&#xD;
      and vascular dysfunction are important pathophysiological components.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hypertensive subjects between the ages of 21 - 65 years in good general health except for&#xD;
        mild to moderate hypertension (blood pressure between 140/95 and 170/110 off medication),&#xD;
        on no medication or nutritional supplements except for antihypertensive agents,&#xD;
        anti-cholesterol drugs or birth control agents. Subjects will be taken off all&#xD;
        antihypertensive OTC supplements and anti-cholesterol drugs for one week prior to study and&#xD;
        for the duration of the study. Women on birth control will remain on their regime. During&#xD;
        the time subjects receive no antihypertensive therapy, their blood pressure will be&#xD;
        monitored at least daily (either at home, in the clinic, or at another convenient&#xD;
        facility). If a subject's blood pressure exceeds 170/110 on three determinations over a&#xD;
        period of at least 15 minutes, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and appropriate&#xD;
        antihypertensive therapy resumed. In addition, if the subject's blood pressure exceeds&#xD;
        160/100 during measurements on three consecutive days, the subject will be withdrawn from&#xD;
        the study and appropriate antihypertensive therapy resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have diabetes, pregnancy, liver disease, pulmonary&#xD;
        disease, renal insufficiency, coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular&#xD;
        disease, coagulopathy, actively smoked tobacco within last two years, in treatment for any&#xD;
        form of cancer, positive tests for HIV, hepatitis B or C, or take systemic corticosteroids.&#xD;
        These conditions are all known to adversely influence insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they have a history of malignant hypertension, aortic aneurysm&#xD;
        or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with known hypersensitivity to octafluoropropane or with known cardiac shunts will&#xD;
        also be excluded from participating because of potential adverse effects from microbubble&#xD;
        contrast agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded if they are unable to give informed consent for all procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children are excluded from this study because children are not typically hypertensive.&#xD;
