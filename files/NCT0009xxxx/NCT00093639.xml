      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as everolimus, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their growth. Combining everolimus with&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate may be effective in killing cancer cells that have become resistant to&#xD;
      imatinib mesylate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of everolimus when&#xD;
      given together with imatinib mesylate and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia who are not in complete cytogenetic remission&#xD;
      after previous imatinib mesylate.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and biological activity of everolimus when combined&#xD;
           with imatinib mesylate in patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia that&#xD;
           is not in complete cytogenetic remission after prior imatinib mesylate. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical efficacy of this regimen, in terms of 3-month&#xD;
           improvement by at least one cytogenetic category and the duration of cytogenetic&#xD;
           improvements, in these patients. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 6-month rate of cytogenetic improvements in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate of confirmed cytogenetic improvements in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate and duration of major cytogenetic response in patients treated with&#xD;
           this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the rate and kinetics of molecular response in patients treated with this&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate genetic variation in drug metabolism genes, leukemia genes, and drug target&#xD;
           genes with response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the mTOR pathway activity, as determined by molecular pathologic&#xD;
           examination before and during treatment with this regimen, is predictive of response in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of&#xD;
      everolimus followed by a phase II study. Patients are stratified according to baseline&#xD;
      cytogenetic status (Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells in bone marrow) (&gt;0% and ≤ 95% vs&#xD;
      &gt; 95%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral everolimus once daily (or once weekly) and oral imatinib&#xD;
           mesylate once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of everolimus until the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients receive everolimus and imatinib mesylate as in phase I at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-98 patients (4-34 for phase I and up to 64 for phase II [34&#xD;
      patients with &gt; 0% and ≤ 95% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive cells and 30 patients with&#xD;
      &gt; 95% Ph-positive cells]) will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
