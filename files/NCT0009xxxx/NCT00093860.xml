      This study will examine the effectiveness of the drug propranolol in preventing fainting in&#xD;
      patients with sympathoadrenal imbalance (SAI). SAI is a particular pattern of nervous system&#xD;
      and chemical responses in which the blood vessels in skeletal muscles do not remain&#xD;
      constricted appropriately during standing for a long time. This can lower blood pressure and&#xD;
      cause fainting. Propranolol (InderalÂ® (Registered Trademark)) is a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration-approved drug that belongs to a class of drugs called beta-blockers. These&#xD;
      drugs slow the heart rate and maintain blood pressure in certain situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 10 and 17 years of age with frequent fainting or near-fainting due to SAI&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Children must experience severe dizzy episodes at least once&#xD;
      every 2 months or fainting episodes at least once every 4 months. The condition must be&#xD;
      severe enough to affect the child's quality of life or to have forced the child to alter his&#xD;
      or her life routines to accommodate to the illness. Screening includes a tilt table test,&#xD;
      described below, to determine if the child has a particular chemical pattern in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children enrolled in the study take propranolol pills in increasing doses during the first&#xD;
      week of the study to determine the proper dose for the individual. Then, the drug is stopped&#xD;
      until the experimental phase of the study begins. In this phase, children are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to take either propranolol or placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient)&#xD;
      for a maximum of 3 days. On the fourth day, the child undergoes a tilt table test to&#xD;
      determine whether the treatment affects his or her ability to tolerate tilt. For this test,&#xD;
      the child lies on a padded table with a motorized tilt mechanism that can move the child from&#xD;
      a flat position to an upright position in about 10 seconds. The child remains upright for up&#xD;
      to 40 minutes while the following measurements are taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sampling: Blood is drawn through a catheter (thin plastic tube) placed in an arm&#xD;
           vein. This allows repeated sampling without repeated needle sticks. Samples are&#xD;
           collected before starting the tilt test, about every 4 minutes during the test,&#xD;
           immediately when a drop in blood pressure is detected or symptoms develop, and after 10&#xD;
           minutes of recovery lying flat. A maximum of 12 samples are collected for each tilt&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physiologic measurements: Blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (EKG) are&#xD;
           measured continuously during the tilt test session, and blood flows and skin electrical&#xD;
           conduction are measured intermittently. Blood flow is measured using sensors applied to&#xD;
           the skin and a blood pressure cuff around the limb. For skin blood flow measurements, a&#xD;
           laser beam scans the skin surface. The skin electrical conduction test measures how well&#xD;
           the skin conducts electricity. This is measured through sensors placed on the tips of&#xD;
           two fingers. Respiration and breathing rate are monitored by an elastic cloth band&#xD;
           around the chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-report questionnaires: Patients or their parents complete a questionnaire about the&#xD;
           child's symptoms before and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of the test drug are allowed to wear off for up to 1 week, after which the entire&#xD;
      tilt test procedure is repeated. Patients who were given propranolol for the first test&#xD;
      session take placebo for the repeat session, and those who were given placebo take&#xD;
      propranolol.&#xD;

      Objectives: This protocol is to evaluate treatment with oral propranolol for a particular&#xD;
      form of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), characterized by a neuroendocrine pattern called&#xD;
      &quot;sympathoadrenal imbalance&quot; (SAI), in children. In SAI, plasma adrenaline levels increase&#xD;
      progressively and to a greater extent than do norepinephrine levels, before syncope. The SAI&#xD;
      pattern is associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation. We hypothesize that increased&#xD;
      occupation of beta-2 adrenoceptors in skeletal muscle by high circulating adrenaline levels&#xD;
      precipitates the neurocirculatory positive feedback loop that leads to NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients 10-17 years old with a history of NCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In a randomized, crossover-design, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we test&#xD;
      the above hypothesis by using the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol. We&#xD;
      predict that in patients with previously documented SAI and tilt-evoked NCS, propranolol&#xD;
      treatment will improve orthostatic tolerance during follow-up tilt table testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure will be whether propranolol therapy can prevent&#xD;
      tilt induced syncope; or significant hypotension and/or bradycardia preceding development of&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure or heart rate&#xD;
      less than 40 beats/min). Secondary dependent measures that will be assessed are occurrence of&#xD;
      duration of tilt tolerance (if tilt induced symptoms are provoked), hemodynamic and&#xD;
      neurochemical indices of SAI, and patient questionnaire reports.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects are patients referred for evaluation of chronic orthostatic intolerance. Patients&#xD;
        enter into the therapeutic trial after they are determined to have NCS with SAI in a&#xD;
        screening evaluation. Participation in this protocol is offered to individuals 10-17 years&#xD;
        of age, independently of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or any other demographic or&#xD;
        sociopolitical classifications. To be eligible to enter this study, the patient must have a&#xD;
        minimum frequency of pre-syncope of at least 1 event/2 months, or syncope of at least&#xD;
        once/4 months. The severity of the symptoms should be of such severity as to alter the&#xD;
        individual's quality of life or routines of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Minors younger than 10 years old and pregnant female subjects between 10 and 17 years&#xD;
        of age will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
        protocol participation would place the subject at substantially increased acute medical&#xD;
        risk. This includes the risk associated with air travel to the NIH. A candidate subject is&#xD;
        excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, the medical risk outweighs the&#xD;
        potential scientific benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying&#xD;
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are history of asthma or chronic&#xD;
        obstructive pulmonary disease requiring bronchodilators, hepatic or renal failure,&#xD;
        atrioventricular block of any degree, bradycardia, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
        severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, insulin-dependent diabetes&#xD;
        mellitus, or psychiatric disorders requiring continuous drug treatment. Patients with known&#xD;
        allergy or hypersensitivity to propranolol are excluded from this study. A positive HIV&#xD;
        test result does not necessarily exclude a patient from participating. If a female subject&#xD;
        becomes pregnant during the study, she will be excluded from further participation in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the&#xD;
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.&#xD;
        Patients who must take medications daily in the following categories are excluded:&#xD;
        anticoagulants, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, aspirin, acetaminophen, insulin,&#xD;
        and bronchodilators. Patients are not to discontinue any medications before the patient or&#xD;
        the patient's doctor discusses this with the Principal Investigator, an Associated&#xD;
        Investigator, or Research Nurse. If it is decided that discontinuing medications would be&#xD;
        unsafe, then the patient is excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements&#xD;
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal&#xD;
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For&#xD;
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the&#xD;
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish&#xD;
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while in study, and search the&#xD;
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to&#xD;
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practical Limitations: Patients in whom we feel it would be difficult to technically carry&#xD;
        out the testing procedures are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating females of child-bearing potential are excluded. A blood&#xD;
        test pregnancy will be conducted in all females of childbearing potential, before intake&#xD;
        evaluation and also before each drug treatment phase. During the course of the protocol,&#xD;
        patients who are of childbearing potential will be advised to practice adequate&#xD;
        contraception (birth control pills, Depo-Provera, or implanted intrauterine device), if&#xD;
        sexually active. If during the course of this study, a minor patient is found to have a&#xD;
        positive pregnancy test, she will be asked confidentially whether she has had any recent&#xD;
        sexual activity that could have resulted in the test being positive. In agreement with&#xD;
        current legal statutes, the minor patient will be told confidentially that she is pregnant.&#xD;
        She will be encouraged to share this information with her parents. By current legal&#xD;
        statutes, we will not directly divulge this information to her parents. The pregnant minor&#xD;
        subject will also be told that further participation in the study is a protocol violation&#xD;
        (because of possible adverse risks to the unborn fetus), and she will be terminated from&#xD;
        continued participation in the protocol.&#xD;
