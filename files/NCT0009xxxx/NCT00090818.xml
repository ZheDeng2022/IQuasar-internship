      This study will screen patients for eligibility in studies sponsored by the Craniofacial&#xD;
      Genetics Section (HCGS), the Clinical Research Core (CRC), and other branches located within&#xD;
      the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR). It will also evaluate&#xD;
      patients with diseases or abnormalities of the oral cavity or craniofacial complex, or both,&#xD;
      for future protocol development. HCGS and CRC study the natural history of oral diseases and&#xD;
      systemic diseases that are manifested in the maxillofacial region-the upper jaw and face.&#xD;
      Among the diseases are lichen planus, systemic lupus erythematosus, and premalignant oral&#xD;
      leukoplakia. Researchers also study certain acquired diseases and genetic diseases. Because&#xD;
      many of the diseases of the maxillofacial region are poorly defined, the evaluation and&#xD;
      characterization of patients with such diseases are goals of investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of any age, gender, and racial and ethnic group who have oral diseases or systemic&#xD;
      diseases of the upper jaw and face may be eligible for the study. Women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential, or who are pregnant or lactating, may be eligible; they would undergo procedures&#xD;
      and tests or receive medications posing a minimal risk to the fetus or child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete medical history and physical examination, including a thorough examination of&#xD;
           the head and neck; detailed examination of the teeth and gums may or may not be&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of blood, urine, stool; tests for pregnancy and HIV when needed; and tests for&#xD;
           cultures, fungi, bacteria, and parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sampling of blood and oral tissues for diagnosis, treatment response, and disease&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram, x-ray, and imaging procedures, including imaging of the face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies may be performed as needed for diagnosis and to guide therapy. The type, number,&#xD;
      location, and frequency of biopsies depend on several factors, including the nature of the&#xD;
      disease being evaluated. Local anesthesia is typically used unless there are&#xD;
      contraindications. Some biopsies are done with disposable, 2 to 3 mm, round, sharp metal&#xD;
      punches. Larger excisions with the use of an appropriate blade may be necessary for proper&#xD;
      evaluation of a patient's condition or complete removal of something that is abnormal. The&#xD;
      risks and discomfort associated with any of the interventions include mild pain, bleeding,&#xD;
      and infection; there may be temporary facial paralysis, bruising, and allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supportive care will be given as needed, according to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, and&#xD;
      clinical information. Disease-related or drug-related complications, or both, will be managed&#xD;
      through collaboration with the patient's referring physician.&#xD;

      The purpose of this clinical research protocol is twofold: 1) to screen patients for protocol&#xD;
      eligibility for those sponsored primarily by the Craniofacial Genetics Section, the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Core and other Branches located within the National Institute of Dental and&#xD;
      Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) as appropriate and 2) to evaluate patients with diseases or&#xD;
      abnormalities of the oral cavity and/or craniofacial complex for future protocol development.&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in this protocol will be evaluated and treated according to standard&#xD;
      procedures and therapeutic modalities. No procedures will be done for research only. Standard&#xD;
      or experimental biochemical, genetic and proteomic tests may be conducted on tissue or blood&#xD;
      samples collected for diagnosis. Eligible patients will be referred to appropriate NIDCR&#xD;
      clinical research protocols for further protocol-driven diagnostic workup and therapy.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients of any age, gender, and racial/ethnic group with oral diseases or systemic&#xD;
        diseases with maxillofacial manifestations that are mission relevant for the Craniofacial&#xD;
        Genetics Section, the Clinical Research Core and other branches located within the NIDCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women of childbearing potential, or who are pregnant or lactating will only undergo tests&#xD;
        and procedures, and/or receive medications for which data exists proving minimal risk to&#xD;
        the fetus and/or child. Only diagnosis without radiographs will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with significant cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant patients or lactating patients, if this status precludes proposed diagnostic&#xD;
        procedures or therapies because of known untoward effects on mother and/or child.&#xD;
