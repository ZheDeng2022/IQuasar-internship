      In this Phase IIIb, randomized, double-blind, maintenance study, 300 subjects with advanced&#xD;
      or metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (Stage IIIB {T4-pleural effusion} and IV)&#xD;
      who have SD or objective tumor response immediately following the completion of 4-6 cycles of&#xD;
      front line, platinum-based, doublet chemotherapy will be randomized in a double-blind manner&#xD;
      to receive either ZD1839 or placebo.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must sign Informed Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females and males aged 18 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed stage IIIB (T4-pleural effusion) and IV NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Either complete response, partial response, or stable disease following at least 4&#xD;
             cycles (3 in the setting of intolerable toxicity) but no more than 6 cycles of&#xD;
             definitive front line, platinum-based, doublet chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior EGFR therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No newly diagnosed intracerebral metastases while receiving or after completing&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 3 weeks (21 days) but no more than 4 weeks (28 days) since last dose of&#xD;
             chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be completely healed from previous major oncologic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to ZD1839 or any of the excipients of these products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of clinically active interstitial lung disease (subjects with chronic,&#xD;
             stable, radiographic changes who are asymptomatic need not be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with&#xD;
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any unresolved chronic toxicity greater than common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 2&#xD;
             from previous anticancer therapy excluding peripheral neuropathy or alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that makes it&#xD;
             undesirable for the subject to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of child bearing potential). Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential must practice acceptable methods of birth control to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with a non-approved or investigational drug within 30 days before Day 1 of&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of neurological symptoms consistent with new onset spinal cord compression or&#xD;
             CNS metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any systemic anticancer therapies other than the prescribed protocol&#xD;
             chemotherapy regimen (refer to Inclusion criterion -). Exception: Palliative&#xD;
             radiotherapy for symptom relief of lesions present at diagnosis will be allowed;&#xD;
             however, this radiotherapy must occur prior to completion of pre-study doublet&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males must also be willing to practice acceptable methods of birth control while&#xD;
             taking the drug to prevent pregnancy of a partner.&#xD;
