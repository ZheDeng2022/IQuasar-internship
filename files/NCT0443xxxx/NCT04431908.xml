  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a non-invasive olfactory device&#xD;
      as a rapid indicator of COVID-19 in positive subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major hypothesis is that a quantitative and unbiased smell test will be a useful tool to&#xD;
      identify COVID-19 positive individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will address what fraction of outpatients truly have a loss-of-smell (including a&#xD;
      partial loss) and is expected to outperform the current question that is used to identify&#xD;
      COVID-19 related anosmia &quot;Do you have a new loss of smell or taste?&quot; (yes/no) in terms of&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will address if high-risk asymptomatic people whom are SARS-CoV-2 positive have a&#xD;
      partial (or perhaps transitory) loss of smell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to validate the utility (sensitivity, specificity and&#xD;
      accuracy) of a quantitative non-biased olfactory device for the rapid identification of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (as identified by PCR). The performance of the device will also&#xD;
      be compared to the standard CDC patient query for 'new loss of smell or taste'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to test if SARS-CoV-2 positive 'asymptomatic' COVID-19 subjects&#xD;
      may actually present with a mild or transitory defect in smell (hyposmia), which is revealed&#xD;
      through our quantitative olfactory smell test.&#xD;

    <description>The subject's score on using the olfactory device will be compared to the PCR results (SARS-CoV-2 negative or positive) on COVID19 outpatients. As the smell test has a variable scale (0-5) the ideal cutoff will be determined to maximize these factors:&#xD;
Sensitivity (Represents True Positives Divided by True Positives plus False Negatives)&#xD;
Specificity (Represents True Negatives Divided by True Negatives plus False Positives)&#xD;
Accuracy (Represents Sensitivity x Prevalence + Specificity x (1-Prevalence) True Positives are patients who got 3 or less correct answers on the smell test and had a positive PCR COVID test.&#xD;
True Negatives are patients who got 4 or 5 correct responses on the smell test and had a negative PCR COVID test.&#xD;
False Positives are patients who got 3 or less correct responses on the smell test and had a negative PCR COVID test.&#xD;
False Negatives are patients who got 4 or 5 correct responses on the smell test and had a positive PCR COVID test.</description>

    <description>We will determine if 'asymptomatic' SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects experience a partial loss of smell (hyposmia) and if so determine the fraction of subjects in which this occurs. We will evaluate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.&#xD;
Sensitivity (Represents True Positives Divided by True Positives plus False Negatives)&#xD;
