  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to define the maximum effect oxytocin (naturally occurring&#xD;
      hormone that is made in the brain) has on pain from a 5 minute heat probe applied to the skin&#xD;
      and to get an estimate for the relationship between the amount of pain relief at different&#xD;
      amounts of oxytocin in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin&#xD;
      (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain) with blood samples taken thereafter&#xD;
      in order to create a formula to describe the concentrations of oxytocin in the blood over&#xD;
      time (pharmacokinetics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study healthy volunteers and people with knee arthritis so severe that there is a&#xD;
      need for a joint replacement are recruited for a one day study. Each study participant will&#xD;
      have 2 IV catheters placed (one in each arm). After placement of the IV catheters, 4&#xD;
      different levels of oxytocin will be given by IV infusion. Blood samples will be taken before&#xD;
      the infusion begins and after each different level of the infusion. The blood will be drawn&#xD;
      through the second IV catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will also do some tests to get a rough idea of how oxytocin changes&#xD;
      perceptions on the skin and how this relates to the amount of oxytocin in the blood at the&#xD;
      same time. The study team will study a painful perception by placing a probe on the skin and&#xD;
      heating it to 113 degrees Fahrenheit for 5 minutes. Each study participant will score any&#xD;
      pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, sequential study in which all participants will receive intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) infusions of oxytocin in the same manner (except for safety reasons an adjustment at the&#xD;
      highest level after review of the first 7 study participants as indicated in safety plan). In&#xD;
      this study healthy people and with those with knee arthritis so severe that a joint&#xD;
      replacement is needed are recruited for a one day study. Study participants will come to the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) and two IVs inserted; one in each forearm. Study participants&#xD;
      will have an intravenous infusion of oxytocin at infusion rates that will result in a steady&#xD;
      concentration of oxytocin in the blood for 15 minutes. The infusion rate will be increased&#xD;
      every 15 minutes for a total of 4 targeted levels. Blood (5 millilitres (ml)) will be&#xD;
      withdrawn through the IV not being used for infusion at the end of each of these infusion&#xD;
      levels and the amount of oxytocin measured in the blood samples. This information will be&#xD;
      analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PK/PD) Core part of this application. The core group at Stanford University will use&#xD;
      mathematics to test the accuracy of the infusion to target the blood concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to define the maximum effect oxytocin has on pain from a 5&#xD;
      minute heat probe applied to the skin and to get an estimate for the relationship between the&#xD;
      amounts of pain relief at different amounts of oxytocin in the blood. The study team will use&#xD;
      a commercially available device (Medoc TSA II) to heat a probe on the skin to 113 degrees&#xD;
      Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) for 5 minutes. Study participants will score any pain noted&#xD;
      on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain rises during the 5 minutes, but remains&#xD;
      mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 scale. The study team will do this 5 times&#xD;
      during the study, once before the infusion and once during each of the 4 levels of infusion.&#xD;
      From this the study team will calculate how the amount of oxytocin in the blood affects pain.&#xD;
