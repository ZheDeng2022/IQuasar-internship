      Adult cardiac surgery ensures the surgical treatment of valvular and coronary pathologies and&#xD;
      of heart failure with the placement of ventricular assistance. Extracorporeal circulation&#xD;
      (ECC) is one of the major technical advances associated with cardiac surgery to replace&#xD;
      cardiac and pulmonary functions during surgery. ECC can nevertheless lead to postoperative&#xD;
      complications, the origin of which is linked to the patient's initial contact with the&#xD;
      circuit and membranes of the ECC. This contact triggers a series of humoral and cellular&#xD;
      reactions that occur in the first few hours after the ECC and the inflammatory syndrome post&#xD;
      ECC fades on its own and usually disappears between the 4th and 6th postoperative day. If the&#xD;
      inflammatory response post ECC is most often transient, certain conditions will maintain and&#xD;
      intensify this response at the origin of postoperative complications, possibly leading to the&#xD;
      patient's death. Among these situations, the investigators find the notion of emergency&#xD;
      cardiac surgery, a patient's age over 75 years and a preoperative history of decompensated&#xD;
      heart failure, renal failure or type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammasome family of receptors of the nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) type,&#xD;
      pyrin domain containing 3, NLRP3, is a multi-protein platform of recent discovery which plays&#xD;
      a major role in the signaling pathways of the innate inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiovascular pathologies is now&#xD;
      well established and its metabolic priming by hyperglycemia could explain the greater&#xD;
      seriousness of these pathologies in T2D patients due to an exacerbated inflammatory response.&#xD;

      Adult cardiac surgery provides surgical treatment of valvular, coronary, and heart failure&#xD;
      pathologies with the installation of ventricular assistance. Extracorporeal circulation (ECC)&#xD;
      is one of the major technical advances associated with cardiac surgery to replace cardiac and&#xD;
      pulmonary functions during surgery. However, ECC can lead to postoperative complications, the&#xD;
      origin of which is linked to the patient's initial contact with the circuit and membranes of&#xD;
      the ECC. This contact triggers a series of humoral and cellular reactions such as activation&#xD;
      of the plasma contact system and complement, coagulation and fibrinolysis, activation of&#xD;
      endothelial cells and leukocytes, as well as the release into the circulating blood of many&#xD;
      mediators of inflammation such as cytokines TNF-α, interleukin IL -1β, interleukin IL6 and&#xD;
      interleukin IL8. These reactions occur in the first hours after the ECC and the inflammatory&#xD;
      syndrome post ECC fades by itself and usually disappears between the 4th and 6th&#xD;
      postoperative day. Different technical and pharmacological modalities (biocompatibility of&#xD;
      circuits, hemofiltration, leukocyte filter, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, corticoids)&#xD;
      have helped reduce the inflammatory syndrome post ECC, but their partial effectiveness&#xD;
      highlights the need to better understand the molecular mechanisms of inflammation. post ECC&#xD;
      in order to improve its prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the inflammatory response post ECC is most often transient, certain conditions will&#xD;
      maintain and intensify this response at the origin of postoperative complications, possibly&#xD;
      leading to the patient's death. Among these situations, The investigators find the notion of&#xD;
      emergency cardiac surgery, a patient's age&gt; 75 years and a preoperative history of&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure, renal failure or type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Defined according to the criteria proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the&#xD;
      American Diabetes Association (ADA), DT2 is a major independent risk factor for morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality from general surgery, and from surgery especially the heart. The risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular and infectious complications after cardiac surgery in T2D patients increases&#xD;
      by 17% for each unit of glycemia above 6 mmol / L. Strict control of blood sugar during the&#xD;
      perioperative phase, however, significantly reduces the risk of complications in T2D&#xD;
      patients. Physiopathologically, the higher incidence of postoperative complications in T2D&#xD;
      patients is attributed to the exacerbation of the postoperative inflammatory response and its&#xD;
      deleterious effects on vascular function. A recent study confirms that the expression of&#xD;
      messenger RNAs coding for the inflammation genes (IL-1β, IL8) and the transitional activation&#xD;
      factors (MYC / JUN) is increased in T2D patients and that this chronic state of low grade&#xD;
      preoperative would promote deregulation of the inflammatory response after cardiac surgery,&#xD;
      and the occurrence of cardiovascular complications. The level of inflammation in T2D patients&#xD;
      is also usually reflected by an increase in plasma levels of proteins in the acute phase of&#xD;
      inflammation (C-reactive protein CRP, in particular) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (TNF-α IL6). These different results suggest that the activation of the NOD-like receptor&#xD;
      family pyrin domain containing 3, (NLRP3) inflammasome may play a central role in low-level&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory status in T2D patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammasome NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3, NLRP3, is a&#xD;
      multi-protein platform whose activation is involved in the signaling pathways of the innate&#xD;
      inflammatory response in many inflammatory and infectious diseases, as well as metabolic&#xD;
      pathologies like gout and type 2 diabetes. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in&#xD;
      the activation of inflammatory caspases allowing the cleavage of the pro-cytokines IL-1β and&#xD;
      IL-18 into mature and active cytokines. Several studies show that T2D hyperglycemia is a&#xD;
      pre-activation or priming factor for NLRP3 which potentiates the secondary activation of&#xD;
      NLRP3 and the synthesis of the interleukins of IL-1β and IL18. During T2D, other metabolic&#xD;
      signals such as the accumulation of free fatty acids, the release of cellular debris&#xD;
      (damage-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also&#xD;
      responsible for the priming of NLRP3. Among the molecular motifs DAMPs, mitochondrial DNA&#xD;
      (mtDNA) is a powerful activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome due to the ancestral bacterial&#xD;
      origin of mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in cardiovascular pathologies is now&#xD;
      well established and its metabolic priming by hyperglycemia could explain the greater&#xD;
      seriousness of these pathologies in T2D patients due to an exacerbated inflammatory response.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no human data on the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in post-ECC&#xD;
      inflammatory syndrome. The investigators envision that the extracorporeal circulation (ECC),&#xD;
      responsible for cellular damage, is accompanied by a release of molecular patterns of DAMPs&#xD;
      type at the origin of the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.&#xD;
