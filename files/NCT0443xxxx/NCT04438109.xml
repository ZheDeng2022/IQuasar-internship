  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a single surgical center, 213 consecutive patients with 221 knees were surgically treated&#xD;
      for recurrent lateral patellar dislocation between 07/2010 and 12/2016. All patients obtained&#xD;
      dynamic reconstruction of the MPFL with detachment of the gracilis tendon at the pes&#xD;
      anserinus while maintaining the proximal origin at the gracilis muscle. Patellar fixation was&#xD;
      performed by oblique transpatellar tunnel transfer and tenodesis screw. Follow-up data&#xD;
      including Kujala-, BANFF- and Norwich patellar instability score as well as Return-to-Sport&#xD;
      and pain level were collected at a minimum follow-up of 2 years&#xD;

      Patients were identified through the hospitals database using OPS-Codes for MPFL&#xD;
      reconstruction. The included surgeries were performed from 07/2010 to 12/2016 in a single&#xD;
      orthopedic hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dynamic MPFL-reconstruction (primary and revision surgery) including cartilage procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age of 18 years or older at a minimum of 24 months follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of connective tissue disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological diseases including patella associated spasticity and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant alignment correction surgery including femoral/tibial osteotomy,&#xD;
           trochleoplasty and tibial tubercle transfer&#xD;
&#xD;
           213 Patients with 221 knees (8 bilateral) met the inclusion criteria. All patients were&#xD;
           contacted by mail or phone to independently answer questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique was performed according to the description by Ostermeier et al.. Briefly, the&#xD;
      gracilis tendon is detached at its insertion site at the pes anserinus after opening the&#xD;
      sartorius fascia. Instead of transferring the tendon through a subligamentous tunnel of the&#xD;
      medial collateral ligament, as detailed in the original description of the technique, the&#xD;
      tendon was passed around the incised sartorius fascia. From around the sartorius fascia the&#xD;
      gracilis tendon is shuttled subcutaneously to the medial patellar margin, allowing the&#xD;
      sartorius fascia to act as a pulley for the transferred tendon. Due to the dynamic&#xD;
      reconstruction technique, the course of the graft appears to be more oblique compared to the&#xD;
      static technique with femoral fixation at Schöttle's point. Fixation of the tendon is&#xD;
      achieved by passing it through a transpatellar drill hole extending from the proximal medial&#xD;
      patellar margin to the lateral patellar margin. The tendon is then tensioned with the knee in&#xD;
      30 degrees of flexion and fixed with a bioabsorbable tenodesis screw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection was performed by self-administered questionnaires, which were sent to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records and radiographs of all patients were reviewed for demographic information&#xD;
      (age, sex) and to identify complications related to the surgical procedure. Complications&#xD;
      were categorized as major if the patient returned to the operating room or required&#xD;
      hospitalization after the index procedure. Complications were categorized as minor&#xD;
      complications if they were treated on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating of the results was performed using the Kujala score, the Norwich Patellar Instability&#xD;
      Score and the BANFF Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain level was recorded using the visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 = no pain, 10 = severe pain).&#xD;
      General satisfaction with treatment outcomes was evaluated by questionnaire (1 = excellent, 2&#xD;
      = very good, 3 = good, 4 = fair, 5 = poor, 6 = very poor) and by asking patients whether they&#xD;
      would undergo the procedure again. Furthermore, information on patient characteristics,&#xD;
      recurrence of dislocation, revision surgery, and other postoperative complications were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative x-rays were analyzed concerning intraoperative complications (e.g. fractures or&#xD;
      patellar drill hole malpositioning).&#xD;
