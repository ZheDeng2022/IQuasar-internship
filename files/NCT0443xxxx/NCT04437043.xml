      Patients with incisional midline ventral hernias with a minimal width of 3 cm and a maximal&#xD;
      width of 8 cm, treated according to the standard practice of the participating investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can be treated with the following ventral hernia repair approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with closure of the defect (IPOM+)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open ventral hernia repair with closure of the defect (retromuscular repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Robotic ventral hernia repair with closure of the defect (retromuscular repair)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the total number of days spent in the hospital within a period of 90 days&#xD;
      post-operative. This will be calculated by adding the hospital length of stay for initial&#xD;
      surgery or index-procedure, length of stay for any additional readmission resulting from the&#xD;
      surgery or re-interventions, and emergency room visits resulting from the surgery or Serious&#xD;
      Adverse Event (SAE) related to the index-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To assess the safety, performance and efficacy of laparoscopic, open&#xD;
      and robotic ventral hernia repair.&#xD;

      Ventral hernia repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laparoscopic: In laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh or IPOM repair, the mesh is&#xD;
           inserted intra-abdominally and fixed to the peritoneum / abdominal wall. The general&#xD;
           steps include safe entry into the peritoneum, insufflation and placement of the trocars&#xD;
           to gain access and visibility (via laparoscope) of the defect. Careful adhesiolysis is&#xD;
           performed, which is the removal of scar tissue connecting tissues and organs. The&#xD;
           content of the hernia, which may include intestine and fatty tissue, is returned into&#xD;
           the abdominal cavity. After closure of the hernia defect, a wide intraperitoneal mesh is&#xD;
           fixed over the defect. Desufflation releases the gas from the abdomen. The trocars will&#xD;
           be removed and the incisions are closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Open: An open retromuscular ventral hernia repair involves an incision through the&#xD;
           abdominal wall. Adhesiolysis is performed and the content of the hernia is returned into&#xD;
           the abdominal cavity. The posterior rectus sheath is separated from the rectus muscle&#xD;
           and closed, which closes the abdominal cavity. The mesh is then placed behind the muscle&#xD;
           and anterior to the re-approximated posterior rectus sheath. Preperitoneal mesh&#xD;
           extension is allowed via transversus abdominis release (TAR). The anterior rectus sheath&#xD;
           is closed over the mesh, which closes the hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Robotic: A robotic retromuscular ventral hernia repair involves a similar separation of&#xD;
           the layers of the abdominal wall, similar closure of the hernia defect and similar&#xD;
           retromuscular mesh placement as for the open approach. Preperitoneal mesh extension is&#xD;
           allowed via TAR. The da Vinci System is a robotic-assisted surgical device that allows&#xD;
           the surgeon to place long, narrow instruments through small incisions in order to&#xD;
           perform surgery from the inside of the abdominal cavity. Rather than one long incision&#xD;
           with open repair, four to six small incisions are made along the outer part of the&#xD;
           abdomen between the rib cage and the hip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classifications and questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. European Hernia Society (EHS) classification: The EHS classification is a simple and&#xD;
           reproducible system, developed to allow comparison of publications and future studies on&#xD;
           primary and incisional abdominal wall hernias. The classification includes the&#xD;
           localization of the hernia as well as the size of the hernia defect as decisive for the&#xD;
           outcome. The EHS classification is to be filled in by the participating investigator&#xD;
           following the patients CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-Anaesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS): The Modified PADSS has proven to be&#xD;
           an efficient system that guarantees safe discharge. PADSS is based on the assessment of&#xD;
           6 criteria: vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respiratory&#xD;
           rate), ambulation, nausea / vomiting, pain, surgical bleeding and fluid intake / output.&#xD;
           Each criterion is given a score from 0 to 2. Patients scoring â‰¥ 9 are considered fit for&#xD;
           discharge, provided that the score for vital signs is not lower than 2 and that none of&#xD;
           the other five criteria is 0, even if the total score reaches 9. PADSS scoring will be&#xD;
           performed twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon with minimally 9 hours in&#xD;
           between. Same day discharge (on the day of hernia repair) is allowed as long as the&#xD;
           required PADSS score is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification: The ASA physical status&#xD;
           classification system was developed to offer clinicians a simple categorization of a&#xD;
           patient's physiological status that can be helpful in predicting operative risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visual Analog Scale (VAS): The VAS scoring system is frequently used as a reliable and&#xD;
           valid measure of pain. It contains a 0 - 100 grading scale with 0 equaling no pain and&#xD;
           100 equaling the worst conceivable pain. The patient is asked to select the number on&#xD;
           the scale that corresponds to the worst level of pain he / she experiences in rest and&#xD;
           activity. The patient will be asked to bend over to score pain during activity. Pain is&#xD;
           classified into mild (1 - 30 mm), moderate (31 - 60 mm) and severe (61 - 100 mm).&#xD;
           Absence of pain is defined as VAS = 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Carolinas Comfort Scale (CSS): The CCS is a disease-specific, quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire developed for patients undergoing hernia repair with mesh. It is a 23-item&#xD;
           questionnaire that measures the severity of pain, sensation and movement limitations&#xD;
           from the mesh in eight categories. The CCS score is derived by adding the scores from&#xD;
           each of the 23 items. The best possible score is 0 and the worst possible score is 115.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ): The BIQ is an ten-item questionnaire incorporating body&#xD;
           image and cosmetic subscales. The body image scale measures patients' perception and&#xD;
           satisfaction with their bodies after surgery, and it is calculated by reverse scoring&#xD;
           and summing the responses to questions 1 through 5. It ranges from 5 to 20 with a higher&#xD;
           number representing greater body image perception. The cosmetic scale assesses&#xD;
           satisfaction with surgical scars and is calculated by simply summing responses to&#xD;
           questions 6 through 8, for a score range of 3 to 24, with a higher score indicating&#xD;
           greater cosmetic satisfaction. The last two items (9, 10) score self-confidence before&#xD;
           and after surgery. The Baseline BIQ was generated to score body image perception and&#xD;
           satisfaction at baseline and consists of 9 questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Seroma classification: Seroma is one of the most common complications after hernia&#xD;
           repair. The seroma classification is used to describe the incidence of seroma after&#xD;
           ventral hernia repair and was developed in order to unify criteria among surgeons when&#xD;
           describing their experience. Originally developed for seroma classification after&#xD;
           laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, it can also be used to describe the incidence of&#xD;
           seroma after open ventral hernia repair.&#xD;
