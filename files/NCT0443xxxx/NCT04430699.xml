  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see how well the combination of a standard of care drug,&#xD;
      investigational drug, and radiation therapy work against unresectable vulvar squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin (standard of care drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (investigational drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy (standard of care intervention)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase 2 clinical trial involving women with unresectable, incompletely&#xD;
      resected, recurrent, or metastatic vulva squamous cell carcinoma. This study combines&#xD;
      cisplatin, pembrolizumab, and radiation therapy to see if this combination further increases&#xD;
      participants' immune system's efficiency in killing their tumor, and if the combination&#xD;
      decreases the chances of participants' cancer coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cisplatin (standard of care drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab (investigational drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy (standard of care intervention)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for up to 36 weeks and will be followed for up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 24 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to&#xD;
      learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the&#xD;
      drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved cisplatin as&#xD;
      a treatment option for vulva squamous cell carcinoma. The FDA has not approved pembrolizumab&#xD;
      for vulva squamous cell carcinoma, but it has been approved for other uses. Cisplatin is a&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug and will be given to participants per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will be given to you per standard of care. Pembrolizumab is a drug that may&#xD;
      target participants immune systems to increase its efficiency in targeting and killing&#xD;
      illnesses and diseases, such as unresectable vulvar squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>To determine the Overall response rate (ORR) in patients undergoing combination therapy with pembrolizumab and cisplatin-sensitized external beam radiation therapy by RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
This sample size calculation is based on an ORR of greater than or equal to 60%. For recurrent metastatic disease, there are is no standard of care.The ORR estimation is informed by data showing an ORR of 40% in patients with advanced or recurrent metastatic vulvar cancer treated with platinum-based combination therapy. Singleagent chemotherapy has an ORR of about 12% (5). Patients with primary disease who are not candidates for upfront surgery have a reported response rates from 55% to 64%.</description>
