  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of rifampicin on&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of healthy Chinese adult subjects after oral administration of SHR6390&#xD;
      tablets. The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of SHR6390 alone and&#xD;
      when co-administered with rifampicin.&#xD;
