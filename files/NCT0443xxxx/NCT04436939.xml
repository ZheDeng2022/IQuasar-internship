      Introduction: Single-stage dental implant placement protocol involves the placement of&#xD;
      healing abutments. In addition to osseointegration process, healing of peri-implant soft&#xD;
      tissues is of a great importance too. Routinely, healing abutments made of titanium (Ti) are&#xD;
      used. The aim is to find novel materials that would have the same mechanical properties, but&#xD;
      less prone to plaque-adhesion and therefore showing lower local inflammatory soft tissue&#xD;
      response. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a thermoplastic polymer that has favorable&#xD;
      mechanical characteristics, high biocompatibility and low submissiveness to microorganism&#xD;
      adhesion. White color makes it aesthetically acceptable in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      thin gingival phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aim: To compare the formation of dental plaque on PEEK and Ti healing abutments and&#xD;
      examine the local response of peri-implant tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: The study included 11 patients with at least two missing teeth in the&#xD;
      posterior regions. In each patient, 2 implants were installed, with PEEK abutment&#xD;
      (experimental group) placed on one implant, while on the other implant, Ti abutment (control&#xD;
      group) was placed. Before prosthetic rehabilitation of patients, both abutments were replaced&#xD;
      with new ones and a thin layer of peri-implant soft tissue was sent to histological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The average age of patients was 49 years. Out of 11 patients, 27% were female and&#xD;
      73% male. 36% of respondents were smokers. Histological immunohistochemical analysis of&#xD;
      samples of peri-implant soft tissues showed massive inflammatory infiltration in&#xD;
      subepithelial tissue in the experimental group (10/11), while the inflammatory infiltrate in&#xD;
      the control group was classified as moderate (7/11) or weak (4/11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Both types of healing abutments have been shown to be successful in single-stage&#xD;
      implantation protocol. However, contrary to expectations and preliminary findings from the&#xD;
      literature, PEEK healing abutments showed a more pronounced inflammatory response of the&#xD;
      surrounding soft tissues relative to Titanium abutments.&#xD;

      Study design This study was performed at Department of Periodontology and Oral medicine of&#xD;
      the Belgrade School of Dental Medicine in collaboration with the Institute of Pathology of&#xD;
      the Belgrade School of Medicine. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical&#xD;
      Committee and all subjects enrolled in this trial have signed an informed consent according&#xD;
      to the Helsinki declaration of 1964 and subsequent amendments. It was a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, with a split mouth design, in which each subject served as both experimental and&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample The subjects included in this study are patients of the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology and Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Belgrade.&#xD;
      Individuals diagnosed with partial edentulism in posterior maxillary or mandibular arches,&#xD;
      with missing at least two teeth that were extracted at least 6 months earlier, have been&#xD;
      selected following clinical and radiological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with indication for implant placement (presenting bilateral single tooth gaps&#xD;
      and/or extended edentulous spaces distally from maxillary or mandibular canines) were&#xD;
      included in this study if they fulfilled the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Men and non-pregnant women, 18 to 70 years of age;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Systemically healthy patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adequate bone quantity at the experimental sites to allow the insertion of 3.8 or 4.3 mm&#xD;
           diameter implants&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Sufficient band of keratinized mucosa at the experimental sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No active periodontal disease at the time of inclusion/surgery and proper oral hygiene&#xD;
           defined by bleeding on probing scores (BOP) and plaque indices (PI) less then 15%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titanium implants placed in the posterior mandible and maxilla were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive transmucosal healing by either: PEEK healing abutment (A, experimental group) or Ti&#xD;
      healing abutment (B, control group). Randomization was performed by a toss of a coin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant placement was carried out under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine with epinephrine,&#xD;
      1:100000). Mid-crestal incisions were made and mucoperiosteal flaps (MPFs) were elevated not&#xD;
      to interfere with muco-gingival junction. Surgical implant sites were prepared according to a&#xD;
      standard procedure using a low-trauma surgical technique under copious irrigation with&#xD;
      sterile 0.9% physiological saline. Thereafter, two bone level implants were inserted (C-TECH&#xD;
      Esthetic line (EL), Italy) in 1mm subcrestally, in a one-stage protocol. The diameter and&#xD;
      length of the implant were chosen following CBCT data analysis. Study abutments (C-TECH,&#xD;
      Italy) were provided in width of 4 mm and in different heights (2, 3, 4 mm). In the&#xD;
      experimental group, immediately following implant placement, a PEEK abutment was screwed at&#xD;
      10 Ncm, while in the control group, the same procedure was performed by means of TI healing&#xD;
      abutment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All abutments were connected using a torque of 10 Ncm. Subsequently, the MPFs were&#xD;
      repositioned and adapted using non-resorbable single sutures to ensure a transmucosal healing&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were prescribed antimicrobials (Amoxicillin caps. 500mg, 3x1 or Clindamycin, 600mg,&#xD;
      2x1, for patients allergic to penicillin), analgesics (Ibuprofen, 600 mg, every 6 hours) and&#xD;
      0.2% chlorhexidine solution (ASD Curasept 212, Curaden, Switzerland). Sutures were removed&#xD;
      one week after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling 3 months following the implant surgery, a minimally invasive surgical procedure was&#xD;
      performed for the placement of larger diameter (5mm wide) healing abutments. At this stage, a&#xD;
      triangular incision was performed at mesial and distal aspect of the existing implant healing&#xD;
      abutment, to remove both the healing abutment with the band of the surrounding soft tissue of&#xD;
      1-1.5mm in thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue specimens were gently rinsed with 4% formalin and fixed in 4% neutral buffered&#xD;
      formalin solution. The samples were processed to the laboratory for further histological&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, commercially available 5 mm wide healing abutments (C-TECH) were selected by height&#xD;
      according to the individual situation and applied to ensure a conditioning of the soft&#xD;
      tissues prior to prosthetic restauration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light microscopic analysis Analysis was performed by two independent observer-pathologists,&#xD;
      blinded to the treatment, samples marked as patients from group A and B. For microscopic&#xD;
      histological evaluation, biopsy were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Three 5-μm-thick&#xD;
      paraffin-embedded horizontal sections were cut dyed with a haematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain and&#xD;
      analyzed by light microscopy and microscope Nikon Eclipse Ci with control unit DS-L3 and&#xD;
      pre-installed software. Following morphological changes were analyzed: presence, localization&#xD;
      and intensity of the inflammation. Presence in epithelial and subepithelial tissue were&#xD;
      categorized qualitatively (yes/no) and intensity semiqualitatively (light, medium,&#xD;
      intensive).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For immunohistochemical analysis serial sections, 5 µm thick, were cut and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical techniques were carried out using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex&#xD;
      method with an LSAB2 kit (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The primary antibodies used in this study&#xD;
      were: LCA (M3629Clone 318-6-11, dilution 1 : 25; Dako), CD 3 (M3539 Clone β-catenin1,&#xD;
      dilution 1 : 200; Dako), CD 20 (M7240 Clone MIB-1, dilution 1 : 100; Dako), and CD 68&#xD;
      (EPR2241, ab134175, dilution 1 : 200; Abcam).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells with cytoplasmic staining were considered positive in immunohistochemistry for all&#xD;
      antibodies. The labeled-cell count of all antibodies was determined in ten high-power fields&#xD;
      at 200× magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In statistics, uni- and multivariate analyses were used, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      accepted as statistically significant.&#xD;
