  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying opioid approach bias during a pilot&#xD;
      RCT of opioid approach bias modification. The investigators are combining novel ultra-high&#xD;
      field MRI technology with the promising treatment of modifying cognitive bias away from&#xD;
      detrimental prescription drug use will generate novel neural data and potentially yield a new&#xD;
      therapeutic tool to reduce problematic opioid use.&#xD;

      The proposed study is a pilot prospective, parallel groups, randomized, double blind, sham&#xD;
      training-controlled, 6-session (over 2 weeks) clinical trial of opioid approach bias&#xD;
      modification (OABM) in 20 male and female veterans with chronic pain at high risk for&#xD;
      opioid-related adverse events at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System,&#xD;
      between ages 18-69. The study consists of screening, 2-week cognitive training, Week-3&#xD;
      post-assessment. Assessment of the neurobiological mechanisms of opioid approach bias will be&#xD;
      administered at baseline and Week-3.&#xD;

    <description>millisecond reaction time of (opioid push - opioid pull) - (non-opioid push - opioid pull) on an opioid approach-avoidance task where participants are asked to respond to the format of presented pictures, irregardless of the content. There are two categories of pictures; 20 different opioid pictures and 20 different non-opioid pictures, with two-hundred trials. Millisecond reaction time will be measured at baseline, prior to each training session during the 2-week training period, and at week 3 post training assessment. Primary outcome is change in reaction time across time in active vs. sham condition.</description>

    <description>The investigators will use a training version of the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT), in which patients are asked to respond to the format of presented pictures, irrespective of the pictures' content. Pushing a presented picture away will decrease picture size, whereas pulling a picture closer will increase size. There are 2 categories of pictures; 20 different opioid and 20 different non-medication alternative pain managing activities. Training effect is achieved by presenting opioid pictures in push format only and non-opioid pictures in pull format only. Two hundred training trials are presented per session.</description>
