  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common opportunistic infection in lung&#xD;
      transplantation leading to direct and indirect effects that can result in life threatening&#xD;
      complications. The risk of CMV infection is highest when the recipient of the transplant has&#xD;
      never been in contact with CMV (negative immunity) and the donor had previous contact with&#xD;
      CMV (positive immunity). This is called CMV mismatch. For these lung transplant patients 6 to&#xD;
      12 months of prophylaxis with an antiviral called Valganciclovir is recommended. This&#xD;
      antiviral can cause side effects like bone marrow toxicity and decrease in immune cells which&#xD;
      can result in temporarily having to stop the treatment. Starting and stopping the prophylaxis&#xD;
      may result in the CMV becoming resistant to the medication. While taking the prophylaxis it&#xD;
      is possible to have a breakthrough of the CMV, this is often due to the development of&#xD;
      resistance to the antiviral. The purpose of this study is to learn more about the rate of CMV&#xD;
      breakthrough while on prophylaxis after lung transplantation in patients who are CMV&#xD;
      mismatch. The investigators will also look at the rates of negative side effects caused by&#xD;
      antiviral prophylaxis in this population.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the rate of CMV breakthrough in lung&#xD;
      transplant patients who are CMV mismatched and receiving prophylaxis. The rates of negative&#xD;
      side effects caused by the antiviral prophylaxis will also be monitored. For patients who do&#xD;
      have a breakthrough of CMV viremia while on study the investigator will also evaluate the&#xD;
      rate of resistance mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator wants to demonstrate that breakthrough CMV DNAemia is common in CMV mismatch&#xD;
      lung transplant recipients on ganciclovir/valganciclovir prophylaxis. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigator will show that leukopenia and neutropenia related to prolonged prophylaxis is&#xD;
      very common and discontinuation of ganciclovir/valganciclovir prophylaxis because of side&#xD;
      effects explains most cases of breakthrough CMV DNAemia. The investigators findings will be&#xD;
      relevant because they will answer the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prophylaxis with ganciclovir/valganciclovir in mismatch lung transplant patients should&#xD;
           include intensive CMV DNA monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Side effects related to the use of ganciclovir/valganciclovir can result in potential&#xD;
           life-threatening infections due to the development of neutropenia and increased cost due&#xD;
           to the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Alternative prophylaxis with new antivirals with safer profile of side effects would&#xD;
           result in a safer profile of adverse events. As resistance to ganciclovir may lead to&#xD;
           death, the development of CMV infection in patients receiving antivirals targeting&#xD;
           different enzymes than those targeted by ganciclovir/valganciclovir will not prevent&#xD;
           future use of ganciclovir/valganciclovir to treat CMV infection or disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common opportunistic infection in lung&#xD;
      transplantation leading to direct and indirect effects that can result in life threatening&#xD;
      complications. The risk of CMV infection is highest in CMV seronegative lung recipients from&#xD;
      CMV seropositive donor (CMV mismatch). Antiviral prophylaxis for 6 to12 months with&#xD;
      valganciclovir is indicated in CMV mismatch lung transplant recipients according to&#xD;
      International Guidelines. Despite prolonged antiviral prophylaxis, the risk of CMV infection&#xD;
      post-prophylaxis is high in this group of patients. Valganciclovir was approved for antiviral&#xD;
      prophylaxis in organ transplant patients in 2004. Rates of breakthrough CMV infection may be&#xD;
      higher after 6 months of prophylaxis due to an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity and&#xD;
      neutropenia from Valganciclovir that may lead to temporary prophylaxis discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance to ganciclovir is a major complication in all solid organ transplant patients, but&#xD;
      lung transplant recipients are the subgroup of patients at highest risk. The rate of&#xD;
      ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection in CMV mismatch lung transplant recipients is the highest&#xD;
      among all organ transplants and its occurrence is associated with increased risk of death.&#xD;
      Although CMV mismatch lung transplantation has been found to be a risk factor for&#xD;
      ganciclovir-resistant CMV infection in most of the studies, the underlying pathophysiological&#xD;
      mechanisms are not fully understood. Discontinuation of valganciclovir can lead to CMV&#xD;
      replication with exposure to sub-therapeutic levels of ganciclovir in blood, and this may&#xD;
      lead to the development of antiviral resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the incidence of breakthrough CMV infection in CMV mismatch lung transplant&#xD;
           patients receiving 6-12 months antiviral prophylaxis with ganciclovir/valganciclovir.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the rates of leukopenia, neutropenia and antiviral prophylaxis&#xD;
           discontinuation due to side effects of antiviral prophylaxis with&#xD;
           ganciclovir/valganciclovir in CMV mismatch lung transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the rates of ganciclovir/valganciclovir resistance mutations in CMV DNA from&#xD;
           mismatch lung transplant patients with breakthrough CMV viremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Method/Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, non-interventional study in 40 CMV&#xD;
      mismatch lung transplant patients receiving standard of care prophylaxis according to each&#xD;
      center. At baseline the patients medical history will be reviewed with them. Post transplant&#xD;
      weeks 1 to 24 or 52 a CMV Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be done every two weeks.&#xD;
      Standard of care blood work and the patients chart will be monitored to look for any relevant&#xD;
      side effects or changes in medication. In case CMV viremia is detected during prophylaxis,&#xD;
      the local PI can decide either to treat the CMV infection with therapeutic dose of antivirals&#xD;
      (ganciclovir, valganciclovir or Foscarnet) or to maintain prophylaxis and CMV PCR monitoring.&#xD;
      In all cases of CMV breakthrough viremia, a whole blood or plasma sample will be sent to&#xD;
      Provincial Microbiology Lab in Edmonton to perform antiviral resistance by next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing. From post transplant weeks 24 to 36 or 52 to 64 weekly CMV PCR will be done as&#xD;
      per standard of care, all other standard of care blood work will also be monitored. Chart&#xD;
      reviews will be completed to look for any relevant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of data the investigator will have the support of the Northern Alberta&#xD;
      Clinical Trials and Research Centre (NACTRC). Incidence rate of breakthrough CMV viremia,&#xD;
      leukopenia, neutropenia and severe neutropenia will be calculated as number of case per 1,000&#xD;
      patients/week. The percentage of CMV infection post-prophylaxis in patients with and without&#xD;
      breakthrough CMV infection will be compared by Fisher's exact test. Cox-regression analysis&#xD;
      will be performed to identify independent variables associated with CMV breakthrough viremia.&#xD;
