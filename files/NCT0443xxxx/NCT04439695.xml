  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observer-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of TAP-V001 quadrivalent influenza vaccine in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened up to 14 days (Day -14 to Day 0) before randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the planned day of vaccination (Day 1), subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (N&#xD;
      = 30 subjects/group) to receive study vaccine or placebo by intramuscular (IM) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5 subjects per group (N = 20) will be enrolled in parallel initially, and&#xD;
      safety data through Day 8 will be collected. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)&#xD;
      will convene to review Day 8 safety data before any additional subjects will be enrolled. If&#xD;
      there are no safety concerns in the IDMC meeting, study enrollment will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and serum samples for safety laboratory tests and HAI titers will be obtained at&#xD;
      baseline on Day 1 before administration of vaccine dose and after vaccination.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have read, understood, and signed the informed consent form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy adult males and females ages 18 to 49 years, inclusive at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index (BMI) of ≥18 and ≤34 kg/m2 at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be in general good health before study participation with no clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that could interfere with study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;

             be able and willing to use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception during&#xD;
             the study and for 3 months after the study completion. A female subject is considered&#xD;
             to be a WOCBP after menarche and until she is in a postmenopausal state for 12&#xD;
             consecutive months (without an alternative medical cause) or otherwise permanently&#xD;
             sterile (for which acceptable methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,&#xD;
             and bilateral oophorectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
             before vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be able to attend all visits for the duration of the study and comply with all&#xD;
             study procedures, including completion of Diary Card according to the study schedule.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. History of an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would render vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the evaluation&#xD;
             of responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of ongoing clinical condition or medication or treatments that may adversely&#xD;
             affect the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals with any elevated (Grade 2 or higher) laboratory test assessed as&#xD;
             clinically significant by investigator at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals with any elevated (Grade 2 or higher) liver function enzyme at screening,&#xD;
             regardless of the appraisal of clinical significance (cannot be retested to qualify&#xD;
             for study). See below the criteria for excluding subjects with elevated liver enzymes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST): &gt;3 × upper limit&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)/gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): &gt;2.5 × ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active neoplastic disease (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer that was successfully&#xD;
             treated) or a history of any hematological malignancy. For this criterion, &quot;active&quot; is&#xD;
             defined as having received treatment within the past 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Long-term (greater than 2 weeks) use of oral or parenteral steroids or high-dose&#xD;
             inhaled steroids (&gt;800 μg/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within 6&#xD;
             months before screening (nasal and topical steroids are allowed)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of autoimmune or inflammatory disease&#xD;

             delayed for full recovery if acceptable to the investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Individuals currently participating or planning to participate in a study that&#xD;
             involves an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, or medication); or&#xD;
             who have received an experimental agent within 1 month before enrollment in this&#xD;
             study; or who expect to receive another experimental agent during participation in&#xD;
             this study; or who intend to donate blood during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Receipt of immunoglobulin or another blood product within the 3 months before&#xD;
             enrollment in this study or those who expect to receive immunoglobulin or another&#xD;
             blood product during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Individuals who plan to receive another vaccine, including seasonal influenza vaccine,&#xD;
             during the entire 6-month study period.&#xD;
