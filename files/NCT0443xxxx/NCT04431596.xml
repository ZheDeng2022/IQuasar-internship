  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BHSAI is developing a computational system that provides early alerts of a rise in core body&#xD;
      temperature to help reduce the risk of heat injury in the field and during training. The goal&#xD;
      of the body temperature alerting system is to use it during rest, exercise in the heat and&#xD;
      during body cooling. Using this system during cooling will allow healthcare professionals and&#xD;
      military personnel monitor core temperature to ensure cooling is effective (and prevent&#xD;
      hypothermia). Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation is to validate a body&#xD;
      temperature alerting system using physiological responses that occur during rest, exercise in&#xD;
      the heat and during body cooling. Multiple cooling modalities will be validated. The&#xD;
      effectiveness of each cooling modality (passive cooling, mist-fan cooling, hand/forearm&#xD;
      immersion) on physiological variables after exercise in the heat will be assessed. Lastly,&#xD;
      subject characteristics (demographic and anthropometric characteristics) will be examined to&#xD;
      examine their effect on physiological variables during exercise in the heat and during body&#xD;
      cooling with each cooling modality.&#xD;

      The study will be completed in the following timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing Visit 2-4: Trial 1, 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit specific information is described below, however, specific data collection protocols&#xD;
      for dependent variables and procedures are included below the description of the study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Baseline and VO2max Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are approved to participate will be scheduled for a baseline and VO2max&#xD;
      testing day. Upon arrival to the lab, subjects will provide a urine sample in a clean urine&#xD;
      cup. Urine specific gravity and urine color will be assessed. Nude body mass will be also be&#xD;
      recorded. Privacy will be afforded for each participant while obtaining body mass measures by&#xD;
      taking measurements with the participant alone in a private room behind a solid, closed door,&#xD;
      and the research reading the scale outside of the room. Participants will only be permitted&#xD;
      to continue to the VO2max test if the euhydrated criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG)&#xD;
      &lt;1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure proper hydration status. Height will be&#xD;
      measured with a tape measure on Visit 1. Percent body fat will be calculated using a 7-site&#xD;
      evaluation of skin fold thickness using skin fold calipers. A researcher will use appropriate&#xD;
      grasping technique to measure skin fold thickness on the chest, iliac, tricep, calf,&#xD;
      shoulder, abdomen, and thigh. This will take less than 5 minutes to complete. This&#xD;
      information will be used to describe the subject demographics. Participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to complete a maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test on a treadmill in a thermoneutral&#xD;
      environment. This test will provide aerobic fitness levels of the participants. This visit&#xD;
      will take approximately 1-2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2-3: Trials 1, 2, 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant numbers will be randomly assigned, and trials will be ordered with a random&#xD;
      number generator and assigned to a participant number. These orders will be counterbalanced&#xD;
      between participants to ensure that there is not an order effect, and each participant will&#xD;
      complete three trials as part of the study. Participants will be allowed to make-up trial&#xD;
      visits if they are sick, suffer an injury or do not meet hydration requirements. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked if they have a current illness or taking medications to determine whether they&#xD;
      can complete the exercise trial. The participant's visit will be rescheduled if they have a&#xD;
      fever, current illness or taking medications that influence body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete three trials on three separate days in a randomized counter&#xD;
      balanced order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Cooling Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Passive Cooling&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mist-fan Cooling&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Forearm Immersion&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol and recovery portions of this study will be conducted in a climatic&#xD;
      chamber with ambient temperature approximately 30-40C and relative humidity at approximately&#xD;
      30-70%. Participants will drink ad libitum throughout the exercise trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the lab, participants will be asked to indicate if they have consumed alcohol&#xD;
      or caffeine in the last 24 hours and 12 hours, respectively. They will not be asked to&#xD;
      specify exactly what they have consumed, but if they provide a positive indication, their&#xD;
      trial will be rescheduled for another day. Participants will provide a small urine sample in&#xD;
      a clean urine cup, and a nude body mass will be measured. Upon arrival to the lab, hydration&#xD;
      status will be assessed by urine specific gravity, nude body mass and urine color.&#xD;
      Participants will only be permitted to continue to the exercise trial if the euhydrated&#xD;
      criteria of a urine specific gravity (USG) &lt;1.025 is met. If the participant arrives with a&#xD;
      USG between 1.020 and 1.025, the subject will be asked to drink 500 mL of water to ensure&#xD;
      proper hydration status. Participants will be given instructions at the prior visit about how&#xD;
      to obtain desired hydration status for the upcoming trial. Participants will insert a rectal&#xD;
      probe and wear a heart rate monitor strap. Additionally, participants will wear 7-site skin&#xD;
      temperature sensors. Researchers will apply the skin temperature sensors with medical tape to&#xD;
      the participants' chest, upper arm, thigh, neck, abdomen, thigh, back, and calf. The&#xD;
      participants will also be asked to complete a subjective sleep questionnaire upon arriving to&#xD;
      the lab. Participants will wear a battle dress uniform (BDU) during all exercise and rest&#xD;
      blocks. Three BDU sizes for the blouse and pants (small, medium, large) will be available for&#xD;
      the participants. A belt will be used to ensure the BDU fits appropriately. Participants will&#xD;
      not be able to keep the BDU- BDUs will be washed (according to manufacturer's instructions)&#xD;
      and re-used for participants. BDU manufacturer's instructions is identical to standard&#xD;
      washing cycle (detergent and washing machine dry). Participants will wear the wrist-based&#xD;
      devices (provided by BHSAI) on their non-dominant arm throughout the testing. The wrist&#xD;
      device must be placed approximately 1-inch proximal to the wrist and be fitted snuggly for&#xD;
      accurate heart-rate measurements. The wrist device is used to estimate heart rate using&#xD;
      infrared technology. The wrist device estimates of heart rate will be compared to the polar&#xD;
      heart rate monitor (gold standard). The body alerting system uses heart rate from the wrist&#xD;
      device and the environmental conditions to estimate body temperature. The sponsor of the&#xD;
      study will use rectal temperature and the 7-site skin temperature sensors to alter the&#xD;
      algorithm (not in real time- from the collected data) to better estimate body temperature.&#xD;
      The future goal is to have the body alerting system imbedded in the watch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will enter the environmental chamber and sit for 30 minutes to become&#xD;
      equilibrated. The environmental chamber will be set to 36C ambient temperature, 30% relative&#xD;
      humidity After baseline measures of heart rate, rectal temperature, participants will&#xD;
      complete the perceptual indices. Participants will also complete an environmental symptoms&#xD;
      questionnaire (ESQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will consist of three, 50-minute intervals of walking and running at approximately&#xD;
      30-50% of VO2max and 60-80% of VO2max, respectively. Each 50-minute exercise block with be&#xD;
      followed by a 30-minute break where cooling will occur. Participants will be allowed to drink&#xD;
      ad libitum throughout the exercise trial. The participant will be cooled for approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes with their assigned cooling modality. Rectal temperature, skin temperature, heart&#xD;
      rate, perceptual measures, and mood will be collected at various time points before, during,&#xD;
      and after exercise and cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Passive Cooling: Participants will be asked to sit in a chair in the climate chamber for&#xD;
      passive cooling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mist-fan cooling: A mist-fan will be placed in front of the participant during mist-fan&#xD;
      cooling. Participants will be asked to roll up their BDU sleeves to increase skin surface&#xD;
      area. The temperature of the mist and wind speed of the fan will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forearm immersion: The participant will place their forearm in approximately 20C water during&#xD;
      forearm immersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be divided into two separate phases. A pilot study will be first&#xD;
      conducted in which the first two participants will complete all study laboratory visits. Data&#xD;
      from those trials will be shared with the sponsor for review before continuation of data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the same procedures for the pilot testing as regular testing. Pilot&#xD;
      testing data will be included in the dataset. Following approval from the sponsor, data&#xD;
      collection will resume. Each trial will be approximately 4-5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All devices will be properly cleaned according to manufacturer's instruction prior to use by&#xD;
      other participants.&#xD;
