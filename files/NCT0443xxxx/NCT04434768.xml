  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells (UCMSCs) in patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke via a combination of intra arterial&#xD;
      (IA) and intravenous (IV) stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01&#xD;
      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via&#xD;
      IA and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not&#xD;
      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be&#xD;
      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and&#xD;
      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive&#xD;
      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke in the United&#xD;
      States.Stroke is a leading cause of death, along with cancer and coronary heart disease, and&#xD;
      the most common cause of physical disability in adults. Moreover, stroke causes a greater&#xD;
      loss of healthy life years, as measured in disability adjusted life years, than other&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating Stroke and produced by Ever Supreme&#xD;
      Bio Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its&#xD;
      effectiveness for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke. The UMSC01 has been&#xD;
      demonstrated its effective effect in the animal models of stroke in the current studies. The&#xD;
      acute stroke rats receiving intracerebral UMSC01 transplantation showed significantly&#xD;
      improved neurological function compared to vehicle-treated control rats.&#xD;
