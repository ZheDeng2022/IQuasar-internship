  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body esteem influences the physical appearance, which can be a social brake. To enhance&#xD;
      the socio-professional insertion of persons with severe mental disorders, the investigators&#xD;
      developed a group program about self-presentation and body esteem. The study's objective is&#xD;
      to understand the body esteem impact on socio-professional insertion, and how to improve that&#xD;
      with a dedicated group program, for patients in a psychosocial rehabilitation center&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a group program centered on the image and the presentation of the&#xD;
      self, with the intervention of professionals of the image of the body, such as&#xD;
      socio-hairdresser, socio-beautician, allows a better socio-professional inclusion, through an&#xD;
      improvement in body self-esteem. Taking care of yourself will require different approaches&#xD;
      such as advice on hygiene, becoming aware of your body, experimenting with beauty treatments&#xD;
      and having the means to reproduce them at home. We will compare our IPS program (Image and&#xD;
      Presentation of Self), with the usual management in the care center (TAU = &quot;Treatment As&#xD;
      Usual&quot;)&#xD;
