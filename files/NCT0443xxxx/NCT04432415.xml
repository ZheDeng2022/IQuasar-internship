  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries (coronal and root) is highly prevalent in older adults. It is important to&#xD;
      identify and implement the most effective methods that prevent the formation of root caries&#xD;
      lesions and inhibit existing lesions at the community level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical trial will be conducted in three groups of adults 60 years old and older,&#xD;
      comparing the application of silver diamine fluoride solution and sodium fluoride varnish in&#xD;
      dental root surfaces with caries and sound root surfaces. The objectives are to determine&#xD;
      over a 30-month period which of the two agents is most effective in reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      root caries, and which is most effective in arresting active root caries lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the incidence of root caries will be lower in the group of subjects treated with&#xD;
      silver diamine fluoride compared to sodium fluoride varnish. The arrest of active root&#xD;
      lesions will be higher when using silver diamine fluoride compared to sodium fluoride&#xD;
      varnish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed informed consent will be requested from persons 60 years and over, residents of four&#xD;
      long-term care centers and attendees of a day care center in four central states of Mexico:&#xD;
      Mexico City, Cuernavaca City, Oaxaca City and Toluca City. All facilities are administered by&#xD;
      the National System for Integral Family Development (IFD), a public welfare institution that&#xD;
      works at the federal and state levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three groups will be formed (60 participants in each), two groups will be administered each&#xD;
      of the agents, the third group will be the control group. All groups will receive dental&#xD;
      health education (oral hygiene, instructions for care and hygiene of removable dental&#xD;
      prosthesis, information on prevention of coronal and root caries and periodontal diseases).&#xD;
      The preventive agents will be administered according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations will be carried out at baseline 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. The&#xD;
      incidence of root caries among the groups will be compared with the percentage of active root&#xD;
      lesions that were arrested and that remained inactive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the greater efficacy of silver diamine fluoride is proven, it can be proposed for use in&#xD;
      caries preventive programs for older persons, reducing the risk of tooth loss and improving&#xD;
      quality of life. It will also serve as a guide for dental surgeon in-office decision-making&#xD;
      regarding the method to use to prevent and limit root caries lesions in older adults at risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increase in the incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases, including oral&#xD;
      problems in older persons. Coronal and root caries, and periodontitis represent the main&#xD;
      causes of tooth loss, and in older adults they have a great impact on quality of life,&#xD;
      nutritional status, social life, and the increased risk of systemic problems related to&#xD;
      dental infectious processes. At present, older adults have more remaining teeth and dental&#xD;
      caries is highly prevalent. It is important to investigate and implement methods that prevent&#xD;
      the formation of new carious lesions and that arrest existing lesions. The utilization of&#xD;
      silver diamine fluoride as a method to prevent coronal caries has been recognized and has&#xD;
      proven to be highly effective in treating dentin hypersensitivity and arresting active&#xD;
      lesions, also it is easy to apply. Therefore, it is important and necessary to implement&#xD;
      methods that avoid the formation of lesions and that inhibit the root caries lesions already&#xD;
      present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If greater effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride in preventing and arresting active root&#xD;
      caries is confirmed, its use in conjunction with oral health education can be proposed as a&#xD;
      preventive method to be included in oral health programs in institutionalized persons in whom&#xD;
      dental care and attention are less frequent. Its ease of application, the longer time between&#xD;
      applications and its cost can facilitate better oral care. On the other hand, the results can&#xD;
      guide professionals in clinical practice in making decisions regarding the most appropriate&#xD;
      method to prevent and arrest root caries lesions in their patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The incidence of root caries (new root caries lesions) after 30 months will be&#xD;
      lower on root surfaces that have been treated with silver diamine fluoride solution (38%&#xD;
      concentration [44800 ppm]) compared to those treated with sodium fluoride varnish (5%&#xD;
      concentration [22,600 ppm]) and to those in the control group (artificial saliva).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of active root caries lesions arrested at baseline will be higher in people who&#xD;
      have been treated with silver diamine fluoride solution (38% concentration [44,800 ppm])&#xD;
      compared to those treated with sodium fluoride varnish (5% concentration [22600 ppm]) and&#xD;
      with the control group (artificial saliva).&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify whether the annual application of silver diamine fluoride solution combined with&#xD;
      an individualized oral health education program is more effective than biannual application&#xD;
      of sodium fluoride varnish combined with an individualized oral health education program and&#xD;
      a group control (artificial saliva and oral health individualized educational program) in the&#xD;
      reduction of the incidence of root caries and in the arrest of active root caries lesions&#xD;
      over a period of 30 months in a population of adults over 60 years of age in residents of 4&#xD;
      gerontological centers and a DIF day care center, in 2017-2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the incidence of root caries after 30 months in three groups receiving the&#xD;
           annual application of silver diamine fluoride solution (44800 ppm), the biannual&#xD;
           application of sodium fluoride varnish (22600 ppm) and the biannual application of&#xD;
           artificial saliva respectively, controlling for age, gender, frequency of toothbrushing,&#xD;
           use of dental floss, use of removable prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the number of active root carious lesions arrested at baseline after annual&#xD;
           application of silver diamine fluoride solution (44,800 ppm) and biannual application of&#xD;
           sodium fluoride varnish (22,600 ppm) and biannual application of artificial saliva, all&#xD;
           combined with an individualized oral health education program, controlling by age,&#xD;
           gender, frequency of toothbrushing, use of dental floss, use of removable prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To design and implement an individualized oral health education program on prevention&#xD;
           and treatment of root and coronal caries, promotion and reinforcement of toothbrushing,&#xD;
           and the proper care and cleaning of removable prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Area: clinical research Study type: Intervention Study design: randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial. Study characteristics: prospective, longitudinal, comparative. Participant&#xD;
      allocation: randomized Study classification: efficacy study Intervention model: parallel&#xD;
      groups Masking: blind (participant) Main purpose: Prevention Study population Residents of&#xD;
      four gerontological centers &quot;Arturo Mundet&quot; (Mexico City), &quot;Vicente García Torres&quot; (Mexico&#xD;
      City), &quot;Los Tamayo&quot; (Oaxaca, Oaxaca) and &quot;Olga Tamayo&quot; (Cuernavaca, Morelos ) and a day care&#xD;
      center in Santa Ana Tlapaltitlán (Toluca, State of Mexico). All centers are administered by&#xD;
      the National System for Integral Family Development, a public welfare institution that works&#xD;
      at the federal and state levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size Three groups of size 60 are required, in a no probabilistic convenience sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration will be carried out in the same way in the three groups using a mini&#xD;
      applicator brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: biannual application of artificial saliva on exposed root surfaces. Sodium&#xD;
      Fluoride varnish: biannual application of sodium fluoride varnish (22,600 ppm) on exposed&#xD;
      healthy root surfaces and application at baseline and biannually on active root lesions.&#xD;
      Silver Diamine Fluoride: annual application of silver diamine fluoride solution (44800ppm) on&#xD;
      exposed healthy root surfaces and alternate annual application of artificial saliva, as well&#xD;
      as initial and annual application on active root lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before data collection persons will be invited to participate, the purpose of the study will&#xD;
      be explained, and if they accept will be examined to identify whether they meet the selection&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants have been selected and signed the informed consent, they will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The baseline questionnaire on knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and practices, the clinical evaluation and the initial application of the&#xD;
      preventive agents or placebo, and the first personalized oral health education session will&#xD;
      be carried out.The clinical examination will be carried out in each center using a portable&#xD;
      dental unit and artificial light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations will be repeated at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months. The examiner will be&#xD;
      standardized for the evaluation of root caries using the International Caries Detection and&#xD;
      Assessment System (ICDAS) for root caries, and in the assessment of dental plaque and dental&#xD;
      calculus.&#xD;
