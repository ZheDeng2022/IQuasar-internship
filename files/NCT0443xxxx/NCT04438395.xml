      This is a prospective, single center, non-randomized, open-label, single arm study in which&#xD;
      we will gather data and physician input for the assessment and further development of the&#xD;
      KODEX - EPD functions for assessing tissue pressure, tissue thickness, lesion transmurality.&#xD;
      The study will include up to 30 subjects. We will enroll patients with atrial flutter and&#xD;
      patients with atrial fibrillation who are scheduled to undergo RF ablation of the&#xD;
      cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI). Both male and female subjects who meet all eligibility criteria&#xD;
      and give written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. We will be assessing the&#xD;
      feasibility of the KODEX-EPD tissue pressure (TP), tissue thickness and lesion transmurality&#xD;
      applications.&#xD;

reproducibility of thickness assessment with KODEX-EPD will be calculated from repeat assessments of the same line (measured in mm)&#xD;
relative thickness values will be compared against relative thickness values measured with ICE (measured in mm)&#xD;
relative thickness values will be compared against relative thickness values derived from pre-procedural CT (measured in mm)</description>
