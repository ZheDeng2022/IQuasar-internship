  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a combination of two drugs ipatasertib and&#xD;
      atezolizumab works as a treatment for residual cancer in the breast or lymph nodes and have&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following investigational drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab govitecan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label single-arm phase II study to evaluate the combination therapy of the&#xD;
      antibody drug conjugate, sacituzumab govitecan, and the anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab, in&#xD;
      patients with triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      laboratory evaluations, stool collection and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves the following investigational drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sacituzumab govitecan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atezolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for 18 weeks and will be followed for every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 40 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug or drug combination&#xD;
      works in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved atezolizumab (Tecentriq) for&#xD;
      residual triple negative breast cancer but it has been approved for advanced triple negative&#xD;
      breast cancer and other cancers. Atezolizumab is a protein that affects your immune system by&#xD;
      blocking the PD-L1 pathway. The PD-L1 pathway controls your body's natural immune response,&#xD;
      but for some types of cancer the immune system does not work as it should and is prevented&#xD;
      from attacking tumors. Atezolizumab works by blocking the PD-L1 pathway, which may help your&#xD;
      immune system identify and catch tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy)&#xD;
      for your specific disease, but it has been approved for patients with metastatic&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer who have been treated with 2 or more prior treatment regimens&#xD;
      for their cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan is composed of a chemotherapy drug, called&#xD;
      Irinotecan, which is attached to an antibody. Antibodies are proteins normally made by the&#xD;
      immune system that bind to substances that don't belong in the body to prevent harm. The&#xD;
      antibody in this study binds to certain types of cancer tumors.&#xD;
