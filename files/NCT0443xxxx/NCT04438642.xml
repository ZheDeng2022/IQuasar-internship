      Aim of study: is to asses biological and esthetical success of ceramic onlay restorations&#xD;
      while preparing the teeth using shoulder finish line preparation versus butt joint with bevel&#xD;
      preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with need to posterior onlay restoration (premolars and molars) will be allocated&#xD;
      into two groups either conventional (shoulder finish line) or conservative group (butt joint&#xD;
      with bevel), after tooth preparation impression, restoration fabrication, try in, cementation&#xD;
      and restoration will be evaluated two weeks post cementation then follow up will be held&#xD;
      every two months for 1 year.&#xD;

      -  Research objective: The aim of this study is to asses biological and esthetical success&#xD;
           of ceramic onlay restorations while preparing the teeth using shoulder finish line&#xD;
           preparation versus butt joint with bevel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 1: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, clinical,&#xD;
                radiographic examination, intraoral photographs and primary impression (alginate&#xD;
                impression*) for diagnostic cast construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 2: Tooth preparation according to its group either shoulder, or butt joint&#xD;
                with bevel preparation, secondary impression using addition silicone rubber base&#xD;
                material two step two viscosities technique and temporary restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 3: evaluation of e-max press onlay ceramic restoration on the cast then&#xD;
                evaluation intra-oral on the prepared tooth and permanent cementation of the final&#xD;
                restoration using adhesive resin cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 4: Every 2 months post operatively follow-up visit for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PICOTS P: Population: Patients requiring posterior onlays. I: Intervention: butt&#xD;
                joint finish line with bevel preparation for ceramic onlay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: comparator: shoulder finish line preparation for ceramic onlay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O: Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Postoperative sensitivity Secondary: Marginal discoloration Tertiary: Secondary&#xD;
      Caries T: Time: 1 year. S: Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research question For patients requiring posterior onlays, does the use of conservative&#xD;
           preparation offer better biological response and esthetics when compared to conventional&#xD;
           onlay preparation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be treated in visits designated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 1: Preoperative records, face-to-face adherence reminder session, clinical,&#xD;
                radiographic examination, intraoral photographs and primary impression (alginate&#xD;
                impression) for diagnostic cast construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 2: Tooth preparation according to its group either shoulder, or butt joint&#xD;
                with bevel preparation, secondary impression using addition silicone rubber base&#xD;
                material two step two viscosities technique and temporary restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 3: evaluation of e-max press onlay ceramic restoration on the cast then&#xD;
                evaluation intra-oral on the prepared tooth and permanent cementation of the final&#xD;
                restoration using adhesive resin cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 4: Every 2 months post operatively follow-up visit for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Simple randomization will be done using computerized random number generator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dental colleague will allocate the participant patients into two groups with 1:1&#xD;
           allocation ratio by using computerized Sequence generation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double blinding (trial participants and outcome assessor)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two dental colleague assessors who are blinded about the aim of the study and&#xD;
           participant's allocation will be responsible for assessing the outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary 1ry: Postoperative sensitivity will be assessed by asking patients according to&#xD;
           modified USPHS criteria and given a score (Alpha, Bravo)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary 2ry outcome: Marginal discoloration will be assessed according to modified&#xD;
           USPHS criteria and given a score (Alpha, Bravo B1, Bravo B2, Charlie).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tertiary 3ry outcome: Secondary Caries will be assessed by visual and given a score&#xD;
           (Alpha, Bravo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plans to promote participant retention &amp; complete follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main investigator will record telephone numbers and address of the patients included&#xD;
           in the study. All patients will be given a phone call before the next appointment. Many&#xD;
           efforts will be done to promote participant retention such as, sending SMS greetings in&#xD;
           the feasts, any celebration and in his/ her birthday.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main investigator will enter patient data electronically. Patient files are to be&#xD;
           stored in Numerical order in a secured place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test or&#xD;
           Fisher's Exact test when applicable will be used for comparisons related to qualitative&#xD;
           variables. Friedman's test will be used to study the changes by time within each group.&#xD;
           Dunn's test will be used for pair-wise comparisons when Friedman's test is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The significance level will be set at P ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed&#xD;
           with IBM® SPSS® Statistics Version 20 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., an IBM Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Data monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main supervisor is responsible of data monitoring if harms arise, interim analysis&#xD;
           will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Harms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main investigator will record, document and treat any adverse effect like pain or&#xD;
           even failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expected risk to the human subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Possibility of restoration dislodgment (the patient should keep the restoration and&#xD;
                contact the researcher as soon as possible as the restoration will be assessed for&#xD;
                cementation or replacement).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Possibility of restoration fracture (the patient should keep the fractured part and&#xD;
                contact the researcher as soon as possible as a new restoration will be placed).&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. In case failure of the onlay restoration the tooth will be assessed for the new&#xD;
                required restorative modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researcher will discuss the trial with all patients. Patients will then be able to have&#xD;
           an informed discussion with the researcher. Researcher will obtain written consent from&#xD;
           patients willing to participate in the trial.&#xD;
