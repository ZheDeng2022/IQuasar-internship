  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood Maltreatment (CM) has highly deleterious effects on human development and is a&#xD;
      preventable known cause of enduring psychopathology in the United States. Infants and young&#xD;
      children are at particularly high risk for physical harm from abuse and neglect, comprising&#xD;
      over 60% of all child maltreatment fatalities. An increasing number of studies point to the&#xD;
      ability to target prevention of CM by estimating individual specific risk at the time of&#xD;
      birth, on the basis of readily-accessible data elements of birth records. This clinical trial&#xD;
      is a randomized controlled trial embedded within a prospective longitudinal study, in which&#xD;
      families of infants recruited prenatally or in the newborn period are randomized to an&#xD;
      enhanced level of engagement in resource navigation, which we refer to as Personalized&#xD;
      Education Regarding Clinical and Community Supports (PERCCS). The enhancement involves keying&#xD;
      recommendations for evidence-informed interventions for the prevention of CM to established&#xD;
      risk factors for ascertained within a family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parent longitudinal cohort study involves enrollment of a diverse population of families&#xD;
      of newborns (prenatally or in the immediate postnatal period) for the purpose of ascertaining&#xD;
      sociodemographic, psychological (eg. parental stress) and family psychiatric risk factors for&#xD;
      (a) child maltreatment (b) unmet service needs, and (c) adverse behavioral outcomes of the&#xD;
      children. Families are contacted quarterly to track acquisition of support services that are&#xD;
      relevant to the prevention of child maltreatment. At age 18 months early childhood behavioral&#xD;
      outcomes are ascertained, biomaterials collected, and official-report child maltreatment&#xD;
      records from the State of Missouri are individually cross-matched with identifiers of the&#xD;
      children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two major outcomes are examined:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first is whether the engagement protocol results in a higher level of acquisition and&#xD;
      active participation in recommended preventive intervention services by the families&#xD;
      (including home visitation, parental mental health care, evidence-based parenting education,&#xD;
      and others delineated in Table 1, see below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second is the rate of child maltreatment (CM) ascertained in official Missouri state&#xD;
      administrative records for which individual informed consent to individually-cross reference&#xD;
      is obtained by the families in the course of their enrollment in the parent longitudinal&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample: The sample will be recruited from the Washington University School of Medicine&#xD;
      Obstetrical Service within the Barnes Jewish Christian (BJC) Health System, on which there&#xD;
      are over 3000 Missouri childbirths per year, serving an urban population of families that are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by poverty. Fifty-five per cent of patients report a family&#xD;
      income less than $20,000, 65% of the mothers are unemployed, and the majority of the newborns&#xD;
      are on Medicaid or are Medicaid-eligible. In preliminary screening efforts, over one third of&#xD;
      the mothers reported their own childhood histories of maltreatment, and approximately one&#xD;
      half score in the clinical range for depressive symptomatology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A schematic summarizing study enrollment, participant randomization, and&#xD;
      ascertainment of outcomes is provided in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Approach and Design: N=400 families are in the process of being enrolled in the parent&#xD;
      longitudinal study. Among those who fall in an elevated risk category (upper 50% of the&#xD;
      sample for total count of established risk factors) we will randomize 150 families 2:1 to&#xD;
      Personalized Education Regarding Clinical and Community Supports (PERCCS) versus Usual Care.&#xD;
      Risk counts are calculated by the total number of established predictors of risk for CM&#xD;
      (itemized in Table 1) ascertained from birth records and: i) a screen for maternal&#xD;
      depression, ii) a screen for maternal childhood trauma, and iii) a screen for active intimate&#xD;
      partner violence. Utilization of community-based evidence-informed support services will be&#xD;
      ascertained at baseline and quarterly thereafter for all study participants. Official-report&#xD;
      Child Maltreatment data from Missouri state administrative data will be individually linked&#xD;
      with participant research records when the children reach 18 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERCCS involves i) a review with the mother of all family CM risks ascertained in the context&#xD;
      of their own individual screening ii) recommendations of community and clinical interventions&#xD;
      which substantively respond to those risks and are available to the subject (on the basis of&#xD;
      each individual subject's zip code, insurance, and eligibility for the interventions),&#xD;
      collectively the personalized family resource plan, iii) facilitation of contact between the&#xD;
      subject and the respective provider agencies to initiate enrollment; and iv) authorization&#xD;
      for the research team to share the personalized risk profile and support recommendations with&#xD;
      the infant's outpatient primary care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The community and clinical supports responsive to specific risk factors are listed in Table&#xD;
      1, which summarizes the array of evidence-informed preventions that will be presented to the&#xD;
      families, and the correspondence with each to specific CM risks ascertained within a family.&#xD;
      Table 2 depicts the set of scripts which are used by the study team to standardize all&#xD;
      aspects of the review of endorsed risks, their potential adverse effects on parenting, and&#xD;
      the opportunities for mitigation through evidence-informed intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive care as usual, including the provision of a summary document&#xD;
      itemizing key community supports for families of infants, a continuously-updated local&#xD;
      community resource handbook, a published parenting guide, and opportunity to enroll&#xD;
      free-of-charge in a virtual parenting education and developmental surveillance program,&#xD;
      babynavigator.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Utilization of Community Services (UCS) is a survey that will be used to ascertain&#xD;
      engagement of families in community supports and interventions, including tracking of both&#xD;
      frequency and duration. This survey is completed at the time of study enrollment to establish&#xD;
      a baseline, and quarterly thereafter until the completion of the study when a child reaches&#xD;
      18 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      State Records: The second primary outcome, rate of child maltreatment, will rely on official&#xD;
      state records from the State of Missouri Department of Social Services. Participants are&#xD;
      aware that accessing service records or CM report data are retrospective when acquired and do&#xD;
      not pose any risk or liability to them nor can it impact services received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Intent-to-treat analysis of impact of PERCCS on service utilization. We will calculate the&#xD;
      total proportion of evidence-informed services indicated by risk profiles of all families&#xD;
      within each group (the intervention group and the control group) and compare the groups using&#xD;
      chi square analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Intent-to-treat analysis of the impact of PERCCS on the occurrence of child maltreatment.&#xD;
      We will compare the rate of official-report abuse/neglect between the groups using chi square&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. (Secondary) We will conduct logistic regression analysis simultaneously examining the&#xD;
      effects of risk count and service access on official report child maltreatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomized controlled trial has adequate statistical power to detect an odds ratio of 2.0&#xD;
      for the effect of PERRCS in reducing child maltreatment outcome.&#xD;
