      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are spread by mosquitos. These diseases have a major impact on&#xD;
      public health. This is especially true in in Southeast Asia. Non-human primates (such as&#xD;
      macaques) could play an essential role in spreading these diseases. Researchers want to&#xD;
      further understand the relationship between humans and these primates. They want to see how&#xD;
      this affects how mosquito-borne viruses are spread in Southeast Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the prevalence of Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus in the blood of&#xD;
      people who live close to long-tailed macaques in Thailand and Cambodia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people aged 18-55 who have lived or worked within approximately 10 kilometers of the&#xD;
      Wat Amphae Phnom monkey habitat in Kampong Speu, Cambodia, for a minimum of 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened in person through an interview. Their medical history will be&#xD;
      reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give information about themselves. This will include sex, age, and&#xD;
      behaviors related to the spread of mosquito-borne disease. For example, they will be asked&#xD;
      about the number of water containers at their home. They will be asked about recent travel.&#xD;
      They will be asked about the extent of their contact with the macaques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give a blood sample....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arboviral epidemics continue to emerge suddenly and spread of disease is unpredictable. The&#xD;
      2015-16 Zika epidemic resulted in a high case number in Thailand, but not in neighboring&#xD;
      Cambodia. It is known that nonhuman primates (NHPs) are important reservoirs of arboviruses,&#xD;
      but the importance of their epidemiological role in the transmission of arboviruses is not&#xD;
      clearly understood. While transmission dynamics are complex and require consideration of many&#xD;
      variables, primate reservoirs are not routinely sampled, particularly in Southeast Asia,&#xD;
      because of the level of operational complexity and skill required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we propose a serological survey for evidence of Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV),&#xD;
      and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exposure in long-tailed macaques and human adults who live or&#xD;
      work in close proximity to these monkeys in Thailand and Cambodia. We hypothesize that ZIKV&#xD;
      seroprevalence in both humans and macaques will be higher in Thailand than Cambodia. With the&#xD;
      current rise of arboviral diseases around the world, we hope the results of this study&#xD;
      contribute to better understanding of the epidemiology and burden of arboviral diseases in&#xD;
      this region.&#xD;
