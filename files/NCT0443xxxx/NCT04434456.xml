    <textblock>
      Carotid artery aneurysm (CAA) is a relatively infrequent, but significant clinical condition&#xD;
      with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic implications. CAA affects laminal flow in the&#xD;
      carotid artery implicating the risk of thrombus formation in the aneurysm cavity, and&#xD;
      subsequent ischemic stroke from distal embolization. Another important clinical problem&#xD;
      related to the CAA is a possible aneurysm dissection and rupture. Symptomatic CAA and&#xD;
      increasing dimensions of CAA institute unquestioned indications for the CAA treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical carotid aneurysm repair bears a significant risk (periprocedural stroke, cranial&#xD;
      nerve damage, carotid artery ligation). Therefore endovascular techniques of CAA exclusion&#xD;
      were developed. Covered stents, stent-grafts, and combined stenting and aneurysm embolization&#xD;
      with coils were applied. However, covered stents were demonstrated to increase the restenosis&#xD;
      risk, and other complications such as CAA neck endo-leak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newer technique involves the flow diversion by implantation of stent in dense-structured&#xD;
      stent (such as Wallstent) or stent-in-stent implantation. In this case a luminary flow&#xD;
      dominates over aneurysm filling, which is limited by stent structure. Gradual thrombosis and&#xD;
      occlusion of aneurysm cavity and healing of aneurysm follows.This method disadvantage was&#xD;
      related to necessity of double stent load and increased restenosis risk (double metal layer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These issues were addressed only recently by the double layer mesh stents that demonstrate&#xD;
      natural flow diverting capabilities. CGuard Stent system is a self-expandable stent covered&#xD;
      with PET mesh (MicroNet) that prevents plaque protrusion into the vessel lumen. In addition,&#xD;
      in low flow conditions MicroNet can act as the flow diverter. These stents are routinely&#xD;
      implanted in elevated risk plaques in high reference centers in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several published observations indicate the CGuard stent also demonstrates flow-diverting&#xD;
      capabilities, but the systematic observation of such application was not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-HEAL is a non-randomized, single arm, open label academic observational study of CGuard&#xD;
      stent implantation in carotid arteries in patients with symptomatic, dissecting or enlarging&#xD;
      carotid artery aneurysm. Procedures are performed according to the center routine, with&#xD;
      application of proximal or distal embolic protection device (if feasible), and standard&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy according to the current guidelines.&#xD;
