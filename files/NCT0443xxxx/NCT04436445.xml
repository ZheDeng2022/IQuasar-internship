      PURPOSE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of dry cupping on women with chronic&#xD;
      pelvic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have examined the efficacy of dry cupping on acupoints for various&#xD;
      pain-related conditions. They showed good result . However, no studies up to date has been&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of dry cupping in treating Chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, this study is&#xD;
      the first one which aims to investigate the effect of dry cupping on women suffering from&#xD;
      Chronic pelvic pain. This study may expand the role of physiotherapy in woman's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no effect of bioptron light therapy on postmenopausal osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no effect of dry cupping on chronic pelvic pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pelvic pain is a highly prevalent debilitating disease with negative impact on the&#xD;
      quality of life and productivity of women. The estimated prevalence of CPP is 3.8% among&#xD;
      women aged 15-73 years, ranging from 14% to 24% among women of reproductive age, with a&#xD;
      direct impact on their marital, social and professional life .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific diagnosis for CPP is often difficult; no diagnosis is made in 60% of patients .&#xD;
      Treatment of these patients remains a challenge due to the diverse clinical signs and&#xD;
      phenotypes. Several non-surgical as well as surgical strategies exist. However, many of the&#xD;
      therapy approaches seem to have only limited effect in managing CPP . Additionally, many of&#xD;
      the recommended medical and surgical interventions have a potential for harm in a proportion&#xD;
      of women . Accordingly, an alternative therapeutic approach is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dry cupping is considered to be a noninvasive and inexpensive technique, used worldwide to&#xD;
      treating patients with pain syndromes . It is in fact a type of physical therapy which is&#xD;
      applied by the specialists of acupuncture or other individuals. It improves the subcutaneous&#xD;
      blood flow and, as a result, stimulates the autonomic nervous system and reduces the pain .&#xD;
      The application of suction on selected acupoints produces hyperemia or hemostasis, which may&#xD;
      result in a therapeutic effect .When compared to acupuncture, cupping therapy is a&#xD;
      non-invasive therapy with relatively shorter treatment duration and less treatment cost .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have examined the efficacy of dry cupping on acupoints for various&#xD;
      pain-related conditions. They showed good results . However, no studies up to date has been&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of dry cupping in treating CPP. Therefore, this study is the first one&#xD;
      which aims to investigate the effect of dry cupping on women suffering from CPP. This study&#xD;
      may expand the role of physiotherapy in woman's health&#xD;

    <description>It is a reliable and valid instrument that is easier and quicker to use in clinical research than the McGill pain questionnaire (MPQ). It will be used to evaluate pain intensity for each woman in both groups before and after the end of treatment program. It consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a questionnaire that assesses the impact of pelvic pain on women, that has high utility, sound psychometric performance, easy scoring, and high reliability, 10-item questionnaire consisted of 8 Likert questions and 2 supplemental, nonscored questions, the questionnaire targeted the pelvic pain population well, had appropriate Likert categories, constituted a unidimensional scale, and showed internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was highPelvic Pain Impact Questionnaire assesses the life impact of pelvic pain. It uses patient-generated language, is easily administered and scored, has very strong psychometric properties, and it is suitable for research and clinical settings across primary, secondary, and tertiary care</description>

    <description>represents the location and clinical importance of each acupoint. First, the position of the patient will be supine lying for SP6, SP9, KI6, GB34 and CV6 acupoints and it will be prone lying for B23 acupoint. Second, the skin will be cleaned by alcohol then cups will be placed on the acupoints. Dry cupping for SP6, SP9, KI6 and GB34 acupoints will be applied using small cups while dry cupping for CV6 and B23 will be applied using large cups. Third, a negative pressure will be applied with a manual handle. Finally, the cups will be removed after 5 to 15 minutes by pressing one side of the skin with a finger to release the vacuum slowly.</description>
