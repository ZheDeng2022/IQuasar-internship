  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection affected 292 million individuals in the world,&#xD;
      translating to about 3.9% of global prevalence. Up to 40% of patients with CHB will develop&#xD;
      liver-related complications. Many patients require long-term oral antiviral therapy since&#xD;
      off-treatment sustained virological control can only be achieved in a minority of patients.&#xD;
      It is uncommon for patients taking long-term antivirals to be able to stop the treatment if&#xD;
      favorable factors are not present. Those include low viral load, long enough duration of&#xD;
      treatment, and absence of cirrhosis. Some studies have found that inducing a mild flare is&#xD;
      beneficial for achieving functional cure in chronic hepatitis B infection. There is lack of&#xD;
      data in the immunological and virological profile in patients who stop their long-term&#xD;
      antiviral therapy, and in those who developed flare after treatment cessation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB) affected 292 million individuals in the world in 2016&#xD;
      according to the Polaris Observatory estimation, translating to about 3.9% global prevalence.&#xD;
      Up to 40% of patients with CHB will develop liver-related complications and there were&#xD;
      890,000 deaths from these complications in 2015. Current antiviral therapy is aimed to&#xD;
      achieve effective viral suppression, biochemical remission, histological improvement, and&#xD;
      risk reductions in liver-related complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Many&#xD;
      patients require long-term oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) since off-treatment sustained&#xD;
      virological control can only be achieved in a minority of patients. For HBeAg-negative CHB&#xD;
      patients, variable rates of durable virological response were observed after cessation of NA.&#xD;
      Only a small proportion of HBeAg-negative Asian patients (&lt;10%) can successfully stop NA&#xD;
      without virological breakthrough, compared to more than 60% of Caucasian patients maintaining&#xD;
      a durable virologic response and even HBsAg seroclearance in up to 30%. Therefore, current&#xD;
      guidelines in general recommend indefinite duration of NA therapy in HBeAg-negative patients,&#xD;
      unless guaranteed close monitoring could be provided after cessation of NA in suitable&#xD;
      subjects. Favourable factors predictive of partial cure include lower baseline HBV DNA, lower&#xD;
      HBsAg titre or hepatitis B core-related antigen at NA cessation and longer duration of&#xD;
      consolidation therapy in HBeAg-negative patients. There is lack of data in the immunological&#xD;
      and virological profile in patients who stop their long-term NA, and in those who developed&#xD;
      post-NA cessation flare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study the virological and immunological profile in patients who&#xD;
      stopped long-term NA therapy, with or without post-NA cessation flare. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators would like to investigate the effect of mild flare after monitored NA-cessation&#xD;
      on subsequent virological activity and HBsAg seroclearance.&#xD;
