  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of Candesartan when used in patients with&#xD;
      Bipolar Disorder, in addition to their medication treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacological options for the treatment of Bipolar disorder (BD) are limited and a large&#xD;
      proportion of patients does not show adequate response to treatment, especially in the case&#xD;
      of bipolar depression. It has been hypothesized that dysfunctions in the renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system (RAS) may be involved in the pathophysiology of BD. We propose a double-blind,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, proof-of-concept trial to investigate the effects&#xD;
      of candesartan, an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist capable to cross the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier, as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of bipolar depression. Bipolar patients on a&#xD;
      depressive episode will be randomly assigned to undergo two consecutive 4-week treatment&#xD;
      periods with either candesartan (4 mg daily) or placebo in a crossover study. At the&#xD;
      beginning of each treatment period, participants will complete a resting-state functional MRI&#xD;
      scan, to be performed 1.5 hours after the first dose of the study medication. Subjects will&#xD;
      be followed weekly and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) will be adopted&#xD;
      as the primary outcome measure. Response will be defined as a decrease equal or higher than&#xD;
      50% in the MADRS score from the time of study entry to the 4th week of each treatment period.&#xD;
      Possible associations between changes in brain connectivity (measured through resting state&#xD;
      functional MRI) and subsequent response to treatment will also be analyzed.&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Assessment Screening Tool scores at the end of each treatment period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment Screening Tool (FAST) identifies factors that may influence problem behaviors. It is a self-report checklist that contains 16 items, with each questions being marked as either &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;not applicable&quot;. The checklist is designed to identify whether maladaptive behavior is maintained in four domains: attention/preferred items, escape from tasks/activities, sensory stimulation, pain attenuation.</description>

    <measure>Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at the end of each treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The YMRS is one of the most frequently utilized rating scales to assess manic symptoms. The scale has 11 items, based on the patient's subjective report and observations made during the clinical interview. Higher scores indicate a greater severity of manic symptoms. Given the cyclic nature of BD, the YMRS will be utilized to monitor patients as for the possibility of a manic switch over each four-week treatment period.</description>
