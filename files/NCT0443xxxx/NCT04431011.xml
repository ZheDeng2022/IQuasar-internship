      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training in a new motor skill often involves periods of active practice and periods of rest.&#xD;
      During early motor skill learning, improvements in performance usually happen during the&#xD;
      short rest periods between practice sessions. Researchers want to use improved imaging&#xD;
      techniques to study the contributions of specific parts of the brain to how people learn and&#xD;
      retain movement skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn the part played by different layers in the brain in retaining a newly learned&#xD;
      movement skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed, English-speaking people age 18-50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and neurological history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. During the MRI,&#xD;
      they will lie in the scanner. The scanner makes noise. They will get earplugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have behavior testing. A specific order of keys will be displayed on a&#xD;
      computer screen. Participants will practice typing the keys with their left hand 36 times (in&#xD;
      10-second blocks). They will repeat this test with a random order of keys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will see single numbers displayed one after the other on the computer screen.&#xD;
      They will make single tap responses using the finger that corresponds with the number on the&#xD;
      screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have up to 4 study sessions. Each session will take about 5 hours.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training on a novel motor skill often involves periods of active practice interspersed with&#xD;
      periods of rest. During early motor skill learning, performance improvements develop&#xD;
      primarily during short offline rest periods that occur between practice blocks. These&#xD;
      performance gains during rest have been referred to as 'micro-offline consolidation'. Primary&#xD;
      motor cortex (M1) is a crucial contributor to skill consolidation, however, due to the poor&#xD;
      spatial specificity and vascular biases of available imaging methods, the specific neural&#xD;
      mechanisms of consolidation in M1 are not known. Recent innovations in functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) have made it possible to measure functional changes across cortical&#xD;
      layers. This study will use these techniques to investigate the contributions of specific&#xD;
      cortical layers in M1 to motor skill learning and consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the correlation between activity in superficial M1 cortical&#xD;
      layers and behavioral gains during microoffline rest periods. Additionally, we will evaluate&#xD;
      the role of superficial and deep cortical layers of M1 in the consolidation of motor skill&#xD;
      learning. To address this question, we will measure neural activations across cortical&#xD;
      laminae in M1 while participants consolidate a newly acquired motor skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint measures will be: 1) activity in superficial M1 cortical layers during&#xD;
      micro-offline rest periods, which will be measured using vascular space occupancy (VASO) MR&#xD;
      imaging and 2) behavioral gains during micro-offline rest periods measured as correct&#xD;
      sequence typing speed (sequences per second). The secondary endpoint measure will be the&#xD;
      ratio of activity between superficial and deep M1 layers during practice and during rest&#xD;
      periods compared to pre-learning and to post-learning rest and the localizing random&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory endpoints will include other fMRI measures that may relate learning with layer&#xD;
      activity. For example, we will use multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of activation data to:&#xD;
      (a) gain insight into the presence of layer-specific reactivation of sequence task&#xD;
      performance during rest periods; and (b) investigate whether this reactivation predicts&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
