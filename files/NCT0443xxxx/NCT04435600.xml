  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease in which skin cells build up and&#xD;
      develop thick, red and white scaly patches on the skin. There is an unmet medical need for&#xD;
      effective treatment in pediatric patients and this study is being done to evaluate&#xD;
      risankizumab in pediatric participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This study&#xD;
      will assess the change in disease symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risankizumab is a drug being studied for the treatment for plaque psoriasis in pediatric&#xD;
      participants. This study has 4 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Participants aged 12 &lt; 18 will receive a fixed dose of risankizumab. Part 2:&#xD;
      Participants aged 12 &lt; 18 will receive;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period A: Risankizumab or ustekinumab based on body weight followed by;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period B: Risankizumab or no treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period C: Re-treatment with risankizumab (if needed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 and Part 4: Participants aged 6 &lt; 12 will receive risankizumab based on body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 132 participants will be enrolled in approximately 50 sites worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risankizumab and ustekinumab are given as a subcutaneous (under the skin) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parts 1, 3, and 4: Risankizumab for 40 weeks with a follow-up call 20 weeks later for a study&#xD;
      duration of approximately 65 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period A: Risankizumab or ustekinumab for 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period B: Risankizumab or no treatment for 36 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Period C: Re-treatment with risankizumab for 16 weeks. Follow-up call 20 weeks later for&#xD;
           a study duration of approximately 81 weeks. Participants from each Part who meet&#xD;
           eligibility criteria for an open-label extension (OLE) study may continue on&#xD;
           risankizumab for 216 additional weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for study participants compared to standard treatment.&#xD;
      Participants will attend monthly visits and medical assessments will check the effect of&#xD;
      treatment through blood tests, questionnaires, and checking for side effects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Stable severe or moderate to severe plaque psoriasis as defined in each study part by&#xD;
             body surface area (BSA) psoriasis involvement and scores on the Psoriasis Area and&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Concurrent clinically significant medical conditions other than the indication being&#xD;
        studied or any other reason that the investigator determines would interfere with the&#xD;
        participant's participation in this study, would make the participant an unsuitable&#xD;
