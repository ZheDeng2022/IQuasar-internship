  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether avatrombopag is an effective treatment for thrombocytopenia in&#xD;
      people who have both cancer and a liver disease (such as cirrhosis, cholangitis, or&#xD;
      hepatitis). Researchers will look at whether giving participants avatrombopag for 3 weeks can&#xD;
      raise their platelet levels enough for them to begin chemotherapy. The study will also test&#xD;
      whether avatrombopag can continue to be effective against thrombocytopenia while participants&#xD;
      are on chemotherapy for 12 weeks or longer. In addition, researchers will determine how safe&#xD;
      the study drug is in participants.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive an initial dose of Avatrombopag 60 mg on Day 1. Starting on Day 2, the dose will be Avatrombopag 20 mg daily. Once a patient has reached a platelet target of &gt; 100,000/mcL patients can initiate systemic cancer therapy. Avatrombopag will be continued as maintenance (subscript &quot;m&quot;) and titrated weekly with a goal to maintain a platelet count of ≥ 100,000/mcL during administration of systemic cancer therapy. Duration of maintenance therapy will be at least 12 weeks (indicated by Week 1m, Week 2m, … 12m) starting from time of platelet correction and resumption of systemic cancer therapy. End of Treatment (EOT) is up to 15 weeks on study Week 12m.</description>
