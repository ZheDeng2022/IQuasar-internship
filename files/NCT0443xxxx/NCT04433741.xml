  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin&#xD;
      (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study healthy volunteers are recruited. Each study participant will have an IV&#xD;
      catheter placed. After placement of the IV catheter oxytocin will be given by IV infusion of&#xD;
      oxytocin or placebo (inactive solution). The investigators will perform some tests to&#xD;
      evaluate how oxytocin changes perceptions on the skin. The investigators will study a painful&#xD;
      perception by placing a probe on the skin and heating it to 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit for 30&#xD;
      seconds and a vibratory stimulus will be applied to the forearm with vibration begun at a 1&#xD;
      kHz frequency and decreased at a rate of 25 Hz/sec until the subject first perceives the&#xD;
      vibration. Each study participant will score any pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale&#xD;
      and will report when the vibration is detected. Each participant will receive oxytocin and&#xD;
      placebo in a random order and will be blinded to group they are receiving.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to create pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models for oxytocin&#xD;
      action at peripheral sites and at central sites as they relate to sensory transmission and&#xD;
      pain. This is the last of 4 studies to accomplish generation, validation, and application of&#xD;
      a PK/PD model for oxytocin in the periphery. Its goal is to apply the PK/PD model generated&#xD;
      in previous protocols and Validate a pharmacodynamic model of oxytocin for peripheral&#xD;
      analgesic effects to a more complex sensory stimulus that stimulates nerve fibers which&#xD;
      result in pain from a heat stimulus and those which reduce pain from vibration, similar to&#xD;
      brushing or rubbing an area of pain. The investigators do this because oxytocin in animals&#xD;
      affects these nerve fibers in the periphery in different ways - it increases the activity of&#xD;
      the vibration/rubbing sensitive fibers and decreases the activity of the pain fibers. As&#xD;
      such, The investigators expect that the effect of oxytocin on pain from this mixed stimulus&#xD;
      of heat and vibration will be much more pronounced than that seen with the purely painful&#xD;
      stimulus used in previous studies in this series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, crossover study in which oxytocin or placebo is infused. In this&#xD;
      study healthy people are recruited for a 2 day double-blind, crossover study. They will come&#xD;
      to the Clinical Research Unit and one intravenous catheter (IV) inserted in the forearm for&#xD;
      oxytocin or placebo infusion. Participants will be given a steady rate intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of oxytocin at a targeted dose or placebo for 30 minutes. At 5, 15, and 30 minutes after&#xD;
      starting the infusion, pain report to the 47°Celsius, 30-second stimulus alone or with ½ VT&#xD;
      vibration (randomized order) will be obtained. Participants will return at least 24 hours&#xD;
      later and receive the opposite infusion and testing.&#xD;
