    <textblock>
      Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy is also known as 'birth asphyxia related brain injury' and&#xD;
      happens when the brain does not receive enough oxygen or blood flow around the time of birth.&#xD;
      Birth asphyxia related brain injury is the most common cause of death and neurodisability in&#xD;
      term babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooling therapy has substantially improved the outcomes of babies with HIE. However,&#xD;
      unacceptably high rate of adverse outcomes are still seen in cooled babies with HIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EDEN trial is a 3 arm randomised control trial and aims to examine the physiological&#xD;
      effects of erythropoietin (Epo) and Darbepoetin alfa (Darbe) therapy on proton magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy thalamic N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level in babies with neonatal&#xD;
      encephalopathy undergoing cooling therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 220 babies with neonatal encephalopathy will be recruited from the participating&#xD;
      sites in UK over a 24 month period. The babies will be randomly allocated to erythropoietin,&#xD;
      darbepoetin or usual care. MR imaging and spectroscopy will be performed at 1 to 2 weeks of&#xD;
      age to examine the brain injury. Neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed at 18 months of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Birth asphyxia related brain injury (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; HIE) occurs in 2.6 (95%&#xD;
      CI 2.5 to 2.8) per 1000 live births in the UK, and is the most common cause of death and&#xD;
      neurodisability in term babies. The economic burden to the treasury on support costs of&#xD;
      neuro-disability from HIE is massive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only effective treatment for HIE is whole body cooling, with an estimated saving of Â£100&#xD;
      million per annum to the UK economy, since its introduction as a standard therapy in the NHS&#xD;
      in 2007. Cooling therapy has substantially improved the outcomes of babies with HIE in the&#xD;
      past decade. However, unacceptably high rate of adverse outcomes are still seen in cooled&#xD;
      babies with moderate or severe HIE, and hence better treatments and further optimisation of&#xD;
      cooling therapy is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A key roadblock in clinical translation of over 15 highly effective neuroprotective&#xD;
      treatments in animal models is the long delay between the intervention and outcome&#xD;
      assessments in HIE. i.e. the earliest age at which neurodevelopmental outcome can be&#xD;
      accurately assessed is 18 months. Hence, despite having over 2 dozen highly effective&#xD;
      treatments in animal models, no further neuroprotective drugs in HIE have been introduced&#xD;
      into the NHS in the past 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (Epo) is a widely used and FDA approved drug for treating anaemia in various&#xD;
      age groups, including newborn infants. Over 34 randomised controlled trials recruiting over&#xD;
      3500 premature babies have reported the safety and efficacy of Epo therapy for anaemia of&#xD;
      prematurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent reviews have highlighted Erythropoietin as one of the most promising therapies&#xD;
      to augment hypothermic neuroprotection. Epo has both acute effects (anti-inflammatory,&#xD;
      anti-excitotoxic, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic) and regenerative effects (neurogenesis,&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis) essential for the repair of injury and normal&#xD;
      neurodevelopment in animal models5. Of the long list of highly effective drugs in animal&#xD;
      models of HIE and early clinical studies, Epo is the most promising. It is the only drug with&#xD;
      a long therapeutic window (at least 24 hours), is widely available, inexpensive, and can be&#xD;
      easily administered on a once a day dosing schedule. It has been extensive evaluated in large&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials for anaemia of prematurity and has a proven safety profile in&#xD;
      newborn infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darbepoetin, a long acting erythropoiesis stimulating agent, has dual erythropoietic and&#xD;
      potential neuroprotective effects. It has been extensively evaluated in newborn infants for&#xD;
      its erythropoietic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EDEN trial is a 3 arm randomised control trial and aims to examine the physiological&#xD;
      effects of erythropoietin (Epo) and Darbepoetin alfa (Darbe) therapy on proton magnetic&#xD;
      resonance spectroscopy thalamic N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level in babies with neonatal&#xD;
      encephalopathy undergoing cooling therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed parental consent, a total of 220 babies with HIE (aged &lt;24 hours) undergoing&#xD;
      therapeutic hypothermia will be randomised to one of the following groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1: Erythropoietin (1000 U/kg) IV once a day x 5 doses along with cooling therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2: Darbepoetin Alpha (10 mcg/kg) IV single dose given less than 24 hours of age&#xD;
           along with cooling therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3: Cooling only (usual care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies recruited will have electroencephalography (EEG), MR imaging and spectroscopy will be&#xD;
      performed at 1 to 2 weeks of age to examine the brain injury. The neurological outcomes will&#xD;
      be assessed between 18 to 22 months of age. The trial duration will be 4 years, consisting of&#xD;
      a 4 week start up period, 24 month recruitment period, a 18 month follow-up period, and 5&#xD;
      months for data analysis and write up.&#xD;
