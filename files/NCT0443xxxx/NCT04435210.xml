      Introduction - Hypertension is the commonest medical complication of pregnancy. When severe,&#xD;
      it puts the lives of both the mother and the unborn baby at risk. Therefore, immediate&#xD;
      lowering of blood pressure is indicated whenever this is detected. Different&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs are being used to that effect, but more commonly these include:&#xD;
      hydralazine, labetalol and nifedipine. Nifedipine, despite being cheap, readily available,&#xD;
      safe in pregnancy and easy to administer, is hardly utilized for this purpose in our setting.&#xD;
      Hydralazine is usually used instead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives - This will be: to determine the efficacy of nifedipine and compare it with that&#xD;
      of hydralazine, which is more commonly used, and to compare their maternal and fetal side&#xD;
      effect profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods - This will be a prospective randomized controlled open label study of&#xD;
      nifedipine versus hydralazine. Patients will be assigned to different arms of the study using&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers. Efficacy and adverse effects of the drugs will be noted on&#xD;
      each arm of the study. Data will be collated, tabulated and then statistically analysed using&#xD;
      the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion - The outcome of the study will enable recommendation to be made on the use of&#xD;
      nifedipine for severe hypertension if found to be effective.&#xD;

      Introduction Hypertension is the commonest medical complication of pregnancy. It is&#xD;
      associated with high maternal and perinatal mortality, especially when severe. Hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy constitute one of the five major causes of maternal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in obstetric practice, accounting for approximately 63,000 maternal deaths&#xD;
      worldwide annually. It has been noted to complicate about 6-12% of pregnancies; with&#xD;
      preeclampsia accounting for about half of these cases, while the relatively benign chronic&#xD;
      hypertension and gestational hypertension constitute the rest. Hypertension is defined as&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure equal to or above 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure equal to or&#xD;
      above 90 mmHg, measured on two or more occasions, at least four to six hours apart. It is&#xD;
      said to be severe when the systolic blood pressure is equal to or greater than 160 mmHg&#xD;
      and/or the diastolic blood pressure is equal to or greater than 110 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension in pregnancy is most worrisome when it is severe because of the associated&#xD;
      maternal end organ damage, with associated maternal morbidity and mortality, as well as fetal&#xD;
      complications. The end organ damage associated with severe hypertension includes renal&#xD;
      impairment, heart failure, liver damage, pulmonary edema and cerebral injury. Though any of&#xD;
      these complications may eventually lead to patient's demise, the most common cause of death&#xD;
      in patients with severe hypertension is cerebro-vascular accident, resulting from disruption&#xD;
      of cerebral auto-regulatory mechanism and increased perfusion pressure. There is also&#xD;
      increased vascular permeability, leading to hemo-concentration, which predisposes the patient&#xD;
      to cerebral thrombosis as well as the vasospasm associated with convulsion. Other&#xD;
      complications include placenta abruption, preterm delivery and increased risk of cesarean&#xD;
      delivery. In order to reduce the maternal complications associated with severe hypertension&#xD;
      in pregnancy, there is the need for immediate treatment to lower the severely elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure. However, due to the fact that the placenta functions as a low resistance shunt&#xD;
      without auto-regulation, lowering the blood pressure too fast or too far may lead to reduced&#xD;
      utero-placental perfusion, which is detrimental to the fetus. Therefore the reduction in&#xD;
      blood pressure, though prompt, should be controlled, with a target of 140-150 mmHg systolic&#xD;
      and 90-100 mmHg diastolic. The primary purpose of this treatment is not to change the course&#xD;
      of the disease but to prevent cerebral hemorrhage and hypertensive encephalopathy associated&#xD;
      with such severely elevated blood pressure. Thus the initial focus of the treatment is&#xD;
      directed towards the safety of the mother, which is necessary to ensure that of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs for the control of severe hypertension in&#xD;
      pregnancy are nifedipine, labetalol and hydralazine. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker&#xD;
      which blocks the L-type calcium channels in both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle&#xD;
      cells, thereby exerting negative inotropic effects on the heart and causing vascular&#xD;
      dilatation which results in decreased systemic vascular resistance. It is available in tablet&#xD;
      and capsule forms. Labetalol is a non-selective α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors&#xD;
      antagonist. It acts by dilating arterioles, thereby decreasing vascular resistance without&#xD;
      significantly lowering the cardiac output. It may be administered orally (tablet) or&#xD;
      intravenously. Hydralazine also lowers blood pressure by decreasing systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance through direct dilatation of arterioles. It is administered both intravenously and&#xD;
      orally. These drugs have been compared with each other in different randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials. While it is generally accepted that the three drugs are effective in controlling&#xD;
      severe hypertension, different trials have recommended labetalol, hydralazine or nifedipine&#xD;
      as the first line agent; and the others (as the case may be), as alternatives, depending on&#xD;
      the prevailing circumstances and considerations of the trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the differences in the outcomes of randomized controlled trials on efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of anti-hypertensive use in pregnancy, there is no consensus on which agent is the&#xD;
      safest and most effective. A recent Cochrane review on 'drugs for treatment of very high&#xD;
      blood pressure during pregnancy' concluded that, until better evidence was available, the&#xD;
      choice of anti-hypertensive drugs should depend on the clinician's experience with the&#xD;
      particular drug, on what was known about the side effects, as well as the women's&#xD;
      preferences. Other factors that determine anti-hypertensive choice are availability, cost,&#xD;
      fetal and maternal condition at admission. This leaves the choice of drugs to the physician's&#xD;
      discretion which is very subjective. In Nigeria, there has been no clinical data specifying&#xD;
      the preferred anti-hypertensive agent (among the three earlier stated) in the management of&#xD;
      severe hypertension in pregnancy. Drug use in such circumstances has generally been based on&#xD;
      studies done in America and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous hydralazine is the most commonly used anti-hypertensive drug in severe&#xD;
      hypertension because of its long term established safety, efficacy, availability and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. However, its administration requires more resources in terms of equipment&#xD;
      (i.e. syringes and needles as well as intravenous cannula) and personnel (administered&#xD;
      usually by doctors or occasionally, nurses) than that of oral agents. Its common side&#xD;
      effects, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting may mimic symptoms of deteriorating&#xD;
      preeclampsia and thereby create confusion during management. Also, maternal hypotension is&#xD;
      common with parenteral hydralazine, which has been shown to be associated with an excess of&#xD;
      caesarean sections, placental abruptions, and low Apgar scores (&lt; 7) at five minutes compared&#xD;
      to labetalol and nifedipine. In view of these limitations of hydralazine, there is a need to&#xD;
      find alternative drugs with equal efficacy in controlling severe hypertension but with fewer&#xD;
      side effects. Nifedipine is cheap, easy to administer, widely available and has less tendency&#xD;
      to cause maternal hypotension resulting in fetal compromise. As a result of these qualities&#xD;
      and the peculiarity of our society in terms of availability of skilled man-power, it is&#xD;
      necessary to know if it is comparable with hydralazine in terms of efficacy and safety, with&#xD;
      the hope of recommending its use in treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy in Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification The use of parenteral agents, such as hydralazine for severe hypertension in&#xD;
      pregnancy requires more resources, monitoring and supervision because they are fast-acting;&#xD;
      and as a result they have the potential to lower BP within minutes and cause maternal&#xD;
      hypotension and fetal compromise. Due to the limited manpower and resources in Nigeria, any&#xD;
      agent that is cheap, effective, easy to administer without much expertise and causes the&#xD;
      fewest side effects will be beneficial to patients in such setting. Nifedipine is an&#xD;
      effective rapidly acting anti-hypertensive. It does not crash BP but controls it gradually&#xD;
      over a period of time. Its simplicity stems from the fact that it comes in tablet and capsule&#xD;
      forms, which can be easily administered without elaborate training. These qualities make it&#xD;
      easy to administer in many rural settings which are prevalent in developing countries such as&#xD;
      Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for this study stems from the fact that further studies have been recommended by the&#xD;
      studies done on this subject which are mainly in Europe and America. Its use for control of&#xD;
      severe hypertension may be important in Nigeria setting, if found effective as hydralazine,&#xD;
      due to the aforementioned challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is nifedipine as effective as hydralazine in controlling severe hypertension in&#xD;
           pregnancy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is nifedipine comparable to hydralazine in sustaining blood pressure control?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is nifedipine comparable to hydralazine in fetal and maternal side effects? Aim of the&#xD;
           study The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine with&#xD;
           intravenous (I.V.) hydralazine in controlling severe hypertension in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the efficacy of oral nifedipine in the management of severe hypertension in&#xD;
           pregnancy in terms of reduction in BP below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the efficacy of I.V. hydralazine in the management of severe hypertension&#xD;
           in pregnancy in terms of reduction in BP below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the efficacy of oral nifedipine with that of intravenous hydralazine in terms&#xD;
           of reduction of blood pressure below 160 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic and&#xD;
           maintaining blood pressure control&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the risk of maternal hypotension using nifedipine compared with hydralazine&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare neonatal side effects following administration of nifedipine to that of&#xD;
           hydralazine using APGAR scores at 1st and 5th minutes after delivery Materials and&#xD;
           method Study design This will be an open label randomized controlled trial of nifedipine&#xD;
           versus hydralazine in control of severe hypertension in pregnancy at the Federal&#xD;
           Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. Nifedipine 20 mg tablet will be used and&#xD;
           compared with 10 mg intravenous hydralazine. Equivalence study design will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study background Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki (AEFUTHA),&#xD;
      where this study will be carried out, is the only tertiary hospital in Ebonyi state, Nigeria.&#xD;
      It is located at the center of Abakaliki, the capital city of Ebonyi state. The state,&#xD;
      located in the South-Eastern part of Nigeria, was created on October 1, 1996 and has 13 local&#xD;
      government areas; with Abakaliki, the state capital as the only urban settlement in the&#xD;
      state. The state has a population of about 2.1 million people, based on the 2006 national&#xD;
      population census.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, AEFUTHA, is one of the clinical departments in&#xD;
      the hospital. It serves as a major referral center for other hospitals in Ebonyi and the&#xD;
      neighboring states of Enugu, Benue and Cross River. There are 52 obstetric bed spaces&#xD;
      including antenatal and postnatal wards. The department has five teams which are sub-divided&#xD;
      into two units each. Each unit is manned by at least two consultants. Resident doctors are&#xD;
      distributed to cover all the units. The department runs antenatal clinics managed by the&#xD;
      consultants and resident doctors, assisted by midwives and other health workers. Antenatal&#xD;
      clients are booked daily on every week day and are assigned consultants according to the&#xD;
      units/teams running antenatal clinic each day. The average antenatal booking is about 4,200&#xD;
      clients per year, while the total antenatal clinic attendance averages 21,000 per year, with&#xD;
      an average annual delivery rate of 2,900. The department has established protocols for&#xD;
      management of specific cases which are in accordance with international best practices, and&#xD;
      are displayed in the labor ward, antenatal ward and the accident and emergency unit of the&#xD;
      hospital. These protocols serve as guides, as patient management is still individualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women with severe hypertension in pregnancy are usually admitted into any of the&#xD;
      aforementioned wards, depending on the clinical condition at presentation. For patients with&#xD;
      severe preeclampsia, the departmental protocol is to stabilize the patient and deliver&#xD;
      through the most expeditious route following stabilization, while those with chronic&#xD;
      hypertension and gestational hypertension may be allowed for prolongation of gestation so far&#xD;
      the blood pressure is under control; and other clinical and laboratory parameters are&#xD;
      satisfactory. Blood pressure control in severe hypertension is one of the cardinal points in&#xD;
      stabilization; and this is usually done with intravenous hydralazine, or occasionally with&#xD;
      intravenous labetalol. Hydralazine is usually given intravenously as 5-10 mg, diluted in 10&#xD;
      ml of normal saline and given over 10 minutes. Blood pressure is checked every 5 minutes,&#xD;
      with target blood pressure of 140-150 mmHg systolic and 90-100 mmHg diastolic. Excessive&#xD;
      lowering of BP is avoided to prevent fetal compromise. Following this, blood pressure control&#xD;
      is usually maintained with oral medications which include nifedipine and α-methyl dopa, used&#xD;
      singly or in combination, in majority of cases. Labetalol tablets may be added in cases where&#xD;
      blood pressure control becomes difficult. Patients are usually managed in conjunction with&#xD;
      the cardiologists, who may modify the drugs as the need arises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the preliminary report of unpublished yearly departmental audit, 175 pregnant women were&#xD;
      admitted and managed for severe hypertension in pregnancy in 2016 out of 2,910 deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Participants to be included in this study will be patients with severe&#xD;
      hypertension in pregnancy admitted and managed at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination The minimum sample size will be determined using statistical&#xD;
      formula for equivalence study design N = 2 x {Z1-α/2 + Z1-β}2 x P x (1-P) { δo }&#xD;
&#xD;
      N = number of patients per group Z = the standard normal deviate for a one or two sided&#xD;
      study, usually set at 1.96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      δo = clinically acceptable difference in attainment of target blood pressure will be set at&#xD;
      30% P = treatment response of nifedipine relative to hydralazine in a systematic review = 84%&#xD;
      α = type I error = ≤5% β = type II error =≤ 10% (90% power) N = 2 {1.96 + 1.28}2 x 0.84 x&#xD;
      (1-0.84) { 0.3 } N = 2 (3.24)2 x 0.84 x 0.16 ( 0.3) N = 2 x 10.82 x 0.1344 N = 2 x 116.64 x&#xD;
      0.1344 N = 31.35 ≈ 31 patients per group This will represent the number of patients per&#xD;
      group. Twenty percent of this minimum sample size will be added to correct for any attrition&#xD;
      that may occur in the course of the study. The final sample size on each arm of the study&#xD;
      will now be 37 while the total will be 74.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' selection, drug administration and study procedure Patients' Selection Patients to&#xD;
      be included in the study are those who present with severe hypertension in pregnancy; meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria and consent to participate in the study. Detailed history will be&#xD;
      obtained and thorough examination will be carried out on all patients. Relevant&#xD;
      investigations, which include blood group and Rhesus type, complete blood count, liver&#xD;
      function tests, renal function tests, coagulation profile and urine analysis for proteinuria,&#xD;
      will be carried out. The participants will be randomized by means of computer generated&#xD;
      random numbers, by a statistician, using the software Research Randomizer®. Using this&#xD;
      software, thirty-four numbers will be randomly generated from a pool of sixty-eight numbers&#xD;
      (1-74) and these numbers will be assigned to group A (nifedipine) while the remaining&#xD;
      thirty-four numbers will automatically be assigned to group B (hydralazine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These numbers (1-74) will be inscribed on brown envelopes and a piece of paper with the&#xD;
      inscription 'nifedipine' or 'hydralazine' will be put, with the respective drug accordingly,&#xD;
      inside these envelopes and sealed. All the envelopes will be kept in a locker that will be&#xD;
      made accessible to all the members of the research team. During the counselling session,&#xD;
      patients will be made to know what the drug is meant to do for them and the possible side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, who meet the inclusion criteria, having understood the study and signed the&#xD;
      informed consent form, will be given sequential study numbers and the corresponding numbered&#xD;
      opaque sealed envelope will then be allocated to the patient. The particular drug contained&#xD;
      in this numbered envelope, corresponding to the patient's study number, will be given to the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration Patients on nifedipine arm (group A) of the study will receive oral&#xD;
      nifedipine 20 mg statim, then 20 mg after 30 minutes if blood pressure still remains equal to&#xD;
      or above 160/110 mmHg. The 20 mg dose will be repeated every 30 minutes until desired BP&#xD;
      (140-150 mmHg/90-100 mmHg) is reached or five doses have been given. The drug will be given&#xD;
      to the patient to swallow in the presence of a nurse. If a patient vomits within 10 minutes&#xD;
      of administration of the drug, the dose will be repeated. In cases where nifedipine fails to&#xD;
      control the B.P., other anti-hypertensive drugs (such as hydralazine or labetalol) will be&#xD;
      administered as may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those on hydralazine arm (group B) of the study will receive 10 mg of intravenous&#xD;
      hydralazine, diluted 10 ml of water for injection and given over 10 minutes. If B.P. remains&#xD;
      equal to or above 160/110 mmHg 30 minutes after administration of the drug, intravenous&#xD;
      hydralazine 10 mg, diluted with 10 ml of water for injection, will be administered over 10&#xD;
      minutes. This will be repeated every 30 minutes until the desired B.P. (140-150 mmHg/90-100&#xD;
      mmHg) is reached or five doses have been given. In cases where blood pressure remains&#xD;
      uncontrolled, other anti-hypertensive drugs (such as labetalol or nifedipine) will be&#xD;
      administered as may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be checked every 5 minutes during the period of administration of these&#xD;
      drugs. Intravenous Ringer's lactate or normal saline will be provided at the bedside of the&#xD;
      patients, which will be rapidly infused in case hypotension develops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of Patients Patients will be monitored by measuring the blood pressure with&#xD;
      mercury sphygmomanometers. These sphygmomanometers will be regularly calibrated to ensure&#xD;
      accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Blood pressure will be taken with the patients&#xD;
      sitting down to prevent the effect of the pregnant uterus on blood pressure and ensure&#xD;
      uniformity. Larger cuff will be provided for obese patients to minimize errors. The rate of&#xD;
      deflation of the cuff will be at 2-3 mmHg per second and the sphygmomanometer will be placed&#xD;
      at the level of the heart. The systolic blood pressure will be read at the point where the&#xD;
      first Korotkoff sound is heard with the eyes placed at the same level as the point of&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure; while the diastolic blood pressure will be the point of&#xD;
      disappearance of the Korotkoff sound or where it becomes muffled in cases where the sound&#xD;
      continues till or near the zero mark. The examiner's eyes will be placed at this level to&#xD;
      read the diastolic blood pressure. This is to avoid error due to parallax. Rounding off&#xD;
      figures will be discouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be collated, tabulated and then statistically analysed using&#xD;
      the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) (IBM) software (version 22, Chicago USA).&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation (mean ±2SD), while&#xD;
      categorical variables will be presented as numbers and percentages. Chi-square test (X2) will&#xD;
      be used for comparison between groups of qualitative variables while normal z-test, odds&#xD;
      ratio and confidence interval at 95% will be used for comparison between groups of&#xD;
      quantitative variables. A difference with a p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations Ethical clearance has been obtained from the Health Research and&#xD;
      Ethics committee of the Hospital. In designing this study, the following ethical issues were&#xD;
      put into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: A signed-written consent will be obtained from each participant before&#xD;
      recruitment into the study. The study objectives, procedure and full implications of&#xD;
      participation will be discussed with the participants before their consent is obtained. The&#xD;
      participants will be made to understand that declining participation in the study will have&#xD;
      no consequences in her obtaining adequate care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of data: All information, including history, physical examination findings&#xD;
      and results obtained from the participants shall be kept strictly confidential. The&#xD;
      participants will be assured that their identity will be kept in confidence by the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of results from study The results from this proposed study will be submitted to&#xD;
      the Human Research and Ethics Committee (HREC) - AEFUTHA. A dissertation will be made from&#xD;
      the findings of this study and submitted to the West African College of Surgeons, Faculty of&#xD;
      Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology. Finally it will be published in a reputable international medical&#xD;
      journal.&#xD;
