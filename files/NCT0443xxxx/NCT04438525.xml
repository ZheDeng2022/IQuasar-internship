  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insect venom allergy is the major cause for severe allergic reactions in Europe. Wasps and&#xD;
      honeybees are responsible for the majority of these allergic reactions. Symptoms range from&#xD;
      generalized skin symptoms (wheals, swellings) to respiratory or cardiovascular problems such&#xD;
      as asthma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, or cardiac arrest. The regular administration of&#xD;
      insect venom ('venom immunotherapy') over up to 5 years is a well-established therapy,&#xD;
      providing long-term protection from further systemic sting reactions in the majority of&#xD;
      patients. However, there is no laboratory test which is able to identify patients who will&#xD;
      still react to an insect sting. The only reliable method available is stinging patients with&#xD;
      living insects ('sting challenges'). The key issue is that only few centers in Europe perform&#xD;
      sting challenges and many patients have no access to these tests. Therefore, it is of utmost&#xD;
      importance to find a method which is able to identify patients who are still at risk for&#xD;
      future allergic sting reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhibition of the basophil activation test (BAT) could be a potential method to monitor&#xD;
      the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Basophils are cells which are activated in acute allergic&#xD;
      reactions. The basophil activation of blood donors with vespid venom allergy can be measured&#xD;
      after adding sera from allergic patients undergoing immunotherapy. In a preliminary study we&#xD;
      found that the activation of basophils could be inhibited in all patients treated with vespid&#xD;
      venom, however, results must be confirmed in a larger study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, a total of 219 patients with vespid venom allergy will be included. Those&#xD;
      patients who are receiving or who have already finished venom immunotherapy will be sting&#xD;
      challenged and blood samples will be taken to perform BAT inhibition experiments. At the same&#xD;
      time, donors with confirmed vespid venom allergy, who have not undergone immunotherapy, will&#xD;
      be recruited for a blood donation, which is necessary for the BAT inhibition tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results of the preliminary study could be confirmed, the BAT inhibition will facilitate&#xD;
      monitoring the effectiveness of venom immunotherapy and patients would benefit from an early&#xD;
      detection of lacking tolerance and consequently from the increased venom dose preventing&#xD;
      future life threatening systemic sting reactions.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint for the study is the inhibition of the CD63 basophil response (BAT inhibition at a concentration of 11ng/ml) in vespid venom allergic patients. A minimum activation of 25% is required to see sufficient inhibition of basophil activity. Immunotherapy will be considered successful if the BAT inhibition (with added serum) is reduced by at least 80% compared to 'no serum'.</description>
