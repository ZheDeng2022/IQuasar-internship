  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of magrolimab and venetoclax&#xD;
      when given together with azacitidine and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia. Magrolimab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Venetoclax may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking Bcl-2, a protein needed for cancer cell survival. Giving magrolimab,&#xD;
      azacitidine, and venetoclax may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of this combination in patients&#xD;
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the response rate (RR) including CR (complete remission) + CRi (complete&#xD;
      remission with incomplete count recovery) within 3 months of treatment initiation of this&#xD;
      combination in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the CR + complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate and&#xD;
      morphologic leukemia free (MLF) rate within 3 months of treatment initiation of this&#xD;
      combination in patients with AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the duration of response (DOR), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival&#xD;
      (OS), MRD status at response and best MRD response attained by flow-cytometry, 4- and 8-week&#xD;
      mortality, and number of patients bridged to hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and&#xD;
      median duration to HSCT from the initiation of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate correlations of response to this combination with a pre- therapy,&#xD;
      on-therapy, and progression 81-gene panel of gene mutations in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate possible relationships between response and non-response to the combination&#xD;
      with pretherapy, on-therapy, and progression gene expression signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in tumor cell populations,&#xD;
      by performing targeted single-cell sequencing on longitudinally collected AML tumor&#xD;
      populations from patients using a novel microfluidic approach that barcodes amplified genomic&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from thousands of individual leukemia cells confined to droplets&#xD;
      (single cell sequencing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify individual cell populations (AML blasts, T-cells - both bulk and T-cell&#xD;
      subsets and coreceptor/ligand expression, macrophages and their coreceptor/ligands) and how&#xD;
      their signaling state in disease relates to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To store and/or analyze surplus blood or tissue including bone marrow, if available, for&#xD;
      potential future exploratory research into factors that may influence development of AML&#xD;
      and/or response to the combination (where response is defined broadly to include efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability or safety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of venetoclax and magrolimab followed by a&#xD;
      phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on&#xD;
      days 1-7, venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of cycle 1 (may be reduced to&#xD;
      days 1-21 for subsequent cycles after principal investigator approval), and magrolimab IV&#xD;
      over 2-3 hours on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 2,&#xD;
      and days 1 and 15 of cycle 3 and subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to&#xD;
      12 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days.&#xD;

             leukemia (CMML) or MPN who transformed to AML, therapy received for MDS, CMML, or MPN&#xD;
             is NOT considered as prior therapy for AML. Patients with MDS or CMML treated with&#xD;
             hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapies who progress to AML, and have no available&#xD;
             therapies or are not candidates for available therapies, will be eligible at the time&#xD;
             of progression to AML. Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, ATRA, steroids&#xD;
             while diagnostic work-up of AML is being performed are allowed and not counted as a&#xD;
             prior salvage&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Phase II (relapsed/refractory prior venetoclax naive cohort): Patients aged &gt;= 18&#xD;

             potentially curative therapy such as effective salvage therapy or hematopoietic stem&#xD;
             cell transplantation or who refuse these options at the time of enrollment. Patients&#xD;
             must have received at least one prior therapy for AML. Patients may have received up&#xD;
             to 2 prior therapies for AML (i.e. up to salvage 2 status allowed). Eastern&#xD;
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2. Patients must not have&#xD;
             received prior venetoclax for MDS or AML&#xD;
&#xD;

             years old with relapsed/refractory AML are eligible if they are not eligible for&#xD;
             potentially curative therapy such as effective salvage therapy, targeted therapies, or&#xD;
             hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or who refuse these options at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment. Patients must have received at least one prior therapy for AML. Patients&#xD;
             may have received up to 2 prior therapies for AML (i.e. up to salvage 2 status&#xD;
             allowed). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2. Patients&#xD;
             may have received prior venetoclax for MDS or AML&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with newly diagnosed AML with poor risk karyotype or complex karyotype and/or&#xD;
             TP53 deletions/mutations younger than 75 year old will be eligible for the Phase II&#xD;
             (frontline cohort) regardless of eligibility or fitness for intensive chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Phase II (frontline cohort): Patients must be chemonaive, i.e., not have received&#xD;
             any chemotherapy (except hydrea or 1-2 doses of ara-C for transient control of&#xD;
             hyperleukocytosis) for AML. They may have received transfusions, hematopoietic growth&#xD;
             factors or vitamins for an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD) or for AML.&#xD;
             Temporary prior measures such as apheresis, ATRA, steroids or hydrea while diagnostic&#xD;
             work-up is being performed are allowed and not counted as a prior salvage. Supportive&#xD;
             care therapy for MDS (growth factors, transfusions) will not be considered as prior&#xD;
             therapy for MDS/AML and these patients will be enrolled to the frontline cohort of the&#xD;
             study if they are otherwise eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of initiation of protocol therapy will be at least 2 weeks or at least 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is shorter). The half-life for the therapy in question will be&#xD;
             based on published pharmacokinetic literature (abstracts, manuscripts, investigator&#xD;
             brochure's, or drug-administration manuals) and will be documented in the protocol&#xD;
             eligibility document. The toxicity from prior therapy should have resolved to grade =&lt;&#xD;
             1, however alopecia and sensory neuropathy grade =&lt; 2 not constituting a safety risk&#xD;
             based on investigators judgement is acceptable. The use of chemotherapeutic or&#xD;
             anti-leukemic agents is not permitted during the study with the following exceptions:&#xD;
             (1) intrathecal (IT) therapy for patients with controlled central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
             leukemia at the discretion of the PI. (2) Use of 1-2 doses of cytarabine (up to 2&#xD;
             g/m^2 each dose) for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the&#xD;
             start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy. Since the effect of&#xD;
             most immuno-oncology (IO)-agents, HMA-therapies, venetoclax may be delayed, use of&#xD;
             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed on study and&#xD;
             before the start of study therapy and will not require a washout. These medications&#xD;
             will be recorded in the case-report form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent therapy for CNS prophylaxis or continuation of therapy for controlled CNS&#xD;
             disease is permitted. Patients with a known history of CNS disease or leukemic brain&#xD;
             metastasis must have been treated locally, have at least 2 consecutive LPs with no&#xD;
             evidence of CNS leukemia, and must be clinically stable for at least 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and have no ongoing neurological symptoms that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating physician are related to the CNS disease (sequelae that are a consequence of&#xD;
             the treatment of the CNS disease are acceptable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;= 30 mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula or&#xD;
             measured by 24 hours' urine collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt; 23, adjusted body weight and not ideal&#xD;
                  body weight is the recommended parameter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Direct bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 2.0 x ULN (aspartate&#xD;
             aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase =&lt; 3.0 x ULN if deemed related to&#xD;
             leukemia by the treating physician)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  White blood cell count &lt; 15 x 10^9/L. Patients must have a white blood cell (WBC)&#xD;
             count &lt; 15 x 10^9/L prior to each dose of magrolimab in cycle 1. Hydroxyurea may be&#xD;
             used to reduce the WBC count to =&lt; 15 x 10^9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and provide signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females must be surgically or biologically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrheic for&#xD;
             at least 12 months) or if of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum or&#xD;
             urine pregnancy test within 72 hours before the start of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate method of contraception&#xD;
             during the study and until 4 months after the last treatment. Males must be surgically&#xD;
             or biologically sterile or agree to use an adequate method of contraception during the&#xD;
             study until 3 months after the last treatment. Adequate methods of contraception&#xD;
             include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on&#xD;
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any of the two following (a+b or a+c or b+c)&#xD;
