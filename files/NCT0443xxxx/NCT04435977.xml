  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, Phase II trial designed to estimate in terms of PFS the&#xD;
      efficacy of cabozantinib, given as second- or third- line treatment in HCC patients that&#xD;
      progress on or are intolerant to immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1 and&#xD;
      anti-PD-L1 antibodies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who meet all study eligibility criteria will take tablets containing 60 mg of&#xD;
      cabozantinib once daily orally. Required dose reductions will be in decrements of 20 mg&#xD;
      cabozantinib (maximum two dose reductions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive study treatment as long as they continue to experience clinical benefit&#xD;
      in the opinion of the investigator or until there is unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib, given as second-&#xD;
      or third-line treatment in HCC patients that progress on or are intolerant to immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the activity of cabozantinib, in terms of ORR (CR+PR) as per RECIST 1.1,&#xD;
           duration of response, time to treatment failure (TTF), time to progression (TTP), and OS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib&#xD;

             × 72 [mg/dL]) for males. (For females multiply by 0.85)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-Pugh Score of A (See Appendix IV)&#xD;
