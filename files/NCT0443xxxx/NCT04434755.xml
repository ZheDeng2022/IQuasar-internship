    <textblock>
      Burnout, fatigue, distress and negative issues are in health care providers with different&#xD;
      percentages. To date, little is known about the experience of burnout, fatigue and distress&#xD;
      related with end of life and bioethical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to quantify burnout and identify a set of variables (meaning of&#xD;
      life, stress, moral distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and negative affects)&#xD;
      that may impact on professionals dealing with end-of-life and bioethics issues in their&#xD;
      working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is an observational multicentre cross-sectional study, population-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population is composed by psychologists, nurses and other healthcare providers&#xD;
      dealing with end-of-life/palliative care and other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted using a mixed methods, using both quantitative and qualitative&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the quantitative approaches, standardized questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      anonymously to each participant in one time only. Concerning the qualitative approaches,&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews will be carried out until the saturation of categories is reached&#xD;
      according to the Grounded Theory methodology It is mainly attended that this project may shed&#xD;
      light on wellness and distress related to end-of-life and bioethical issues faced in working&#xD;
      life by health care providers, considering not only risk factors but also protective and&#xD;
      positive ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative part of the research is supposed to identify the dimension of burnout in&#xD;
      this health-care professionals category and to better clarify the role of some variables&#xD;
      (meaning of life, stress, moral distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and negative&#xD;
      affects) that may modulate and affect wellness and distress experienced by this category of&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative part of the study will help to frame better the issue, detecting the main&#xD;
      demanding aspects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Burnout, fatigue, distress and negative issues are well known in health care providers with&#xD;
      different percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This issue is internationally considered relevant; physicians have 36% more probability of&#xD;
      developing burnout with respect to the American high school graduated population and, in&#xD;
      general, medical students, residents/fellows, and early career physicians are more likely to&#xD;
      suffer from burnout compared to the general population. Moreover, between 2011 and 2014, the&#xD;
      trend of job satisfaction and burnout was getting worse in these worker categories. This&#xD;
      condition has to be seriously taken in consideration; indeed, chronic distress and burnout in&#xD;
      health care providers affect both the quality of patient care and satisfaction, as well as&#xD;
      the employee professional quality of life and psychological and physical wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors are various and the most relevant include work features, interpersonal&#xD;
      relationships and personal factors. However, only recently literature has focused on positive&#xD;
      and protective factors which modulate too the relationship between the health care&#xD;
      professional and her/his job. To date, little is known about the experience of burnout,&#xD;
      fatigue and distress related with end of life and bioethical issues in everyday working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What emerges from qualitative studies is that a relevant source of distress is linked to the&#xD;
      physicians and nurses' necessity to take bioethical decisions against their personal values,&#xD;
      and another source of distress arises from balancing family, institutional and moral&#xD;
      constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to quantitative researches, the exposure to death and dying results in distress,&#xD;
      fatigue and impoverishment of professional quality of life. Moreover, a review reports that&#xD;
      critical care nurses experience their most stressful job situation when they have to manage&#xD;
      with the unnecessary prolongation of life of their patients on the bases of family's desire.&#xD;
      Indeed, a risk factor to burnout seems to be the ethical decision-making regarding end of&#xD;
      life and foregoing life-sustaining therapy. Another qualitative and quantitative review shows&#xD;
      that health care practitioners' end-of-life decision making may contribute to the distress&#xD;
      and burnout experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contemporary medical practice implies an increasing amount of bioethical issues to manage and&#xD;
      this fact may constrain physicians and health care professionals to experience relevant&#xD;
      distressing and high demanding situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General objective The main aim of this study is to quantify burnout and identify a set of&#xD;
      variables (meaning of life, stress, moral distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and&#xD;
      negative affects) that may impact on professionals dealing with end-of-life and bioethics&#xD;
      issues in their working life by quantitative and qualitative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives - 1 to estimate the prevalence of the subjective perception of burnout&#xD;
      among health-care professionals dealing with end-of-life and bioethical issues. 2: to&#xD;
      evaluate possible relations among some influential variables (meaning of life, stress, moral&#xD;
      distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and negative affects) and burnout and&#xD;
      wellness/distress among health-care professionals dealing with end-of-life and bioethical&#xD;
      issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design The project is an observational multicentre cross-sectional study,&#xD;
      population-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The target population is composed by psychologists, nurses and other healthcare&#xD;
      providers dealing with end-of-life/palliative care and other conditions possibly&#xD;
      characterized by bioethical problems. Therefore, no sample size is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the healthcare professionals working in unit of end-of-life/palliative care and other&#xD;
      conditions characterized by bioethical problems in three private Institutions (IRCCS):&#xD;
      Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri Spa SB, Humanitas Research Hospital - Rozzano (Milan)&#xD;
      and I.R.C.C.S. Santa Lucia - Centro Riabilitativo - Roma (Roma) will be eligible and invited&#xD;
      to participate at the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since all the eligible will be enrolled the study is population based and no sample size is&#xD;
      needed. Nevertheless achievement of at least 80% of responders will be fixed to ensure&#xD;
      internal validity and minimizing selection bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be the possibility to extend the study in other countries too (to now ongoing&#xD;
      contact with Croatia, Cyprus, Poland, Portugal) to maximize the generalizability of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point The subjective perception of burnout will be measured by Maslach Burnout&#xD;
      Inventory - General Survey (MBI GS): a brief scale assessing the three dimensions of burnout:&#xD;
      emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and professional efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure The study will be conducted using a mixed methods, using both quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the quantitative approaches, standardized questionnaires will be administered&#xD;
      anonymously to each participant in one time only. Only a numerical code will identify the&#xD;
      participant's questionnaires battery. Participant's information linked to the numerical code&#xD;
      will be encrypted and kept in security by a password. The access to this sensitive data will&#xD;
      be possible only to authorised persons involved in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the qualitative approaches, semi-structured interviews will be carried out until&#xD;
      the saturation of categories is reached according to the Grounded Theory methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative and quantitative part of the research will be carried out in Italy.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the quantitative part only will be extended to other foreign countries interested&#xD;
      to be involved in the research. These Institution will be further identified during the 13th&#xD;
      World Conference on Bioethics, Medical Ethics &amp; Health Law at the end of 2018 (Jerusalem,&#xD;
      November 27th -29th, 2018). An amendment to research protocol will be presented if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will began according to previous agreements with the professionals and their&#xD;
      Institution too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the quantitative part of the study, the following instruments (Annex 3) will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MBI GS - Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey: a brief scale assessing the three&#xD;
           dimensions of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and professional&#xD;
           efficacy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SMILE - Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation: a short open- and close-answer&#xD;
           questionnaire assessing the individual meaning in life;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MASI-R - Maugeri Stress Index: a brief questionnaire assessing work-related&#xD;
           psychological stress;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDS-R - Moral Distress Scale-Revised: a brief scale scored by clinicians in terms of&#xD;
           frequency and intensity assessing moral distress;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HECS - Hospital Ethical Climate Survey: a short scale assessing ethical climate in the&#xD;
           hospital perceived by healthcare professionals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDS-RISC-10 - Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale: a 10 items questionnaire assessing&#xD;
           resilience;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PANAS - Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale: a brief self-report measure assessing&#xD;
           positive and negative dispositional dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-demographic characteristics (i.e. sex, age, years of occupation in the unit) will be&#xD;
      also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative part of the study, a semi-structured interview will be constructed&#xD;
      according to literature suggestions on the same constructs assessed by the instruments cited&#xD;
      above and on the bases of the Grounded Theory (GT) qualitative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Quantitative data will be summarized as mean with standard deviation, or&#xD;
      median with 25th and 75th centile. Qualitative data will be described by percentages.&#xD;
      Relationships between the scores will be described by the appropriate correlation&#xD;
      coefficients. The appropriate bivariate analyses will be applied. The crude prevalence of&#xD;
      subjective perception of burnout with the exact 95% confidence interval (95%CI) will be&#xD;
      estimated. The association between the prevalence of burnout and the meaning of life, stress,&#xD;
      moral distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and negative affects will be&#xD;
      investigated by logistic regression model and the effect of all these factors will be&#xD;
      evaluated by Likelihood Ratio test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses for quantitative and qualitative data will be made using SPSS Statistics Standard&#xD;
      (Statistics Standard - Statistical Package for Social Science (IBM Site). A p-value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative analysis of the semi-structured interviews will be carried out by means of&#xD;
      the GT methodology, with the support of the open source R package for Qualitative Data&#xD;
      Analysis (RQDA) purposely designed. This approach allows generating information thorough an&#xD;
      iterative process involving continuous sampling and analysis of data derived from the&#xD;
      concrete setting and, as a consequence, strongly &quot;grounded&quot; in the real experience&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration Even if the cross sectional design is planned, it will be necessary several&#xD;
      time to conduct the interviews. So at least 12 months will be planned to develop the&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Table -Time: first 18 months Recruitment of participants within the 2nd month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 3rd month to 14th month:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative part: administration of the standardized questionnaires, implementation of data&#xD;
      in the database (data entry), and statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative part: semi-structured interviews data collection, transcriptions and analysis&#xD;
      will be carried out in the same time and until the saturation of the emerged categories,&#xD;
      according to the GT methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Time: from 19th to 30th month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results It is mainly attended that this project may shed light on wellness and&#xD;
      distress related to end-of-life and bioethical issues faced in working life by health care&#xD;
      providers, considering not only risk factors but also protective and positive ones according&#xD;
      to the current international trend of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative part of the research is supposed to identify the dimension of burnout in&#xD;
      this health-care professionals category and to better clarify the role of some variables&#xD;
      (meaning of life, stress, moral distress, ethical climate, resilience, positive and negative&#xD;
      affects) that may modulate and affect wellness and distress experienced by this category of&#xD;
      workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative part of the study will help to frame better the issue, detecting the main&#xD;
      demanding aspects in order to propose a grounded theory explaining the connections between&#xD;
      wellness and distress related to end-of-life and bioethical issues in the working place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications The implications may be of paramount relevance in the health care system.&#xD;
      Indeed, worldwide advances in medical sciences and society transformations inevitably imply&#xD;
      an ever-growing need of workers involved in palliative care and chronic disease units, as&#xD;
      well as ever-proliferating bioethical quandaries impacting on the health care professionals'&#xD;
      wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a theoretical point of view, these results could orientate the future research and&#xD;
      enrich the growing amount of bioethical knowledge, in particular regarding aspects impacting&#xD;
      on the quality of health care providers' working life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From a practical point of view; implications may be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study may help to focus on risk and protective factors to be monitored during the&#xD;
           health care provider's career. The attended results may provide information useful for&#xD;
           personal resources and for preventing distress experienced in daily medical practice&#xD;
           dealing with end-of-life and bioethical issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New insights on conditions of professionals who deal constantly with ever-increasing&#xD;
           bioethical issues may provide suggestions on parameters, guidelines and legislation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These new insights may impact indirectly to the society since, &quot;care of the patient&#xD;
           requires care of the provider&quot;. Indeed, health care professionals' distress is a&#xD;
           condition depleting the relationship with the patient and, as a consequence, also the&#xD;
           quality and the adherence to the treatment besides to an unnecessary increase of care&#xD;
           costs&#xD;
