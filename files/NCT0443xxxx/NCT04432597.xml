      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some cancers associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), standard treatments are not&#xD;
      helpful. Researchers want to see if a vaccine for HPV combined with a drug called M7824 has a&#xD;
      better effect on these cancers than when they work alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of HPV vaccine alone or combined with M7824. Also, to test if either HPV&#xD;
      vaccine alone or combined with M7824 causes a better immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with locally advanced or metastatic HPV associated cancer (Phase I)&#xD;
      or stage II or III p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible photos of skin lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT, MRI, or nuclear bone scan: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the&#xD;
      body. For the CT scan, they may have a contrast agent injected into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have up to 2 tumor biopsies. For participants in Phase II, this may be&#xD;
      performed with a thin tube placed through the nose into the airway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the HPV vaccine alone or with M7824. For participants on the Phase&#xD;
      II, they will receive two doses of HPV vaccine under the skin either alone or with M7824 as&#xD;
      an infusion spaced two weeks apart. This will be done prior to their planned chemoradiation&#xD;
      or surgery. For participants on the Phase I, they will get the HPV vaccine injected under the&#xD;
      skin 2 to 3 times in the first month. Then they will have a booster every 4 weeks. They will&#xD;
      receive M7824 as an infusion into a vein every 2 weeks. Treatment will last up to 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After they stop treatment, participants will have a visit within 4 weeks. They will then be&#xD;
      contacted for long-term follow-up every year, for the rest of their lives.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic HPV associated malignancies (cervical, anal, oropharyngeal cancers, etc.) are&#xD;
           often incurable and poorly palliated by standard therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HPV-positive (p16+) oropharyngeal cancers are the most common HPV-associated malignancy&#xD;
           in the United States and are increasing in incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage II and III HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is primarily treated with definitive&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Although the prognosis for stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer is favorable, about 20&#xD;
           percent of patients with stage II disease and 35 percent of patients with stage III&#xD;
           disease will die within four years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attempts to de-intensify treatment of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer by replacing&#xD;
           high-dose cisplatin with cetuximab concurrent with radiotherapy have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction and neoadjuvant immunotherapy are an area of active study in this type of&#xD;
           cancer. The aims of induction immunotherapy are to induce antigen-specific immunity&#xD;
           prior to definitive therapy and to reduce the risk of disease relapse for patients with&#xD;
           stage II and III disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic vaccines targeting HPV alone or in combination with M7824 (dual PD-L1 and&#xD;
           TGF beta inhibitor) have demonstrated induction of HPV antigen-specific responses and&#xD;
           tumor growth inhibition in multiple pre-clinical models of HPV-positive malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In clinical studies done in the CCR, M7824 as monotherapy has produced a notable&#xD;
           objective response rate (35-40%) for metastatic HPV + cancers including Oropharyngeal&#xD;
           Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OPSCC) and preclinical studies support the addition of an&#xD;
           investigational HPV vaccine with therapeutic intent (PRGN-2009, a gorilla adenoviral&#xD;
           based vaccine) to further increase anti-tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I in participants with recurrent/metastatic HPV positive cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objective: To determine the safety and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of PRGN-2009&#xD;
      (HPV vaccine) alone or in combination with M7824 administered at RP2D of 1200 mg q2w.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II in participants with newly diagnosed stage I (T1,T2 N1)/II/III p16-positive&#xD;
      oropharyngeal cancer and patients with newly diagnosed operable stage II/III/IVA/IVB/HPV +&#xD;
      sinonasal squamos cell cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Primary objective: To determine if either HPV vaccine alone (Arm 2A) or in combination with&#xD;
      M7824 (Arm 2B) is able to result in a &gt;= 2-fold increase in CD3+ tumor infiltrating T cells&#xD;
      post treatment compared with pre-treatment in p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men or women of age &gt;= 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
           HPV associated malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cervical cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  p16+ Oropharyngeal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Anal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vulvar, vaginal, penile, and squamous cell rectal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (e.g. lung, esophagus) that are known&#xD;
           HPV+.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard&#xD;
           treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men or women of age &gt;= 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with newly diagnosed stage I (T1,T2 N1), II or III II or III p16-positive&#xD;
           oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) or stage II/III/IVA/IVB HPV-SNSCC planned&#xD;
           for definitive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Recurrent/metastatic HPV associated cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 3+3 dose escalation design will be used which will evaluate PRGN-2009 (HPV vaccine) at&#xD;
           two dose levels (1x10^11 and 5x10^11 viral particle (VP) units) given as monotherapy&#xD;
           followed by a third dose level evaluating the RP2D dose of PRGN-2009 in combination with&#xD;
           1200 mg (RP2D) of M7824. In addition, the combination of PRGN-2009 at RP2D with 1200 mg&#xD;
           of M7824 will be expanded to a total of 10 evaluable participants to gauge the&#xD;
           preliminary efficacy of the combination of PRGN-2009 and M7824 in participants with&#xD;
           advanced disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be a 4-week DLT evaluation period for each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that up to 22 participants may enroll in 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly diagnosed p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential two-arm evaluation of HPV vaccine alone (Arm 2A: Stage I (T1,T2 N1)/II/III)&#xD;
           or HPV vaccine plus M7824 (Arm 2B: Stage II/III) as neoadjuvant/ induction therapy&#xD;
           before definitive standard of care therapy (20 participants each arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive neoadjuvant/ induction immunotherapy at NIH Clinical Center&#xD;
           and then be referred back to their home institution for definitive standard of care&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that up to 40 participants may enroll in 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Newly diagnosed stage II/III/IVA/IVB HPV-SNSCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment and treatment will occur similarly as participants with p16+oropharyngeal&#xD;
           cancer for exploratory correlates to advise possible future trials. Up to 4 participants&#xD;
           may enroll in this group.&#xD;

             investigator has assessed that all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved&#xD;
             or are minimal and feel the participant is otherwise suitable for enrollment.&#xD;
             Participants may continue adjuvant hormonal therapy in the setting of a definitively&#xD;
             treated cancer (e.g. breast).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to the first drug administration (minimally&#xD;
             invasive procedures such as diagnostic biopsies are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active brain or central nervous system metastasis (less than a month out from&#xD;
             definitive radiotherapy or surgery), seizures requiring anticonvulsant treatment (&lt;3&#xD;
             months) or clinically significant cerebrovascular accident (&lt;3 months). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible participants must have repeated CNS imaging at least a month after definitive&#xD;
             treatment showing stable CNS disease. Participants with evidence of intratumoral or&#xD;
             peritumoral hemorrhage on baseline imaging are also excluded unless the hemorrhage is&#xD;
             grade =&lt; 1 and has been shown to be stable on two consecutive imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M7824 and PRGN-2009 vaccine have&#xD;
             not been tested in pregnant women and there is potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these&#xD;
             immunotherapies, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory&#xD;
             agent with exception of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetes type I, eczema, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid&#xD;
                  disease or other mild autoimmune disorders not requiring immunosuppressive&#xD;
                  treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation)&#xD;
                  is acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on systemic intravenous or oral corticosteroid therapy with the&#xD;
                  exception of&#xD;
&#xD;
        physiologic doses of corticosteroids (=&lt; the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg/day) or other&#xD;
        immunosuppressors such as azathioprine or cyclosporin A are excluded on the basis of&#xD;
        potential immune suppression. For these subjects these excluded treatments must be&#xD;
        discontinued at least 1 weeks prior to enrollment for recent short course use (=&lt; 14 days)&#xD;
        or discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment for long term use (&gt; 14 days). In&#xD;
        addition, the use of corticosteroids as premedication for contrast-enhanced studies is&#xD;
        allowed prior to enrollment and on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as&#xD;
             cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, bleeding diathesis or recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) clinically significant bleeding events, known left ventricular ejection&#xD;
             fraction &lt;50% (confirmation of EF &gt; 50% is not required for eligibility), history of&#xD;
             myocarditis, or recent myocardial infarction (within 6 months), or other illness&#xD;
             considered by the Investigator as high risk for M7824 drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects refusing to accept blood products as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except for the following:&#xD;
             adequately treated localized skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, other localized malignancy which has been adequately treated or&#xD;
             malignancy which does not require active systemic treatment (e.g., low risk CLL). For&#xD;
             participants enrolled on the phase I portion of the protocol a second HPV driven&#xD;
             malignancy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known severe hypersensitivity reaction to monoclonal antibodies or its&#xD;
             excipients (grade &gt;/= 3 NCI-CTCAE v5) will be evaluated by the allergy/immunology team&#xD;
             prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, fludarabine) or&#xD;
             any organ transplantation requiring ongoing immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants who may receive M7824, previous life-threatening side effects&#xD;
             resulting from prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with pulse oximetry &lt; 92% on room air at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants whose inclusion in the trail would in the judgement of the PI lead to&#xD;
             time from diagnosis to initiation of curative treatment of &gt;70 days (Arms 2A and 2B&#xD;
             only).&#xD;
