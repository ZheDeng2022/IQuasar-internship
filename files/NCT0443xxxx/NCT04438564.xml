      The immune system is our body's defense mechanism, which helps us to resist foreign pathogens&#xD;
      and cancer cells in the body. However, if the immune system is too weak, too strong, or&#xD;
      unbalanced, it will be susceptible to get bacterial and viral infections, unable to fight&#xD;
      cancer, or cause allergies, autoimmune and rheumatic diseases. At present, there is no good&#xD;
      western medicine to strengthen immunity when the body is insufficient immunity. However,&#xD;
      strong immunity causes autoimmune diseases and need to be treated by steroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive agents. These drugs have limited efficacy and often have many side effects.&#xD;
      In the clinical practice of traditional Chinese medicine, tonify qi, supplement blood and&#xD;
      nourish yin are often used to enhance immunity. However, there is no clinical test to&#xD;
      demonstrate the modulation of immune response after traditional Chinese medicine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our preliminary study, the investigators identified that the basic immune response of&#xD;
      cancer patients is weaker than healthy people by testing the level of IFN-r (promoting T cell&#xD;
      activity, anti-tumor, anti-viral), TNF-a (promoting B cell proliferation, producing&#xD;
      antibodies, anti-tumor, anti-viral) and IL-2 (regulate the proliferation and&#xD;
      differentiation). Besides, some Chinese herbal extracts can significantly stimulate the&#xD;
      immune response higher than the general average basic immunity of cancer patients. Further,&#xD;
      we will use the stimulatory Chinese medicine extract to administer to cancer patients and&#xD;
      examine the immune response of cancer patients after taking them. Therefore, this test can&#xD;
      provide actual data on the basic immunity of healthy people or cancer patients and the&#xD;
      modulation of immune response by traditional Chinese medicine treatment. This analysis&#xD;
      platform provides patients to select the medicines that can enhance the immune response for&#xD;
      individuals and analyze the changes of the immune response after conditioning with the&#xD;
      candidate Chinese medicines. Therefore, this test could be applied clinically to validate the&#xD;
      immunological regulation of Chinese herbal medicine as well as analyze the immunological&#xD;
      modulation against different cancer by various Chinese herbal medicine.&#xD;

      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and dendritic cells (DCs) activation/maturation One of the&#xD;
      important approaches to successful cancer immunotherapy is generation of specific T cell&#xD;
      responses by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are the most potent antigen-presenting cells for&#xD;
      naive T cells, because their high expression of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules. DCs&#xD;
      comprise several subsets, and their roles in the presentation of antigens derived from&#xD;
      pathogens, vaccines and self tissues are now beginning to be elucidated. Immature DCs (iDCs)&#xD;
      resided in periphery have a high ability to endocytose antigens and become to mature DCs&#xD;
      (mDCs) upon a variety of stimuli through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, iDCs facilitate&#xD;
      immune tolerance and fully mDCs can promote immune responses. Until now, there are some&#xD;
      studies have demonstrated that TCM could promote the activation status of DC to enhance&#xD;
      immune responses through TLR, which are characterized by increased expression of&#xD;
      co-stimulatory moleculars, MHC class II and several cytokines. Ganoderma lucidum and&#xD;
      Cordyceps sinensis have been widely used in Asian countries to have beneficial effects on&#xD;
      human health. Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides have been reported to induce DCs maturation&#xD;
      and promote the cytotoxicity of specific CTL. Moreover, Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides&#xD;
      were able to induce DC activation markers production and cytokines expression through TLR-4&#xD;
      signaling pathway. However, this character about TCM acted as TLR agonists could apply to&#xD;
      develop safe and effective adjuvant in vaccine generation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and T cell activation T cells are the master regulators of&#xD;
      adaptive immune responses. Proper T cell responses are essential for the hosts to orchestrate&#xD;
      sufficient adaptive immunity. Classically, the TH1/TH2 hypothesis has served the immunology&#xD;
      community well, particularly in understanding infectious and allergic diseases. Regulatory T&#xD;
      cells (Treg) are suppressive T cells that regulate effector T cell immunity. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      this model dose not fit all systems when it comes to the study of organ-specific autoimmune&#xD;
      diseases. It has also become more and more clear, however, that many complicated pathological&#xD;
      situations cannot be simply explained by the TH1 cell and TH2 cell paradigm. Efforts to&#xD;
      resolve these issues in recent years have resulted in the discovery of TH17 cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cell immunity is crucial for anti-tumor immunity. Given their importance in immune&#xD;
      responses and diseases, it is important to understand the regulation of T cell immunity. In&#xD;
      immune system, different lineages of immune cells were conventionally distinguished by the&#xD;
      morphology and expression of a cluster of differentiation markers on the cell surface. TH1&#xD;
      cells that make IL-2 and IFN-r are important for delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions,&#xD;
      whereas TH2 cells that make IL-4 promote IgE production and allergic reaction. The&#xD;
      differentiation of TH1 and TH2 cells mainly through the induction of distinct transcriptional&#xD;
      programs. Activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1 (STAT1) by IFN-r&#xD;
      and STAT4 by IL-12 drives expression of T-bet for TH1 programming. On the other hand,&#xD;
      activation of STAT6 by IL-4 promotes GATA3 expression in TH2 cells. A revise of the TH1/TH2&#xD;
      hypothesis was proposed until the discovery and IL-23 and IL-17. TH17 cell is a distinct T&#xD;
      helper cell population that plays a crucial role in CD4+ T cell-mediated adaptive immunity.&#xD;
      Commitment to the TH17 pathway requires the presence of both IL-6 and TGF-a during in vitro&#xD;
      culture. These cells, different from the classical TH1 and TH2 cells, do not produce IFN-r or&#xD;
      IL-4 but on the other hand express the IL-23 receptor and IL-21, IL-22, and IL-17F. ROR-rt ,&#xD;
      ROR-rt are also highly expressed in TH17cells and can be induced by TGF-a and IL-6. Our&#xD;
      previous studies showed for the first time an in vivo requirement for STAT3 in TH17 mediated&#xD;
      autoimmunity. In addition, the investigators found that STAT3 is required for the maintenance&#xD;
      of endogenous TH17 cells. In a more recent report, the investigators also found that CD8 T&#xD;
      cells, like their CD4 counterparts TH17, can be skewed toward IL-17 production in vitro and&#xD;
      in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manipulating T cell immunity by Chinese herbs is a promising field to explore. Many herbs&#xD;
      were reported to regulate the T cell activation. Tanshinlactone A from Salvia miltiorrhiza&#xD;
      Bunge significantly decreased the IL-2 and IFN-γ gene expression through reduction of MAPK&#xD;
      activation in phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Periplocoside&#xD;
      E (PSE) was shown to dose-dependently inhibit anti-CD3 induced primary T cell proliferation,&#xD;
      activation for IL-2R (CD25) expression, and IFN-γ and IL-2 production at the transcriptional&#xD;
      level by inhibited the activation of ERK and JNK. Furthermore, kurarinol was reported to&#xD;
      increase level of HBV specific CTL by down-regulating peripheral blood HBV specific CTL&#xD;
      surface PD-1 expression of CHB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these will support investigators' hypothesis that modulation of dendritic cell and T&#xD;
      cell immunity by Chinese herbs or cytokines may be an applicable intervention to modulate&#xD;
      immunity, for example, to promote anti-tumor immunity against cancer. The successful&#xD;
      completion of the proposed studies will provide a strong support for future development of&#xD;
      anti-cancer immunotherapy by Chinese herbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese herbs as a pharmacologic approach to modulate immunity Cancer&#xD;
      immunotherapy, allergy, and autoimmune diseases are among the chronic illness that accounts&#xD;
      for the death and economic burdens in Taiwan and other modern countries. Diseases such of&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, vasculitis,&#xD;
      psoriasis and Sjogren's syndrome are common autoimmune diseases that cause not only life-long&#xD;
      discomfort but also disabilities of the patients. Cancer immunotherapy is promising. Many of&#xD;
      autoimmune disease and difficult-to-treat allergies are now found to be associated with IL-17&#xD;
      mediated pathology. However, the current treatment is limited. Recently, targeted therapy&#xD;
      such as Etanercept (trade name Enbrel), a biopharmaceutical that interferes with tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor (TNF; a soluble inflammatory cytokine), has been developed to treat some of&#xD;
      the autoimmune diseases. However, nhibition of TNF has substantially advanced the treatment&#xD;
      of inflammatory diseases. Because TNF and IL-17 have shared functions, the rationale for&#xD;
      testing IL-17 inhibitors in the clinic is often based on the concept that patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to TNF inhibitors may have an IL-17-driven disease. Autoimmune diseases such of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are common autoimmune diseases that cause not&#xD;
      only life-long discomfort but also disabilities of the patients. The current treatment for&#xD;
      these autoimmune diseases is limited to analgesia, anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids,&#xD;
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and immunosuppressants. Recent studies in&#xD;
      mouse models and in humans have identified a key role of IL-17 and TH17 cells in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmunity as well as in host defense against certain&#xD;
      pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, there are some studies using Chinese herbs to modulate CD4 TH17 immunity. Compound&#xD;
      extracted from Chinese herbs, such as berberine exhibited potent efficacy inhibiting TH17 in&#xD;
      the EAE model. Triptolide also inhibited collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model of&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis, through inhibition of CD4 TH17 cells. Periplocoside A was found to&#xD;
      ameliorate EAE by suppressing IL-17 production and inhibited the differentiation of Th17&#xD;
      cells in vitro. Eriocalyxin B was also found to be effective to inhibit TH17 and EAE through&#xD;
      targeting Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator Of Transcription and Nuclear&#xD;
      factor-kappaB signaling pathways. TCM formula such as Qingkailing injection was found to&#xD;
      ameliorate rat experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Qingkailing injection can alleviate&#xD;
      autoimmune uveitis in rats, inhibit the differentiation toward Th1 and Th17 effector cells&#xD;
      and the relevant cytokines secretion. Pure compound from Daphne odora var. marginata (D.&#xD;
      marginata) was also found to inhibit TH17 and thus exhibit inhibitory effects in CIA model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the landmark study published in Science and Nature Chemical Biology is the example of&#xD;
      halofuginone, an active component of traditional Chinese herb hydrangea root (Dichroa&#xD;
      febrifuga), used to treat malaria for thousands of years. A collaborative research team led&#xD;
      by Dr. Mark Sundrud at the Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School and Immune Disease&#xD;
      Institute, Boston, MA, has reported that halofuginone halted the progression of experimental&#xD;
      autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice and TH17. Importantly, unlike other therapies for&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases, halofuginone does not have the undesirable effect of suppressing the&#xD;
      other immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have established some platforms for screening Chinese herbs not only for&#xD;
      modulating PD-1/PD-L1, IL-17, but also for detection of dendritic cell and T cell activation&#xD;
      (Immunogen Test Panel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that modulation of dendritic cells and T cells by traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine may be an applicable intervention to treat some of the immunologic diseases such as&#xD;
      cancer, allergy, and autoimmune diseases. Studies that can fit the niche, understanding the&#xD;
      function and mechanism of Chinese herbs on immune cells and its pathway, will have broad&#xD;
      clinical and immunological significance. The successful completion of the proposed studies&#xD;
      will provide a strong support for a clinical trial of traditional Chinese medicine to treat&#xD;
      patients with immunologic diseases.&#xD;
