  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIIb, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of prophylactic emicizumab in&#xD;
      previously untreated and minimally treated patients at study enrollment from birth to â‰¤12&#xD;
      months of age with severe hemophilia A (intrinsic factor VIII [FVIII] level &lt;1%) without&#xD;
      FVIII inhibitors. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of emicizumab administered at 3 milligrams per kilogram of body weight&#xD;
      (mg/kg) once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for 52 weeks. After 1 year of treatment, participants will&#xD;
      continue to receive emicizumab (1.5 mg/kg once every week [QW], 3 mg/kg Q2W or 6 mg/kg once&#xD;
      every 4 weeks [Q4W]) over a 7-year long-term follow-up period under this study frame.&#xD;

    <description>Initially, all participants will receive 4 loading doses of 3 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) emicizumab subcutaneously (SC) once every week (QW) for 4 weeks followed by the maintenance dosing regimen 3 mg/kg emicizumab SC once every 2 weeks (Q2W) for a total of 52 weeks. Starting from Week 17 of treatment, individual participants may have their dose up-titrated to 3 mg/kg SC QW if they experience suboptimal bleeding control.&#xD;
At the Week 53 clinic visit following consultation with the treating physician, parents/caregivers may elect for their child to continue with the maintenance 3-mg/kg SC Q2W dosing regimen or to switch to the maintenance 1.5-mg/kg SC QW or 6-mg/kg SC once every 4 weeks (Q4W) dosing regimen for the subsequent 7-year long-term follow-up period.&#xD;
During the study, participants will be treated with emicizumab until unacceptable toxicity, discontinuation from the study due to any cause, or other criteria specified in the protocol, whichever occurs first.</description>

             the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study or interpretation of&#xD;
             the study results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unwillingness of the parent or caregiver to allow receipt of blood or blood products,&#xD;
