  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX with intrahepatic administration of oxaliplatin is&#xD;
      combined with immunotherapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab) for the group of patients with&#xD;
      multiple liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Investigators hope to increase the&#xD;
      disease-free survival after 3 years from 10 % to 30%.&#xD;
