    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pre- or postmenopausal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Postmenopausal women are defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥ 60 years of age with no vaginal bleeding over the prior year, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. &lt; 60 years with &quot;premature menopause&quot; or &quot;premature ovarian failure&quot; manifest&#xD;
                  itself with secondary amenorrhea for at least 1 year and follicle stimulating&#xD;
                  hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels in the postmenopausal range according to&#xD;
                  institutional standards, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy. Note: Premenopausal women who&#xD;
                  meet all of the other entry criteria must be maintained on ovarian suppression&#xD;
                  (such as Lupron) during the study and subjects counseled to use appropriate&#xD;
                  contraception to prevent pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If possible, a biopsy of metastatic breast cancer tissue should be obtained to provide&#xD;
             histological or cytological confirmation of ER+/HER2- disease as assessed by a local&#xD;
             laboratory, according to American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American&#xD;
             Pathologists guidelines, using slides, paraffin blocks, or paraffin samples. If a&#xD;
             biopsy is not possible, the ER and HER2 status from the tissue obtained at the time of&#xD;
             the original diagnosis must confirm that the subject is ER+ and HER2-.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with radiological or clinical&#xD;
             evidence of progression on the first or 2nd lines of hormonal therapy for metastatic&#xD;
             disease. Progression may have occurred on no more than 2 of the following endocrine&#xD;
             treatments for metastatic breast cancer: an aromatase inhibitor (AI) and/or&#xD;
             fulvestrant either as monotherapy or in combination with any commercially approved&#xD;
             CDKi; and/or the combination of fulvestrant and everolimus; and/or the combination of&#xD;
             fulvestrant and alpelisib; and/or tamoxifen; and/or the combination of&#xD;
             exemestane/everolimus. (Note: before starting study treatment, subjects should have&#xD;
             stopped any CDKi for at least 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have had no evidence of progression for at least 6 months during their&#xD;
             first hormonal treatment for advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. At least one or more of the following ESR1 point mutations as assessed in cell-free&#xD;
             circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) obtained from a blood or tissue sample: Y537S, Y537C,&#xD;
             D538G, E380Q, S463P, V534E, P535H, L536H, L536P, L536R, L536Q, or Y537N. Note: the&#xD;
             Sponsor's blood ctDNA assay must be used but tissue sequencing (if done) may be done&#xD;
             by a validated commercial laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A positive ESR1 mutation in tissue or ctDNA using a validated commercial assay&#xD;
             if done prior or at the time of disease progression is acceptable to meet this entry&#xD;
             criteria. However, blood for ctDNA must still be obtained for genomic analyses using&#xD;
             the sponsor's ctDNA assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with either measurable (according to&#xD;
             RECIST 1.1) or non-measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects may have received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease&#xD;
             as well as those who received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen in the neo-adjuvant&#xD;
             or adjuvant setting prior to entry into the trial can be enrolled but must be free of&#xD;
             all chemotherapy acute toxicity excluding alopecia and Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
             before study entry. A washout period of at least 21 days is required between last&#xD;
             chemotherapy dose and entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Stable breast cancer metastasis to the brain is allowed as long as the subject has&#xD;
             received radiotherapy and not demonstrated any evidence of brain metastasis&#xD;
             progression for at least 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. ECOG performance score of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Adequate organ function as shown by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. alkaline phosphatase level ≤ 3 ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. creatinine clearance of 40 ml/min or greater as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. International normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT)&#xD;
                  &lt; 2.0 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Able to swallow tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Able to understand and voluntarily sign a written informed consent before any&#xD;

             radiotherapy for analgesic purposes or for lytic lesions at risk of fracture, which&#xD;
             can then be completed within 7 days prior to entry into the study. Subjects must have&#xD;
             recovered from radiotherapy toxicities prior to entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with known inactivating RB1 mutations or deletions (Screening for RB1&#xD;
             mutation is not required for entry).&#xD;

             months or any known thrombophilia. Subjects stable on anti-coagulants for maintenance&#xD;
             are eligible as long as the DVT and/or PE occurred &gt; 6 months prior to enrollment and&#xD;
             there is no evidence for active thrombosis. The use of low-dose ASA is permitted.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Any significant co-morbidity that would impact the study or the subject's safety.&#xD;
             Since CDKi have reported the occurrence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), subjects&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. History of malignancy within the past 5 years (excluding breast cancer), except basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin curatively treated by surgery, or&#xD;
