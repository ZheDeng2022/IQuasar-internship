  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between recurrent&#xD;
      hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and cognition (thinking) in individuals who have a history of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, but do not have pre-diabetes or diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will analyze whether recurrent hypoglycemia is associated with differences in&#xD;
      cognition (thinking), and if individuals with a history of hypoglycemia perform less well on&#xD;
      cognitive assessments compared to individuals without known hypoglycemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that recurrent hypoglycemia is associated with&#xD;
      differences in cognition (thinking), by analyzing results of cognitive testing in individuals&#xD;
      with a history of hypoglycemia as compared with those without known hypoglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will identify cognitive domains of interest in participants with&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, as well as inform the development of a future battery of assessments, which&#xD;
      could be replicated in a larger sample. Cognitive domains which will be assessed include:&#xD;
      memory, language, executive function, and psychomotor speed.&#xD;
