  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central Venous access by real-time ultrasound guidance is considered as gold standard and a&#xD;
      recommended clinical practice. Internal jugular vein cannulation is one of the central venous&#xD;
      access commonly used for major cardiac surgeries for monitoring and administering life-saving&#xD;
      medications. In daily practice internal jugular vein cannulation is done under the guidance&#xD;
      of ultrasound imaging after general anesthesia before the surgery. Real time 2D ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance (USG) during central venous cannulation (CVC) has shown to be superior to the&#xD;
      traditional anatomical landmark guided CVC, but the incidence of carotid puncture is still&#xD;
      4.2%. Any improvement that aids in the ease and safety of the procedures needs to be&#xD;
      evaluated. Recently USG biplanar imaging can now successfully demonstrate real time imaging&#xD;
      in two different views at the same time. Theoretically, this may help improve precision by&#xD;
      improving real time needle tip visualization and thereby reduce potential complications as&#xD;
      compared to a traditional 2D approach. This study aims to assess the feasibility of biplanar&#xD;
      USG internal jugular venous cannulation.&#xD;

      This is a single arm prospective observational pilot study conducted at Prince of Wales&#xD;
      Hospital in Hong Kong SAR. 20 adult patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgeries under&#xD;
      general anesthesia (GA) will be recruited. After GA, patients will be positioned in the head&#xD;
      low position for the USG guided IJV access. The skin of the neck will be prepared in a&#xD;
      standard aseptic fashion. After sterilization, the surrounding area will be covered with a&#xD;
      full-body sterile drape. The footprint and the cable of the ultrasound transducer will also&#xD;
      be covered with a sterile transparent cover. Sterile ultrasound gel will be used for acoustic&#xD;
      coupling during the USG guided CVC placement, but care will be taken to avoid inserting the&#xD;
      needle through the US gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USG XL 14-3 transducer will be used to obtain the biplanar imaging of IJV. A 3 lumen CVC will&#xD;
      be used to access the IJV. An experienced anesthesiologist shall perform the USG guided&#xD;
      procedure using the Seldinger method. This special transducer can provide real-time short&#xD;
      axis (out of the plane) and long axis (In-plane) view which can be used to identify, locate&#xD;
      and choose the introducer needle entry site for IJV vascular access. IJV will be assessed for&#xD;
      any anatomical variations, pre-existing pathologies and patency. Among the 'out of plane' and&#xD;
      'in plane' view, the former will be used as a primary view to guide the CVC introducer&#xD;
      needle. The reference mark/line in the primary 'out of the plane' image in the biplanar view&#xD;
      can be adjusted sidewise to visualise the needle in the 'in plane' view. As the needle is&#xD;
      visualised in the 'in plane' technique (figure 1), the relative position of the needle to the&#xD;
      target IJV can be determined which will further help in redirecting the needle towards the&#xD;
      IJV. Needle tip can be made visualised in the 'out of the plane' view by carefully moving the&#xD;
      transducer initially towards the introducer needle. Once the needle tip is visualised, it is&#xD;
      advanced further towards the target taking into consideration both the 'in plane' and 'out of&#xD;
      plane' image guidance. When the needle is visualised (in both the views) inside the vein, the&#xD;
      transducer will be kept aside, a 5 ml syringe will be used to aspirate blood and then the&#xD;
      guidewire is inserted into the IJV. Presence of guidewire will be again confirmed using the&#xD;
      same biplanar transducer before performing the dilatation of IJV and final passage of the&#xD;
      CVC. Likewise, the final position of the CVC shall also be confirmed using biplanar imaging.&#xD;
      After final confirmation, CVC will be secured safely to the neck using sutures and connected&#xD;
      to the pressure transducers for central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring.&#xD;
