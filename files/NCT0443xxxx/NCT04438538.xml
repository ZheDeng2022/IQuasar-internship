  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has suggested that Ménière's disease may be a consequence of a number of&#xD;
      individual conditions rather than developing from a single cause. This means that determining&#xD;
      the different conditions that cause Ménière's disease will help the investigators to provide&#xD;
      effective treatments. Experience from other similar medical conditions has taught the&#xD;
      investigators that the best method to identify different causes of a condition is via a&#xD;
      process called 'clinical subtyping'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to set up a large Ménière's disease database in order to allow then&#xD;
      to subtype Ménière's disease. More specifically, the proposed project aspires to achieve two&#xD;
      aims. The investigators intend to investigate a sub-type of Ménière's disease, bilateral&#xD;
      disease, i.e. both ears affected. The study hopes to identify what features predict an&#xD;
      individual developing bilateral Ménière's disease. Secondly, to test the feasibility of&#xD;
      expanding the database across the whole of the UK to involve all Ménière's disease patients.&#xD;
      This will allow many other features of Ménière's disease to be used to establish sub-types&#xD;
      and help predict the best treatment for individual patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ménière's disease is an inner ear disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of spontaneous&#xD;
      vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus, often with a feeling of fullness in the ear.&#xD;
      The exact aetiology remains unknown. Ménière's disease is estimated to have a prevalence of&#xD;
      0.25% in the UK (around 162,000 individuals) (Tyrrell 2016) and is associated with&#xD;
      significant physical, psychological and socioeconomic morbidity (Anderson 2001, Tyrrell&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a substantial lack of knowledge regarding many aspects of Ménière's disease,&#xD;
      including a fuller understanding of epidemiological aspects of the disease, aetiological&#xD;
      factors, pathogenesis, clinical course and treatment outcomes. The James Lind Alliance cites&#xD;
      Ménière's disease as the theme for four of their top ten priorities for addressing&#xD;
      uncertainties in the field of balance disorders (JLA 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is mounting unease regarding the definition of Ménière's disease as a single clinical&#xD;
      entity. Many consider it to represent the final pathway of a number of individual disease&#xD;
      processes. This is reflected by the progressive and varied development of diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      over the last few decades (Gurkov 2016). It is in the context of these observations that&#xD;
      Ménière's disease is likely to represent a heterogeneous clinical condition defined only by&#xD;
      small groups of common, but not always mandatory, symptoms. Understanding how Ménière's&#xD;
      disease may exist as a cluster of clinical sub-types is key to allowing further research into&#xD;
      its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and the targeting of specific treatment&#xD;
      strategies; as well as allowing a better understanding of the physiology of the inner ear&#xD;
      micro-environment (Phillips 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide the initial steps necessary to set-up a UK Ménière's disease&#xD;
      registry by primarily investigating a single clinical subtype of Ménière's disease: bilateral&#xD;
      disease. The development of bilateral Ménière's disease has significant implications for&#xD;
      short and long-term opportunities for treatment and rehabilitation; this in turn has&#xD;
      significant implications for communication and employment. Previous literature on bilateral&#xD;
      disease has offered widely ranging estimates of the likelihood that it will occur in cases&#xD;
      where unilateral disease is confirmed, and no clear predictors have been identified (Huppert&#xD;
      2010). However, it is a sub-type which is relatively well-defined with standard&#xD;
      internationally agreed criteria for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In areas of research such as this, the implementation of bespoke data collection platforms&#xD;
      and national registries have been demonstrated to be both effective and efficient (Mandavia&#xD;
      2017). The use of national registries has many advantages over conventional data collection&#xD;
      methods. When implemented correctly, national registries can allow the appraisal of a more&#xD;
      representative sample of the target population. Furthermore, a national approach broadens the&#xD;
      opportunities both for participation among the patient population to be served by such a&#xD;
      venture, and for public engagement and dissemination activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A national registry would allow the identification of features at presentation that predict&#xD;
      disease course and long-term outcome, improving the understanding of disease progression,&#xD;
      treatment response, and underlying aetiology. A UK Ménière's disease registry would also&#xD;
      provide a resource for broad and far reaching research into Ménière's disease beyond that of&#xD;
      defining clinical sub-types. Registries offer other benefits to patients, carers (including&#xD;
      partners and family), researchers, clinicians and other individuals that are involved with&#xD;
      the provision of services for those affected by the condition being studied. Individual&#xD;
      hospitals and the NHS as a whole can use registry data to improve the services they offer.&#xD;
      Individual patients and carers can use registries to learn more about their condition and&#xD;
      this can lead to a better understanding of how people's lives are affected. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that this work will lead to further registry development and expansion with a broad remit of&#xD;
      aims via further awards from major research funders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To develop the methods and infrastructure for a national registry by recruiting participants&#xD;
      from three distinct urban and rural regions within the UK (Norfolk, Leicestershire and&#xD;
      London). This will include an appraisal of a number of practical processes of recruitment,&#xD;
      such as data acquisition, data processing and data management. This will inform future stages&#xD;
      to expand the infrastructure to support a registry for widespread national use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will require the retrospective collection of data from existing Ménière's&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants with a diagnosis of probable or definite unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      Ménière's Disease as defined by the 2015 edition of the American Academy of&#xD;
      Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) criteria (Goebel 2016) in their hospital&#xD;
      records will be identified at ENT secondary care and private clinics. Potential participants&#xD;
      must have received a diagnosis of Ménière's Disease within the previous 10 years or have&#xD;
      received a new diagnosis during the recruitment window of the study. Unilateral and bilateral&#xD;
      Ménière's disease will be defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unilateral Ménière's Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two episodes of vertigo each lasting at least 20 minutes, where each episode is&#xD;
      associated with aural symptoms in a single ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral Ménière's Disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least two episodes of vertigo each lasting at least 20 minutes, where each episode is&#xD;
      associated with aural symptoms in both ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will include contemporaneous and historical information regarding medical and relevant&#xD;
      social/occupational history, audiometric data, vestibular testing data, radiological data and&#xD;
      symptom specific and health related quality of life questionnaires. Clinical data will be&#xD;
      requested, collected and extracted locally and entered directly into the Study Dataset&#xD;
      managed by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit at the University of East Anglia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be offered the option of completing the study questionnaires online or on&#xD;
      paper (for entry by a member of the research team). No additional outpatient appointments&#xD;
      outside normal care pathways will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full dataset will be composed of three components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history. This will be completed by the participant onto a predefined data&#xD;
           collection form - see additional document: MDR_NVPQ&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptom questionnaires. These will be completed by the participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Audiometric, Vestibular and Radiological test results. This will be completed by the&#xD;
           local investigator team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that participants will spend no longer than 60 minutes to&#xD;
      complete the necessary forms and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to complete a non-validated Ménière's disease questionnaire about&#xD;
      their Ménière's disease including demographics, history, symptoms including triggers of&#xD;
      Ménière's disease related vertigo attacks, comorbidities, current treatment and past&#xD;
      treatments tried for Ménière's disease.&#xD;
