      This is a multinational multicenter cross-sectional study in patients with a definite&#xD;
      diagnosis of PsA. The population of interest will consist of 400 adult patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with PsA and fulfilling the classification criteria for PsA and not receiving biological or&#xD;
      targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (b or tsDMARDs). Participating&#xD;
      rheumatologists are encouraged to include consecutive PsA patients not treated with biologic&#xD;
      or a targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug because of their potential&#xD;
      impact on active inflammatory changes in the axial skeleton, which will be the focus of the&#xD;
      current study. Patients will be recruited prospectively in selected study centres and will&#xD;
      undergo study-related examinations including imaging of the axial skeleton (X-rays and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging). Collected data will serve as a basis for the judgement on the&#xD;
      presence or absence of axial involvement by the local investigator and, independently, by the&#xD;
      central study committee.&#xD;

      Background. Involvement of the axial skeleton (of sacroiliac joints and / or spine) is one of&#xD;
      the frequent manifestations associated with psoriatic skin disease along with involvement of&#xD;
      peripheral musculoskeletal structures (peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis), which&#xD;
      are usually referred to as psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Depending on the definition used, the&#xD;
      prevalence of axial disease varies from 25% to 70% of patients with PsA. There is an urgent&#xD;
      need for an evidence-based definition and a unified and widely accepted nomenclature for&#xD;
      axial involvement in PsA that would allow defining a homogeneous subgroup of patients in the&#xD;
      heterogeneous PsA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and study objectives. To develop a data-driven definition of axial involvement in PsA&#xD;
      based on cross-sectional evaluation of patients with a diagnosis of PsA fulfilling the CASPAR&#xD;
      criteria. The study objectives are: to determine the prevalence of axial involvement in a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with PsA; to identify the frequency of imaging findings suggestive of&#xD;
      inflammatory involvement of axial skeleton in PsA; to identify factors (clinical, lab,&#xD;
      imaging) associated with the presence of axial involvement in PsA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and study population. This is a multinational multicenter cross-sectional study&#xD;
      in patients with a definite diagnosis of PsA. The population of interest will consist of 400&#xD;
      adult patients diagnosed with PsA and fulfilling the classification criteria for PsA and not&#xD;
      receiving biological or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b or&#xD;
      tsDMARDs). Participating rheumatologists are encouraged to include consecutive PsA patients&#xD;
      not treated with biologic or a targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug&#xD;
      because of their potential impact on active inflammatory changes in the axial skeleton, which&#xD;
      will be the focus of the current study. Patients will be recruited prospectively in selected&#xD;
      study centres and will undergo study-related examinations including imaging of the axial&#xD;
      skeleton (X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging). Collected data will serve as a basis for&#xD;
      the judgement on the presence or absence of axial involvement by the local investigator and,&#xD;
      independently, by the central study committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and study outcomes. The prevalence of axial involvement in a cohort of patients with&#xD;
      PsA according to the local and central assessment will be calculated in PsA patients&#xD;
      presenting with peripheral involvement (the primary analysis population) as well as in the&#xD;
      entire group. The prevalence of axial involvement as assessed by the local investigator in&#xD;
      PsA patients presenting with peripheral involvement will be the primary outcome of the study.&#xD;
      The agreement between local and central judgements will be analyzed. A sub-analysis of a&#xD;
      group presenting without peripheral involvement (i.e., pure axial disease) will be performed.&#xD;
      The frequency of imaging findings (on MRI and X-rays) suggestive of inflammatory involvement&#xD;
      of axial skeleton (sacroiliac joints and spine) in PsA according to the local and central&#xD;
      assessment will be calculated. The agreement between local and central judgements will be&#xD;
      analyzed. Parameters associated with the presence of axial involvement in PsA will be&#xD;
      explored as well. The diagnostic / classification value of each parameter will be evaluated.&#xD;
