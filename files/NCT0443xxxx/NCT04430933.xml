&#xD;
          -  Presence of measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions - situated in a&#xD;
             previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy, are&#xD;

             lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  After dose escalation, subject must be willing to undergo pretreatment and&#xD;
             on-treatment tumor biopsies (core or excisional). Note: A baseline biopsy obtained for&#xD;
             other purposes (i.e., not an NC318-02 study procedure) before signing consent may be&#xD;
             utilized if the subject has not had any intervening systemic therapy from the time of&#xD;
             the biopsy to the start of treatment with the medical monitor's approval.&#xD;
&#xD;

             surgical sterilization with a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and are not&#xD;
             postmenopausal, defined as ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea) must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening. All female and male subjects of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy or fathering children&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 × ULN unless conjugated bilirubin ≤ ULN (conjugated&#xD;
                  bilirubin only needs to be tested if total bilirubin exceeds ULN). If there is no&#xD;

                  chronic use of corticosteroids and must not have had radiation pneumonitis&#xD;
                  because of a treatment. A 1-week washout is permitted for palliative radiation to&#xD;
                  non-central nervous system (CNS) disease with medical monitor approval. Note:&#xD;
                  Bisphosphonates and denosumab are permitted medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≤ 7 days for immune-suppressive-based treatment for any reason. Note: Use of&#xD;
                  inhaled or topical steroids or corticosteroid use for radiographic procedures is&#xD;
                  permitted. Note: The use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be&#xD;
                  approved after consultation with the medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;

             therapy. Note: Subjects with stable chronic conditions (≤ Grade 2) not expected to&#xD;
             resolve (such as neuropathy and alopecia) are exceptions and may enroll. Note:&#xD;
             Subjects with a history of any grade immune-related ocular AE (e.g., episcleritis,&#xD;
             scleritis, uveitis) will be excluded. Note: Subjects with a history of a Grade 3 or&#xD;
             higher immune-related AE from prior immunotherapies are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis attributed to prior treatment with immune&#xD;
             checkpoint inhibitor therapy&#xD;

             mumps, rubella, chicken pox/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin,&#xD;
             and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed&#xD;
             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,&#xD;
             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment in the past (i.e., with use&#xD;
             of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs). Subjects&#xD;
             who have not required systemic treatment in the past 2 years may be eligible with&#xD;
             approval of the medical monitor. Note: Subjects with hyper/ hypothyroidism are&#xD;
             eligible to participate. Note: Replacement and symptomatic therapies (e.g.,&#xD;
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal&#xD;
             or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) are not considered a form of systemic immune&#xD;
             suppressive therapy and are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active CNS metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Note: Subjects with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without&#xD;

             least 7 days before the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment, or&#xD;

             intraepithelial neoplasm, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or other noninvasive or&#xD;
             indolent malignancy, or cancers from which the subject has been disease-free for &gt; 1&#xD;
             year, after treatment with curative intent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis or history of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or presence of an abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that, in the investigator's&#xD;
             opinion, is clinically meaningful.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or risk of&#xD;
             reactivation. HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA must be undetectable. Subjects cannot be positive&#xD;
             for HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen, or anti-hepatitis B core antibody.&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with no prior history of hepatitis B infection who have been vaccinated&#xD;
             against hepatitis B and who have a positive antibody against hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen test as the only evidence of prior exposure may participate in the study.&#xD;
