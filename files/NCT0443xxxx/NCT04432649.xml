      Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumor have poor prognosis despite complex&#xD;
      multimodel therapy and therefore, novel approaches are urgently needed. This study attempts&#xD;
      to treat these diseases using T cells genetically modified with a 4th generation lentiviral&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (4SCAR fused with an inducible apoptotic caspase 9 domain)&#xD;
      targeting CD276 (B7-H3). The 4SCAR-CD276-modified T cells (4SCAR-276) can recognize and kill&#xD;
      tumor cells through the recognition of CD276, a surface protein expressed at high levels on&#xD;
      many types of tumors but at low levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side&#xD;
      effects and effective doses of 4SCAR-276 in treating refractory and/or recurrent tumors.&#xD;

      Background: Patients with refractory and/or recurrent solid tumors have poor prognosis&#xD;
      despite complex multimodal therapy; therefore, novel curative approaches are needed. The&#xD;
      investigators are attempting to use T cells obtained directly from the patient, which can be&#xD;
      genetically modified to express a 4th generation CD276-specific chimeric antigen receptor&#xD;
      (4SCAR-276). The CAR molecules enable the T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells through&#xD;
      the recognition of the surface CD276, which is expressed at high levels on tumor cells&#xD;
      including brain tumors, Ewing's sarcoma (PNET) and many other tumors but not at significant&#xD;
      levels on normal tissues. This study will evaluate the side effects and the best dose of a&#xD;
      novel 4th generation anti-CD276 CAR T cells to target refractory and/or recurrent solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participants will be screened through physical exam and medical history. Blood and tumor&#xD;
           tissue samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be obtained by apheresis, and T cells&#xD;
           will be activated and modified to express the 4SCAR-276 gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. On Day -5 to -7, PBMC will be activated and enriched for T cells, which will be followed&#xD;
           by 4SCAR-276 lentiviral transduction. The total culture time is approximately 5-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will receive a preparative conditioning regimen comprising&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide/fludarabine to prepare their immune system to accept the modified CAR T&#xD;
           cells. The preparative regimen will be based on patient immune condition and consistent&#xD;
           with standard chemotherapy conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patients will receive ~10^6 CART cells/kg body weight per infusion, and may receive&#xD;
           additional booster CART infusions if positive outcome is recorded.&#xD;
