  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) may benefit from immunocheckpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
      Although target antibody drugs for PD-1 and PD-L1 have achieved good results in immunotherapy&#xD;
      of many malignant tumors, there is still a lack of corresponding clinical research reports on&#xD;
      whether LELC treatment can benefit. Therefore, this study intends to adopt the basket&#xD;
      research model , to explore the application of anti-procedural death receptor 1 (PD-1)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody in patients with advanced LELC after the failure of first-line standard&#xD;
      treatment . Further explore the relationship between tumor and body immunity, tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and curative effect, and find stable biomarkers, so as to screen out the&#xD;
      superior population of tumor immunotherapy.&#xD;
