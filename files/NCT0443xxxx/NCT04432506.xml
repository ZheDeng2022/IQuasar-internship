  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and best dose of anakinra and to see how well it&#xD;
      works in reducing side effects (toxicity) associated with a CAR-T cell treatment called&#xD;
      axicabtagene ciloleucel in patients with large B-cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed)&#xD;
      or has not responded to treatment (refractory). Anakinra is a drug typically used to treat&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis but may also help in reducing CAR-T cell therapy toxicity. Giving&#xD;
      anakinra in combination with axicabtagene ciloleucel may help control relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess safety and tolerability of anakinra in reducing incidence of cytokine release&#xD;
      syndrome (CRS) within 30 days after infusion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine incidence of all grades and duration of both CRS and immune-cell associated&#xD;
      neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the complete response rate (CRR), overall response rate (ORR),&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of anakinra on the cytokine and chemokine profile in peripheral&#xD;
      blood after CAR-T therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effects of anakinra on the expansion and persistence of CAR T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate baseline characteristics with toxicity, response and survival after&#xD;
      anakinra combined with CAR-T therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of anakinra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and fludarabine IV over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days -5 to -3 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients then receive axicabtagene ciloleucel IV over 30 minutes or less on day 0 and&#xD;
      anakinra subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-6 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 and 4 weeks, and then at&#xD;
      2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;
