  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is only limited data available on the functional immune changes after&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiation in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) patients. Identifying the&#xD;
      effect of the treatment on immune cells and what their functional consequences are is an&#xD;
      essential first step to come to prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies investigating the role of immunomodulatory effects of treatment are carried out&#xD;
      in either in vitro or in vivo animal models. However, identified factors frequently hamper&#xD;
      clinical validation. In addition, as mentioned earlier, although several immunogenic factors&#xD;
      have been shown to be released by irradiated tumor cells, so far, only a limited number of&#xD;
      studies searched for potential predictive and prognostic immunological biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the first time that the immune effects of both treatment modalities will be&#xD;
      studied, with, in addition, the immune changes during durvalumab treatment, which are also&#xD;
      unknown at present. By getting more insight in the treatment-induced immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects, ultimately, in subsequent projects, this will allow to determine optimal immune&#xD;
      stimulation and hence improved outcomes of subsequent durvalumab immune therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Even with the addition of durvalumab to concurrent chemoradiation, approximately only half of&#xD;
      the patients are alive at 3 years, and more have progressed already, either locally or&#xD;
      distant. Not much is known regarding to identification of patients that will benefit from&#xD;
      adjuvant durvalumab, or regarding resistance to adjuvant durvalumab after chemoradiation.&#xD;
      Most data on immunotherapy resistance come from metastatic patients treated with monotherapy&#xD;
      PD-(L)1 antagonists. Depending on PD-L1 expression level, 10-44% of patients respond well to&#xD;
      PD-(L)1 antagonists. The majority of patients are either unresponsive, or experience a tumor&#xD;
      recurrence after achieving an initial response. The development of individual immunological&#xD;
      treatment strategies (e.g. selection of best treatment: mono- or combination ICI, ICI&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy, or the addition of radiotherapy) is hampered by the lack of&#xD;
      knowledge in the best timing, sequencing, and dosing of all modalities and the lack of&#xD;
      optimal biomarkers for monitoring the treatment response. This highlights the need of clear&#xD;
      biomarkers that can be used to select the best treatment for each individual patient and&#xD;
      predict whether patients will benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy. Currently, there is only&#xD;
      limited data available on the functional immune changes after concurrent chemoradiation in&#xD;
      NSCLC patients. Identifying the effect of the treatment on immune cells (e.g. T-, B-,&#xD;
      NK-cells, dendritic cells, macrophages) and what their functional consequences are is an&#xD;
      essential first step to come to prognostic and predictive biomarkers.&#xD;

        Patients with stage III NSCLC who are eligible for curative intent concurrent chemotherapy&#xD;
        and radiotherapy will be enrolled in the study. They receive standard radiotherapy (60 Gy&#xD;
        in 30 fractions of 2 Gy) with protons or photons according to the standard of care.&#xD;
        Eligible patients will thereafter receive standard durvalumab immune therapy for 12 months.&#xD;
        Eligibility criteria for this study are therefore similar to those for standard of care&#xD;
