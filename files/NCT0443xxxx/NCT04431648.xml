      This study is to demonstrate the feasibility of novel MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated&#xD;
      microbubble treatment to enhance radiation effects in humans receiving external beam&#xD;
      radiotherapy delivered using a LINAC (linear accelerator) radiation therapy device. The&#xD;
      investigators have previously demonstrated that ultrasound and microbubble mediated&#xD;
      endothelial cell perturbation can significantly enhance the effectiveness of radiation. It&#xD;
      enhances tumour response to radiation significantly by synergistically destroying tumour&#xD;
      blood vessels. The technique is targeted spatially and achieves tumour specificity by&#xD;
      confining the low-power ultrasonic fields that stimulate microbubbles to the tumour location&#xD;
      only. By perturbing the tumour vasculature and activating specific genetic pathways, the&#xD;
      technique sensitizes the targeted tissues to the subsequent therapeutic application of&#xD;
      radiation, resulting in significantly enhanced cell killing. The primary aim of this research&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety profile of MRI-guided ultrasound stimulated microbubble treatment&#xD;
      and radiation in patients with head and neck cancer. The secondary aim is to evaluate tumor&#xD;
      (primary and/or nodal) response to MRg-FU + MB and radiation, as measured radiologically&#xD;
      within the treated therapeutic regions.&#xD;
