    <description>The quality of life associated with asthma will be measured following the GINA questionnaire.&#xD;
The GINA questionnaire consists of 4 questions. In questions 1-4, patients recall their experience during the last 4 weeks and answer using YES or NO.&#xD;
The interpretation of the answers is as follows:&#xD;
Well-controlled: None of the answers are YES Partly controlled: 1 - 2 answers are YES Uncontrolled: 3-4 answers are YES</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life associated with rhinitis will be measured following the test ESPRINT-15.&#xD;
The scoring of the questionnaire will be carried out as follows: The global sum of the scores (ranging from &quot;0 = nothing has bothered me&quot; to &quot;6 = it has bothered me a lot&quot;) of the 14 items plus the score given in the general questionnaire (ranging from &quot;0 = Excellent&quot; to &quot;4 = Bad&quot;). This sum is divided by the total number of items (15 items).&#xD;
The interpretation of the scores is between 0 (low impact) and 6 (high impact).</description>
