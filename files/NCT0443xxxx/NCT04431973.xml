  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Medacta Shoulder System total&#xD;
      reverse shoulder prosthesis, at 2 years of follow up, in patients who required this&#xD;
      prosthesis for primary omarthrosis, cuff tear arthropathy, massive cuff tear or post&#xD;
      instability arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal is to evaluate at 2 years post-operatively the shoulder function of patients.&#xD;
      The secondary goals are to assess the rate of complications, the survival rate of Reverse&#xD;
      Medacta Shoulder System, the positioning of the prosthesis,pthe behaviour of the bone in&#xD;
      contact with the humeral stem, Patient satisfaction and evolution of shoulder function in&#xD;
      patients at 3 months and 1 year post-surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, national, multicenter, non-controlled, non-randomized study in&#xD;
      order to evaluate outcomes of the MSS reverse prosthesis used for the management of primary&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, cuff tear arthropathy, massive cuff tear, or post-instability arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients, will have an oral and written information about the study, including the&#xD;
      information note, during a preoperative visit. The surgeon will answer any questions that may&#xD;
      arise and will collect their decision after sufficient time for the patient to reflect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in the research will be able to withdraw their consent and ask to stop&#xD;
      the study at any time and for any reason. The investigator should document the reasons as&#xD;
      fully as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed according to the schedule below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1 : Inclusion during a preoperative visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2: Surgery maximum 4 months after inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V3: Follow-up visit at 3 months ± 1 month post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V4: Follow-up visit at 12 months ± 2 months post-surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V5: Follow-up visit between 24 months and 28 months post-surgery, marking the end of&#xD;
           follow-up for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical technique for implantation of the Reverse Medacta Shoulder System total shoulder&#xD;
      prosthesis will be performed according to the MyShoulder pre-operative planning (without&#xD;
      custom-made guides). All procedures will be performed with conventional instrumentation&#xD;
      according to each surgeon's current practice. It is possible to use the BIO-RSA technique to&#xD;
      reposition the pre-morbid glenoid center. The stem that will be used is the short stem&#xD;
      (cementless) with PE angulation at 145°.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected at each of the 3 month, 1 year and 2 year :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative complications as dislocation, glenoid loosening, infection, neurological&#xD;
           damage, fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival of implants according to these definitions Revision: A procedure that removes&#xD;
           all or part of the original configuration of the implant, one or more of the components&#xD;
           except for the polyethylene insert* if it has been removed and restored Re-operation:&#xD;
           Any surgical procedure that does not remove, modify or add any components to the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination: evaluation of post-operative mobility, Constant score. This&#xD;
           examination corresponds to current practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical Imaging: the results of the radiological examinations will be reviewed centrally&#xD;
           by independent assessors. These evaluators will collect the available data from the&#xD;
           radiographs of the AP view, axillary profile, or Neer/Lamy. The data from the scans will&#xD;
           be analyzed by each investigator and by the software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient questionnaire If a follow-up visit is not made, the reason will be collected and&#xD;
           noted in the patient record and on the CRF. The investigator will proceed to obtain the&#xD;
           most exhaustive follow-up data possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The clinical examination will be replaced by the Self-Constant Questionnaire which will&#xD;
           be sent to the patient for completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results of available radiological examinations will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient questionnaires planned for the study (ISS score and OSS score) will be sent&#xD;
           to the patient for completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A web-based data collection medium will be used for this study. All the information required&#xD;
      by the protocol will be collected in a e-crf. It requires only an Internet connection and a&#xD;
      browser. A help document for the use of this tool will be provided to the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management for the study will be handled by a CIC INSERM 1415 data-manager. The&#xD;
      electronic case report form (eCRF) will be developed using Ennov Clinical® software. Data&#xD;
      management will be done according to the standard operating procedures (edited in CIC INSERM&#xD;
      1415. The Clinical Research Assistant in charge of the study will be trained in the use of&#xD;
      the eCRF, then will be in charge of the training of investigators. Data relating to&#xD;
      post-operative radiological data will be entered on the eCRF directly by the independent&#xD;
      assessors commissioned for the centralized review of radiological examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed with SAS Version 9.4 (or later). The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed according to a pre-established statistical analysis plan. Missing values will not&#xD;
      be replaced by estimated values but will be considered as missing in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis report will be written integrating all the elements to be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical research assistant will ensure the rigourous conduct of the study, the collection&#xD;
      of the data generated in writing, their documentation, recording and reporting, in accordance&#xD;
      with the Promotion and Quality Control Unit of the Tours CHRU as well as the legal and&#xD;
      regulatory provisions.&#xD;
