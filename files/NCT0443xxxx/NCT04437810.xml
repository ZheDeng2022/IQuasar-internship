    <textblock>
      The role of Albumin in prevention and Treatment of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in patients with&#xD;
      Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) who are at high risk of AKI development has been&#xD;
      clearly defined , which decreases the morbidity and mortality. But the role of Albumin in&#xD;
      patient with SBP who are at low risk of AKI development (Serum Bilirubin &lt;4mg/dl, Creatinine&#xD;
      &lt;1mg/dl at the time of presentation) has been controversial and there are no placebo&#xD;
      controlled trials. We propose that Albumin at the standard doses is beneficial in preventing&#xD;
      development of AKI in patients with SBP who are at low risk of AKI development.&#xD;

      1. Aim- To compare the efficacy of albumin when compared to placebo in the development or&#xD;
           progression of AKI in patients with cirrhosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis who&#xD;
           are at low risk for AKI development (i.e Serum Bilirubin &lt;4 mg/dL and serum creatinine &lt;&#xD;
           1 mg/dl at presentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary objective: To evaluate the Proportion of patients developing AKI by day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare the resolution of SBP by day 2 and day 5 in both the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the Changes in PRA, TNF-α, IL-6 at day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To measure the Changes in renal resistive index at day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To compare Mortality by day 7 and 28 in both the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Dose and duration of albumin/placebo infusion in both the limbs: -The dose of&#xD;
                albumin was 1.5 g/kg of body weight given within 6 h of SBP being diagnosed over a&#xD;
                period of 12hrs, followed by an additional infusion of 1.0 g/kg on day 3 over a&#xD;
                period of 12 hrs. Other arm receives a similar quantity of isotonic fluid like&#xD;
                normal saline or plasmalyte&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Renal resistive index will be done with the help of a) high frequency probe(5Mhz)&#xD;
                together with the use of color or power Doppler to help vessel localization.,&#xD;
                sampling for RRI should be done at the level of the arcuate or interlobar arteries,&#xD;
                adjacent to medullary pyramids. Measurements will be repeated in different parts of&#xD;
                both organs (superior, median, and lower) when at least three reproducible&#xD;
                waveforms have been obtained. An RRI will be calculated with the following formula:&#xD;
                (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity, and the&#xD;
                mean value of three measurements at each kidney will be considered. An RRI value&#xD;
                0.60 ± 0.01 (mean ± SD) is usually taken as normal with a value of 0.70 being&#xD;
                considered the upper normal threshold by most authors. In order to maximize&#xD;
                waveform size, care will be taken in using the lowest pulse repetition frequency&#xD;
                without aliasing, the highest possible gain without noise and the lowest wall&#xD;
                filter. Patient will undergo RRI on day 0 and day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. PRA, TNF-A and IL-6: - Measurement at day 0 and day 7 PRA is measured by generating&#xD;
                AngI (angiotensin I) from endogenous angiotensinogen, followed by measurement by&#xD;
                RIA of the generated AngI. Although PRA measurement is convenient for estimating&#xD;
                the biological activity of the renin system, it may not necessarily reflect the&#xD;
                real concentration of active renin. Il-6 is measured with the help of IL-6 ELISA&#xD;
                kits. TNF- alpha is measured using flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Antibiotics to be used in the SBP: - The gold standard treatment consists of&#xD;
                third-generation cephalosporins, especially cefotaxime/ceftriaxone, given&#xD;
                intravenously at a dose of 4-8 g/d for a minimum duration of 5 d. (AASLD&#xD;
                guidelines). If patient does not respond then switch over to carbapenem (meropenem)&#xD;
                with or without tigecycline. if patient still does not respond then GM-CSF will be&#xD;
                given.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Blood samples and Ascitic fluid samples will be collected and stored for&#xD;
                measurement of Neutrophilic activity (CD66+/CD66-, CD11b) and Macrophage activity&#xD;
                (CD 14+, CD 16+, IL-6, TNF-α)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Serum Cystatin C and Urinary NGAL, markers and predictors of renal injury will be&#xD;
                measured in both the limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Management of the complications: -&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The patients who develop sepsis (presence of SIRS; positive blood cultures);&#xD;
                     worsening of hepatic encephalopathy &gt;2 grades, variceal bleed or deterioration&#xD;
                     of the clinical condition; worsening of AKI and volume overload will be&#xD;
                     managed according to standard protocols,&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Definitions: -&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: - SBP was diagnosed when the ascitic fluid&#xD;
                     polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count was &gt; 250 cells/mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Resolution of Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: - A repeat diagnostic&#xD;
                     paracentesis to document the response by a greater-than 25% decrease in&#xD;
                     ascitic fluid neutrophil count at 48 h after initiation of antibiotics is&#xD;
