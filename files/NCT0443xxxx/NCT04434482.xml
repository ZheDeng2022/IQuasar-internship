  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation and dose-expansion phase I study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK characteristics and anti-tumor activity of PARP&#xD;
      inhibitor IMP4297 and temozolomide combination therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      and with ES-SCLC who develops disease progression after 1L platinum-based regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two parts. Part I of the study will be dose escalation&#xD;
      evaluation to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of IMP4297 in combination with temozolomide. Part&#xD;
      II of the study will be conducted in two RP2D expansion cohorts (sensitive ES-SCLC cohort and&#xD;
      resistant ES-SCLC cohort) to further evaluate the anti-tumor activity, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of this regimen in ES-SCLC patients.&#xD;
