      This study will be conducted in order to determine the prevention effect of caries preventive&#xD;
      regimen using herbal toothpaste and regimen using fluoride toothpaste versus fluoride&#xD;
      toothpaste and fluoride varnish on the caries risk of patients with high caries risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is highly predominant worldwide. So, in addition to treating this caries,&#xD;
      patients should be managed to avoid new caries. Preventive measures could be applied to the&#xD;
      patients who are most expected to develop dental caries who are identified by caries risk&#xD;
      assessment. Thus, effective caries risk assessment is essential to control new caries&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries can be prevented by conducting appropriate measures; therefore, it is crucial&#xD;
      to identify those who are most likely to have dental caries by caries risk assessment and&#xD;
      giving them the essential preventive measures. Though some caries preventive measures have&#xD;
      showed success in descriptive clinical trials, there is little information on their&#xD;
      practicality with high caries risk groups in everyday usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral health is an essential part of general well being, people have used herbs in order to&#xD;
      prevent dental diseases for centuries. In 2008 the Federal Council of Dentistry approved the&#xD;
      use of medicinal plants for oral healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicinal plants can heal bacterial diseases as it is full of antimicrobial agents. They are&#xD;
      becoming more popular than chemicals due to the side effects of synthetic antibiotics and the&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance in microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies propose that herbal extracts are highly effective against significant microorganism&#xD;
      which cause dental caries like Streptococcus mutans. Herbal toothpaste decreases dental&#xD;
      caries through combined effects of antibacterial agents, oral acid neutralisers and decreased&#xD;
      plaque bacterial enzyme inhibitors present in the herbal toothpaste.&#xD;
