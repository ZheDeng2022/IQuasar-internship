    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare hemodynamic response upon endotracheal intubation using&#xD;
      either conventional laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade versus C-Mac video laryngoscope in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting without anticipated difficult&#xD;
      airway.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be premeditated with 7.5mg oral midazolam approximately 45-60 minutes prior to&#xD;
      anesthesia. The standard monitoring of Electrocardiography for ST analysis and SPO2 will be&#xD;
      monitored continuously. Capnography, tidal volume and airway pressure will also be monitored&#xD;
      during anesthesia. Arterial line for invasive Blood Pressure monitoring, wide bore IV cannula&#xD;
      will be placed before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia technique will be standardized in&#xD;
      both groups. After pre-oxygenation, anesthesia co-induction will be done with midazolam&#xD;
      0.02-0.05 mg/kg, propofol 0.5-1mg/kg and fentanyl 5mcg/kg. Cis-atracurium 0.15mg/kg will be&#xD;
      used as muscle relaxant. Patient will be ventilated manually by using isoflurane (1% end&#xD;
      tidal) in oxygen using facemask. ETT will be placed orally via direct laryngoscopy by MC and&#xD;
      C-MAC blade 3 or 4 when a Train of Four would not be achieved. All intubation will be&#xD;
      performed by senior experienced anesthetist having experience of at least 20 intubations&#xD;
      using video laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction a central venous catheter will be placed for central venous pressure&#xD;
      monitoring and a thermo dilution Swan Ganz catheter will be inserted if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracheal intubation will be performed using the standard Macintosh laryngoscope(MC) or C- MAC&#xD;
      video laryngoscope (VL) (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic changes, laryngoscopic view, the number of attempts, the time required for&#xD;
      laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, changes in rhythm, and intraoperative and post&#xD;
      operative complications will be recorded. Heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure (SAP),&#xD;
      diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) along with peripheral&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2), will be recorded before (T1) and after induction (T2), 1 minute&#xD;
      after intubation (T3), 5 min (T4) and 10 min (T5)post intubation. End tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      (EtCO2) will be recorded immediately after induction (T2), immediately after intubation 1&#xD;
      minute (T3), 5 min (T4) and 10 min (T5) post intubation. Measurements obtained after&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia when the hemodynamics will be stable (post induction) will be&#xD;
      considered as baseline measurements in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of laryngoscopy (DOL) is defined as the time from oral placement of the laryngoscope&#xD;
      blade to obtaining the best glottic view. For the evaluation of glottic view during&#xD;
      laryngoscopy, modified Cormack and Lehane Scoring System (m CL) and percentage of the glottis&#xD;
      opening (POGO) score will be used. Duration of intubation (DOI) is defined as the time&#xD;
      interval between oral placement of the ET to the attainment of tracing of 3 EtCO2 waveforms&#xD;
      after intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation. An attempt is defined as the time&#xD;
      from introduction of laryngoscope into the oral cavity until its removal. Three attempts at&#xD;
      intubation will be allowed for all groups. Failure to intubate will be defined as the&#xD;
      inability to intubate after three attempts. An alternative technique will be used in cases of&#xD;
      failure as per the discretion of anesthetist. In the case of multiple attempts, the duration&#xD;
      of each attempt will be recorded. The duration of laryngoscopy and intubation (DOLI) is&#xD;
      defined as the sum of all intubation attempts. The hemodynamic changes after intubation will&#xD;
      be evaluated after successful intubation. After the study period, the anesthetic agents will&#xD;
      be used as per the patient requirement. A number of unsuccessful attempts of intubation,&#xD;
      complications encountered during intubation (bleeding, lacerations, dental injury, etc.,),&#xD;
      and optimal laryngeal external manipulation (OLEM) during intubation will be recorded. The&#xD;
      management of these complications will be done by primary anaesthesia team as per their&#xD;
      feasibility and the costs of management of these complications will be covered under hospital&#xD;
      insurance. Difficult intubation will be assessed by using Intubation Difficulty score (Table&#xD;
      1), Thyromental distance and Upper lip bite test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse effects of A number unsuccessful attempts of intubation, complications encountered&#xD;
      during intubation (bleeding, lacerations, dental injury, etc.,), and optimal laryngeal&#xD;
      external manipulation (OLEM) during intubation will be recorded.&#xD;
