  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll and treat subjects with cutaneous neurofibromas with NFX-179, a&#xD;
      topical study drug. Eligible subjects will receive treatment for 28 days and be observed by a&#xD;
      study doctor for approximately 56 days. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4&#xD;
      treatment groups. 3 of the treatment groups will receive a specific dose NFX-179, and 1 group&#xD;
      will receive placebo. The subject, study doctor, and NFlection Therapeutics will not know&#xD;
      what treatment group each subject is assigned. Study participation requires at least 7 clinic&#xD;
      visits, blood, urine, and tissue collection, images of the treated cutaneous neurofibromas,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, and information regarding the subject's medical and disease history.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacodynamic activity (biochemical and physiologic effects of drugs) of NFX-179 Gel as defined by suppression of phospho-ERK (p-ERK) levels in Target cNF Tumors in each NFX-179 Gel group compared with the Vehicle Gel group after 28 days of once-daily (QD) application will be measured at Week 4</description>

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability of NFX-179 Gel measured by Local Tolerability Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be measured via a local tolerability assessment. The investigator will assess erythema, edema, scabbing/crusting, vesiculation, and erosion. The subject will assess stinging, burning, and pruritus. All assessments are performed using a 4-point scale (0 none, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change in cNF tumor volume after 28 days of QD applications of NFX-179 gel based on tumor volume derived from ruler measurements, ultrasound measurements and digital images. All modes of tumor volume measurement are reported in cubic millimeters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic exposure of NFX-179 Gel measured by plasma concentration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic exposure of NFX-179 will be measured during the 28 days of QD applications at select investigative sites. Pharmacokinetic samples will be drawn at the baseline visit and week 4 visit. 5 time point samples will be collected at the week 4 visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Tumor Assessment of the average overall severity of cNF tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of treatment with The Physician Tumor Assessment is the investigator's assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF tumor at a particular time point. The Physician Tumor Assessment is a 5-point measuring tumor severity (0 clear/none, 1 almost clear, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe). The assessment is performed at the Baseline visit and week 4 visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Self-Assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Subject Self-Assessment is the subject's assessment of the average overall severity of each Target cNF at a particular time point and is not a comparison with any other time point. The Subject Self-Assessment is a 5-point measuring tumor severity (0 clear/none, 1 almost clear, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe).
