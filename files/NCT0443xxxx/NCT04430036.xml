  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial to evaluate the tolerability, efficacy, and immune outcomes of&#xD;
      AGEN1884 plus AGEN2034 concurrent with cisplatin and gemcitabine in the neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      of muscle-invasive, non-metastatic bladder cancer prior to radical cystectomy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will begin with an initial safety run-in to establish the safety of the combination prior&#xD;
      to expansion to the full planned phase II. The overall phase II will be an open-label, single&#xD;
      arm study in two stages to evaluate the efficacy of the combination in pathologic downstaging&#xD;
      of MIBC. Patients will receive four 21-day cycles of neoadjuvant therapy consisting of&#xD;
      cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 in all 4 cycles and AGEN1884 in cycles 1 and 3.&#xD;
      Patients will proceed to radical cystectomy within 10 weeks after the final dose of this&#xD;
      therapy. The primary endpoint of pathologic tumor downstaging will be assessed at the time of&#xD;
      cystectomy.&#xD;

    <description>The safety run-in of the study will first enroll three patients who will begin treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 as outlined in the treatment plan. These first 3 patients will be assessed for DLTs and there will be a pause in enrollment until all three complete the DLT period. If there are no DLTs in the first 3 patients, we will proceed to further accrual to stage I of phase II. If there is 1 DLT in the initial 3 patients, we will enroll 3 additional patients to the safety run-in. If &gt; 2 DLTs are experienced in the initial 3 patients, the study will be terminated.</description>

    <description>In the first stage of phase II of this study, 17 patients will be enrolled. Patients will begin treatment with cisplatin and gemcitabine plus AGEN2034 and AGEN1884 as outlined in the treatment plan. They will be evaluated with each cycle of therapy, with radiographic restaging assessment after 2 cycles of therapy and prior to the third cycle of treatment. If no disease progression is identified, patients will receive a third and fourth cycle of therapy. Following this neoadjuvant regimen, they will proceed to planned surgery following preoperative clearance within 10 weeks of the last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.</description>
