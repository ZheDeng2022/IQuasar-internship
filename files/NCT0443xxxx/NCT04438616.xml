  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients were randomly divided in to two groups by using computerized software ; the&#xD;
           first group received flat magnetic attachment design while the second group received&#xD;
           dome magnetic attachment design.which the inclusion criteria is completely edentulous&#xD;
           patient ,Age range from 40 to 70 year old ,skeletal class 1, both sexes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant stability will be measured for both groups using smart peg /osstell at the day&#xD;
           of implant installation and after 2,4,8,12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction measure in 2 weak and after 12 weak by Denture satisfaction&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The selected patients will be informed of the nature of the research work and informed&#xD;
           consent will be obtained then randomized in equal proportions between control group flat&#xD;
           magnetic attachment design and study group dome magnetic attachment design technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic examination included a preoperative digital panoramic radiograph with 1:1&#xD;
           magnification for each patient as a primary survey to obtain an approximation of the&#xD;
           available bone height and detect the presence of remaining roots and localized pathosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will receive complete denture before implant installation .Constructed as&#xD;
           the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary impression to construct diagnostic cast and special tray .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary impression with selective pressure impression technique to have master caste&#xD;
           and occlusion block&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Face bow transfer and centric relation record will be utilized to mount the master cast&#xD;
           on semi adjuctable articulator ,then setting the teeth and trying the denture in patient&#xD;
           mouth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Processing of acrylic and lab remounting ,then delivery of the denture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The complete denture will be duplication to be used as a guide to fabricate the&#xD;
           radiographic stent after placement radio opaque marker in two lower canines then send&#xD;
           patient to perform CBCT and these duplicate denture use as surgical template to place&#xD;
           two implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT machine: planmeca / CBCT soft ware : blue sky / FOV: single arch mandible /voxel&#xD;
           size :400 Mm ( KV:90 / MA: 8 / S:11,997)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The CBCT examination where performed in radiology department / collage of dentistry&#xD;
           /cairo university&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  serial follow up CBCT not need&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients were randomly divided in to two groups by using computerized software ; the&#xD;
           first group received flat magnetic attachment design while the second group received&#xD;
           dome magnetic attachment design e. All surgeries were performed by the same&#xD;
           prosthodontic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All surgical procedures were performed under strict aseptic conditions, all patients&#xD;
           received infiltration local anesthesia (Articaine 4% 1:100 000 epinephrine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A crestal incision is made using No. 15 c blade extending over the crest of anterior&#xD;
           mandible and a full mucoperiosteum flaps elevated to provide access to the alveolar&#xD;
           ridge for implant installed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full sequential drilling under copious saline irrigation will be made as indicated by&#xD;
           the company guide lines. insertion of two implant in each group by the contra angle&#xD;
           handpiece with special adaptor.(control and study groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The flap will then be closed using interrupted 4/0 resorbable sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We connect magnetic attachment(flat,dome) for each groups on complete denture by pick up&#xD;
           procedure at day of implant installation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relief space from the denture for the magnetic attachment will be made and a rubber dam&#xD;
           will be used to closed the under cute under the magnetic attachment. pickup material&#xD;
           will be added in the relief area to connect the housing to the denture intra orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Implant stability will be measured for both groups using smart peg /osstell at the day&#xD;
           of implant installation and after 2,4,8,12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction measure in 2 weak and after 12 weak by Denture satisfaction&#xD;
           questionnaire&#xD;
