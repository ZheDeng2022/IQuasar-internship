      This is an open-labeled, expanded access protocol for eligible patients with treatment&#xD;
      resistant PTSD. This protocol is designed to provide access to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to&#xD;
      patients who are not eligible for participation in another ongoing MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life, and&#xD;
      can result in diminished cognitive and psychosocial functioning, fractured relationships,&#xD;
      inability to maintain employment, substance abuse, high-cost healthcare utilization,&#xD;
      increased depression, and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD relive their traumatic&#xD;
      experience(s) through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleeping, and feel detached&#xD;
      or estranged. Symptoms can be severe and long lasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine&#xD;
      and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin,&#xD;
      arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase&#xD;
      compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and&#xD;
      introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and&#xD;
      hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be&#xD;
      especially useful for treating PTSD. The subjective effects of MDMA create a productive&#xD;
      psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-labeled, expanded access protocol with the primary purpose of providing&#xD;
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to patients with treatment-resistant PTSD, who are not eligible&#xD;
      for participation in another ongoing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy clinical trial. In addition,&#xD;
      this study will provide supportive data on safety and tolerability of MDMA-assisted&#xD;
      psychotherapy in treatment-resistant patients with PTSD. The study will enroll up to 50&#xD;
      patients. A flexible dose of MDMA, followed by a supplemental half-dose unless&#xD;
      contraindicated, is administered duringthe Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in&#xD;
      up to three open-label Experimental Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental&#xD;
      Session is preceded by three 90-minute Preparatory Sessions and followed by three&#xD;
      90-minuteIntegrative Sessions of non-drug psychotherapy. Experimental Sessions will be&#xD;
      followed by an overnight stay.&#xD;
