    <textblock>
      Evaluate effective delivery of goal nutrition with intermittent as compared with continuous&#xD;
      enteral nutrition schedules, as defined by percentage of recommended calories that patient&#xD;
      receives per day of interest.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be approached and if the patient (or surrogate decision maker) is&#xD;
      interested, then consent will be obtained for participation in the study. The patient will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to receive usual care (continuous feeds) or intervention&#xD;
      (intermittent feeds, see details below). Randomization will occur via simple block&#xD;
      randomization within the REDCap software. Group assignment will not be revealed to the&#xD;
      clinical team until the decision to feed the patient has occurred and the actual feeding&#xD;
      order is entered. When the clinical team decides to initiate enteral nutrition, they will&#xD;
      place a nutrition consult order for tube feed recommendations. Nutrition consult will place&#xD;
      recommendations for both continuous feeding and for intermittent schedule, including enteral&#xD;
      nutrition formula and dosing. Prior to feeds being started, the patient's randomization&#xD;
      status will be revealed to the clinical team. The covering provider will then place the order&#xD;
      for enteral nutrition according to the nutritionist's recommendations for the correct feeding&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to continuous feeds, their enteral nutrition will be ordered and&#xD;
      delivered as per usual care and standard MICU procedure. Nutritionist will provide&#xD;
      recommendations for initiation rate, up titration schedule, and maintenance dosing to be&#xD;
      delivered continuously over 24 hours. Under usual care of ICU patients, our clinical&#xD;
      nutritionists provide a specified formula, a specified calorie goal, and a suggested&#xD;
      titration rate. This is typically 20 mL per hour to start with an increase in rate of 20 mL&#xD;
      per hour every 6 to 8 hours until the goal rate is achieved. Typical goal rates are in the&#xD;
      range of 60 to 80 mL per hour for 24 hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients randomized to the intervention group (intermittent feeds), they will receive&#xD;
      their enteral nutrition according to a research protocol schedule. This will involve the&#xD;
      total recommended feed volume divided into four equal volume &quot;meals.&quot; These will be delivered&#xD;
      at a rate of 400 cc/hr at 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00. The up-titration schedule will be as&#xD;
      follows: first meal will be 100 mL, and the volume of each meal thereafter will be increased&#xD;
      by 100mL until patient is at goal volume (typically between 300 and 450 mL). There are no&#xD;
      formula or diets that are inappropriate to be administered on an intermittent feed schedule.&#xD;
      The intervention will not change formula selection or total calorie goals. It will only&#xD;
      change the schedule of feeding. For all patients, regardless of feeding schedule, the&#xD;
      Kangaroo E-Pump will be used to deliver enteral nutrition, and the above rate and volume&#xD;
      parameters can be programmed in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no change in delivery of enteral free water or medications. This schedule will&#xD;
      be determined by nursing and clinical care team, as is the current standard of care. To&#xD;
      assure correct ordering of intermittent feeds and the insulin prior to each meal, an EPIC&#xD;
      orderset with prepopulated instructions will be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are no signs of or clinical concerns for intolerance, patients will continue to&#xD;
      receive enteral nutrition according to assigned schedule until they are extubated or until&#xD;
      enteral nutrition is discontinued.&#xD;
