  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HST 001 (also known as hair stimulating complex [HSC]) is a mixture of growth factors&#xD;
      secreted by human dermal fibroblasts when cultured in proprietary bioreactors which are then&#xD;
      harvested and concentrated to specific ranges. In both preclinical studies and in previous&#xD;
      clinical trials, HSC has been shown to be safe, with no serious adverse events reported. This&#xD;
      protocol design is based on the completed Phase 1 study in women which used a similar&#xD;
      investigational product (Study 16-HIS002-US; HSC660), and includes specific objective&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints (macrophotography) to measure Target Area Hair Counts (TAHC) after three&#xD;
      separate doses of product separated by six weeks (week 0, week 6, week 12) and comparing to&#xD;
      placebo treated group&#xD;

      -  Single center, randomized, controlled, parallel-design study in participants with mild&#xD;
           to moderate hair loss on a Norwood-Hamilton (N-H) Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind: Evaluating Investigator (EI) and participants are blinded; Treating&#xD;
           Investigator (TI) is not blinded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigational product is randomly assigned to subjects upon enrollment and will&#xD;
           receive either HST 001 or placebo (phosphate buffered saline [PBS]). Injections will be&#xD;
           delivered via 1 mL syringes with 31 Gauge needles to the target depth of 1.75 mm, using&#xD;
           a slow injection technique and holding the needle in position for count of 3-4 seconds.&#xD;
           Each injection will provide 0.1 mL and a total of 20 injections will be given in the&#xD;
           scalp with particular attention to the leading edge of the vertex and the temporal&#xD;
           recession areas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive intradermal injections at 3 timepoints only: week 0, week 6&#xD;
           and week 12. At each of these 3 interventional visits they will receive 0.1 mL X 20&#xD;
           injections spaced approximately 0.8 - 1.2 cm apart from one another. Dosing will be&#xD;
           split between the leading edge of the vertex region (~10 injections covering 10.18 cm2)&#xD;
           and in each temporal recession area (~5 injections covering 7.07cm2) in each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events (AEs) will be monitored to ensure safety of participants throughout the&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy will be assessed at Week 18 and Week 26 via macrophotography and TAHC by the&#xD;
           Canfield HairMetrix System&#xD;
