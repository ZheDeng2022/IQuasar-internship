    <textblock>
      This research study is testing the efficacy of an experimental drug combination for people&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma that are eligible for a stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carfilzomib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isatuximab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of once weekly carfilzomib, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, and isatuximab (KRDI) in patients with newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible&#xD;
      multiple myeloma. The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study&#xD;
      treatment including evaluations and follow up visits. The study treatment portion of this&#xD;
      study is comprised of an induction phase and a maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction Phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants will receive the same study drugs (carfilzomib, isatuximab,&#xD;
                lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) for up to 8 cycles. Each cycle is 28 days in&#xD;
                length.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All participants will perform stem cell collection after 4 cycles of therapy. Based&#xD;
                on the recommendation participants may or may not proceed to an autologous stem&#xD;
                cell transplant (SCT) as part of induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance Phase: During maintenance, participants will receive the study treatment for&#xD;
           up to two years after induction until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug combination to learn whether the drug&#xD;
      combination works in treating a specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug combination is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved carfilzomib or isatuximab as a&#xD;
      treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has also approved lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a treatment option for&#xD;
      transplant-eligible multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the FDA has not approved the combination of isatuximab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide,&#xD;
      and dexamethasone as an approved regimen. The combination is considered to be investigational&#xD;
      for the treatment of individuals with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
