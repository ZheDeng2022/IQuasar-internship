      Studies evaluating the use of customized healing screws/abutments have been performed aiming&#xD;
      to assess possible advantages with the use of this treatment modality. Despite the existence&#xD;
      of these investigations, there is a lack of information regarding a digital approach to&#xD;
      evaluate in an objective manner soft and hard tissue dimensional changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform a volumetric analysis evaluating peri-implant tissues&#xD;
      dimensional changes on the effect of using customized healing abutments compared with the use&#xD;
      of collagen matrices as socket sealing options in maxillary immediate implant placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with a&#xD;
      parallel-group design, to document the response of using a customized healing abutment in&#xD;
      maxillary immediate implants. Twenty-eight consecutive patients in need of a single implant&#xD;
      restoration in the maxillary arch following tooth extraction were included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were treated with cylindrical shape implants (OsseoSpeed EV™, AstraTech Implant&#xD;
      System, Dentsply Implants, Möhndal, Sweden) with a narrow diameter internal connection&#xD;
      platform following the surgical sequence protocol provided by the manufacturer. The implant&#xD;
      was placed in a correct three-dimensional position, engaging the palatal and apical bone to&#xD;
      achieve high primary stability. (Buser et al. 2004) After implant insertion, a gap of at&#xD;
      least 2 mm between the inner cortical buccal bone plate and the implant surface was filled&#xD;
      with DBBM material (Symbios®, Dentsply Implants, Möhndal, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups differ in the type of socket sealing. Control group fresh sockets were sealed&#xD;
      with a resorbable collagen membrane (Mucograf Seal®, Geistlish Biomaterials, Wolhusen,&#xD;
      Switzerland) stabilised with single interrupted 6/0 polyamide sutures (SeralonTM,&#xD;
      Serag-Wiessner, Nalia, Germany), whereas test group received a healing abutment customized&#xD;
      with a composite resin material allowing to close the socket without sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination and image acquisition Examination protocol and data collection consisted&#xD;
      of four appointments: 1) T0 (flapless tooth extraction and implant insertion; 2) T1 (1-month&#xD;
      follow-up after implant placement; 3) T2 (4-month follow-up after implant insertion) and 4)&#xD;
      T3 (1-year postoperative follow-up). An intraoral scan of the upper arch (Cerec Omnicam®,&#xD;
      Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) and a CBCT radiographic evaluation (Ortophos&#xD;
      XG 3D®, Sirona Dental Systems GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) were performed followed by tooth&#xD;
      extraction and implant placement (T0). At this point, two clinical parameters were assessed&#xD;
      with a periodontal probe to the nearest millimetre: BID (distance between implant shoulder&#xD;
      and the buccal bone plate) and KM (distance between the gingival groove and the mucogingival&#xD;
      junction). Intraoral scans were completed post-implant placement at one month (T1), four&#xD;
      months (T2) and twelve months (T3). In all follow-up appointments hygiene instructions were&#xD;
      given to the patients and a periodontal care was executed when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matching digital models All digital models were exported from the intraoral scanner in STL&#xD;
      format. The T0 and T1, T0 and T2, and T0 and T3 STL files were overlapped and a strict&#xD;
      alignment was made into one common coordinate system. A final alignment was done through the&#xD;
      best fit alignment algorithm for a perfect match of digital models and executed with settings&#xD;
      adjusted to the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the superimposition of digital models, a colour map was created to quantitatively&#xD;
      analyse the three-dimensional changes occurring in the surgical areas and adjacent tissues.&#xD;
      Green areas correspond to the perfect alignment of the model. The variation between yellow&#xD;
      and red represents variations of volumetric increase, whereas the variations between light&#xD;
      blue and dark blue represent the variations of volumetric decrease. A region of interest&#xD;
      (ROI) with 10 section planes, perpendicular to the coronal section of the tooth, was computed&#xD;
      at buccal and palatal aspect (Figure 2). These sections were set at the most apical point of&#xD;
      the gingival margin and ended 5 mm above it. Mesially and distally, a line passing through&#xD;
      the interproximal area limited the region of interest. The same ROI was used in each patient,&#xD;
      at the different comparison points. The intersection of these sections with the overlapping&#xD;
      models allowed the linear changes to be obtained in each area. The Mean Buccal Change&#xD;
      (MBC0-1, MBC0-2, and MBC0-3) and Mean Total Change (MTC0-1, MTC0-2 and MTC0-3) were&#xD;
      calculated in millimetres (mm) to evaluate the changes that occurred in peri-implant contour&#xD;
      (Figure 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital models superimposed in Geomagic Control X® were exported to Materialise Magics® for&#xD;
      volumetric assessment. A volumetric ROI was manually selected with &quot;Cut or Punch&quot; function&#xD;
      using interproximal areas as mesial and distal limits. All cuts were performed in the same&#xD;
      way in all digital models so that all measurements were carried out in the same areas. ROI&#xD;
      volume at T0 was computed for further comparison with consecutive volume variation values&#xD;
      (Figure 4). The 3D-analysis was conducted with &quot;Boolean&quot; functions, which allowed researchers&#xD;
      to obtain the volume variation in each time point from different variables like the Buccal&#xD;
      Volume Variation (BVv0-1, BVv0-2, and BVv0-3) and Total Volume Variation (TVv0-1, TVv0-2, e&#xD;
      TVv0-3), computed in cubic millimetres (mm3). To allow a direct comparison of different sites&#xD;
      at different time points, relative percentages of these variables were calculated based on&#xD;
      the ROI volume at T0 (Szathvary et al. 2015). All measurements were recorded to the nearest&#xD;
      0.01 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic assessment The acquisition of radiographic images was performed with a&#xD;
      volumetric dimension of 8 x 8 cm for 14s with the tomography acquisition protocol, with a&#xD;
      voxel size of 0.1 mm in HD mode. The CBCT images were imported in a DICOM format to Mimics®&#xD;
      software to perform the measurements. Buccal plate thickness (BT) was assessed for 3D&#xD;
      radiographic analysis to evaluate the initial features of the alveolar bone. All measurements&#xD;
      were obtained through coronal slice reconstructions, using an adjacent line to the&#xD;
      sinus/nasal plate as a reference (Figure 5). BT was measured 1 mm above the coronal bone&#xD;
      margin using a central slice, as well at the mesial and distal slices, ranging 1 mm from the&#xD;
      central slice. Mean BT values were obtained as the average values of the three slices. One&#xD;
      independent examiner who was not involved in the study executed all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The outcome variables were presented as mean values, standard deviation,&#xD;
      median and 95% confidence interval. Measurement time (T1, T2 and T3) was considered as a&#xD;
      factor and the following as covariates: age, gender, KM height, location, implant length, BID&#xD;
      and BT. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS™ Statistical Package for the Social&#xD;
      Sciences, version 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used&#xD;
      to disclose differences for continuous non-paired variables. Moreover, the paired Wilcoxon&#xD;
      test was used when the normal distribution of the groups was proved. A multiple linear&#xD;
      regression model, using the stepwise forward method, was built to analyse the effect of the&#xD;
      tested treatment in the main outcome variables throughout the study. All hypothesis tests&#xD;
      were conducted at the 5% level of significance.&#xD;
