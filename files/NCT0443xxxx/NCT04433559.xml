    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind Phase III study with two arms&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy and safety of the use of an IPDE in women with FSIAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      enter the study and receive active product or placebo for 14 weeks.&#xD;
