    <textblock>
      The CONTAIN (CiclesOnide cliNical TriAl covId-19 treatmeNt) is a randomized control study of&#xD;
      ciclesonide vs placebo for mild covid-19 disease. The need for potential therapy for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients is urgent. Ciclesonide has shown encouraging in vitro results, is easy to be used&#xD;
      and is readily available. It has a low rate of side effects and few interactions with other&#xD;
      drugs. It is unusual to use an inhaled steroid drug for COVID-19 but there has been new data&#xD;
      suggesting steroids may have an antiviral effect in addition to an anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to use inhaled and nasal ciclesonide to stop viral replication in the&#xD;
      nose and airways. Investigators hope this will accelerate recovery from COVID-19 illness in&#xD;
      individuals who are not admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis of COVID-19.&#xD;
