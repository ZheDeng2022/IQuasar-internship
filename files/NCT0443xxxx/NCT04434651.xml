    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effect of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block on ICP and&#xD;
      arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference (AJVDO2) and jugular bulb oxygen saturation&#xD;
      (SjVO2). Throughout this study, the efficacy of Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block as scalp block&#xD;
      in craniotomy operation will be assessed, and the effect of SPGB on cerebral hemostasis&#xD;
      during craniotomy will be evaluated by monitoring of both ICP, AJVDO2 and SjVO2.&#xD;

      This study was performed in the Neurosurgical operating room and included 52 patients&#xD;
      allocated into two groups: the treatment group (block group) and the control group (non-block&#xD;
      group). 26 patients enrolled in block group and 26 patients in non-block group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative ICP monitoring by subdural ICP monitors will be done every 20 minutes in both&#xD;
      block and non- block groups until craniotomy has been occurred, then at the time of closure&#xD;
      of the dura . Arterio- jugular venous oxygen difference and Jugular venous bulb oxygen&#xD;
      saturation changes will be recorded every 20 minutes in block and non- block groups&#xD;
      throughout time of the surgery till closure of the dura.&#xD;

    <description>Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block using 2% lidocaine in block group. Sphenopalatine Ganglion Block is performed by a hollow culture swab that is connected with a 21-gauge a syringe filled with three ml 2% lidocaine, inserted parallel to the floor of the nose until resistance is felt. The swab is at the posterior pharyngeal wall superior to the middle turbinate. The applicator was kept in the nostril for five to ten mins. The same procedure is done also in the second nostril SPGB using normal saline is performed in the control group</description>
