      Postoperative pain is one of the greatest patient concerns following any surgery. Although an&#xD;
      increased emphasis has been placed on pain management, approximately 80% of surgical patients&#xD;
      report postoperative pain with 86% of patients rating their pain as moderate, severe, or&#xD;
      extreme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the increasing adoption of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia for acute&#xD;
      pain management parallels the rapid rise in the availability of ultrasound machines,&#xD;
      facilitating description of a number of important fascial plane blocks blocking the dorsal,&#xD;
      lateral and anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax and abdomen. These new descriptions in&#xD;
      blocks are supposed to be an advance in regional anesthesia due to its simplicity and lack of&#xD;
      complications. These include the transversus abdominis plane block, rectus sheath block,&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block, pectoralis nerve block, serratus plane block, retrolaminar block,&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain is one of the greatest patient concerns following any surgery. Although an&#xD;
      increased emphasis has been placed on pain management, approximately 80% of surgical patients&#xD;
      report postoperative pain with 86% of patients rating their pain as moderate, severe, or&#xD;
      extreme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, the increasing adoption of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia for acute&#xD;
      pain management parallels the rapid rise in the availability of ultrasound machines,&#xD;
      facilitating description of a number of important fascial plane blocks blocking the dorsal,&#xD;
      lateral and anterior cutaneous nerves of the thorax and abdomen. These new descriptions in&#xD;
      blocks are supposed to be an advance in regional anesthesia due to its simplicity and lack of&#xD;
      complications. These include the transversus abdominis plane block, rectus sheath block,&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block, pectoralis nerve block, serratus plane block, retrolaminar block,&#xD;
      and now the Erector spinae block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAP is a potential anatomical space that lies between transversus abdominis and internal&#xD;
      oblique muscles, where local anesthetic can be deposited, creating a non-dermatomal &quot;field&#xD;
      block.&quot;.This block can be placed before or during a surgery either by ultrasound guidance or&#xD;
      by landmarking through the triangle of Petit (inferior lumbar triangle). Blocks can be placed&#xD;
      either intra-abdominally prior to abdominal fascial closure or by transdermal injection.&#xD;
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks can provide reliable relief of somatic incisional&#xD;
      pain. However, the lack of reliable visceral pain relief with TAP blocks may necessitate&#xD;
      additional modes of analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have investigated the efficacy of TAP blocks in benign gynecology, general&#xD;
      surgery,and non-ovarian gynecologic oncology.These studies have had mixed outcomes, but a&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis has demonstrated an overall reduction in pain and opioid usage&#xD;
      associated with TAP blocks in laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its first description by Forero et al. there have been many articles and case reports&#xD;
      including an increasingly number of indications for the ESP block: chronic and acute pain&#xD;
      treatment , rib fractures management in the emergency setting, treatment of abdominal&#xD;
      surgical pain , hip arthroplasty , analgesic management in breast surgery,or in spinal&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESP block targets the erector spinae plane, which lies between the anterior surface of&#xD;
      the cephalon-caudal oriented erector spinae muscles (that arise from and insert into various&#xD;
      bony components of the vertebral column, for example, from spinous process to spinous&#xD;
      process, rib to rib, and transverse process to transverse process and the posterior surface&#xD;
      of the spinal transverse processes. LA is deposited in the fascial plane deep to the erector&#xD;
      spinae muscle and superficial to the tips of the transverse processes, from where it diffuses&#xD;
      to the dorsal and ventral rami of spinal nerves, achieving an extensive multi-dermatomal&#xD;
      sensory block of the posterior, lateral, and anterior thoracic wall .&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESP block could result in both visceral and somatic abdominal analgesia if the injection were&#xD;
      performed at a lower thoracic level.as the local anesthetic penetrates anteriorly through the&#xD;
      intertransverse connective tissue and enters the thoracic paravertebral space where it can&#xD;
      potentially block not only the ventral and dorsal rami of spinal nerves but also the rami&#xD;
      communicants that transmit sympathetic fibers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 2019 about 22,530 women will receive a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer and about 13,980&#xD;
      women will die from ovarian cancer as for The American Cancer Society estimation for ovarian&#xD;
      cancer in the United States. oncologic ovarian cancer surgeries performed by general&#xD;
      anesthesia (GA),cannot provide adequate postoperative pain control as cytoreductive and&#xD;
      staging procedures often involve considerable visceral disruption and incisions above the&#xD;
      umbilicus have accessory innervation. and the routine use of parenteral opioids aggravates&#xD;
      postoperative sedation, nausea, emesis, impaired oxygenation and depressed ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ESP and TAB blocks successfully reduced postoperative opioid consumption in previous&#xD;
      studies, no study has ever compared their efficacy in postoperative analgesia of adult&#xD;
      patients undergoing ovarian cancer surgery under general anesthesia thus in this randomized&#xD;
      controlled study we are aiming to fill this gap in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work Aims to evaluate the analgesic effects of combined general with&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided erector spinae block versus that of combined general with transversus&#xD;
      abdominis block in patients undergoing major ovarian cancer surgery 1. Inclusion criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
             1. Randomization (in RCT only) Computer generated sequence will be used for&#xD;
                randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study Protocol After approval of the Research Ethics Committee and written informed&#xD;
                consent from all patients, A randomized, prospective, comparative, single blinded&#xD;
                as the anesthesiologist who will collect data will be blinded for which block was&#xD;
                given study to compare between ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block and&#xD;
                transversus abdominis plane block for postoperative analgesia of adult patients&#xD;
                undergoing ovarian cancer surgery under general anesthesia with lower midline&#xD;
                incision approach will be conducted on A total of 45 Patients that will be randomly&#xD;
                allocated by using computer generated random numbers into Group1: (n=15) &quot;ESP block&#xD;
                group&quot; ,Patients received preoperative US guided ESP block on BOTH sides to be&#xD;
                operated upon 30 minutes before being transferred to the OR, Group 2: (n=15) &quot;TAB&#xD;
                group&quot; ,Patients received bilateral lower TAB 30 min before being transferred to&#xD;
                the OR and Group 3: (n=15)&quot;the control group&quot;, Patients will not receive any block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day before surgery, all patients will be instructed to fast for 6-8 hours. On the day of&#xD;
      the operation, the patient will arrive to the preparation room 1 hour before operation, to&#xD;
      allow time for the block procedure and a minimum of 30 minutes to pass after the block before&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia, an 18 G cannula insertion, a start of IV fluid drip, and&#xD;
      premedication with 0.02-0.03 mg/kg intravenous midazolam will be done. All basic monitoring&#xD;
      will be applied (ECG/HR/SpO2/NIBP), and baseline values for HR, SPO2, SBP, DBP and MAP will&#xD;
      be documented then every 5 minutes till the patient reaches the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 1 a mark will be applied on the required level (T10) identified as 3rd spinous&#xD;
      process caudal to that of T7 which located in the middle of a line passing between the lower&#xD;
      tips of the scapulae, the midline (spinous processes) and the injection points 3 cm on either&#xD;
      sides from midline. While the patient is in a sitting position with support from a member of&#xD;
      staff, Preparation of the field with iodine will be made. The ultrasound transducer is placed&#xD;
      in a longitudinal parasagittal orientation using the HFL38X linear multi-frequency 6-13 MHz&#xD;
      probe of SonoSite M-Turbo of portable ultrasound system anatomical landmarks will be&#xD;
      identified including the transverse process at T10 level and the layers of muscles from&#xD;
      posterior to anterior: trapezius-erector spinae. After subcutaneous lidocaine 2% injection a&#xD;
      22-G spinal needle will be inserted under ultrasound guidance in plane, aiming towards the&#xD;
      transverse process. After a Gentle contact with the transverse process, a volume of 20 ml for&#xD;
      each side with 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected in increments with careful repetitive&#xD;
      aspiration to avoid intravascular injection targeting to cover dermatomal levels from T8-T12&#xD;
      as minimum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group 2 while the patient is lying supine, the probe will be placed perpendicular to the&#xD;
      mid-axillary line between the iliac crest and subcostal margin, the 3 abdominal muscle layers&#xD;
      were identified, and the transversus abdominis plane was located between the internal oblique&#xD;
      and transversus abdominis muscle. Next, 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected in&#xD;
      increments with careful repetitive aspiration to avoid intravascular injection, and drug&#xD;
      spread in the plane will be observed. The same procedure will be repeated on the other side&#xD;
      of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the patient will be transferred to the OR. All basic monitoring will be applied&#xD;
      (ECG/HR/SpO2/NIBP) while monitoring of end-tidal CO2 will be initiated after induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and values will be recorded for HR, SPO2 ,SBP,DBP ,MAP and ETCO2 every 5 minutes&#xD;
      till the end of the surgery then for 30 minutes from time of reaching PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anesthesia will be induced with 2 mg/kg propofol, 1μg/kg fentanyl and 0.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      atracurium to facilitate endotracheal intubation. After intubation the lungs will be&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated to maintain the ETCO2 35-40 mmHg. Anesthesia will be maintained with&#xD;
      isoflurane keeping the ET concentration of isoflurane 1-2% to maintain the BIS value 40-60.&#xD;
      Atracurium besylate top-up doses 0.1mg/kg will be given based on the response to train of&#xD;
      four ulnar nerve stimulation. Additional fentanyl dose of 0.5 µg/kg IV for maximum of 3 µg/kg&#xD;
      will be given if HR and /or BP increased more than 20% from baseline in response to surgical&#xD;
      stimulation and the total dose of fentanyl will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's pain will be monitored and documented using the Numerical Rating Score (NRS)&#xD;
      for pain at times 0,30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18 and 24 hours.(28)The &quot;zero&quot; point&#xD;
      of time will be the moment the patient recovered from general anesthesia. Time to first&#xD;
      analgesic requirement will be recorded which is the time from the &quot;zero&quot; point till the NRS&#xD;
      is 4 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 g paracetamol IV will be given every 6 hours regardless the NRS value while rescue&#xD;
      medication in the form of 50 mg tramadol IV will be given on demand when NRS score is 4 or&#xD;
      more with maximum dose of 1 mg /kg every 6 hours and the total consumption of tramadol will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications in the form of local anesthetic systemic toxicity, failed block, injury to&#xD;
      surrounding structures (peritoneum, vessels, dura ,pleura inform of pneumothorax) will be&#xD;
      documented&#xD;
