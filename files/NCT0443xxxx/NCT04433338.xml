  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric guidelines recommend preoperative weight loss of 5% to reduce the risk of surgical&#xD;
      complications. However, results in the literature on the improvement of surgical procedure&#xD;
      and outcomes are still conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of preoperative weight loss by means of a 14-day&#xD;
      low-calorie diet in bariatric patients on operative time, the ease of the Roux-en-Y gastric&#xD;
      bypass (RYGB) procedure and long-term weight loss in a real-life experimental setting.&#xD;

    <description>Ten aspects of the RYGB procedure will be scored on a 5-point Likert scale. The total score can range from 10 to 50, with 10 being the easiest.&#xD;
