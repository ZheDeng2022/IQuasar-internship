  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are many conservative treatment methods, including below arm cast, above arm cast, and&#xD;
      sugar tong splint that aim to obtain maximum functional, clinical, and radiological results&#xD;
      There are no clear indications with regard to the best treatment including conservative or&#xD;
      surgical methods for the different fracture subtypes in distal radius fracture. The purpose&#xD;
      of this prospective randomized study was to compare a new reverse sugar tong splint technique&#xD;
      that does not immobilize the elbow with a below-arm cast, in terms of patient radiological&#xD;
      and clinical outcomes and the ability to maintain fracture reduction.&#xD;

      This study was conducted at a single Orthopedics and Traumatology emergency department center&#xD;
      between April 2017 and March 2019. A two-arm, parallel-group, prospective randomized trial&#xD;
      was conducted to compare below-arm cast (BAC) and reverse sugar tong (RST) (described below)&#xD;
      treatment of DRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, 231 patients diagnosed with distal radius fracture in the emergency department&#xD;
      received prospective treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients aged &gt;18 years and with distal radius fracture type A and B (who&#xD;
      presented within 10 days of the injury) were considered for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients with AO type C distal radius fractures (treated surgically),&#xD;
      type 2 and 3 open fractures (according to Gustilo classification), previous hand or wrist&#xD;
      surgery, fractures in the concomitant side of the upper extremities, associate carpal&#xD;
      fracture, deformity on same extremity, pathological fractures, and cognitive deficit that&#xD;
      does not allow the patient to understand the functional evaluation were excluded from this&#xD;
      study. Lastly, patients who did not return for a follow-up visit at the end of the cast or&#xD;
      splint treatment were also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection and treatment methods Sample Size: The sample size was calculated based on&#xD;
      a 15-20% difference in complication rate between the two treatment groups, an alpha level of&#xD;
      5% and a power of 80%. Consequently, each group shall at least consist of 55 participants. We&#xD;
      considered an extra 20% who loss of follow-up or loss of reduction and surgery may require&#xD;
      for balancing sample size. With expectation of dropouts70 patients per group were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the initial fractures of the patients were classified by the same author using the AO&#xD;
      classification. Patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group using an electronic&#xD;
      random number generator, with those having an even number assigned to the BAC group and those&#xD;
      having an odd number to the RST group. Treatment in both the BAC and RST groups was conducted&#xD;
      by the same investigator. The reduction obtained was checked on AP and lateral x-ray of the&#xD;
      wrist, which were then used to calculate the following baseline radiological parameters:&#xD;
      radial inclination (RI), radial height (RH), and volar tilt (VT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Management Clinical and radiological follow-up was performed 7-10 days (initial&#xD;
      follow-up), three weeks, 5 or 6 weeks, 12 weeks and one year (last follow-up) after the&#xD;
      treatment. X-rays at the initial follow-up which was performed 7-10 days after the initial&#xD;
      closed reduction were taken with the cast or splint in place. Maintenance of fracture&#xD;
      reduction was defined as a loss of reduction of less than 2 mm of radial height, 5° of radial&#xD;
      inclination or 10° of volar tilt from the initial reduction films, and/or less than 2 mm of&#xD;
      intra-articular step-off. In the initial follow-up, third week, and 6th week visit, patients&#xD;
      were evaluated with x-ray to detect cast and splint complications, including those that&#xD;
      require cast wedging or valving to reduce the pressure and the presence of complex regional&#xD;
      pain syndrome (CRPS). Both treatments were removed during the 5-6th week visit in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional outcomes The validated quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Q-DASH)&#xD;
      questionnaire score and the Mayo Elbow Performance score (MEPS) score were used to measure&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.These scores were performed at the12th week and last follow-up visit for&#xD;
      all the patients. Both groups were also evaluated with the Health Assessment Questionnaire&#xD;
      (HAQ) at the 6th week visit for health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological evaluation All the radiological parameters were measured by the same author at&#xD;
      two time points: initial visit postreduction and 6th visit after the end of treatment. Radial&#xD;
      height, Radial inclination and Volar tilt were measured separetly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations The wrist range of motion was measured in degree, using a goniometer,&#xD;
      from the neutral position to flexion, extension, radial deviation, and ulnar deviation by&#xD;
      same investigator during the last follow-up visit. The forearm rotation was also measured.&#xD;

    <description>All the patients were prepared in the supine position at the emergency department. For analgesia, we used the hematoma block technique with 3 cc of 2% prilocaine hydrochloride®. In this group, after traction was applied using a finger-trap traction with a 4.5 kg weight for 5 minutes, the standard below arm cast was applied. Patients were encouraged to actively move their fingers, ipsilateral shoulder, and elbow in all the groups. Both treatments lasted 5 or 6 weeks after at our clinic</description>

    <description>In this group, after traction was applied using a finger-trap traction with a 4.5 kg weight for 5 minutes, sugar tong splint made of 12 layers of plaster was performed by one person. The reverse sugar tong splint succeeds as a classic sugar tong splint by stabilizing the volar and dorsal aspects of the wrist and forearm, maintaining the same degree of immobilization. The splint fold is located distally at the first web space of the hand, which does not immobilize the elbow. In all the groups, the wrist immobilization position was the same; pronated forearm, 15-20° wrist flexion, ulnar deviation, and care was taken not to immobilize the metacarpophalangeal joints. Patients were encouraged to actively move their fingers, ipsilateral shoulder, and elbow in all the groups. Both treatments lasted 5 or 6 weeks after at our clinic</description>
