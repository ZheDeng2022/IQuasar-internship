      This comparative study was carried out in general surgery unit, Zagazig university hospitals,&#xD;
      between January 2018 and December 2020, on 43 cases with large incisional hernia,&#xD;
      participants were randomly allocated according to the deemed option of management into two&#xD;
      groups, group A, the modified Chevrel group, 22 participants were treated by double mesh&#xD;
      modification of Chevrel's technique, and group B, the on-lay group, participants treated by&#xD;
      anatomical repair and fixation of non-absorbable mesh in on-lay position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt; 18 years old suffering large midline incisional hernia. exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complicated incisional hernia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced cardiac, respiratory, liver and renal diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients with abdominal and abdominal wall malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ASA III and IV The study condition is the large midline incisional hernia defined as&#xD;
           hernia following mid line incision, its defect is 10 cm or more in any of its diameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of the study is recurrence of hernia and local complications mainly skin&#xD;
      sloughing, seroma formation and wound infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the study participants signed an informed written consent, the study was approved by our&#xD;
      local ethical committee and institutional review board All the study participants were&#xD;
      subjected to thorough history taking and full systemic and abdominal examination chest X ray,&#xD;
      abdomino-pelvic ultrasound examination, measuring of the defect by ultrasound or abdominal CT&#xD;
      if needed, preoperative routine laboratory tests, fractionated heparin was given when&#xD;
      indicated as a prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (BMI &gt;35, previous history of DVT,),&#xD;
      they were given third generation cephalosporins just before the induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In participants of the double mesh modification of Chevrel's technique, after excision of the&#xD;
      previous scar, skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the hernia sac, the sac was&#xD;
      then opened, released off intra-abdominal adhesions and resected, the real defect size was&#xD;
      measured, the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the anterior rectus sheath,&#xD;
      dissection was limited to less than 2 cm lateral to the hernia defect edges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, a bilateral vertical incisions of the anterior rectus sheath was done parallel to the&#xD;
      midline and at maximum 2 cm far from it thus two medial anterior rectus sheath flaps could be&#xD;
      created and dissected off the rectus abdominis muscles on both sides, dissection of both&#xD;
      recti abdominis muscles was continued to be separated off the posterior rectus sheath opening&#xD;
      the retro-rectus space, linea alba was reformed by suturing each of the newly formed medial&#xD;
      anterior rectus sheath flaps to its fellow of the other side, using Vicryl\0 sutures, the&#xD;
      flaps help tension free closure of the defect and formation of a common posterior rectus&#xD;
      sheath,&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prolene mesh was spread in the retro-rectus space, extending between the two lateral ends&#xD;
      of the space and 4 cm beyond the vertical edges of the defect, fixed to the posterior sheath&#xD;
      with prolene sutures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end the anterior rectus sheath was closed with prolene mesh tailored to the space&#xD;
      between lateral flaps of anterior rectus sheath, and sutured to their medial edges with&#xD;
      interrupted non absorbable sutures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the group of on-lay mesh repair the old scar was excised, the sac was laid open at its&#xD;
      fundus, adhesolysis was done to free the abdominal viscera from the parietal peritoneum, the&#xD;
      sac was excised, skin and subcutaneous tissue were dissected of the anterior rectus sheath&#xD;
      till the linea semilunaris, taking care to preserve the perforating vessels, anatomical&#xD;
      repair was done by midline closure with prolene 1\0 non absorbable interrupted suture, a&#xD;
      prolene mesh was fixed in on-lay position by prolene 2\0 sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both groups after proper hemostasis a suction drain was left over the mesh, subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue was approximated by vicryl 3\0 skin closed by prolene 3\0.in the postoperative period&#xD;
      patients received non-steroid pain killer according to need and third generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin intravenous injection, wounds were observed after 24 hours for assessment of&#xD;
      any local wound complications specially skin flap ischemia, after discharge patients were&#xD;
      followed up in the outpatients clinic by the attending surgeon, follow up data including&#xD;
      (wound complications as sloughing of skin flap, drainage amount and duration, corset feeling,&#xD;
      parasthesia of abdominal wall and corset feeling) was collected in each visit, two months&#xD;
      after operation an abdominal wall ultrasound examination was done for detection of early&#xD;
      recurrence, a clinic visits or phone contact was done every 6 months till the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continues data was presented in mean and standard deviation, statistically analyzed using t&#xD;
      test, z test, in SPSS program 22&#xD;
