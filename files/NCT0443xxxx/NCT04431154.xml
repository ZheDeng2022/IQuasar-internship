  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test if small incentives promote linkage to care and 6-month viral&#xD;
      suppression among individuals recently tested for HIV at selected sites within Johannesburg,&#xD;
      South Africa. Individuals who obtain a reactive HIV test result will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to care or to receive financial incentives for&#xD;
      confirmatory testing, linkage to care and viral suppression.&#xD;

      This study is in collaboration with Ezintsha, a sub-division of Wits Reproductive Health and&#xD;
      HIV Institute (WRHI) in South Africa. This study will leverage on the existing research&#xD;
      infrastructure of Ezintsha, including, HIVSS testing through the STAR initiative (Self-Test&#xD;
      Africa), as well as HIV positive persons identified through other Ezintsha research studies&#xD;
      and at Eztinsha affiliated health clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a randomized trial design to test the effectiveness of incentives to&#xD;
      increase confirmatory testing, linkage to care and viral suppression. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to determine whether HIV-infected men and women are more likely to achieve or maintain HIV&#xD;
      virologic suppression if offered financial incentives vs. no incentives (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who report receiving a reactive HIVSS test result on the STAR programme, or a HIV&#xD;
      reactive test in another research study or at a affiliated clinic, will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of two groups: a) a control group that receives the standard of care (SOC) for linkage to&#xD;
      care; and b) an intervention group that receives financial incentives for confirmatory&#xD;
      testing, linkage to care, and viral suppression.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive the standard of care (SOC) following the STAR program protocol in various sites in Johannesburg. This will include provision of an HIV self-screening test kit, the standard linkage officer follow-up call following report of a positive HIVSS test and an invitation to i) participate in study visit 1 to have their positive HIVSS result confirmed and complete blood collection for viral load PCR testing and to ii) participate in study visit 2 at 6 months for Viral Load PCR. Individuals with a positive HIV test result from another Ezintsha study or an affiliated clinic will also be invited to participate in study visit 1 for baseline viral load PCR testing.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will receive the same standard HIV self-screen test kit and linkage officer follow-up call including the invitation to i) participate in study visit 1 and ii) study visit 2. In addition, they will receive a financial incentive if they complete a confirmatory HIV test at visit 1 and if they demonstrate viral suppression at study visit 2, approximately 6 months after positive HIVSS result. They will also receive monthly reminders and incentives to pick up HIV medication. Individuals with a positive HIV test result from another Ezintsha study or an affiliated clinic will also be invited to participate in study visit 1 for baseline viral load PCR testing.</description>
