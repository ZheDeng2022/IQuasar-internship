  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HERMES intervention was developed in a Danish setting after a comprehensive investigation&#xD;
      on caregivers' needs. The intervention consists of: 1) a systematic identification of the&#xD;
      caregiver's unmet information needs and 2) a subsequent consultation with a nurse providing&#xD;
      the lacking information. The evaluation carried out in a randomized trial at Herlev Hospital&#xD;
      showed positive results. It reduced the unmet information needs and improved the caregivers'&#xD;
      evaluation of the information from and communication with the health care professionals and&#xD;
      the perception of being seen and acknowledged as a caregiver. However, although research&#xD;
      projects may show a positive effect, this does not mean that the intervention will be easily&#xD;
      implemented in the health care system. Nor does it guarantee that the intervention will show&#xD;
      the expected results once implemented in a busy clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the present project will adapt the HERMES intervention to be implemented in Danish&#xD;
      departments of oncology and haematology by (in the first part of the project):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Elucidating how the HERMES intervention is best implemented in the clinical setting&#xD;
           according to the clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elucidating how the HERMES intervention is best implemented in the treatment and&#xD;
           follow-up period according to the patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Developing a technological solution (an app) for the HERMES intervention in which the&#xD;
           responses given by the caregivers will form the basis for a subsequent consultation with&#xD;
           the health care staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Revising the HERMES intervention based on the outcomes of a-c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Testing the revised HERMES intervention in a pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second part of the project, the revised HERMES intervention will be tested in a large&#xD;
      scale trial with the purpose to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implement the revised HERMES intervention in the departments of oncology/haematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the effect of the revised HERMES intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the feasibility of the revised HERMES intervention in a large scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Elucidate the effectiveness and the feasibility of the intervention and assess&#xD;
           possibilities and potential needs for further adaptation in order to secure the future&#xD;
           applicability in the Danish Health Care System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overall aim is that by the end of the study, an evidence based and practical&#xD;
      implementable method to (continous) use of the HERMES intervention in the Danish health care&#xD;
      system is available.&#xD;
