  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This online randomized controlled trial seeks to determine if inclusion of incidental&#xD;
      findings information in a lung cancer screening decision aid affects screening intent among&#xD;
      screening-eligible individuals. Participants will view either a decision aid with incidental&#xD;
      findings information or without and indicate their intent to pursue lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inclusion of incidental findings in a decision aid will decrease intent to screen&#xD;
      among participants.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by a survey item where participants indicate their response to a statement of whether they plan to pursue lung cancer screening, with answer choices being strongly agree, agree, disagree and strongly disagree. Comparison between the intervention and control groups will be made.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean score on scale of lung cancer screening knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Lung cancer screening knowledge tested by 6 multiple choice questions on facts of the benefit and harms of screening. The questions will be answered before and after participants watch a lung cancer screening decision aid. Scores will be determined by the number of correct answers for questions.</description>
