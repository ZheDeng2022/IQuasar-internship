  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative myocardial injury (PMI) after non-cardiac surgery (NCS), i.e. the elevation of&#xD;
      postoperative troponin, occurs in nearly 20% of patients older than 45 years undergoing NCS&#xD;
      and is independently and strongly associated with post-operative mortality (30-day mortality&#xD;
      up to 10%). With over 300 million surgical interventions every year worldwide, PMI has a high&#xD;
      clinical relevance on the health of the population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate (HR) is an independent and modifiable risk factor for PMI and death after&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. Numerous studies showed that beta-blockers decrease myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      after surgery in a heart-rate dependent manner, but this beneficial effect is surpassed by an&#xD;
      increased incidence of perioperative hypotension and death. Currently, no single intervention&#xD;
      is available to decrease the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Ivabradine (IVA) is&#xD;
      a negative chronotropic agent without significant effects on contractility or vascular tone&#xD;
      and has been shown to improve outcomes in the setting of chronic and acute heart diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for pilot feasibility trial: the planned definitive large trial is a multicenter&#xD;
      trial to investigate the efficacy of ivabradine to decrease perioperative myocardial injury.&#xD;
      The intervention planned is complex and demands important resources. The investigators&#xD;
      designed this pilot study to inform on the feasibility of the definitive large trial. This&#xD;
      pilot study will also provide additional information that could help investigators improve&#xD;
      the definitive large trial regarding recruitment, refinements to the study protocol and&#xD;
      improving the participant's experience.&#xD;
