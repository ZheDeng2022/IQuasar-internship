      The study aim is to investigate the differences between sex and gender in the immune-related&#xD;
      adverse events (irAEs) development associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In common feeling, sex and gender represent the same concept, that is the traditional&#xD;
      division of individuals into females (F) and males (M) defined by differential organization&#xD;
      of chromosomes, reproductive organs, and sex steroid levels. However, if going beyond these&#xD;
      aspects, which characterize &quot;sex&quot;, it can be observed how the differences between people are&#xD;
      also characterized by behaviors and relationships that are the product of the culture and&#xD;
      sociality typical of human beings. This is what is called &quot;gender&quot;, i.e. the process of&#xD;
      social and cultural construction that determines the behaviors that give life to the status&#xD;
      of an individual. Gender is therefore learned and not innate. Sex and gender do not&#xD;
      constitute two opposing but interdependent dimensions: the process of determining gender&#xD;
      identity is triggered on biological characters. The relationship between sex and gender&#xD;
      varies according to geographical areas, historical periods and cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sex influences the adaptive immunity, and may influence irAEs types, frequency and severity.&#xD;
      Together with genetic and biological differences, the roots of irAEs inequalities between F&#xD;
      and M could be linked to psycho-social and behavioral determinants. IrAEs usually develop&#xD;
      within the first few weeks to 6 months after treatment initiation; however, they can also&#xD;
      present after cessation of ICI therapy. Most studies indicate that prolonged treatment does&#xD;
      not result in an increased cumulative incidence of irAEs. Accumulating evidences support the&#xD;
      existence of sex-driven differences in immune responses as potential factors contributing to&#xD;
      disease outcome and response to therapy. Increasing use of ICI is associated with&#xD;
      immune-related adverse events caused by non-specific activation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective observational study investigating&#xD;
      sex differences in irAEs in relation to clinical factors and genetic, immunological and&#xD;
      hormonal profiles. By focusing on biological F/M differences possibly affecting discrepant&#xD;
      irAEs incidence, sex inequality will be explicitly addressed and complemented by the&#xD;
      exploration of association between gender dimension and irAEs development. Exploring the&#xD;
      irAEs occurrence in a &quot;real world&quot; (outside RCT) context will be more easily translated in a&#xD;
      ready-to-use personalized approach to irAEs timely diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;

      -  Gene-expression analysis. Blood samples will be taken in order to identify&#xD;
           immune-related genes in patients with various solid tumors treated with ICI associated&#xD;
           with the development of irAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SNPs analysis. Blood samples will be taken in order to perform a preliminary genome wide&#xD;
           association study for the identification of germline variations associated with the&#xD;
           development of irAEs. with the hypothesis that the individual's genetic makeup may be&#xD;
           related to irAEs.&#xD;

        -  Microbiome analysis. Stool collection will be performed to analyze gut microbiota aiming&#xD;

        To allow for balanced sex groups, we will include patients according to the following&#xD;
        stratification : ICI: 100 F/100 M; ICI+ CT/RT: 100 F/100 M. Due to the current ICI use in&#xD;
        clinical practice we are expecting to mainly populate the ICI strata during the first&#xD;
        recruitment period. As the recruitment progresses, the sample will be enriched of ICI+CT&#xD;
        and ICI+RT treated patients, since combinations are expanding for many cancers such for&#xD;
        instance melanoma, lung and head and neck&#xD;
