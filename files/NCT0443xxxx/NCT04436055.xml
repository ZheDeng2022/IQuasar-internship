  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposed project is to prospectively evaluate the epigenetic&#xD;
      and developmental effects of paternal cannabis and other drug use in offspring.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project involves enrollment of 40 healthy mother-father dyads that are between the ages&#xD;
      of 18 and 40 years. Urine samples for qualitative drug and cotinine testing will be collected&#xD;
      from mother-father dyads, as well as quantitative THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and THCCOOH&#xD;
      (11-nor-9-carboxy-THC) assay. A semen sample will be collected from biological fathers.&#xD;
      Relevant birth outcome data including both infant and maternal measures will be extracted&#xD;
      from the electronic health record (EHR). Infant developmental assessments will be completed&#xD;
      at approximately 6 months of age.&#xD;
