      Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in motor neuron disease (MND) patients.&#xD;
      Symptoms of respiratory dysfunction in MND patients include sleep disturbance, excessive&#xD;
      daytime somnolence, morning headaches and cognitive changes. Almost all MND patients will&#xD;
      develop respiratory problems during the course of their disease. In a small percentage of MND&#xD;
      patients, respiratory failure may present as the primary symptom at onset, whereas more&#xD;
      commonly it develops later in the disease.&#xD;

      Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in motor neuron disease (MND) patients.&#xD;
      Symptoms of respiratory dysfunction in MND patients include sleep disturbance, excessive&#xD;
      daytime somnolence, morning headaches and cognitive changes. Almost all MND patients will&#xD;
      develop respiratory problems during the course of their disease. In a small percentage of MND&#xD;
      patients, respiratory failure may present as the primary symptom at onset, whereas more&#xD;
      commonly it develops later in the disease. (1) Forced vital capacity (FVC), taken either&#xD;
      supine or erect, is the most commonly used measurement tool of respiratory function. Such&#xD;
      measures are well recognized predictors of survival (2), with supine FVC a more accurate&#xD;
      marker of diaphragmatic weakness (1). However, FVC may not be sensitive for the detection of&#xD;
      early respiratory failure and can be technically difficult to perform in patients with severe&#xD;
      bulbar weakness (3). Other respiratory measures include maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP),&#xD;
      maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) and, less&#xD;
      commonly, formal assessment of arterial blood gases (ABG). Interpretation of the trends of&#xD;
      these measures over time, combined with the clinical picture, determines appropriate&#xD;
      respiratory management. Significantly, the advent of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has&#xD;
      provided clear benefit in terms of improving symptoms, QOL and prolonging survival by up to 7&#xD;
      months in MND patients, making NIV a central armamentarium of respiratory management in these&#xD;
      patients (4) Bilevel ventilation devices (Bi-PAP) are most commonly used as initial therapy.&#xD;
      There are no established evidence-based guidelines regarding optimal timing for initiation of&#xD;
      NIV.Some studies suggest that an early introduction of NIV may increase survival (5), reduce&#xD;
      respiratory-related energy expenditure (6) and improve adherence to therapy and QOL (7).Once&#xD;
      initiated, poor optimisation of NIV represents an independent risk factor for mortality (8)&#xD;
      However, there are no randomized control trial data available that have compared the specific&#xD;
      parameters of bilevel modes of ventilation across various patient cohorts. Different&#xD;
      strategies have been used to optimize patient comfort, including adjusting the type of mask&#xD;
      and fittings, providing humidified air and testing different Bi-PAP pressure settings.&#xD;
      Despite these measures, up to 30% of MND patients cannot tolerate therapy due to secondary&#xD;
      effects of anxiety, emotional lability from pseudobulbar palsy, excessive salivation,&#xD;
      claustrophobia and nasal bridge soreness (8) Importantly, the key factors that affect overall&#xD;
      compliance with this treatment are the presence of bulbar dysfunction with bulbar onset&#xD;
      patients six times less likely to tolerate NIV than those with limb onset disease (9) Future&#xD;
      efforts must be focused on determining more accurate testing for early respiratory failure,&#xD;
      optimal time to initiate NIV and the comfortable adaptation of NIV devices for patients with&#xD;
      bulbar weakness&#xD;
