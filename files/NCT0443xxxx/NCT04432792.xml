  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess efficacy and safety outcomes of a telehealth model of abortion&#xD;
      care. The study will compare efficacy of this model to usual in-clinic care based on&#xD;
      published rates. It will also investigate participant acceptability and feasibility of this&#xD;
      model of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are 2 components to the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A clinical records review on all patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A survey study on a subset of patients who agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Records Review: We will examine medical chart data on all patients from partnered&#xD;
      telehealth providers to analyze efficacy and safety outcomes for medication abortion. These&#xD;
      medical chart data will include medical/pregnancy history and abortion outcome and&#xD;
      de-identified apart from date of birth, zip code, and dates of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey Study: Following completion of the telehealth provider's standard medical screening,&#xD;
      all patients eligible to receive care through the telehealth provider will be directed to a&#xD;
      page providing detailed information about the CHAT Evaluation Study and given the option to&#xD;
      participate. Participation in the study involves completing our online questionnaires only.&#xD;
      Being in the research study will not affect their care or treatment plan. Declining to&#xD;
      participate in our research study will not affect their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If interested, the patient will provide electronic consent and complete a baseline survey to&#xD;
      report socio-demographic characteristics, pregnancy history, and reasons for interest in&#xD;
      telehealth medication abortion services. An online follow-up survey will be administered 3-7&#xD;
      days after receiving mifepristone and then once again 4 weeks after taking mifepristone;&#xD;
      assessments will include self-report of medication administration, adverse events, and&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among those who complete the study surveys, we will investigate the feasibility, time to&#xD;
      abortion, efficacy, safety, and acceptability of telehealth provision of mifepristone,&#xD;
      measured using a 4-week follow-up though open-ended and closed-ended survey questions.&#xD;
      Individuals who opted not to take the medications will be asked a separate set of follow-up&#xD;
      questions to collect data related to diversion, to better understand potential risks.&#xD;

        The study will aim to reach a diverse sample of medication abortion patients across the&#xD;
        country in states where care is provided including California, New York, and Washington,&#xD;
        thus far. In California alone, an estimated 50% of all abortions are medication abortions&#xD;
        resulting in &gt;66,000 medication abortions per year. California accounts for 20% of the&#xD;
        nation's medication abortions.&#xD;
