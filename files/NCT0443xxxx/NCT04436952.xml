  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a highly debilitating condition with a lifetime prevalence&#xD;
      of 2%-3%, and a notable percentage of patients (40-60%) have a partial or no response to&#xD;
      medications. The present gold standard for the treatment of OCD is medications (Selective&#xD;
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) / Clomipramine) + Exposure and Response Prevention&#xD;
      (ERP). There is a significant need for alternative novel methods of treatment. One of the&#xD;
      novel methods of treating OCD is using magnetic stimulation which has already been&#xD;
      successfully used in the treatment of depression. Treating OCD is difficult with regular&#xD;
      superficial repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) hence the need for coils that&#xD;
      targets deeper structures. Thus, we are comparing the efficacy of the two different coils&#xD;
      from two different manufacturers plus using ERP in combination with the different coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (DTMS) using BrainsWay H7 coil targets deeper&#xD;
           structures such as medial prefrontal cortex. The H7 coil has already shown clear&#xD;
           evidence in treating patients with OCD and has been approved by the FDA for clinical&#xD;
           use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) using MagVenture Cool D-B coil could&#xD;
           also target the medial prefrontal cortex. Hence it might also be equally effective as&#xD;
           the BrainsWay H7 coil in treating patients with OCD.&#xD;

      i. Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the efficacy of repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) by MagVenture and Deep Transcranial Magnetic&#xD;
      Stimulation (DTMS) by BrainsWay with and without the combination of active Exposure and&#xD;
      Response Prevention (ERP) for the treatment of patients with OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Hypothesis a) We hypothesize that the combination of TMS + active ERP will have a&#xD;
      superior efficacy in the treatment of OCD. We also hypothesize that MagVenture cool D-B80&#xD;
      coil will be as effective as BrainsWay H7 coil in treating patients with OCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Justification&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The Prospective Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Trial by Carmi et&#xD;
           al. (2019) had shown significant improvement in OCD symptoms by using the H7 coil and&#xD;
           provocation of OCD symptoms before and during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study by Dunlop et al. (2016) has shown reduction in OCD symptom severity by using&#xD;
           the Cool D-B80 Coil without provocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There have been no head to head studies comparing the BrainsWay H7 coil and MagVenture&#xD;
           Cool D-B80 coil using provocation methods for both coils.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Also there have been no head to head studies comparing the gold standard treatment of&#xD;
           medications + active ERP with medications + active ERP + TMS and medications + TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) The aim of the study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of DTMS treatment and the&#xD;
      rTMS treatment with and without the combination of active ERP in patients suffering from OCD,&#xD;
      in conjunction with medications approved for OCD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Research Method/Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruit 100 patients suffering from OCD who have been treated and currently on at least&#xD;
           one SSRIs, SNRIs, clomipramine and at least one trial of CBT (Exposure and Response&#xD;
           Prevention) had an inadequate response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Make a personalized provocation for each patient and using them during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The trial will consist of 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Pre-study screening and baseline assessment;&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Treatment trial period (8 weeks); and&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Follow-up (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical severity rating scales will be taken every other week and include: (Brief&#xD;
           Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (BOCS), Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) ,&#xD;
           Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) and&#xD;
           Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I). Safety evaluations will include adverse&#xD;
           event monitoring, vital signs, and cognitive changes (Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)).&#xD;
           All measures will be taken before treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre-Study Screening and Baseline Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Potential Patients will be given complete information describing the study&#xD;
                treatment and their role in the trial, and they will be encouraged to ask any&#xD;
                questions regarding the trial. The risks and requirements of this clinical research&#xD;
                trial will be explained to each potential patient. Those volunteering to take part&#xD;
                will read and sign the Informed Consent Form for participation in the clinical&#xD;
                research trial before any trial-related procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Upon obtaining the signed informed consent, inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
                be reviewed to verify the patient's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Baseline data are defined as the data generated during the baseline visit before&#xD;
                the first treatment Session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the patients has been admitted into the study, they will be asked to undergo a&#xD;
           fMRI and then randomly organized based on age and symptom severity into the 5 different&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Comparing 5 groups of patients with OCD 1) Group 1 - 20 patients undergoing DTMS&#xD;
           treatment using the H7 coil 2) Group 2 - 20 patients undergoing rTMS treatment using the&#xD;
           cool D-B80 coil 3) Group 3 - 20 patients undergoing DTMS treatment using the H7 coil +&#xD;
           ERP 4) Group 4 - 20 patients undergoing rTMS treatment using the cool D-B80 coil + ERP&#xD;
           5) Group 5 - 20 patients undergoing ERP only&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Treatment Trial period&#xD;
&#xD;
           1) During the treatment phase the patients will either receive&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 - medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) DTMS 5 days a week for 8 consecutive weeks =&#xD;
           40 Sessions 20 Hz at 100% MT, 2 s on 20 s off intertrain interval, 50 trains, 2000&#xD;
           stimuli per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TMS will be done at active state by provocation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2 - dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) rTMS 5 days a week for 8 consecutive&#xD;
           weeks = 40 sessions 10 Hz at 120% MT, 5 s on 10 s off intertrain interval, 60 trains,&#xD;
           First 3000 pulses to the left DMPFC then 3000 pulses to the right DMPFC. TMS will be&#xD;
           done at active state by provocation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 3 - medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) DTMS + ERP 5 days a week for 8 consecutive&#xD;
           weeks = 40 sessions 20 Hz at 100% MT, 2 s on 20 s off intertrain interval, 50 trains,&#xD;
           2000 stimuli per session. TMS will be done at active state by provocation The ERP will&#xD;
           be administered for 2 hours on week 1 and week 8 and for 1 hour on Weeks 2 to 7 for a&#xD;
           total of 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 4 - dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) rTMS +ERP 5 days a week for 8&#xD;
           consecutive weeks = 40 sessions 10 Hz at 120% MT, 5 s on 10 s off intertrain interval,&#xD;
           60 trains, First 3000 pulses to the left DMPFC then 3000 pulses to the right DMPFC. TMS&#xD;
           will be done at active state by provocation The ERP will be administered for 2 hours on&#xD;
           week 1 and week 8 and for 1 hour on Weeks 2 to 7 for a total of 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 5 - ERP The ERP will be conducted for 2 hours on week 1 and week 8 and for 1 hour&#xD;
           on Weeks 2 to 7 for a total of 10 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Prior to initiation and during each treatment of TMS, OCD symptoms will be provoked for&#xD;
           each patient in an individual manner to activate the relevant brain circuitry. Targeted&#xD;
           questions will be designed for each patient using external, internal or a combination of&#xD;
           provocations and the degree of provocation on a Visual Analog Scale will be recorded.&#xD;
           These may require adjustment as the patient improves.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Study evaluations will be performed every week at the beginning of the next treatment&#xD;
           week (from week 2), prior to the first or second (preferably second) treatment session&#xD;
           of that week. Procedures to be performed at the 8-week visit will also be performed in&#xD;
           case of Early Discontinuation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Follow up period 1) All patients will be followed up at week 12. vi. Plan for Data&#xD;
