  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with mental health conditions (MHC) often face significant barriers in obtaining&#xD;
      personal valued social roles and feeling a sense of belonging to their community. With the&#xD;
      growing emphasis on community integration, and the fact that the vast majority of people with&#xD;
      MHC live in the community, there is an effort to develop interventions and services which&#xD;
      focus on recovery, wellbeing, and community integration, to reclaim &quot;right to a safe,&#xD;
      dignified, and personal and gratifying life in the community despite his or her psychiatric&#xD;
      condition&quot; (Davidson, Tondora, Lawless, O'Connell, &amp; Rowe, 2009, p.11).Music therapy (MT) has&#xD;
      been practiced for many decades with growing evidence for its effectiveness in different&#xD;
      populations, including people with MHC. Music has pivotal influences on socialization and in&#xD;
      building inter-personal skills and has the potential to be effective as a community-based&#xD;
      therapeutic approach in bringing people together in a shared experience, an important step&#xD;
      towards integration back to the community. MT encourages verbal and non-verbal interactions&#xD;
      and offers opportunity to practice interpersonal skills, build relationships and peruse&#xD;
      common goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study has a potential to shed additional light on the processes of recovery in&#xD;
      people living in the community with MHC who are participating in group CoMT. Although the&#xD;
      study will pinpoint to the domains where MT was mostly studied before (social skills, group&#xD;
      cohesion and emotional expression), it is unique in two main aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Majority of previous MT studies on people with MHC were testing short-term MT&#xD;
           interventions in in-patient brief settings. This has limited significance in&#xD;
           understanding the generalization of MT into everyday life and promoting wellbeing. In&#xD;
           the proposed study, on the other hand, I will try to evaluate the significance of&#xD;
           recovery-oriented long-term group CoMT in the community, where most people live,&#xD;
           focusing on behavioral domains where MT is expected to benefit most: The client's social&#xD;
           skills development, group cohesion and emotional expression (affect improvement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study, to my knowledge, is the first that is based on longitudinal quantitative&#xD;
           micro-analysis of filmed video sessions. This approach bypasses the participants&#xD;
           subjective reaction to a qualitative interview (which by itself is important) allowing&#xD;
           an additional un-biased angle of observation on the interaction process (assuming that&#xD;
           the participants may ignore the presence of the video camera over time).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an exploratory, retrospective, quantitative, longitudinal single-cases study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed to observe the development of different behavioral, emotional, social&#xD;
      and musical domains as well as the development of group cohesion during 9 months of weekly&#xD;
      group CoMT. These behaviors were chosen since they can serve as indicators for satisfying&#xD;
      social recovery and wellbeing (Wilson et al., 2008; Tew et al., 2012; Solli et&#xD;
      al.,2013;Jetten et al., 2014 ; Solli, 2015), can build up gradually through group meetings,&#xD;
      and can simply be observed and quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, video recorded sessions were quantitively micro-analyzed by 2 scales: one that&#xD;
      tests individual participants performance, the second tests the group performance as a whole.&#xD;
      The scales score several behavioral domains, focusing on social skills, affect and group&#xD;
      cohesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: The study protocol and informed consent form (ICF) were approved,&#xD;
      prior to data collection, by the ethics committee for the evaluation of research with human&#xD;
      subjects of the faculty of social welfare &amp; health sciences, Haifa University, Israel.&#xD;
      Participants were informed on the study, its purposes, design, and conduct both orally and by&#xD;
      explanation leaflet. Following this, all participants signed an ICF. Participant&#xD;
      confidentiality was maintained at all times. Confidential private data was not exposed in the&#xD;
      video recordings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data, including the video films, were stored and handled securely, and were destroyed upon&#xD;
      study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (XXX). The data collected in this study in&#xD;
      available as a supplementary document to this manuscript.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and setting The study involved eight adult individuals (20-65 years old) of both&#xD;
      genders, who are long term service-users with MHC (schizophrenia and schizoaffective&#xD;
      disorders). The participants took part in a weekly community music therapy group in &quot;Enosh&quot;&#xD;
      community center. The declared goal of this CoMT group was defined as a music therapy project&#xD;
      based on individual and group work, that invites the participants to share and express&#xD;
      emotional and daily life experiences through singing, improvising, playing instruments and&#xD;
      creating original songs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All group participants were eligible to be included to the study. The participants had a&#xD;
      strong interest in music, although it was not an inclusion criterion. The participants had no&#xD;
      previous music experience. Only participants whose behavior was fully captured in all&#xD;
      video-recordings were included in the individual behavior analysis, thus four out of the&#xD;
      eight individuals fulfilled this criterion and their behaviors were analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoMT sessions were co-facilitated by a certified music therapist, trained for community&#xD;
      music therapy practice, and a psychiatrist. Both the music therapist and the psychiatrist&#xD;
      received ongoing advanced training from a senior music therapist experienced in the field of&#xD;
      CoMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CoMT group followed a pre-defined protocol and the extent to which the delivery of the&#xD;
      intervention adheres to the protocol was monitored. This was done on two levels: individual&#xD;
      and group. The music therapist performed weekly individual sessions, which included original&#xD;
      song-writing based on the preferences of the participant, to explore if the CoMT meets the&#xD;
      participant's goals, needs and expectations. On the group level, a wide variety of musical&#xD;
      engagement were involved, including free improvisations, singing from song-books and the&#xD;
      participant's original songs, and playing instruments. In addition, periodic discussions were&#xD;
      held after the sessions to explore if the group goals were met and changes were applied&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis method Longitudinal video micro-analysis was performed on the video films to&#xD;
      answer the main research question: whether recovery-oriented long-term group CoMT be&#xD;
      beneficial in social skills development, group cohesion and affect improvement. According to&#xD;
      Wigram, and Wosch (2007), video microanalysis is a comprehensive and a powerful tool when&#xD;
      investigating aspects related to interaction and communication. Assessment of video films&#xD;
      have successfully been used before to explore the long-term effects of psychotherapeutic&#xD;
      interventions in people with MHC (Isbell, Thorne and Lawler 1992; Lee and McFerren 2015;&#xD;
      Wang, Yang and Yu 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five MT sessions, out of 30 filmed during the course of group music therapy were selected for&#xD;
      the study: baseline (at the beginning of the course), after two, four and five months and at&#xD;
      the end of the course (9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video recording micro-analysis was based on two scales: the first for individual participant&#xD;
      assessment - Individual Behavior Observation Categorization Scale, (Mercadal-Brotons,2014)&#xD;
      the second for group assessment - Group Environmental Scale (Isbell, Thorne and Lawler 1992;&#xD;
      Lee and McFerren 2015; Wang, Yang and Yu 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment was carried out by three blinded raters (blinded to the timepoint of the filmed&#xD;
      session) for the group analysis and by one blinded rater for the individual analysis. In&#xD;
      order to reduce inter-rater variability, the raters were trained on the use of the group&#xD;
      analysis scale in analyzing videos (which were not from those intended for the study&#xD;
      evaluation). The training continued until raters consent was achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was planned with a small sample size, underpowered to conclusively confirm or&#xD;
      disconfirm beneficial effects of CoMT in this group of people, but adequate to probe for&#xD;
      signal of potential benefit for future large-scale confirmatory study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was carried out by the F test with N=4 (# of time points), force zero&#xD;
      intercept, 3 degrees of freedom to identify if there was statistically significant difference&#xD;
      over time. This statistical test evaluates the change between each time point to the&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale to assess individual performance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Individual Behavior Observation Categorization Scale (IBOC scale):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBOC scale is an appraisal method that measures behavior against levels of performance&#xD;
      and also measures the frequency with which the behaviors occur. It is commonly used in the&#xD;
      medical arena, as well as job performance in school and work environments, and other uses. In&#xD;
      brief, the instruments of IBOC is either ordinal scale questionnaire and/or counting the&#xD;
      frequency of the tested behavior. The scale was successfully used before to analyze videos of&#xD;
      MT sessions in dementia patients, and music participation behaviors were adopted into the&#xD;
      scale (Sole et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scale tests 5 behavioral categories which are simple to quantify in a video film&#xD;
      (Mercadal-brotons,2014). Each of these categories is further divided into sub-categories:&#xD;
      Verbalization, Physical contact, Visual contact (gaze), Active participation in music&#xD;
      activities, and Emotions/facial affect and body expressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rater quantified the number of specific events that the tested individuals exhibited, for&#xD;
      example, how many times in the session the individual had visual contacts with other&#xD;
      participants. A behavior category score is the sum of all the sub-categories of the score.&#xD;
      The whole session lasts 1 hours and the assessment was carried out between minute 23-46&#xD;
      (overall 23 minutes of each session). This time frame was suggested by the music therapist as&#xD;
      it represents the time frame were the musical activity is the most pronounced during the&#xD;
      meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IBOC scale is highly relevant to the study as it focuses on the domains of social skills&#xD;
      and group cohesion, participation in music activity, and affect (emotional expression):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social skills and group cohesion = Verbalization, Physical contact, Visual contact&#xD;
           (gaze) and Active participation in music activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in music activity = to assess the degree of engagement in singing, playing&#xD;
           instruments, music listening &amp; improvisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Affect = Emotional expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeating the micro-analysis in 5 time points enabled a longitudinal analysis of the CoMT&#xD;
      process on the chosen participants.. A test for regression slope (the F test) was used to&#xD;
      assess whether a trend of improvement is demonstrated per category per participant over time.&#xD;
      The H0 assumed no change in score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale to assess group performance Group Environmental Scale (GES) In brief, the GES offers a&#xD;
      quantitative method for assessing intervention support groups (Moos RH 1994). The GES has (1)&#xD;
      psychometrically established reliability, factor structure, content, and construct validity&#xD;
      (2) has generic applicability to different types of groups from different settings, (3) has&#xD;
      subscales theoretically matching most support group objectives and expands into &quot;leader&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;systems maintenance&quot; dimensions, and (4) is brief, taking short time to complete 90&#xD;
      true/false items on an answer form, with additive responses easily converted into a 9-point&#xD;
      interval scale for standardized scoring. GES was originally designed to be rated by group&#xD;
      members. To make it suitable for external rating, we slightly altered the wording of the&#xD;
      questions without changing their meanings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GES was used before to analyze different group interventions and group environments including&#xD;
      in mental health patients (Lavoie 1981; Isbell, Thorne, Ph, Lawler, &amp; Ed, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GES evaluates 10 &quot;group environment&quot; subscales: Cohesion, Leader (therapist) support,&#xD;
      Expressiveness, Independence, Task orientation, Self-discover, Anger and aggression, Order&#xD;
      and organization, Leader control, and Innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subclass has 9 Yes/No questions (total of 90 questions). The rater watches the video and&#xD;
      at the end answers the 90 questions. &quot;Yes&quot;- scores 1, &quot;No&quot; - score 0, and each subclass score&#xD;
      is the total score of its 9 questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GES is highly relevant to the study as it focuses on group cohesion domains as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Relationship = Cohesion, leader support, Expressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal Growth = Independence, Task orientation, Self-discovery, ( - ) Aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  System maintenance and change = Order and organization, Leader control, Innovation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeating the micro-analysis in the different time points enabled a longitudinal analysis of&#xD;
      the CoMT process on the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The F test for regression slope was used to assess whether a trend of improvement is&#xD;
      demonstrated per domain over time. The H0 assumes no change in score.&#xD;
