      The goal of the study is to verify theoretical benefit of ventriculoperitoneal shunting with&#xD;
      MIETHKE M.blue® valve in patients with iNPH. The study is designed to assess walking and&#xD;
      balance, urinary function, cognitive performance and quality of life before and after&#xD;
      shunting and compare the results between the patients with MIETHKE M.blue® and MIETHKE proGAV&#xD;
      2.0® (with SA 2.0®) valves.&#xD;

      Patients who will be referred to Military University Hospital Prague with suspicion of normal&#xD;
      pressure hydrocephalus will be tested by conventional methods to consider implantation of a&#xD;
      ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. This testing is performed during hospitalization and includes&#xD;
      clinical examination of the patient by a neurosurgeon, neurologist and neuropsychologist&#xD;
      including neuropsychological questionnaires or tests - MoCA, AVLT, ROCFT, TMT A + B, Phonemic&#xD;
      Verbal Fluency Test (N, K, P), Semantic Fluence Test (animals, vegetables), subtest of&#xD;
      battery WAIS III and GDS. Clinical examinations are followed by magnetic resonance imaging.&#xD;
      Functional testing of cerebrospinal fluid circulation is initiated on the second day unless&#xD;
      another cause of the patient's symptoms (AD, Parkinson's disease, vascular dementia, tumor,&#xD;
      obstructive type of hydrocephalus - eg aqueductal stenosis, Blake's pouch cyst etc.) is&#xD;
      present. The functional testing will involve lumbar infusion test and subsequent external&#xD;
      lumbar drainage (ELD) for 120h, including biochemical analysis of CSF during the ELD. After&#xD;
      this time, the objective improvement of the patient's gait with the aid of the Dutch Gait&#xD;
      Scale will be evaluated with respect to the subjective evaluation by the patient or family&#xD;
      (changes in urinary incontinence / urgency, headaches, etc.). If the diagnosis of&#xD;
      normotensive hydrocephalus is confirmed, the patient will be indicated for a VP shunt&#xD;
      implantation, which is used for permanent derivation of cerebrospinal fluid into the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity. As a result of cerebrospinal fluid derivation, the clinical condition of&#xD;
      most of the patients improves. The operation process described by Michael J. Fritsch (Fritsch&#xD;
      et al. 2014) will be modified for various valve types in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations and assumed conditions for proper valve adjustment. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      implanted with a M.blue® or proGAV 2.0® (with SA 2.0®) valve (Christoph Miethke GmbH &amp; Co.&#xD;
      KG) in a randomized manner to form two study groups. The efficacy and safety of the proGAV&#xD;
      2.0® (with SA 2.0®) valve has already been confirmed in a randomized prospective study in&#xD;
      patients with idiopathic normotensive hydrocephalus (Lemcke et al. 2013). The theoretical&#xD;
      benefit of the M.blue® valve lies in the targeted modification of the cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      diversion during the active time of a day, when the opening pressure of the valve's&#xD;
      gravitational unit is controlled according to the angle between the valve and the horizontal&#xD;
      line. The basal opening pressure of the valve that has to be overcome in the supine position&#xD;
      is controlled with a fixed differential pressure unit. ProGAV 2.0® is an adjustable&#xD;
      differential pressure valve implanted with a shunt-assistant SA 2.0®. The shunt-assistant&#xD;
      represents a fixed gravity unit that increases the pressure in the standing position, which&#xD;
      must be overcome for the cerebrospinal fluid flow through th shunt. The opening pressure of&#xD;
      the valve could be selected according to the patient's height and sex. The basal opening&#xD;
      pressure of the valve that must be overcome in the supine position is controlled with an&#xD;
      adjustable differential pressure unit that can be adjusted before and after the shunt&#xD;
      implantation. In both valves, the opening pressure is the sum of the opening pressures of the&#xD;
      gravitational and differential pressure units. The theoretical benefit of the M.blue® valve&#xD;
      is the possibility of changing the opening pressure of the gravitational unit regulated&#xD;
      according to the position of the head in the space and thus aiming more at the pressure&#xD;
      conditions when the valve is not parallel to the horizontal line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not be familiar with the type of valve implanted with respect to subjective&#xD;
      evaluation of patients during the follow-up. Initial valve settings will be in accordance&#xD;
      with the manufacturer's recommendations. Follow-up of the patients will be guided in the&#xD;
      usual regime according to the natural history of the disease: at one month of follow-up an&#xD;
      outpatient clinical examination by a neurosurgeon, including brain CT scan; at three-months&#xD;
      of follow-up an evaluation during a two-day hospitalization including collection of the&#xD;
      following questionnaires, brain MRI, clinical examination by a neurosurgeon, neurologist and&#xD;
      neuropsychologist and collection of cerebrospinal fluid from the pre-chamber for the&#xD;
      biochemical analysis; at six-months an outpatient examination by a neurosurgeon; at one year&#xD;
      of follow-up an evaluation during a two-day hospitalization including collection of the&#xD;
      following questionnaires, brain MRI, clinical examination by a neurosurgeon, neurologist and&#xD;
      neuropsychologist and collection of cerebrospinal fluid from the pre-chamber valve for&#xD;
      biochemical analysis; at two-years of follow-up an outpatient clinical examination by&#xD;
      neurosurgeon and neuropsychologist including brain CT scan including collection of the&#xD;
      following questionnaires and collection of the cerebrospinal fluid from the pre-chamber of&#xD;
      the valve for biochemical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study, the Dutch Gait scale (gait), UI-SF (incontinence) and MoCA&#xD;
      (dementia) will be used to assess the outcome of the shunt operation to monitor the severity&#xD;
      and nature of the main symptoms during the follow-up in pre-implant, three months, one year&#xD;
      and after two years. The SF-12V2 will be used in a similar mode to monitor the quality of&#xD;
      life of the patients. Severity of the symptoms will also be assessed by the Kiefer Scale,&#xD;
      which was developed directly to monitor patients with idiopathic normotensive hydrocephalus.&#xD;
      Charlson comorbidity index will be used to monitor covariates. All clinical examinations by a&#xD;
      neurosurgeon will monitor early and late complications of the short-circuit operation&#xD;
      (infection, hemorrhage, overdrainage, underdrainage, shunt malfunction), the number of valve&#xD;
      setting changes and their range, unscheduled checks and shunt revisions and other unexpected&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected number of patients who will undergo all examinations after an annual check is 40&#xD;
      (20 and 20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefit of the study is in particular to confirm the theoretical assumptions of&#xD;
      an adjustable gravitational valve in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus&#xD;
      and thus in improvement of the quality and life expectancy of these patients.&#xD;

    <description>The SF-12® V2 Health Survey (SF-12 v2.0) (Ware, Kosinski, Turner-Bowker, &amp; Gandek, 2002) is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective. Generic patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures like the SF-12 assess general health and well-being [or health-related quality of life (HRQOL)], including the impact of any and all illnesses on a broad range of functional domains. The SF-12 v2 consists of a subset of 12 items from the SF-36® Health Survey (SF-36) (Ware &amp; Sherbourne, 1992; Ware, Snow, Kosinski, &amp; Gandek, 1993) covering the same eight domains of health outcomes, including physical functioning (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH).</description>
