      Aim and background: The aim of this retrospective observational study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      survival rate of cracked teeth, presenting partial (PVF) or complete vertical fracture (CVF),&#xD;
      after tooth restoration either with fracture-fragment adhesive bonding or with amalgam&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: One hundred eight fractured teeth, from 99 patients (51 males, 48&#xD;
      females, mean age 50.5 years), presenting complete or partial root fracture, were treated&#xD;
      with adhesive restoration or non-adhesive restoration protocol (amalgam) between 1991 and&#xD;
      2019. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated as predictors of extraction.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the bone loss/recovery due to therapy for the fracture was radiographically&#xD;
      evaluated at the one year follow-up. All cases were treated by the same operator, using a&#xD;
      surgical microscope. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics. The study&#xD;
      was approved by the ethical committee of Sistema Sanitario Nazionale (prot. NÂ°2370CELazio1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred eight fractured teeth, from 99 patients (51 males, 48 females, mean age 50.5&#xD;
      years, standard deviation (SD) 12.8, range 23-84), presenting complete or partial root&#xD;
      fracture, were included in this observational retrospective study. All the teeth were treated&#xD;
      according to one of two clinical protocols (adhesive or amalgam, see below). Besides a&#xD;
      general medical history and subjective and objective symptoms, the presence of the crack was&#xD;
      determined by the usage of a Leica 650 stereomicroscope with the help of methylene blue or&#xD;
      eosin-type dyes. The following parameters were gathered from the clinical charts to evaluate&#xD;
      possible risk factors for extraction: age, gender, tooth number and type of root fracture&#xD;
      (complete or partial). A vitality test was performed with an electrical test, and periodontal&#xD;
      probing was performed on six sites per tooth to detect probing defects, using a manual probe.&#xD;
      Periapical radiolucency at the moment of the diagnosis, survival in months and type of&#xD;
      coronal restoration at the diagnosis (no restoration, single crown, composite, amalgam) were&#xD;
      all explored. Presence of calcification in the canal, endo-treatment before the diagnosis of&#xD;
      fracture (no treatment, good endodontic treatment, surgical treatment, retreatment), canal&#xD;
      obstacles (i.e., broken files) and previous endo-canal retention (no retention, screw post,&#xD;
      fibre post, cast post, composite, amalgam) were all determined. Survival was also considered&#xD;
      at one, three, five and more than five years, and a qualitative evaluation of the tooth was&#xD;
      given (success, functional success: the tooth was asymptomatic; failure: the tooth would be&#xD;
      extracted; extracted: the tooth was extracted before the control visit), modifying the&#xD;
      European Society of Endodontology for success of endodontic therapies. When evaluating&#xD;
      treatment results, a commission made up of three operators, all active members of the Italian&#xD;
      Endodontic Society (SIE), re-examined the radiograms and the clinical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bone loss/recovery due to the therapy of the fracture was radiographically evaluated at&#xD;
      the one year follow-up: using Adobe Photoshop, the area of the bone loss was drawn,&#xD;
      calculated and compared on radiograms at the moment of the diagnosis and at one year after&#xD;
      the treatment, using the same radiological projection and classified as recovered, same loss,&#xD;
      or further loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic examination was performed after the restoration, and then the radiographic&#xD;
      survey was repeated every six months for the first two years and once a year for the&#xD;
      remaining period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These cases have all been reported, treated and evaluated over time by radiographic and&#xD;
      clinical investigation. In all treated cases, the protocol of adhesive restorations was the&#xD;
      same, performed and documented with the aid of the Leica 650 surgical microscope by the same&#xD;
      operator. The adhesive protocol (87 cases) remained unchanged over time (from 1991 to 2019).&#xD;
      A few cases (21 cases) were treated with amalgam, following protocols recommended by the&#xD;
      literature to avoid the risk of dental fractures (endo-canal retention and cusp covering).&#xD;

    <description>Survival rate of teeth with vertical root fracture will be considered at one, three, five and more than five years, and a qualitative evaluation of the tooth will be given, clinically and radiographically:&#xD;
success: tooth is asymptomatic and there is not radiographc lesion;&#xD;
functional success: the tooth is asymptomatic but there is a radiographic lesion;&#xD;
failure: the tooth would be extracted because of symptoms and/or radiographic lesion getting worse;&#xD;
extracted: the tooth was extracted before the control visit.</description>

    <description>The canal walls were etched with 37% orthophosphoric acid for 30 seconds with use of a microbrush.&#xD;
The primer was applied on the wet canal walls, with a microbrush several times, after checking by drying the canal, that the appearance of the dentine was shiny and not opaque or chalky.&#xD;
The next step was the application of bonding with a microbrush, blowing in the fracture line to make sure it is not loaded with bonding.&#xD;
Flow composite was used to make it penetrate the fracture line with the help of a 0.06 mm k-file.&#xD;
The canals were filled with dual composite parts more deeply, light cured at the canal entrance and pulp chamber; the following phase was the coronal restoration with a sandwich technique, covering the cusp with composite.</description>
