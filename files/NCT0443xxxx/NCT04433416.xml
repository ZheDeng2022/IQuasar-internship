      Comparision of Exposed Factors of Preoperative Hypertension and Intraoperative Controlled&#xD;
      Hypotension on Postoperative Delirium in the Elderly under Radical Resection of Head, Neck&#xD;
      and Maxillofacial Tumor&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium has a higher incidence in elderly patients after general&#xD;
      anesthesia，and It is closely related to the type of surgery, the length of surgery, and the&#xD;
      patient's physique.Because head and neck maxillofacial radical surgery requires free flap&#xD;
      transplantation and longer duration,and hemorrhage is more when the primary focus is&#xD;
      removed，Intraoperative blood pressure reduction is needed to reduce bleeding，therefore,&#xD;
      hypoperfusion of craniocerebral blood flow will occur.Low cerebral perfusion is closely&#xD;
      related to the occurrence of postoperative delirium.Patients undergoing this type of surgery&#xD;
      have more preoperative complications，hypertension is particularly common.Therefore, this&#xD;
      study mainly studied the correlation between the preoperative blood pressure level and the&#xD;
      controlled hypotension level in patients with radical head and neck and maxillofacial tumors&#xD;
      and the incidence of postoperative delirium.&#xD;

        The subject was a patient undergoing radical surgery for general anesthesia for mandibular&#xD;
        and facial malignant tumors. The patients who had just been admitted to the hospital were&#xD;
        preoperatively visited 2-3 days before the operation. According to whether the patient had&#xD;
        a history of hypertension and the blood pressure value in the calm state after three&#xD;
        admissions, Patients were divided into hypertensive group and non-hypertensive group.&#xD;
