  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current US opioid epidemic is a pressing public health concern. Links between opioid&#xD;
      misuse and mortality are well-known; nearly 70% of all drug overdose deaths in 2017 were&#xD;
      attributable to opioids. Given their pain-relieving properties, opioids have been widely used&#xD;
      in the chronic pain population who are also susceptible to misuse of these analgesics.. In&#xD;
      chronic pain patients with anger, the pain as well as opioid use may be aggravated. For&#xD;
      example, suppression of anger has been linked with increased pain sensitivity in experiments,&#xD;
      while anger-hostility scores and internalized anger predict pain severity variance and pain&#xD;
      intensity, respectively. Anger is also linked with drug use/abuse, including opioids. The&#xD;
      goal of this research is to implement a state-of-the-art program for anger regulation in&#xD;
      chronic pain patients., Called Cognitive Behavioral Affective Therapy (CBAT), this program is&#xD;
      evaluated on multiple measures of anger, sensory versus affective measures of pain, and&#xD;
      measures of opioid misuse. CBAT is expected to reduce anger, and thereby produce reduction in&#xD;
      pain as well as shift attitudes away from opioid misuse..&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited by electronic announcements and IRB approved recruitment&#xD;
      flyers in local pain clinics and pain support groups. These ads and flyers will contain&#xD;
      relevant info (e.g., study email address and GoogleVoice number) for prospective participants&#xD;
      to contact study staff with any questions about participation. Interested participants will&#xD;
      be screened by an RA on the phone using the following steps: 1) RA will obtain verbal consent&#xD;
      upon explaining study participation and answering any questions participants may have; 2)&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained, RA will use participants preferred email address to send&#xD;
      potential participant a link to the Qualtrics screening questionnaire; 3) RA will then&#xD;
      briefly orient participant to Qualtrics; and 3) RA will complete the screening process with&#xD;
      participant on the phone to determine and inform participant of their eligibility to&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent and Screening: Participants will first go through the informed consent procedure,&#xD;
      where they will be told about the purpose of the study, expectations of them as participants,&#xD;
      etc. Informed consent is expected to take no more than 5 minutes. They will then be asked to&#xD;
      complete a screening questionnaire which is expected to take no more than 3 minutes. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Control and 2) CBAT. Both&#xD;
      control group and experimental group participants will be required to complete 2 pre-recorded&#xD;
      sessions per week lasting 1 hour each (total of 8 hours) over the course of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Sessions and Surveys: After questionnaires (including measures of pain and opioid use,&#xD;
      the Anger Parameters Scale) have been administered at pre-treatment, the first session will&#xD;
      serve as orientation to self-monitoring anger levels between sessions. If a participant has&#xD;
      no anger on a given day, no monitoring is necessary. Following this, control group&#xD;
      participants self-monitor their anger and watch pre-recorded sessions on emotions in general.&#xD;
      The treatment group will be actively trained in anger regulation skills within the framework&#xD;
      of CBAT. These participants will proceed from a week of anger prevention to a week of&#xD;
      intervention to a week of postvention. During the prevention phase, an individually-tailored&#xD;
      behavior contract against anger will be signed by each paParticipants will work with&#xD;
      investigators over email to draft and electronically sign their contracts. RAs will review&#xD;
      participant progress toward fulfillment of contracts during weekly check-in phone calls to&#xD;
      participants. Participants will also engage in behavioral rehearsal of anger-provoking&#xD;
      situations and learn about stimulus control for discriminating and avoiding situations that&#xD;
      are likely to culminate in anger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Intervention phase, participants will be introduced to techniques for regulating anger&#xD;
      that could not be prevented. These include thought-stopping, distraction, and cognitive&#xD;
      reappraisal..&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the postvention phase, participants will be trained in techniques for ameliorating&#xD;
      residual anger. These include expressive writing and verbal disclosure. Gestalt therapy empty&#xD;
      chair dialogue will be used for overcoming unresolved anger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the 4 weeks of anger self-regulation training, the same questionnaires&#xD;
      relating to anger, pain, and opioid misuse and beliefs will be assessed in both groups. This&#xD;
      post-treatment set of questionnaires is expected to take no more than 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a follow-up session (2 hours) will be held for both groups one month after&#xD;
      post-treatment. Anger, pain, and opioid use measures will be re-administered (taking no more&#xD;
      than 20 minutes). All participants will receive a brief booster session to reinforce&#xD;
      effective anger regulation techniques. The same pre- and post-treatment questionnaires&#xD;
      mentioned above will be re-administered at this point in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone Calls and Knowledge Tests: To ensure that participants are paying attention to the&#xD;
      online videos, RAs will contact them weekly and administer a brief, multiple choice knowledge&#xD;
      test over the phone. Participants who score less than 50% in any given week will be dropped&#xD;
      from the study. During that same phone call, RAs will check in with participants to ensure&#xD;
      that there are no problems with their participation in the study and that the participants&#xD;
      are not in any emotional distress. Phone calls are anticipated to last approximately 10&#xD;
      minutes, for a total time of 50 minutes over the span of the study (4 weeks of either&#xD;
      treatment or control and the 1-month follow up). Total participant time commitment over the&#xD;
      course of the study is approximately 12 hours.&#xD;
