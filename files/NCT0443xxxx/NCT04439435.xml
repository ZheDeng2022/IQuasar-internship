  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of acute hepatitis,and chronic&#xD;
      infection with HBV often leads to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis,and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. So far, the most effective way to prevent HBV infection in susceptible population&#xD;
      is to inject hepatitis B vaccine. However, long-term protection against hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV) after vaccination remains widely debated. This study aims to evaluate the existence of&#xD;
      immune protection in healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and find a&#xD;
      method to evaluate the immune protection induced by hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;

      One method to determine the long-term protection provided by hepatitis B vaccine against HBV&#xD;
      infection is to estimate the cumulative incidence of chronic carrier status and breakthrough&#xD;
      infection of previously vaccinated individuals in different periods. Up to now, no&#xD;
      international standard suggests that hepatitis B vaccine should be used as a routine&#xD;
      immunization program. However, it is an important issue to discuss the immune protection of&#xD;
      healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and the duration of this&#xD;
      protection in the future. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the existence of immune&#xD;
      protection of healthy children with negative hepatitis B surface antibody, find a method to&#xD;
      evaluate the immune protection induced by hepatitis B vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main content of the study: To recruit healthy children. Children lacking HBsAb were&#xD;
      selected for immune memory test and receive a Hep B booster. The results of Antibody positive&#xD;
      group and antibody negative group were compared and analyzed. To find out the most suitable&#xD;
      method for evaluating immune protection.&#xD;
