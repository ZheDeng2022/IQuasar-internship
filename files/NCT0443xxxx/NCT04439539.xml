    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment regimen of JNJ-73763989&#xD;
      + pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PegIFN-alpha-2a) + nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) with or without&#xD;
      JNJ-56136379.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small deoxyribonucleic acid virus that specifically infects the&#xD;
      human liver. The acute phase of infection is either followed by an immune controlled state or&#xD;
      progresses to chronic hepatitis B. The worldwide estimated prevalence of chronic HBV&#xD;
      infection is about 292 million people affected. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)&#xD;
      seroclearance is currently considered to be associated with the most thorough suppression of&#xD;
      HBV replication (termed functional cure). With current available NA treatment strategies,&#xD;
      rate of HBsAg seroclearance remains very low (around 3 percent [%]) even under long-term&#xD;
      treatment. Also, with the persistently high global prevalence of HBV-associated mortality,&#xD;
      there is a medical need for more effective finite treatment options that lead to sustained&#xD;
      HBsAg seroclearance. JNJ-73763989 is a liver-targeted antiviral therapeutic for subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection designed to treat chronic HBV infection via a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)&#xD;
      mechanism. JNJ-56136379 is an orally administered capsid assembly modulator (CAM) that is&#xD;
      being developed for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. The aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of a treatment regimen of JNJ-73763989 + PegIFN-alpha-2a + NA with or&#xD;
      without JNJ-56136379 in participants with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive chronic&#xD;
      infection. The study will be conducted in 4 phases: a screening phase, an induction phase&#xD;
      with flexible duration, a consolidation phase with or without PegIFN-α2a and a follow-up&#xD;
      phase. Safety assessments will include Adverse Events (AEs), serious AEs of the study&#xD;
      interventions, clinical laboratory tests, Electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and&#xD;
      physical examinations.&#xD;
