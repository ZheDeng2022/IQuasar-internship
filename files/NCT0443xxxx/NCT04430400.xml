      Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute aortic syndromes (AASs) are deadly and difficult to diagnose cardiovascular&#xD;
      emergencies. AASs include acute aortic dissection, intramural aortic hematoma, penetrating&#xD;
      aortic ulcer and spontaneous aortic rupture. A conclusive diagnosis of AASs requires an&#xD;
      advanced imaging exam, such as computed tomographic angiography (CTA), transoesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (TEE) or magnetic resonance imaging. These exams are time-consuming, costly&#xD;
      and frequently require transfer of patients to specialized clinical centres. CTA, the most&#xD;
      frequently used advanced imaging exam for suspected AASs in the Emergency Department (ED),&#xD;
      exposes patients to significant ionizing radiations and to contrast medium, carrying inherent&#xD;
      risks of anaphylaxis and contrast nephropathy. Selection of patients necessitating an&#xD;
      advanced aortic imaging exam is therefore worrisome. There is a need for standardized&#xD;
      diagnostic management of AAS workup, and in particular for a validated diagnostic algorithm&#xD;
      incorporating evidence-based decision rules allowing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. rapid identification of patients necessitating urgent CTA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. safe rule-out of patients not requiring CTA. Based on available guidelines and further&#xD;
           evidence, standardized decision rules for rule-in and rule-out of AASs should be&#xD;
           effectively based on: (1) standardized pre-test probability assessment, (2) bedside&#xD;
           imaging of the aorta with focus cardiac ultrasound (FOCUS) and (3) biomarker testing&#xD;
           (D-dimer assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The aim of the present study will be to evaluate the performance of an&#xD;
      integrated algorithm for standardized diagnostic workup (rule-in, rule-out) of suspected&#xD;
      AASs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting This observational multicentric diagnostic accuracy study will be performed in the&#xD;
      setting of several international EDs. Participating EDs will satisfy the following criteria&#xD;
      for 24 hours / 7 days, in their routine clinical practice: (1) experienced use of bedside&#xD;
      FoCUS, (2) local access to urgent D-dimer (DD) assay, (3) local access to urgent CTA. Both&#xD;
      hub and spoke centers will be allowed to participate in the study, if local census is &gt;30.000&#xD;
      visits/years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an observational, prospective, multicentre, international, non-profit,&#xD;
      investigator-driven, diagnostic accuracy study. The study protocol does not imply any&#xD;
      modification in the routine diagnostic and therapeutic approach to patients with suspected&#xD;
      AASs. The only difference from standard care will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. registration of selected demographic and clinical data of study patients, obtained&#xD;
           during the index ED visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. follow-up (by telephone or clinical visit) of patients after 1 month from the index ED&#xD;
           visit, for collection of selected clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study will be performed on consecutive adult outpatients evaluated for&#xD;
      specified symptoms in the ED, in whom AASs are considered in differential diagnosis by the&#xD;
      attending physician(s). Eligibility will be defined during or after medical evaluation in the&#xD;
      ED and always before establishment of a final diagnosis. In each centre, patient recruitment&#xD;
      will start after obtaining approval from the local Ethic Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods and organization Patients will be evaluated in the ED by an authorized&#xD;
      physician practicing Emergency Medicine and will be managed in accordance with international&#xD;
      guidelines. The recommended standard of care for diagnosis and treatment of patients with&#xD;
      suspected AAS will be as indicated by the European Society of Cardiology 2014 guidelines.&#xD;
      However, attending physicians will be allowed to derogate from guideline indications based on&#xD;
      the clinical scenario, irrespective of patient's participation to the present study. After&#xD;
      medical evaluation a clinical suspicion of AAS will prompt to possible enrolment in the&#xD;
      study. The attending physician or an authorized study research investigator/collaborator will&#xD;
      then acquire patient (or next of kin, if deemed necessary) consent to participate to the&#xD;
      study and will fill a standardized clinical form reporting the relevant clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aortic dissection detection risk score The aortic detection dissection- risk score (ADD-RS)&#xD;
      will be calculated based on the number of categories where at least one risk marker is&#xD;
      present. Patients will be classified at low probability of AAS, if ADD-RS ≤1 (at least 1 risk&#xD;
      marker present, in no more than 1 risk category), or at high probability of AAS if ADD-RS &gt;1&#xD;
      (at least 1 risk marker present, in more than 1 risk category).&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-dimer DD levels will be analysed in the hospital laboratory on venous samples with an&#xD;
      automated test. Diagnostic tests will be site-specific. DD is defined negative if lower than&#xD;
      500 ng/ml (Fibrinogen Equivalent Unit, FEU). This cut off has been validated for the&#xD;
      diagnosis of AAS in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focused cardiac ultrasound The attending physician, a cardiologist or an authorized study&#xD;
      research investigator expert in bedside emergency ultrasonography will perform a FoCUS on&#xD;
      study patients during ED evaluation, before advanced aortic imaging tests or surgery.&#xD;
      Evaluation of the heart and aorta will be performed with the patient in the supine or left&#xD;
      lateral decubitus positions, using the following views: (1) left parasternal (long-axis) and&#xD;
      (2) suprasternal notch view. Additional views including apical, subcostal, right parasternal,&#xD;
      abdominal and neck for carotid arteries will be decided by the attending physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be considered as direct sonographic signs of AASs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. presence of an intimal flap separating two aortic lumens;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. presence of an intramural aortic thickening (circular or crescentic thickening of the&#xD;
           aortic wall &gt;5 mm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. presence of a crater-like outpouching with jagged edges in the aortic wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following signs will also be researched, as potential indirect sonographic signs of AASs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. thoracic aorta dilatation (diameter ≥4 cm);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. pericardial effusion or tamponade&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. aortic valve regurgitation at colour Doppler (at least moderate), based on subjective&#xD;
           evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced Aortic imaging The advanced aortic imaging exam used to confirm or refuse a&#xD;
      diagnosis of AASs will be CTA, TEE or magnetic resonance angiography, performed by physicians&#xD;
      not involved in the present study, according to local procedures. Patient enrolment in the&#xD;
      study will not change standard patient management and will not affect medical decision to&#xD;
      perform aortic imaging. Instruments used for imaging will be site-specific. These exams will&#xD;
      be performed and interpreted by specialized radiologists, cardiologists or surgeons not&#xD;
      involved in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up data AASs are difficult to diagnose disease entities. Given the severity of AASs in&#xD;
      untreated patients, investigators assume that individuals with an undiagnosed AAS would&#xD;
      experience major clinical events leading to conclusive diagnosis within 30 days from the ED&#xD;
      visit. Therefore, all study patients will enter a 30-day clinical follow-up to allow accurate&#xD;
      case adjudication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final diagnosis The final diagnosis will be established in each centre dichotomically&#xD;
      (presence or absence of an AAS) by two senior investigators, who will review all available&#xD;
      clinical data (including aortic imaging studies, medical, surgical, autopsy records if&#xD;
      applicable). Reviewers will be blinded to: ADD-RS risk score stratification, FoCUS findings&#xD;
      and D-dimer levels. The reviewers will judge on presence or absence of an AAS, and defined&#xD;
      the AAS type: acute aortic dissection, aortic intramural hematoma, penetrating aortic ulcer&#xD;
      or spontaneous aortic rupture, and Stanford classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and statistical methods Dichotomous data will be expressed as proportions and&#xD;
      continuous data as mean and standard deviation (SD). Pearson's chi square test will be used&#xD;
      for the comparison of dichotomous data, and the unpaired Student's t-test will be used to&#xD;
      compare normally distributed data. The diagnostic performance of D-dimer will be assessed by&#xD;
      computing sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values and negative and&#xD;
      positive likelihood ratios with their 95% confident interval (95% CI) in all patients. The&#xD;
      failure rate (or false negative proportion) will be calculated as the number of patients with&#xD;
      a final diagnosis of AAS divided by the number of patients satisfying rule-out criteria. The&#xD;
      rule-out efficiency will be calculated as the number of patients satisfying the rule-out&#xD;
      criteria divided by the number of all included patients. The rule-in efficiency will be&#xD;
      calculated as the number of patients satisfying the rule-in criteria (i.e. proceeding to&#xD;
      advanced aortic imaging) divided by the number of all included patients. P-values will be&#xD;
      two-sided, and a P-value lower than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)&#xD;
      statistical package (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trend measures: The general characteristics of the population (clinical and demographic data)&#xD;
      will be expressed as median and interquartile range (continuous variables) and as proportions&#xD;
      and confidence interval (95% CI; categorical variables). The confidence interval will be&#xD;
      calculated with the Wilson method or with a generalized linear model (for likelihood ratios).&#xD;
      The main endpoints of the study will consist of standard measures of diagnostic accuracy,&#xD;
      i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative&#xD;
      likelihood ratio. They will also be calculated as key diagnostic variables: failure rate&#xD;
      (false negative AASs / n cases that meet the rule-out criteria) and efficacy (n cases that&#xD;
      meet the rule-out criteria / n cases enrolled). Of each variable, the central value and the&#xD;
      appropriate confidence interval will be defined. For statistical tests, the values of P &lt;0.05&#xD;
      will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The study will be sized to test the null hypothesis that the failure rate of the&#xD;
      integrated rule-out diagnostic strategy (ADD-RS ≤1 / DD-) exceeds 2%. Investigators assume,&#xD;
      based on literature data, that the punctual failure rate is 0.5%. With a type I error (alpha)&#xD;
      of 0.05 and a type II error (beta) of 0.2, approximately 496 patients with ADD-RS≤1 / DD-&#xD;
      will have to be enrolled, to reject the null hypothesis. Assuming that patients with ADD-RS≤1&#xD;
      / DD- are 30% of all subjects enrolled with the clinical suspicion of AAS, approximately 1653&#xD;
      patients should be analysed. Assuming a 10% rate of patients lost at follow-up, at least 1837&#xD;
      patients should be enrolled&#xD;
