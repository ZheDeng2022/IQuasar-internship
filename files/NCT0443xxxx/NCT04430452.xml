    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well standard of care hypofractionated radiation therapy&#xD;
      followed by durvalumab with or without tremelimumab works in treating patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer (liver cancer) that has spread to other places in the body (advanced)&#xD;
      and that is growing, spreading, or getting worse (progressing) after treatment with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor immunotherapy. In some patients, cancer cells and immune cells start to express&#xD;
      signals that stop the body's immune system from killing the cancer. New drugs being&#xD;
      developed, such as durvalumab and tremelimumab, are designed to target and block these&#xD;
      signals and may help increase the immune response to prevent or slow down cancer growth.&#xD;
      Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter&#xD;
      period of time and may help the immune system work even better. Giving durvalumab with or&#xD;
      without tremelimumab after radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine objective response rate (ORR) of durvalumab (D) and D + tremelimumab (T) after&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with progression&#xD;
      on prior PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety of D and D + T in advanced HCC patients with progression on prior&#xD;
      PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the efficacy of D and D + T in advanced HCC patients with progression on prior&#xD;
      PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immune cells and plasma samples before&#xD;
      RT, after RT, and during D or D + T immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore relationship between plasma biomarkers and PBMC immune profiles, the proportion&#xD;
      of participants with adverse events (AEs), (safety endpoint), and clinical outcomes (ORR),&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Profile immune cells in archival pre-treatment tumor tissue for all patients and&#xD;
      on-/post-treatment tumor samples and/or non-tumor liver tissue samples when available, and&#xD;
      explore for relationship with safety/tolerability and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine incidence of tumor PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in&#xD;
      pre-treatment archival tumor samples in all patients, and in on-/post-treatment tumor samples&#xD;
      if repeat tumor sampling is obtained for clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Explore relationship between tumor PD-L1 status and clinical outcomes. VI. Explore&#xD;
      relationship between viral hepatitis status, viral load, safety/tolerability, and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Measure tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response to immunotherapy plus RT and&#xD;
      explore for relationship with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Explore relationship between site of RT (liver, bone, other soft tissue), number of RT&#xD;
      sites (1 or &gt; 1), safety/tolerability, clinical outcomes, and changes in immune cell profiles&#xD;
      on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care hypofractionated RT over 5 fractions once daily (QD)&#xD;
      for 5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-10 days&#xD;
      after completion of RT, patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care hypofractionated RT over 5 fractions QD for 5 days&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-10 days after&#xD;
      completion of RT, patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour&#xD;
      on day 1. Treatment with durvalumab repeats every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who complete the first dose of&#xD;
      tremelimumab and demonstrate clinical benefit based upon radiographic tumor regression and/or&#xD;
      other clinical response without progression for at least 6 cycles or 6 months on treatment,&#xD;
      whichever is shorter, and subsequently have evidence of progressive disease during the&#xD;
      durvalumab monotherapy portion may receive a repeat dose of tremelimumab at the next&#xD;
      scheduled cycle of treatment with durvalumab per physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
