  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose is to conduct a pilot study to evaluate GDS muscle and articulation chain&#xD;
      treatment for inoperable spine patients with degenerative changes in the lumbar spine,&#xD;
      compared to &quot;standard treatment&quot; (any other chosen treatment). The pilot study will be&#xD;
      conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate feasibility and benefit of&#xD;
      GDS muscle and articulation chain treatment on pain, function and quality of life. The pilot&#xD;
      study will form the basis for a later full-scale randomized study and the following research&#xD;
      questions will be addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what extent were the criteria for inclusion in the study suitable?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How did the recruitment procedure work?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How did the participants experience GDS treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To what extent were the selected outcome measures suitable at the different evaluation&#xD;
           moments, and which outcome measure tested in this pilot study would be most suitable as&#xD;
           primary outcome measure in a full-scale study? (user experience will be included in the&#xD;
           evaluation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How was the change in the primary outcome measure (Oswestry Disability Index)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What will be the estimated time for inclusion of the required number of participants in&#xD;
           a full-scale study? (required sample size will be based on strength calculation /saving&#xD;
           of the outcome target chosen as primary outcome measure for full scale study) The study&#xD;
           is a pilot study with a randomized controlled design, with follow-up after 3-4 months.&#xD;
           Thirty patients are recruited and receive baseline examination and respond to the&#xD;
           questionnaires before randomization. The patients receive a questionnaire by mail 3-4&#xD;
           months after inclusion (after the treatment is completed for intervention group ). The&#xD;
           pilot study will be one-way blinded.&#xD;

      Design: randomized, controlled trial with intervention and control arm. Recruitment: Patients&#xD;
      are recruited from those relegated from GPs in Vestfold to the spine surgeons at Vestfold&#xD;
      Hospital (SIV) for assessment of surgery. Participants who qualify for the study will be&#xD;
      contacted by the project staff member (Sidsel Lombardo) who will provide the information&#xD;
      about the study. Participants who are interested in participating will be assessed in terms&#xD;
      of the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. If these are met, the participant will be&#xD;
      explained what the study is based on in detail, both orally and in writing (appendix in REK&#xD;
      application). The participant is then asked if he / she is still willing to participate. They&#xD;
      will then undergo the baseline survey, fill in the forms and then sign the consent&#xD;
      declaration. Afterwards they are randomized to GDS treatment or standard therapy.&#xD;
      Participants have the opportunity to quit along the way without affecting their health care&#xD;
      and regular treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women and men aged between 35 to 75 years, with chronic (&gt; 3 months) low back pain, with&#xD;
           or without irradiation in legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Degenerative changes in the lumbar spine verified on MR. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity that prevents the patient from performing exercises and gradually increasing&#xD;
           general activity when the back / leg function permits it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Already had surgery with fixation of the lumbar spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Being in process of assessing disability insurance or economic compensation for health&#xD;
           reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure: After baseline survey and answered questionnaire, participants will&#xD;
      be randomized to intervention and control group using a data generated randomization sequence&#xD;
      at a 1: 1 ratio. Statisticians at the Musculoskeletal Health Research Group (MUSKHealth.com)&#xD;
      at OsloMet will assist with the randomization sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: In this study, one cannot blind the participants nor the treating physiotherapist&#xD;
      for which treatment they are receiving. However, research staff who collect and process data&#xD;
      at the 3-4 month follow-up will be blinded to who is randomized to the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The treatment group is examined and evaluated based on the principles of the&#xD;
      &quot;muscle and articulation chains GDS method&quot;, and receive until 8 treatments of one hour. They&#xD;
      meet once a week in the beginning, more seldom towards the end of treatment. The participants&#xD;
      pay for the individual treatments, but half prize of usual physiotherapy rate. The reason is&#xD;
      that there is no extra money in SIV Hospital to provide free treatment, and that patients&#xD;
      today pay regular rates for the same. Participants' follow-up to the intervention will be&#xD;
      logged by the attending physiotherapist. The same applies to apostasy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: The control group receives standard treatment from their GP, possibly referred to&#xD;
      physiotherapy, chiropractor or the treatment option they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, imaging diagnostic findings regarding degenerative findings in the spine&#xD;
      obtained from patient records will also be included. Data on function using Oswestry list f&#xD;
      Data collection: Background variables such as age, gender, education level, marital status,&#xD;
      mother tongue, height and weight will only be obtained at baseline (before randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same applies to mapping the risk of chronic back pain, which will be mapped using the&#xD;
      STarT Back screening form [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging diagnostic regarding degenerative findings in the spine obtained from patient records&#xD;
      will also be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional data using the Oswestry list for functional limitations [10], pain using the VAS&#xD;
      scale [8], health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D [11], risk for chronic back pain&#xD;
      using the StarT Back screening form [12] and work ability will be obtained before and after&#xD;
      intervention (3-4 months). A questionnaire at 3-4 months follow-up will be sent by mail, with&#xD;
      a stamped envelope for return. Patients who do not respond will be reminded twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size: This pilot study will also be used to make a strength&#xD;
      calculation for a full-scale RCT. Nevertheless, if we use minimum clinical important&#xD;
      difference (MCID) estimates in primary outcome measures as a starting point for a strength&#xD;
      calculation, we will get the following reasoning: MCID for ODI has been found to be between 8&#xD;
      and 10 points on the scale from 0 to 10 [10]. Assuming an expected difference between two&#xD;
      groups of 8 ODI points with a standard deviation (SD) of 10 and significance level of 5%,&#xD;
      then we will have 80% strength to detect this difference with a sample of 50 people in each&#xD;
      group. We account for 15% drop-out, ie a full-scale study will require 115 patients. If the&#xD;
      pilot study proves to be able to expect greater differences in ODI scores between the groups,&#xD;
      then this number could be reduced, and vice versa. For this pilot study, the aim is to&#xD;
      include totally 30 participants for intervention and control groups.&#xD;
