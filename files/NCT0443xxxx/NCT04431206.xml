  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of participants that will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of oxytocin&#xD;
      (naturally occurring hormone that is made in the brain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study healthy volunteers and people with knee arthritis so severe that they may need&#xD;
      joint replacement are recruited for a one day study. Each study participant will have an IV&#xD;
      catheter placed. After placement of the IV catheter oxytocin will be given by IV infusion.&#xD;
      Investigators will perform some tests to evaluate how oxytocin changes perceptions on the&#xD;
      skin. Investigators will study a painful perception by placing a probe on the skin and&#xD;
      heating it to 113 -117 degrees Fahrenheit (F) for 5 minutes. Each study participant will&#xD;
      score any pain that is experienced on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find that pain rises&#xD;
      during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0 to 10 scale. The&#xD;
      5 minute heating temperature will be determined according to the subjects pain rating during&#xD;
      the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to determine the effect of oxytocin during and after a fixed&#xD;
      rate intravenous infusion on reduction in pain to a sustained heat stimulus in order to&#xD;
      generate a model for peripheral analgesia.&#xD;

      In this study healthy people or those with knee arthritis so severe that they may need joint&#xD;
      replacement are recruited for a one day study. Study participants will come to the Clinical&#xD;
      Research Unit (CRU) and one intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted in the forearm for&#xD;
      oxytocin infusion. Participants in this study will receive oxytocin at a steady rate for 30&#xD;
      minutes. This information will be analyzed by another group at Stanford University in the&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) Core part of this application. Mathematics will be&#xD;
      utilized to calculate how quickly oxytocin moves from the blood to where it reduces pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also do a pain test to determine how much oxytocin reduces pain. For this&#xD;
      Investigators will place a probe on the skin and heat it to 113 - 117 degrees for 5 minutes.&#xD;
      Study participants will score any pain they feel on a 0 to 10 scale, and most people find&#xD;
      that pain rises during the 5 minutes, but remains mild, usually around only 1 or 2 on the 0&#xD;
      to 10 scale.&#xD;

             compromise the quality of the data&#xD;
