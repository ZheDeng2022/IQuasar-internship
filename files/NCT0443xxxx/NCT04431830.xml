  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial of a psychosocial pain management intervention&#xD;
      called, Meaning-Centered Pain Coping Skills Training (MCPC). Patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumor cancer and at least moderate pain will be randomized to MCPC or a standard care control&#xD;
      condition. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 5- and 10-week&#xD;
      follow-ups. The first aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial to test MCPC. The second aim is to characterize MCPC's effects on&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes of pain severity, pain interference, meaning in life, self-efficacy&#xD;
      for pain management, and psychological distress. The third aim is to describe participants'&#xD;
      experiences of MCPC using semi-structured qualitative interviews. The risk and safety issues&#xD;
      in this trial are low and limited to those common to a psychosocial intervention (e.g., loss&#xD;
      of confidentiality).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with advanced cancer describe pain as their most feared and distressing&#xD;
      symptom. In this population, higher pain levels often predict worse physical, emotional, and&#xD;
      existential/spiritual well-being. Psychosocial interventions show promise for improving&#xD;
      cancer-related pain; however, no interventions address existential concerns (e.g., a loss of&#xD;
      meaning in life) that are common among those facing pain from advanced illness. To address&#xD;
      this need, an intervention called Meaning-Centered Pain Coping Skills Training (MCPC) was&#xD;
      developed. MCPC seeks to teach patients cognitive and behavioral skills for managing pain&#xD;
      (e.g., guided imagery) in order to help them engage with what gives their life a sense of&#xD;
      meaning, purpose, and significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is being conducted to prepare for a large-scale clinical trial that will&#xD;
      test the efficacy of MCPC for improving patients' pain and pain-related outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), and 10-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain severity will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). The BPI-SF consists of 4 items assessing pain severity, including worst, least, average, and current pain. The minimum value on this scale is 0 and the maximum value is 10. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week follow-up (immediately post-intervention), and 10-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference will be measured using the 6-item Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference-Short Form. This measure assesses the degree to which pain has impacted patients' enjoyment of life and engagement in social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. The minimum value on this scale is 6 and the maximum value is 30. Higher scores represent worse outcomes.</description>
