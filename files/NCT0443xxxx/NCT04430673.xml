  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and young people with movement difficulties such as Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Acquired&#xD;
      Brain Injury (ABI) report that traditional therapies are highly repetitive and labourious.&#xD;
      This influences enjoyment and participation in regular therapy programmes and may result in&#xD;
      reduced adherence to therapy or exercise regimes, limiting effectiveness. This study will&#xD;
      build on the team's previous work to explore the potential use of Virtual-Reality (VR)&#xD;
      technologies in rehabilitationÍ¾ particularly systems that can be used at home to increase&#xD;
      accessibility and reduce need to attend clinics for therapy. During the co-production events&#xD;
      of the VR4REHAB Inter Regional North West Europe (NWE) funded programme in 2018, young people&#xD;
      desired the use of commercial games for therapeutic purposes. This work has enabled&#xD;
      connections between affordable computer technologies: the Raspberry Pi, VR headsets and&#xD;
      freely available commercial games.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 2-Phased project is therefore exploring the potential of commercially available virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) systems consoles and games for use in rehabilitation programmes. The&#xD;
      Investigators hope to gain information on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether commercially produced VR games can provide a motivating environment to support&#xD;
           adherence to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether it is possible to improve reaching and grasp-release hand movements through this&#xD;
           method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Gain an understanding of the ages of children and young people most likely to benefit&#xD;
           from home-based VR therapy User evaluation and performance data and therapist&#xD;
           evaluations will be collected and compared to baseline data to provide information on&#xD;
           usability, accessibility, acceptability and adaptability.&#xD;

      Aim: The focus of this Proof-of-Concept feasibility study investigates the potential of&#xD;
      commercially available virtual reality (VR) games and equipment for therapeutic use for upper&#xD;
      limb rehabilitation; considering in particular the role of motivation and engagement when&#xD;
      using the system to support adherence to therapy protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale - Effective rehabilitation requires appropriate dosage and intensity and be&#xD;
      meaningful to daily life, but traditional therapeutic modalities struggle to achieve optimum&#xD;
      input and gains following successful intensive intervention programmes are often not&#xD;
      maintained. Commercial VR products are designed with high level gaming methods to engage&#xD;
      participants in the games. Commercial VR products therefore offer potential as therapeutic&#xD;
      adjuncts to gain appropriate practice of sufficient intensity and duration but may need some&#xD;
      adjustments. Adjustments in this instance refer to changing the speed at which the game plays&#xD;
      and which combinations of devices compliant with European Union standards (CE) can be&#xD;
      connected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will evaluate whether young people with Cerebral Palsy (CP) or Acquired&#xD;
      Brain injury (ABI) can be engaged in VR games for upper-limb movement using VR systems,&#xD;
      potential for therapeutic benefit and also consider clinical feasibility in relation to&#xD;
      utility, particularly in respect to the costs involved (i.e. labour, training, workplace&#xD;
      set-up). The Co-Production Group (C-PG) group identified a 2-Phase study in order to assess&#xD;
      for any modifiable alterations and prepare training manual prior to a short feasibility&#xD;
      trial. This clinical trial is designed as an Action Research study in two Phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 of the study. Participants will engage in a 2-hour workshop to test out the VR system&#xD;
      and games in order to gather responses to the game speeds and devices (including method of&#xD;
      access). Feedback will contribute to information for instruction leaflets for access and&#xD;
      usability and determine whether further adjustments are required and additional training&#xD;
      information needed for therapists to be able to set up the system to meet individual&#xD;
      requirements. Information gathered during the workshop will also inform on the links and&#xD;
      support required from the computer scientists for backup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study, will test out the feasibility of use within a home/school setting as a&#xD;
      Proof-of-Concept study. Phase 2, will inform on trial design for a larger randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. The VR system will be provided to each participant for a 2-week home- or&#xD;
      school- based trial. User evaluation and performance data and therapist evaluations will be&#xD;
      collected and compared to baseline data to provide information on usability, accessibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and adaptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from preliminary, albeit small single-subject design studies, suggests that children&#xD;
      and adults with movement impairments may improve upper limb performance (speed, fluency and&#xD;
      accuracy) with some transfer to clinical measures of upper limb and hand skills. It is not&#xD;
      known if children with CP/ABI can improve upper limb movement performance and function nor&#xD;
      whether gains transfer into improved hand skills in daily life although it anticipated that&#xD;
      benefits to function will be achieved for many children. An exploration of this point will be&#xD;
      considered as secondary outcomes to inform on dose and duration for a future definitive&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase 2: Day 1 and at 2-weeks (end of 2-week trial)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported outcomes using Goal Attainment Scaling will consider potential of system to address 3 identified child/young adult identified goals. Anticipated outcomes are defined on a 5 point scale with -2 = a much less than anticipated outcome; -1= less than anticipated outcome; 0=anticipated outcome; +1 =better than expected outcome; +2=much better than expected outcome. Each goal is weighted by asking the participant to rank them in order of importance and also with respect to anticipated difficulty on a four point scale and a total weigh/per goal determined by multiplying Importance x difficulty=weight of goal. The outcome score for each goal is rated at the review data and the goal attainment 'T-score' calculated using the formula and calculation provided in Turner Stokes (2006) which takes into consideration the sum of weights and score changes and expected correlations. HIgher scores reflect better outcome.</description>
