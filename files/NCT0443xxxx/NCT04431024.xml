      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A germline mutation is a change to a person s genes that is carried through their DNA. These&#xD;
      mutations can be passed on from parents to their offspring. Germline mutations in a gene&#xD;
      called BAP1 are linked to the development of mesothelioma and other cancers. Researchers want&#xD;
      to follow people with these mutations to learn more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if researchers can improve how people who have or are suspected to have a BAP1&#xD;
      mutation are monitored over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People age 30 and older who are suspected to have a BAP1 germline mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a personal and family medical history. Their medical&#xD;
      records may be reviewed. They will give a blood or saliva sample to test for a BAP1 mutation.&#xD;
      They will get genetic counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To take part in this study, participants will enroll on 2 to 3 other protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. They may have a tumor biopsy. They will give blood&#xD;
      and urine samples. They will have skin and eye exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have video-assisted thoracoscopy to examine the chest and lungs and&#xD;
      diagnose suspicious areas. For this, a small camera is inserted into the chest through a&#xD;
      small incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some participants will have laparoscopy to examine the organs inside the abdomen. For this, a&#xD;
      small camera is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have imaging scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They may have brain&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH once a year for follow-up exams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation lasts indefinitely.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations involving BRCA1-Associated Protein-1 (BAP1), a nuclear deubiquitinase involved&#xD;
           in epigenetic regulation of gene expression, DNA repair, and cellular energetics, have&#xD;
           emerged as one of the most common somatic mutations in malignant mesotheliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Germline mutations involving BAP1 predispose individuals to mesothelioma as well as a&#xD;
           variety of other malignancies including lung, melanoma, renal, gastric, and breast&#xD;
           cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cancer penetrance of BAP1 is nearly 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presently there are no established guidelines for surveillance of cancer patients with&#xD;
           germline BAP1 mutations or of cancer-free individuals with germline BAP1 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prospectively gather information related to the use of photon counting computed&#xD;
      tomographic imaging (PCCT), together with minimally invasive surgical surveillance for early&#xD;
      detection of pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma in patients with BAP1 tumor predisposition&#xD;
      syndrome (TPDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with a history of any malignancy with known or suspected germline mutation&#xD;
           involving BAP1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First- or second-degree relatives of patients with documented germline BAP1 mutations,&#xD;
           who are also found to carry similar germline mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age greater than or equal to 30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals with suspected hereditary tumor predisposition syndromes will undergo&#xD;
           germline evaluation using CLIA-certified next-gen sequencing (NGS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First- and second-degree relatives of patients with germline BAP1 mutations will be&#xD;
           offered similar NGS evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with germline mutations in BAP1, will undergo periodic photon counting CT&#xD;
           (PCCT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) will be&#xD;
           assessed at similar intervals, and minimally invasive surveillance procedures (i.e.,&#xD;
           video- assisted thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) will be performed periodically to detect&#xD;
           early, subclinical malignancies that may be amenable to potentially curative local&#xD;
           interventions.&#xD;
