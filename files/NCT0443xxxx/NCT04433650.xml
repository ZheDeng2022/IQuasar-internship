      Introduction: Person-centred care is based on the assumption that every person has resources&#xD;
      that should be used in the care situation. In order for this to happen the patient has to be&#xD;
      able to effectively communicate his/her symptoms. This protocol describes the analysis of a&#xD;
      digital picture-based tool for communication support for children with cancer aged 5-17&#xD;
      years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment. The advantage of a non-linguistic based&#xD;
      platform, beside the expected clinical outcomes, is that it can be used in multiple national&#xD;
      studies with minimal translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Two studies will be conducted in a hybrid design, i.e., a crossover&#xD;
      design will be used for the intervention (effects), and a mixed-methods design will be used&#xD;
      for the process evaluation. Qualitative interviews will be carried out with children with&#xD;
      cancer, their legal guardians and case-related healthcare professionals as part of the&#xD;
      process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interviews will address the experiences of the intervention and frequency of use from the&#xD;
      child's perspective. Interview transcripts will be analyzed qualitative descriptively. The&#xD;
      digital communication tool will collect child self-reports of symptoms/emotions. The children&#xD;
      will be monitored for biomarkers of stress and pain (neuropeptides, neurosteroids and&#xD;
      peripheral steroids) in venous blood samples, in-app estimation levels for the children, drug&#xD;
      consumption. Person-centeredness will be evaluated with the questionnaire Visual CARE&#xD;
      Measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (ref&#xD;
      2019-02392; 2020-02601).&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Failure in symptom relief in children with cancer leads to physical and emotional&#xD;
      distress. Success in symptom relief is assumed to decrease distress. To initiate a&#xD;
      person-centred approach to child-centred care means to elucidate, listen to and affirm the&#xD;
      child´s story. Assessments of distress and symptoms are essential in symptom relief for&#xD;
      children with cancer. However, the exclusive assessment of pain intensity can be considered a&#xD;
      restrictive description of the experience. Novel assessment tools that give a broader&#xD;
      description of symptoms are needed. Self-reports of symptoms are the gold standard for&#xD;
      measuring symptoms, and strategies to achieve symptom relief to represent a dynamic and&#xD;
      interactive process. A complex intervention has been chosen, and the project follows the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council´s key principles and actions for consideration in the developing of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM This project aims to investigate whether a person-centred communication intervention&#xD;
      employing a new digital communication tool for children undergoing cancer treatment decrease&#xD;
      the children's self-reported distress&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does adding a digital reporting and communication tool, decrease distress in children with&#xD;
      cancer, aged 5-17 years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the adding of a digital reporting and communication tool, increase person-centredness in&#xD;
      children with cancer, aged 5-17 years, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: (i) Person-centred communication with children undergoing cancer treatment,&#xD;
      applying a digital reporting and communication tool, will lead to reduced self-reported&#xD;
      distress on an analogue assessment tool (paper sheet) (primary outcome), a decrease in&#xD;
      neuropeptides, neurosteroids and peripheral steroids for stress and pain in blood, and an&#xD;
      increased person-centeredness (secondary outcomes) (effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) The person-centred communication is performed in child-centred ways to proactively&#xD;
      assess children's symptoms (process) and will be evaluated with frequency of use and&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS/DESIGN Study design The children will participate in a cross-over design where they&#xD;
      are their own controls. This is a hybrid design, which evaluates both the effects and the&#xD;
      implementation (process).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant is given a code in a predetermined order; the code shows whether he or she&#xD;
      should start either with intervention (application) or with the control conditions.&#xD;
      Randomization of the codes occurs in advance at randomizer.org, and the researcher always&#xD;
      picks the codes in a predetermined order without knowing if it is intervention or control.&#xD;
      This is revealed when the participant has agreed to participate in the study. Participating&#xD;
      children participate twice, once as a control and once with e-health support Pictorial&#xD;
      support in Person-centered care for children (PicPecc).&#xD;

    <description>Phase A: The child has the protocol for methotrexate treatment, the healthcare professionals have one workshop that containing person-centred care, universal design, distress, symptom management and the digital reporting and communication tool.&#xD;
Phase B: The child has everything in phase A. In addition, the child use the digital reporting and communication tool that has a thermometer (graded from zero (green) to ten (red)). The result of the assessment is visualized as a face (mimic and colour represents the intensity of the symptom and/or emotion (i.e., anxiety, appetite, fear/worries, how I´m feeling today, nausea, pain, sleep, and tiredness)). The digital reporting and communication tool has a body figure for location of pain, pictures for the type of pain, and an open question. There is an avatar and a gamification part, e.g., the child gets a pet after assessing the symptoms/emotions. The child reports in the app, and the child decides the frequency of assessments.</description>
