  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has no evidence for the anticoagulation in patients who had undergone catheter ablation&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. However,&#xD;
      anticoagulation can increase the risk of bleeding, the study evaluating the role of oral&#xD;
      anticoagulation is needed in this patients. This study will compare the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in patient with sinus&#xD;
      rhythm one year after catheter ablation of AF.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized study which was performed in multicenter (General&#xD;
      Hospital) in Korea. Inclusion criteria is atrial fibrillation patients with moderate or high&#xD;
      stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc&gt;=1 male, and &gt;=2 female) who had undergone catheter ablation of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. Anticoagulation&#xD;
      (Apixaban group) will take apixaban (5 mg bid or 2.5 mg bid according to dose guideline) for&#xD;
      2 years, and nonanticoagulation group will not take any oral anticoagulants for the same&#xD;
      period. If the patients have the recurrence of AF, they will take anticoagulation according&#xD;
      to standard treatment, and will be censored. We will analyze and compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
