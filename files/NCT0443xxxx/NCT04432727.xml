  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the Flexitouch Plus&#xD;
      with Cellular Connectivity (FT-CC) to monitor device use data to determine if reminders to&#xD;
      patients impact compliance, and to identify the impact device compliance has on arm girth,&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL), and symptom assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, on label, prospective, randomized, two-arm feasibility study that&#xD;
      plans to enroll 30 female subjects in the United States. In an effort to reduce potential&#xD;
      exposure to COVID-19, all study assessments are intended to be performed in a contactless&#xD;
      manner (i.e., telephone, video conference, etc). If a subject passes the initial screening&#xD;
      requirements via medical history and expresses interest in the study an informed consent form&#xD;
      will be provided to them. Once consent has been obtained they will undergo a baseline visit&#xD;
      where they will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: PASSIVE FT-CC (text messages&#xD;
      reminders will not be sent to subjects) and ACTIVE FT-CC (text messages reminders will be&#xD;
      sent if subject does not use the device for 2 consecutive days). Randomization was&#xD;
      incorporated into the study to determine if ACTIVE FT-CC affects device use. A total of 2&#xD;
      follow-up visits will be conducted over a 60-day period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 30 days after device training, and 60 days after device training</time_frame>

    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment via LYMQOL ARM</measure>

    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant quality of life in patients treated with FT-CC via Lymphedema Quality of Life Tool (LYMQOL ARM).&#xD;
Lymphedema Quality of Life Tool (LYMQOL-ARM) includes sub-scores for Function (range 10-40), Appearance (range 5-20), Symptoms (range 6-24), and Emotion (range 6-24) where lower scores represent a better outcome. It also includes an Overall QOL sub-score (range 0-10) where a higher score represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Assessment via SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 30 days after device training, and 60 days after device training</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant quality of life in patients treated with FT-CC by via The RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36).&#xD;
The RAND 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item for perceived change in health. Min value: 0, Max value: 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Symptoms Assessment via LSIDS-A</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 30 days after device training, and 60 days after device training</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of partially compliant and compliant symptoms in patients treated with FT-CC by via The Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-ARM (LSIDS-A).&#xD;
The Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey is a questionnaire used to assess intensity and distress of symptoms in patients with lymphedema of the arm. This includes sub-scores for soft tissue sensation (range 0-10), neurological sensation (0-10), function, (0-10), biobehavioral (0-10), resource (0-10), sexuality (0-10), activity (0-10). Higher score represents worse outcome.</description>
