    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot investigation is a prospective, observational study of 300 healthy&#xD;
      nulliparous women with spontaneous term labor onset. The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1: Characterize IL-8 (pro-inflammatory biomarker), basal body temperature, maternal&#xD;
      heart rate, and electrical activity of the uterus prior to spontaneous onset of labor through&#xD;
      the onset of active labor among nulliparous women. IL-8 will be quantified weekly, daily&#xD;
      basal body temperature, as well as continuous maternal heart rate and electrical activity of&#xD;
      the uterus throughout the transition from late pregnancy into active labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2: Characterize latent labor symptoms among nulliparous women in spontaneous labor.&#xD;
      Using Likert scale, childbirth-specific, symptom-specific PROMIS measures,45 and open-ended&#xD;
      questions will be quantified and characterize latent labor symptoms (e.g., intensity,&#xD;
      frequency) and identify relevant themes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #3: Characterize trajectories of labor biomarkers and latent labor symptoms across latent&#xD;
      labor duration. A modified growth mixture modeling approach to quantify subgroup phenotypes&#xD;
      among nulliparous women in spontaneous latent labor will be employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.1. There will be significant congruence between higher biomarkers (e.g., higher&#xD;
      IL-8, more uterine electrical activity) and symptoms that are more intense and frequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3.2. At least two classes of laboring women with distinct trajectories of change&#xD;
      in biomarkers and symptoms can be identified and will be associated with cervical dilation at&#xD;
      hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Characterize biomarkers among nulliparous women with spontaneous labor onset&#xD;
      vs. nulliparous women requiring labor induction for post-term gestation. Weekly IL-8, daily&#xD;
      basal body temperature, as well as continuous maternal heart rate and electrical activity of&#xD;
      the uterus throughout the transition from late pregnancy into active labor between those&#xD;
      whose labor begins spontaneously and those whose labors are induced for post-term gestation&#xD;
      will be quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis. There will be different biomarker patterns between women with&#xD;
      spontaneous labor onset vs. those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Standard descriptive and inferential statistics as well as growth mixture modeling for&#xD;
      quantitative aims will be used. The investigators will use thematic development for&#xD;
      qualitative aims.&#xD;
