  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      FDY-5301 compared to placebo in major trauma ICU patients at risk of intensive care unit&#xD;
      acquired weakness (ICUAW)&#xD;

      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of FDY-5301 compared to&#xD;
      placebo in trauma ICU patients at risk of ICUAW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle wasting occurs rapidly after major trauma and is often associated with multi-organ&#xD;
      failure lasting from a few weeks to a long term disability. It is believed that FDY-5301 may&#xD;
      help prevent or treat muscle weakness and organ dysfunction in major trauma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 252 subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive up to 7 daily bolus IV doses&#xD;
      of FDY-5301 at 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, or volume-matched placebo. To ensure equal representation&#xD;
      in each group, the randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of any pelvic&#xD;
      or lower limb fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who satisfy the eligibility criteria will be randomly allocated to one of three&#xD;
      treatment groups (FDY-5301 low dose, FDY-5301 high dose, or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted globally.&#xD;
