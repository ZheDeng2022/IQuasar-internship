  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis is that administration of iOWH032 to adult and pediatric males and&#xD;
      females with acute cholera due to V. cholerae O1 reduces stool output in the first 24 hours&#xD;
      significantly more than does the current standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of iOWH032 in adult&#xD;
      patients (Part A) and then pediatric patients (Part B) with acute watery diarrhea of less&#xD;
      than 24 hours' duration due to cholera. All subjects will be treated with standard of care&#xD;
      (IV rehydration fluids, ORS, and azithromycin less than/equal to1 g po) in addition to study&#xD;
      drug (iOWH032 active drug or placebo). Patients will be admitted, undergo a 4- to 6-hour&#xD;
      screening/observation period, be randomized in the study and treated with study drug (active&#xD;
      or placebo) for up to 3 days (ie, up to 9 doses), with a follow-up visit on Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A, approximately 170 adult patients with severe dehydrating diarrhea due to cholera&#xD;
      will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive iOWH032 500 mg or placebo TID for up to 3&#xD;
      days. Following completion of Part A, the data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will review&#xD;
      the unblinded data to assess safety and efficacy and conduct a futility analysis prior to&#xD;
      proceeding to Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the DSMB recommendation of dose and dosing schedule for pediatric patients, Part B&#xD;
      will be initiated. Approximately 156 pediatric patients with severe dehydrating diarrhea due&#xD;
      to cholera will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to receive iOWH032 or placebo at the&#xD;
      recommended dose and dosing regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy population for Parts A and B will consist of patients who tolerate the&#xD;
      first 3 doses of study drug (0, 8, and 16 hours post-randomization) without vomiting and&#xD;
      whose diagnosis is subsequently confirmed by a positive culture for V. cholerae O1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) Ethics&#xD;
      Committee and Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) will be informed of any serious&#xD;
      adverse event (SAE). Occurrence of 2 or more drug-related SAEs within a group of 10 patients&#xD;
      (20% of cumulative completed patients in the treatment group) in Part A or Part B will result&#xD;
      in unblinding of those patients and review by the DSMB. The study can be halted,&#xD;
      discontinued, or amended according to the recommendations of the icddr,b DSMB.&#xD;
