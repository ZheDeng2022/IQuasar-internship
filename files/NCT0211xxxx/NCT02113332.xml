  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liraglutide, a GLP-1-analogue has been shown to be an effective treatment option in patients&#xD;
      on oral anti-diabetes therapy with beneficial effects on both glycaemic control and weight.&#xD;
      However, to date there are no clinical trials of liraglutide added to insulin therapy, a&#xD;
      population of patients generally having worse glycaemic control and weight gain. In clinical&#xD;
      guidelines, use of multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) is usually the final therapeutic&#xD;
      option for type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study aim is to evaluate whether the addition of liraglutide, compared to&#xD;
      placebo, reduces the HbA1c level for overweight and obese type 2 diabetes patients with&#xD;
      inadequate glycaemic control treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). MDI is&#xD;
      defined as treatment with any basal insulin combined with separate meal time insulin&#xD;
      injections before the main meals, i.e. an insulin regimen with premixed insulin is not&#xD;
      considered as MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study duration is 24 weeks and includes 120 patients at 15 centers in Sweden.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with type 2 diabetes are generally treated with metformin and diet as first-line&#xD;
      therapy (1). In Sweden sulphonylureas are generally recommended as the next treatment option&#xD;
      due to their low cost and evidence for reducing diabetes complications (2). The next line of&#xD;
      therapy includes adding basal or premixed insulin. As a final step multiple daily insulin&#xD;
      injections with basal and prandial insulin have become the standard if glycaemic control does&#xD;
      not meet targets. Obesity is another co-morbid condition in this population (3). The United&#xD;
      Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) published 1998, the seminal trial demonstrating&#xD;
      the importance of glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, illustrated that insulin therapy&#xD;
      (mostly basal insulin alone) is accompanied by significant weight gain in patients with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (4). MDI generally results in even greater weight gain. Today there are few&#xD;
      treatment options in patients with type 2 diabetes on MDI with poor glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with basal, intermediate or premixed insulin, addition of sitagliptin has shown&#xD;
      further reduction in HbA1c of 0.6 percentage units (6 mmol/mol) with no change in weight (5).&#xD;
      However, the effect in patients with the most severe disease, namely those requiring MDI, was&#xD;
      not evaluated. In combination with metformin or sulphonylurea, adding the GLP-1-analogue&#xD;
      liraglutide, compared with adding sitagliptin, has shown greater reductions in HbA1c and&#xD;
      significant weight reductions (6). In an uncontrolled study in clinical practice, the&#xD;
      addition of exanatide (n=22) or liraglutide (n=43) to patients on insulin therapy, the&#xD;
      majority using MDI, was associated with a mean reduction in HbA1c by 1.0 percentage units (10&#xD;
      mmol/mol), reduction in weight of 7.1 kg and, simultaneously, a mean reduction in insulin&#xD;
      dose by 37 units (7). At baseline patients were generally obese (mean BMI 36kg/m2), had poor&#xD;
      glycaemic control, mean HbA1c of 8.9% (74 mmol/mol) and insulin doses of 92 units. The number&#xD;
      of hypoglycaemic events was low, treatment satisfaction was high and patients rated&#xD;
      hypoglycaemic episodes to be fewer than with insulin therapy alone. From these results it&#xD;
      seems that there may be a beneficial effect associated with liraglutide when added to type 2&#xD;
      diabetic patients on MDI; however, this requires confirmation in a randomised clinical trial.&#xD;
      This question is of particular concern since currently there are no treatment options for&#xD;
      reducing weight and insulin doses while simultaneously improving glycaemic control for this&#xD;
      patient group having most advanced disease. Further, many clinicians today use a therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy consisting of MDI as a final treatment option, but many patients do still not reach&#xD;
      target HbA1c and some even continue to have very poor glycaemic control (7). Therefore, the&#xD;
      aim of this study is to study the effect on HbA1c when adding liraglutide to MDI in&#xD;
      overweight and obese patients with impaired glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomised double-blind trial for 24 weeks including patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and poor glycaemic control despite being treated with MDI for at least 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to study the effect on HbA1c when adding liraglutide to MDI in overweight or obese&#xD;
      patients with impaired glycaemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novo Nordisk will provide study medication and treatment codes. Apoteket AB, Sweden, will&#xD;
      handle study treatment logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gothia Forum, Gothenburg, Sweden&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gothia Forum will provide the eCRF system to be used in the study. Data Management (including&#xD;
      the randomisation system) and statistical analysis will be performed by Statistiska&#xD;
      Konsultgruppen, Gothenburg, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab and continuous glucose monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      All laboratory tests will be measured at the Research Centre for Laboratory Medicine at&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DexCom G4 CGM device will be used for 21 days (7 days during the run-in period, 7 days&#xD;
      during week 12 Â± 7 days and 7 days during the last 2 weeks of the trial) for blinded&#xD;
      monitoring of glucose values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-benefit assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously published observations from clinical practice (7) have shown that patients treated&#xD;
      with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) with concomitant addition of liraglutide&#xD;
      (off-label) decreases the HbA1c by approximately 10 mmol/mo (1 percentage unit), reduces the&#xD;
      weight by 7 kg and decreases the insulin dose with 37 units (7). These patients were prior to&#xD;
      treatment overweight (BMI around 36), had HbA1c on average 74 mmol /mol and insulin doses&#xD;
      were at 92 units. Patients also rated hypoglycaemias to be fewer when insulin was combined&#xD;
      with liraglutide than when used alone. In general, patients reported an improved quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is always a risk of hypoglycaemia during insulin therapy irrespective of any additional&#xD;
      glucose-lowering therapy. However, previous findings from clinical practice (7) and that the&#xD;
      effect of GLP-1 on insulin release is only observed under hyperglycaemic conditions (8)&#xD;
      indicate that liraglutide does probably not lead to major increased risks of hypoglycaemias.&#xD;
      Since, liraglutide has been associated with a reduction in body weight in previous clinical&#xD;
      trials (8) it is likely that such an effect exists also in individuals treated with insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the risk of side effects or adverse reactions with the combination of insulin and&#xD;
      liraglutide is probably small in relation to the improved hyperglycaemic control and weight&#xD;
      reduction that may exist when adding liraglutide in type 2 diabetic patients with basal and&#xD;
      prandial insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rational&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) are regarded as the most advanced treatment regimen&#xD;
      in patients with type 2 diabetes. At study start all patients have been treated with MDI for&#xD;
      at least 6 months but are still suffering from poor glycaemic control. The patients included&#xD;
      are also overweight or obese. It is therefore of importance to evaluate whether this patient&#xD;
      group have a beneficial effect, on the glycaemic control and weight reduction, by adding&#xD;
      liraglutide, since liraglutide has shown such beneficial effects in combination with oral&#xD;
      glucose lowering drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, beneficial effects by liraglutide have been observed when used off-label in&#xD;
      combination with insulin in clinical practice (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with parallel-group design. The&#xD;
      study involves 120 patients at 15 health centres in Sweden and includes 10 visits over 26&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug will be liraglutide which includes 3 different dosages: 0.6 mg, 1.2 mg and 1.8&#xD;
      mg. Liraglutide will be titrated to 1.8 mg by increasing the dose every week. Since subjects&#xD;
      will have inappropriate glycaemic control (greater than or equal to 7.5%=58 mmol/mol HbA1c)&#xD;
      no general reduction in insulin doses will be made, but if glucose curves during the run-in&#xD;
      period show clearly lower mean glucose levels than those corresponding to HbA1c 7.5%=58&#xD;
      mmol/mol or are well-controlled before certain meals, insulin adjustments will temporarily be&#xD;
      considered during the titration phase of liraglutide/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide will be available at a concentration of 6.0 mg/ml and supplied in a 3 ml&#xD;
      disposable pen-injector. Placebo is supplied in an identical disposable pen-injector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a run-in period of maximally 60 days, patients will be randomised to receive either 0.6&#xD;
      mg liraglutide or 0.6 mg placebo. Novo Nordisk will provide (coded) medication pens and the&#xD;
      associated code-list. No study personnel other than a designated data manager responsible for&#xD;
      setting-up randomisation will have access to the complete code-list until the study blind is&#xD;
      broken. Apoteket AB/farmaci will handle study treatment logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimisation (optimal allocation) using a centralised web system (handled by Statistiska&#xD;
      Konsultgruppen) will be used for randomisation. At randomisation each subject will be&#xD;
      assigned a randomisation code that (blindly) represents the treatment (liraglutide or&#xD;
      placebo) that the patient is randomised to. The patient will also be assigned a unique and&#xD;
      anonymous Subject ID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breaking blind&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is double-blinded. The randomisation codes will not be broken until last subject's&#xD;
      last visit and when all study data are collected, the study database is cleaned and declared&#xD;
      locked. Apoteket AB/farmaci will be responsible for keeping the complete randomisation list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency situation.&#xD;
      Apoteket/farmaci is equipped with 24 hour emergency telephone service in case of need for&#xD;
      breaking blind in an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone number:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekdays 08.30-16.00: 040-33 26 74. Any other time: 040-331000 - ask for emergency telephone&#xD;
      service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject should be withdrawn from the study in case of a code break but be included in the&#xD;
      safety population in the statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected duration of subject participation is approximately 32 weeks (maximally 60 days&#xD;
      run-in, and 24 weeks follow-up after randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 120 patients at 15 centres in Sweden. Patients requiring MDI and who&#xD;
      are on no other diabetes drugs except metformin will be recruited and included in the study&#xD;
      after receiving oral and written information about the study and given informed consent and&#xD;
      fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The study&#xD;
      population will be identified among diabetic outpatient clinics at hospitals and will be&#xD;
      recruited on a community-wide basis and in communication with primary care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written information will include objects and purpose of the study, risks and benefits,&#xD;
      and a detailed description of the events during the study. The patient will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to ask additional questions at the first clinic visit The patients will be&#xD;
      randomised 1:1 to liraglutide or placebo Randomisation codes will be assigned strictly&#xD;
      sequentially as subjects are eligible for randomisation. If a subject discontinues&#xD;
      participation in the study, his/her enrolment/subject number cannot be reused. Drop-outs&#xD;
      (expected to be ~5%) will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Stop Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor/Investigator may decide to stop the trial or part of the trial at any time for&#xD;
      medical reasons. Furthermore, the manufacturers of the study drugs may revoke their products,&#xD;
      which may lead to the entire study may be interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Investigator should promptly inform&#xD;
      the patients and ensure appropriate therapy and follow-up. Furthermore, the Investigator&#xD;
      should promptly inform the Ethics committee and provide a detailed written explanation. The&#xD;
      regulatory authority should be informed according to national regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-outs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who drop-out from the study or receive rescue therapy shall be requested for&#xD;
      follow-up on an additional visit. HbA1c, FPG, C-peptide, pro-insulin, amylase, lipase, liver&#xD;
      transaminases, creatinine, calcitonin, fasting blood lipids, adiponectin, sensitive CRP,&#xD;
      apolipoproteins, weight, blood pressure, insulin dose, waist-hip ratio, abdominal sagittal&#xD;
      diameter, concomitant medications and treatment satisfaction shall be checked. Blood samples&#xD;
      for biobank will be taken. Insulin doses and other medications recorded. If drop-out exists&#xD;
      the reason shall be recorded. Regarding rescue therapy the variables above shall be checked&#xD;
      if possible before rescue therapy is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product and treatment of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial product will be dispensed to each subject as required according to treatment group.&#xD;
      The centralized web randomisation system will allocate trial product Dispensing Unit Number&#xD;
      (DUN) to the subject at the randomisation visit. The correct DUN must be dispensed to the&#xD;
      subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator must ensure availability of proper storage conditions and record and&#xD;
      evaluate the temperature (at least every working day). Storage facilities should be checked&#xD;
      frequently. A log to document the temperature must be kept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned for 24 weeks and in addition a run-in period of maximally 60 days.&#xD;
      Capillary glucose values will be measured before each meal and 1.5-2 hours after meals at 2&#xD;
      days during the 60-day run-in period, 2 days per week during the first 3 weeks of the trial&#xD;
      and 2 days during the last 2 weeks of the trial. Capillary glucose curves performed during&#xD;
      the run-in period and the last two weeks of the study will always be measured after the week&#xD;
      with CGM to not disturb the interpretation of CGM data. The Contour XT SMBG meter (Bayer)&#xD;
      shall be used for capillary glucose measurements during the study. The SMBG meter shall be&#xD;
      checked at eash visit before initiating CGM, i.e. during the run-in period, week 12 (+- 7&#xD;
      days) and week 23-24. Calibration will be performed according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      standards. The SMBG meter shall be introduced at visit 4. During 7 days of the run-in period,&#xD;
      7 days of week 12 Â± 7 days and 7 days of the 2 last weeks in the study, CGM with DexCom 4G&#xD;
      will be used. CGM should be taken for 7 days, but a minimum of 5 days is acceptable. If a&#xD;
      shorter period exists, a new sensor shall be set to get data for a total of 7 days (A total&#xD;
      period of 5 days is acceptable). Investigators will recommend patients measure 3-4 glucose&#xD;
      values per day before meals and at bedtime daily according to clinical guidelines for&#xD;
      potentially adjusting insulin doses, diet or physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liraglutide/placebo will be administered at 0.6 mg the first week, 1.2 mg the second week and&#xD;
      1.8 mg the third week and onward. Dose increase periods can be extended based on subject's&#xD;
      tolerance to the trial product. If the subject does not tolerate 1.8 mg liraglutide/placebo&#xD;
      due to side effects, the dose shall be reduced to 1.2 mg liraglutide/placebo.&#xD;
      Correspondingly, if 1.2 mg liraglutide/placebo is not tolerated 0.6 mg liraglutide/placebo&#xD;
      shall be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since subjects will have inappropriate glycaemic control (greater than or equal to 7.5%=58&#xD;
      mmol/mol in HbA1c) no general reduction in insulin doses will be made. However, glucose&#xD;
      profiles during the run-in period shall be judged by the clinician. In the following cases&#xD;
      the clinician will consider to take the following actions when liraglutide is added:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) If the patient has a mean glucose level lower than 8.5 mmol/l the clinician should&#xD;
      consider reducing the total insulin dose by 10%-20% when adding liraglutide 0.6 mg B) If&#xD;
      glucose levels before a certain meal are well-controlled (less than 7 mmol/l) the clinician&#xD;
      should consider reducing the meal-time insulin dose administered at the previous meal by&#xD;
      10%-20% when adding liraglutide 0.6 mg. If daytime hypoglycaemia has occurred a larger than&#xD;
      20% reduction in the insulin dose at the previous meal shall be considered when adding&#xD;
      liraglutide 0.6 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) If fasting glucose is 5.0-7.0 mmol/l the basal insulin shall be reduced by 20%-30% when&#xD;
      adding liraglutide 0.6 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) If fasting glucose is less than 5 mmol/l or nocturnal hypoglycaemia has occurred during&#xD;
      the run-in period basal insulin shall be reduced by 20%-40%. Novel evaluations with glucose&#xD;
      measurements during 4-5 days shall be performed to confirm that FPG is greater than 5 mmol/l&#xD;
      and no new nocturnal hypoglycaemia exists before adding liraglutide. A novel evaluation&#xD;
      according to point A)-D) shall then be performed from the new glucose values when adding&#xD;
      liraglutide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When increasing liraglutide from 0.6 mg to 1.2 mg as well as from 1.2 mg to 1.8 mg the&#xD;
      corresponding actions as points A-D above shall be considered based on glucose values and&#xD;
      hypoglycaemias during the previous week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After titrating liraglutide/placebo to 1.8 mg in patients where insulin doses at any stage&#xD;
      have been reduced, the insulin doses will be increased until the original doses are reached.&#xD;
      However, the titration will be stopped, i.e., the insulin doses will not be titrated to the&#xD;
      original doses, if glucose levels at any stage in the phase of increasing doses are already&#xD;
      on target. For example, if the mean glucose level before a certain meal is less than 7 mmol/l&#xD;
      after adding liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg, the insulin dose before the previous meal will not&#xD;
      be increased although the dose has been reduced. Correspondingly, if mean FPG is less than&#xD;
      7.0 mmol/l the basal insulin dose will not be increased although it has been reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total insulin dose shall not be titrated higher than the original total insulin dose at&#xD;
      any point during the study, except if rescue therapy is required. The diabetes educator or&#xD;
      physician will have regular telephone contact with the patient during the initial period when&#xD;
      liraglutide is titrated and for possibly adjusting insulin doses. At the 6, 12 and 18 week&#xD;
      follow-up visits and other contacts with the patient, e.g. telephone contacts, the insulin&#xD;
      doses can be increased in patients with a lower insulin dose than the original insulin dose&#xD;
      before randomisation so long as glucose levels then not are on target (less than 7.0 mmol/l&#xD;
      fasting or before meal). However, the insulin doses shall not be increased higher than the&#xD;
      original doses, except if rescue therapy is undertaken In daily activity, the patient will&#xD;
      continue to adjust meal-time insulin doses in the same way as previously performed in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the fasting self-measured plasma glucose (fasting SMPG) values taken on three separate&#xD;
      days or if any of the FPG samples analysed by the central laboratory exceeds the limit of&#xD;
      15.5 mmol/l from baseline to week 12 or 13.5 mmol/l from week 12 to week 24, the subject&#xD;
      should be called for an unscheduled visit as soon as possible. The next scheduled visit&#xD;
      should not be awaited. A confirmatory FPG should be obtained and analysed by the central&#xD;
      laboratory. If this FPG exceeds the above described values, and no treatable intercurrent&#xD;
      cause for the hyperglycaemia has been diagnosed (e.g. compliance to liraglutide/placebo,&#xD;
      missing of insulin dose in the evening, infection), the subject should receive rescue&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue therapy is defined as an increase of the total insulin dose above the original total&#xD;
      insulin dose (i.e. total insulin dose at baseline, at randomisation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should be noticed that rescue therapy is NOT given if the total insulin dose was initially&#xD;
      reduced in the trial and the total insulin dose is increased by the physician due to FPG&#xD;
      above thresholds but not higher than the total original insulin dose. Rescue therapy will not&#xD;
      exist either if a patient increases the total insulin dose at any point in time above the&#xD;
      total original insulin dose by, e.g., self-adjustments of meal-time insulin doses in daily&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other medication, which is considered necessary for the subject's safety and well-being, may&#xD;
      be given at the discretion of the investigator. Medications prescribed before study entry&#xD;
      should preferably remain unchanged during the study period unless changes are made for safety&#xD;
      reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance and adherence to protocol will be checked at each contact with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject compliance will be assessed by DMG monitoring accountability. The unused amount of&#xD;
      trial product will be assessed against the dispensed amount and, in case of discrepancies,&#xD;
      the subjects must be asked about compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual delegated by the Investigator must keep track of all received, used, partly&#xD;
      used and unused trial products and, if possible, all empty packaging. This shall be properly&#xD;
      documented. Used, partly used and unused trial products and empty packaging must be stored&#xD;
      separately from non-allocated trial products. Used, partly used and unused trial products&#xD;
      must be stored until the monitor has performed drug accountability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Destruction of trial products will be performed in accordance with local legislation and&#xD;
      recorded on a destruction form.&#xD;

      Not in use: The liraglutide/placebo pen-injector must be stored in a refrigerator at a&#xD;
      temperature between +2Â°C and +8Â°C. Keep away from the cooling element. Do not freeze and do&#xD;
      not use if it has been frozen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In use: After first opening the liraglutide/placebo pen-injector can be stored for one month&#xD;
      at temperatures below +30Â°C or in a refrigerator between +2Â°C and +8Â°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The liraglutide/placebo pen-injector must be protected from all sources of light, and the pen&#xD;
      cap should be kept on when the pen is not in use. The liraglutide/placebo should not be used&#xD;
      if it does not appear clear and colorless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of incorrect storage the Investigator or site staff must contact Novo Nordisk without&#xD;
      delay. Trial product(s) must be set on-hold and not dispensed to subjects until notified by&#xD;
      Novo Nordisk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individual delegated by the Investigator must keep track of all received, used, partly&#xD;
      used and unused trial products and, if possible, all empty packaging, by using the drug&#xD;
      accountability module in the centralised web system. No trial product should be dispensed to&#xD;
      any person not enrolled in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Returned trial product(s) (used, partly used or unused and if possible, empty packaging&#xD;
      material) must be stored separately from non-allocated trial product(s). Destruction of trial&#xD;
      products will be done according to local laws and will be recorded on a destruction form,&#xD;
      which must be signed by the individual responsible for destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardised procedures for administration of questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be filled in at the study site. The patients should be allowed to sit&#xD;
      alone in a reasonable quiet environment to answer the questions. It will be emphasized that&#xD;
      patients complete the questionnaires prior to clinical measurements and before meeting a&#xD;
      doctor. Questionnaires should be answered by the patient herself alone, however, the&#xD;
      nurse/assistant will be informed about helping the patients to complete the questionnaires if&#xD;
      necessary, however without influencing the patients' responses. Ensure the patient&#xD;
      confidentiality. Study nurse/assistant should check the questionnaires for completeness. The&#xD;
      principal investigator will assure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Run-in period&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the run-in period is to check glucose values as a basis for possible insulin&#xD;
      adjustments and to perform CGM before randomisation. Blinded CGM will be performed during 1&#xD;
      week of the 60-day run-in period. Capillary glucose values before meals and 1.5 hours after&#xD;
      meals will be measured during at least 2 days, after the CGM-period. Treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      (DTSQs) will be checked, preferentially before initiating CGM, since CGM may influence&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose profiles and hypoglycaemias during the run-in period will be checked to judge whether&#xD;
      insulin reductions shall be performed (See section 8.2 Titration Algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the randomisation visit the following variables will be measured before randomisation and&#xD;
      blood samples will be sent to the Research Centre for Laboratory Medicine at Karolinska&#xD;
      University Hospital. All blood samples are recommended to be fasting to facilitate logistics&#xD;
      since several tests require fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure after at least 5 minutes rest in sitting position&#xD;
           with appropriate cuff-size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HbA1c and fasting glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amylase, lipase, creatinine, liver transaminases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting Blood Lipids (Triglycerides, Total-, HDL- and LDL-Cholesterol), fasting&#xD;
           apolipoproteins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Waist-hip ratio and abdominal sagittal diameter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of insulin and doses of insulin and metformin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AE, SAE and hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adiponectin, sensitive CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GAD-antibodies, calcitonin, amylase, lipase&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting C-peptide and fasting pro-insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biobank samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of insulin, doses of insulin and doses of metformin recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other types of medications recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A morning urin sample of Albuminuria/Creatinine ratio will be measured with local&#xD;
           laboratory analysis either at inclusion/exclusion visit or at randomisation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Web randomisation will be performed with minimisation (optimal allocation) to liraglutide or&#xD;
      placebo in 1:1 proportion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diabetes educator or the physician will have telephone contact with the patient as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day after starting liraglutide/placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the 2 days before increasing liraglutide/placebo to 1.2 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day after the increase to 1.2 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the two days before increasing liraglutide/placebo to 1.8 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day after increasing liraglutide to 1.8 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One week after the increase of liraglutide/placebo to 1.8 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      More frequent telephone contacts during the initial weeks or later in the study will be made&#xD;
      depending on the decision of the diabetic educator or physician if needed for the individual&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each telephone contact, insulin adjustments will be considered according to specified&#xD;
      algorithms, i.e.:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if hypoglycaemia exists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If glucose values are well-controlled before titrating liraglutide/placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients where insulin doses are reduced at any stage during the titration of liraglutide,&#xD;
      regular telephone contacts every 3-4 day after titrating liraglutide/placebo to 1.8 mg shall&#xD;
      be performed. Insulin doses will then be increased until the original insulin doses are&#xD;
      reached. The increase of insulin doses will be stopped at a lower level earlier before&#xD;
      original doses are reached if glucose levels already are on target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical visits will be performed at weeks 6, 12, 18 and 24. Visit at Week 6, 12 and 18&#xD;
&#xD;

           laboratory analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemias&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemias will be defined according to the general guidelines from the American Diabetes&#xD;
      Association of definitions of hypoglycaemias in study settings (9). Hypoglycaemias will be&#xD;
      divided into documented symptomatic hypoglycaemias, documented asymptomatic hypoglycaemias&#xD;
      and severe hypoglycaemias. Patients will be counselled of typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      and given a diabetes diary for recordings of glucose values, signs of hypoglycaemias and&#xD;
      recovery from symptoms after intake of carbohydrates. The frequency of hypoglycaemia with&#xD;
      glucose values below 3.0 mmol/l and 4.0 mmol/l will both be used as endpoints. Severe&#xD;
      hypoglycaemias will also be recorded in the diabetes diary. If a severe hypoglycaemia appears&#xD;
      the responsible physician for the patient should be informed as soon as possible. The&#xD;
      following parameters of hypoglycaemia will be recorded in accordance with guidelines for&#xD;
      study design of the American Diabetes Association:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of documented symptomatic hypoglycaemias (PG less than 4.0 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of documented asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (PG less than 4.0 mmol/l).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The number of symptomatic and asymptomatic documented hypoglycaemia with PG less than&#xD;
           3.0 mmol/l will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of glucose values recorded by CGM below 3.0 mmol/l and 4.0 mmol/l respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of severe hypoglycaemias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients shall be informed regarding the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and requested to&#xD;
      immediately perform a finger stick glucose measurement if symptoms occur that may be related&#xD;
      to hypoglycaemia, but to avoid delay in treating these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full analysis set (ITT-population) The full analysis set (ITT-population) consists of all&#xD;
      randomised patients who received at least one dose of study medication and has at least one&#xD;
      follow-up measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Analysis Primary efficacy analysis will be change in HbA1c from baseline to&#xD;
      24 weeks follow-up between the two treatment groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)&#xD;
      with HbA1c at baseline as covariate on the full analysis set (ITT-population), two-sided test&#xD;
      on significance level 0.05. If HbA1c from 24 weeks follow-up is missing the last observation&#xD;
      carry forward (LOCF) principle from 6, 12 and 18 weeks will be applied. All measurements&#xD;
      obtained after rescue therapy should be excluded in all efficacy analyses.&#xD;
