  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and&#xD;
      cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may&#xD;
      lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after&#xD;
      the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent&#xD;
      coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive inhibitor of&#xD;
      3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been safely and&#xD;
      widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart disease and&#xD;
      familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the cholesterol-lowering effects,&#xD;
      statins exerts diverse cellular, cholesterol-independent effects, including improvement in&#xD;
      endothelial function, inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and reduction in levels of&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines. Based on the above concepts, some patients with infrarenal&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysms received statin therapies and then the growth rate of aneurysms&#xD;
      slowed down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators may hypothesize that Atorvastatin is helpful in the regression&#xD;
      of persistent coronary lesions in KD patients due to its effect of anti-inflammation. In&#xD;
      NTUH, there are about 20 KD patients with coronary lesions persistent for many years. And the&#xD;
      investigators plan to conduct the clinical trial with atorvastatin to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      Atorvastatin on the persistent coronary arterial lesions/aneurysms in children with Kawasaki&#xD;
      disease including safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are around 20 KD patients eligible for this study. After they sign the IRB-approved&#xD;
      ICF, they will be enrolled for this study. Briefly, this study is divided into three stages:&#xD;
      screening &amp; enrollment stage (I), treatment &amp; follow-up stage (II) for 1 year and final data&#xD;
      analysis stage (III). Measurements include basic vital sign, electrocardiography, liver&#xD;
      function, muscle enzyme, inflammatory markers and echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predicted results&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.Oral atorvastatin therapy can effectively prevent the progression of coronary lesions in KD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      Background Kawasaki disease (KD) is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative&#xD;
      conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and&#xD;
      cervical lymphadenopathy. Incidence of late coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, which may&#xD;
      lead to myocardial infarction (MI), sudden death, or ischemic heart disease, decreased after&#xD;
      the introduction of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. However, significant persistent&#xD;
      coronary arterial lesions or aneurysms may still occur in about 1-3 % of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirin and warfarin, the recommended medication to prevent and decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      coronary artery events, can't guarantee the coronary patency in these KD patients. Thus, it's&#xD;
      urgent to look for an effective and safe treatment to make sure the coronary lesions will&#xD;
      stabilize even regress gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several groups studied the clinical characteristics of KD patients with coronary sequelae and&#xD;
      showed there was association between elevated inflammatory markers and the persistence of&#xD;
      coronary lesions. Atorvastatin (Lipitor®), a kind of statin, is a selective competitive&#xD;
      inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This drug had been&#xD;
      safely and widely used for treatment of adult hyperlipidemia, prevention of coronary heart&#xD;
      disease and familial hypercholesterolemia in childhood. In addition to the&#xD;
