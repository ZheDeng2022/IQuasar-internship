  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate development of hemolysis and the variation in isokinetic&#xD;
      muscle strength in two groups of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating&#xD;
      polyneuropathy (CIDP) or multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients shifted from 3- or 6-weekly treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to&#xD;
           weekly treatment with subcutanoeus immunoglobulin (SCIG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients shifted from SCIG treatment with Subcuvia® or Hizentra® to Gammanorm®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During treatment with IVIG blood hemoglobin will fluctuate with a decline due to&#xD;
           infusion, whereas it will remain stable during SCIG treatment without fluctuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Isokinetic muscle strength in affected muscle groups is more stable during treatment&#xD;
           with SCIG than with IVIG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood hemoglobin and changes in muscle strength is comparable during Subcuvia® or&#xD;
           Hizentra® and Gammanorm® treatment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to planned switch of treatment with immunoglobulin at Department of neurology&#xD;
      (Rigshospitalet) patients treated with IVIG will be shifted to treatment with SCIG with an&#xD;
      unaltered dosage. The medication is administered at home two or three times weekly. IVIG is&#xD;
      often administered every 3 to 6 weeks. All patients will be trained in managing the treatment&#xD;
      with SCIG by a nurse from the neurological department. When the patient is able to manage the&#xD;
      treatment regimen it can be done at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated eight times during the study period. Four times before and&#xD;
      four times after shift of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to participation the intervals will be standardized to 3 or 6 weeks giving an extra&#xD;
      infusion for those with an interval of 3 weeks, i.e. patients on 4-week interval will be&#xD;
      switched to 3-week interval while patients on 5-week interval will be switched to 6-week&#xD;
      interval. The dose will be adjusted leading to an unchanged weekly dose of IVIG. All patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated in connection to two IVIG infusions. For those receiving 3 infusions&#xD;
      examinations will be executed before and 2 weeks after the first and last infusion. SCIG is&#xD;
      initiated 2 weeks after the last IVIG infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on maintenance therapy with Subcuvia® or Hizentra® will be shifted to treatment with&#xD;
      Gammanorm® according to guidelines from the Danish Healthcare Society, the weekly dose of&#xD;
      immunoglobulin being unaltered. They will be evaluated 3 times (once before, at the time of&#xD;
      shift of SCIG and once after).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All evaluations at each time point in both groups consist of measurement of isokinetic muscle&#xD;
      strength of four affected muscle groups and blood sampling detecting blood hemoglobin and&#xD;
      hemolytic parameters.&#xD;
