  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the course of tumor growth and possibly by manipulation during the surgical procedure,&#xD;
      cells from rectal tumors may be shed into the peritoneal cavity. Such cells may give rise to&#xD;
      local recurrence or contribute to the formation of metastatic disease, specifically in the&#xD;
      form of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Detection of cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity at the&#xD;
      time of surgery might therefore be of value for prediction of disease recurrence with&#xD;
      subsequent prognostic implications for these patients. In this study the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine the presence of exfoliated tumor cells in peritoneal lavage samples from patients&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for LARC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators recently published a study investigating the incidence of exfoliated cancer&#xD;
      cells in peritoneal lavage fluid after resection of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC).&#xD;
      DNA isolated from cells obtained by peritoneal lavage was analyzed by denaturing capillary&#xD;
      electrophoresis with respect to mutations in hotspots of the K-RAS gene. This gene is mutated&#xD;
      in 30% of rectal tumors. Exfoliated tumor cells (as assessed by the presence of mutated DNA)&#xD;
      were found in lavage fluid from 19/237 of the patients, and the presence of tumor cells was&#xD;
      associated with poor overall survival. Based on these encouraging results the investigators&#xD;
      have designed a more comprehensive prospective study, using a novel, validated set of cancer&#xD;
      specific DNA methylation - based biomarkers present in the vast majority of all colorectal&#xD;
      tumors (sensitivity 94%, specificity 98%).Using these tumor cell associated biomarkers, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to determine the presence of exfoliated tumor cells in peritoneal lavage&#xD;
      samples from patients undergoing surgery for LARC. Lavage will be performed prior to and&#xD;
      after manipulation of the tumor to provide data regarding both spontaneous and iatrogenic&#xD;
      tumor cell exfoliation and their respective contribution to patient outcome. If detection of&#xD;
      exfoliated tumor cells is predictive of tumor recurrence, this would support an active&#xD;
      approach to postoperative chemotherapy, possibly in the form of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
