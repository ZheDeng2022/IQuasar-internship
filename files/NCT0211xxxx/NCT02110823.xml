      The Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) Trial looked at how infants with single ventricle&#xD;
      heart defects did after the first stage of surgery (Norwood operation). Infants enrolled in&#xD;
      the trial got one of two kinds of shunts during the Norwood; a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt&#xD;
      (MBTS) or right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (RV-to-PA shunt).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn if children (2-6 years of age) who were enrolled in the&#xD;
      SVR Trial do better with one of the two shunts (MBTS or RV-to-PA) in the years after surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Among critical congenital heart lesions, hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) and related&#xD;
      single right ventricle (RV) anomalies are associated with the highest morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The first stage in palliation for patients with these defects is the Norwood&#xD;
      procedure. The essential components of the Norwood procedure include (1) an atrial&#xD;
      septectomy, (2) anastomosis of the proximal pulmonary artery to the aorta with homograft&#xD;
      augmentation of the aortic arch, and (3) establishment of a source of pulmonary blood flow,&#xD;
      with either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (MBTS) or the right ventricle to pulmonary&#xD;
      artery (RV-to-PA) shunt. In May 2005, the Pediatric Heart Network began a multi-center,&#xD;
      randomized trial, the Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVR) Trial, comparing outcomes in&#xD;
      subjects with HLHS or other single RV anomalies palliated using the Norwood procedure with&#xD;
      either a MBTS or the RV-to-PA shunt. The primary outcome of this trial was freedom from death&#xD;
      or cardiac transplantation by 12 months post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Single Ventricle Reconstruction Extension (SVR II) Study is an extension of the SVR Trial&#xD;
      that compares clinical outcomes and RV performance following the RV-to-PA shunt versus MBTS&#xD;
      modifications of the Norwood procedure in subjects at 6 years post-randomization. Data is&#xD;
      collected annually between ages 2 and 6 years, as well as before and after the Fontan&#xD;
      surgery. Vital status and medical history is ascertained annually until the last enrolled&#xD;
      subject is 6 years old. Data is obtained through medical record review, phone interview with&#xD;
      the parent or guardian, electrocardiography (ECG), core laboratory analysis of&#xD;
      echocardiographic images and Holter monitors, and completion of questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, behavior, health-related quality of life, and family&#xD;
      functioning. The primary outcome variable in SVR II will be freedom from death or cardiac&#xD;
      transplantation at 6 years post-randomization. All subjects who were randomized in the SVR&#xD;
      trial will be included in analysis of this endpoint.&#xD;

      The SVR II study will collect biological specimens to bank in an established biorepository as&#xD;
      a resource for future, hypothesis-driven studies from families who provide separate informed&#xD;
      consent. When possible, blood will be drawn, processed, and stored in such a way as to permit&#xD;
      both genetic studies and studies of serum biomarkers. The intent is to obtain blood from&#xD;
      study subjects and parents (i.e., &quot;trios&quot;). When obtaining blood is not possible, however,&#xD;
      saliva will be obtained so that at least genetic information can be stored for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
