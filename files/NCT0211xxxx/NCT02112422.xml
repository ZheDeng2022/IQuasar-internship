    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that single dose dexamethasone given&#xD;
      sixty minutes preoperatively reduces visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and improves&#xD;
      quality of recovery in patients undergoing elective cesarean section as compared to the same&#xD;
      dose given immediately prior to skin incision.&#xD;

      Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid with minimal mineralocorticoid effects, is&#xD;
      commonly administered as an anesthesia adjunct for the prevention of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV). Over the last two decades the analgesic effects of dexamethasone have also&#xD;
      been demonstrated in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Two recent meta-analyses of&#xD;
      over thirty randomized clinical trials (close to 5,000 subjects) concluded that dexamethasone&#xD;
      at doses more than 0.1 mg/kg is an effective adjunct in multimodal strategies to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid consumption after a variety of surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean section is a common surgical procedure and associated with a moderate amount of&#xD;
      postoperative pain (Visual analogue score (VAS) of 3-5, on a 10 point scale). Patients'&#xD;
      postoperative experience closely correlates with their perception of pain management.&#xD;
      Controlling postoperative pain after cesarean section remains an important clinical&#xD;
      challenge. A multimodal approach to reduce pain has become a standard of care and includes&#xD;
      varying doses of intrathecal local anesthetic, intrathecal morphine, co-administration of&#xD;
      opioids or other adjuncts such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is typically administered in the elective cesarean section population for the&#xD;
      prevention of intrathecal opioid induced PONV. Recently however, the potential benefit of&#xD;
      single dose dexamethasone has been demonstrated in improving postoperative analgesia in this&#xD;
      patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analgesic effect of dexamethasone in post-cesarean section parturients is likely to be&#xD;
      mediated via its anti-inflammatory actions. This does not come as a surprise given the&#xD;
      profound inflammatory changes associated with the peripartum period and cesarean sections.&#xD;
      Until the late third trimester. pregnancy is thought to be associated with suppression of a&#xD;
      variety of humoral and cell-mediated immunological functions to accommodate the &quot;foreign&quot;&#xD;
      semi-allogeneic fetal graft. The proinflammatory milleu becomes up regulated in late&#xD;
      pregnancy and around the time of delivery. Specifically, during the third trimester, the&#xD;
      percentage of granulocytes and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8+) T lymphocytes are&#xD;
      significantly increased, along with a concomitant reduction in the percentages of cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 4 (CD4+) T lymphocytes and monocytes. During the peripartum and delivery&#xD;
      period, leukocyte count may become markedly elevated, attaining levels of 25,000/Î¼L or&#xD;
      greater. Moreover, circulating leukocytes undergo significant phenotypic changes including&#xD;
      the upregulation of adhesion molecules. Other markers of inflammation including C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and complement factors C3 and C4 are all&#xD;
      increased in normal pregnancy and significantly so during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean section itself causes significant surgical stress and results in a profound&#xD;
      inflammatory response. Inflammation is triggered not only by direct tissue injury from&#xD;
      surgical incision and deeper tissue trauma but also by &quot;spillage&quot; of highly pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators from amniotic fluid and placental tissue into the pelvic cavity as well as systemic&#xD;
      circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result of the inflammatory insults of pregnancy and cesarean section, dexamethasone has&#xD;
      emerged as an important adjunct in postoperative pain control in this patient population.&#xD;
      Unanswered, however, is the role that the timing of dexamethasone administration may play in&#xD;
      its analgesic action. Dexamethasone peak effect is delayed by 60-90 minutes reflecting its&#xD;
      unique pharmacodynamics. Unbound dexamethasone crosses cell membranes and binds with high&#xD;
      affinity to specific cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors. This complex binds to DNA elements&#xD;
      (glucocorticoid response elements) which results in a modification of transcription and&#xD;
      protein synthesis. This leads to inhibition of leukocyte infiltration at the site of&#xD;
      inflammation, interference in the function of mediators of inflammatory response, suppression&#xD;
      of humoral immune responses, and reduction in edema or scar tissue. Direct anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      actions of dexamethasone are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins and&#xD;
      lipocortins (which control the biosynthesis prostaglandins and leukotrienes). This multistep&#xD;
      mechanism of action may explain why administration of dexamethasone prior to the stress of&#xD;
      surgery may optimize its therapeutic effects including analgesia and anti-emesis. However,&#xD;
      the vast majority of studies on dexamethasone administer the drug immediately prior to or&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blinded trial is to determine if single dose&#xD;
      dexamethasone given 45-60 minutes preoperatively reduces VAS pain scores and improves quality&#xD;
      of recovery in patients undergoing elective cesarean section as compared to the same dose&#xD;
      given immediately after surgical incision.&#xD;
