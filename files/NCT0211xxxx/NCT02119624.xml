      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People who are dependent on alcohol drink even when they know something bad might happen.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about why they do this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study brain response when a person plays a game in different threat conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy right-handed adult heavy drinkers age 21 60&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy right-handed adult light drinkers age 21 60&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine&#xD;
           tests. They will have an EKG and psychiatric interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one or two clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will choose a snack and alcoholic beverage that they must drink in 5 minutes. After&#xD;
           their breath alcohol content (BrAC) is zero, they will play a game in the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The scanner is a metal cylinder that takes pictures of the brain. Participants lie on a&#xD;
           table that slides in and out of the cylinder. They will be in it for about 90 minutes,&#xD;
           lying still for up to 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the MRI, participants will play a simple computer game to earn food or drink&#xD;
           points under different threats of electric shock. Points can be exchanged for food or&#xD;
           alcohol after the game. Sometimes, participants will receive a mild electric shock&#xD;
           through a metal disk on the wrist. Electric shocks will only happen if the participant&#xD;
           tries to earn a reward point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the MRI, participants use their points for another drink and snack. They will stay&#xD;
           at the clinic until their BrAC is low, usually within 3 hours. Participants cannot drive&#xD;
           themselves home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a follow-up phone call the next day.&#xD;

      Objective: Continued drug seeking despite knowledge of adverse consequences is a hallmark of&#xD;
      addiction. To model this behavior, we will refine the parameters of a modified Monetary&#xD;
      Incentive Delay (MID) task that will allow us to investigate neural substrates of&#xD;
      approach-avoidance conflict resolution. We will then use this task to investigate functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain activation during pursuit of reward in heavy and&#xD;
      light drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Healthy non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers and healthy light drinkers&#xD;
      aged 21 to 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study will require 1 to 2 visits. Subjects will play a modified MID task called&#xD;
      Reward Incentive Delay with Shock (RIDS) to measure motivation to earn cue reward points in&#xD;
      conditions that are signaled to be safe or associated with a threat. After playing the RIDS&#xD;
      task subjects will be able to self-administer alcohol and/or food based on the reward points&#xD;
      earned during the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The outcome measures are differences in behavioral task performance and in&#xD;
      blood oxygenation dependent level (BOLD) signal measured using standard fMRI techniques and&#xD;
      analyzed using AFNI software.&#xD;
