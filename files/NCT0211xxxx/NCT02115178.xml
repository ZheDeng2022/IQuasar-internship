    <textblock>
      Background and Goal of Study: Minimal dose of spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine is commonly&#xD;
      performed for adult anorectal surgery. This kind of anaesthesia can cause sinus bradycardia&#xD;
      and hypotension wich reason is body position, autonomic nervus system reaction, reflex&#xD;
      reaction even with low levels of sensory block. However, neither the publication of minimal&#xD;
      doses of spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine effects of haemodynamic modifications nor their&#xD;
      accuracy was widely discussed. The aim of the study is to make a comparison of the&#xD;
      haemodynamic modifications due to minimal dose of spinal hyperbaric bupivacaine for adult&#xD;
      anorectal surgery in lithotomy or jack knife position of steering impedance device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Patients will be included which are over then 18 years old, who&#xD;
      underwent anorectal surgery of the benign pathology, requiring spinal anaesthesia, were&#xD;
      admitted in this clinical randomized study, hospitalized in Hospital of Lithuanian University&#xD;
      of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics and agree to participate to this study (written&#xD;
      settlement). All patients were implicitly divided in to 4 groups by the position will be&#xD;
      operating (lithotomy or jack knife position and by American Society of Anaesthesiologists&#xD;
      (ASA) clas I-II and III-IV). Technique of anaesthesia were strictly standardized by protocol.&#xD;
      All patients were premedicated with oral diazepam 5mg and diclofenac 100mg 60min before&#xD;
      operation. After arrival in the operating theater peripheral vein 18 or 20G catheter was&#xD;
      inserted, infusion therapy were started with crystalloid 5-7ml/kg/hour. Standard monitoring&#xD;
      was used, including noninvasive arterial blood pressure (BP), electrocardiography (ECG),&#xD;
      heart rate, peripheral oxygenation. Circulatory changes were recorded impedance device. 2&#xD;
      single-neck sensors connected vertically on both sides of the neck just below the ears lobe.&#xD;
      Another pair of sensors attached on both sides of the chest processus xiphoid axillary line&#xD;
      level. Thorax allows a variable electrical current, it travels through the lowest resistance&#xD;
      (blood-filled aorta) and resistance is measured. For each heart contraction during changes in&#xD;
      blood volume and velocity. Accordingly, replacing the resistors obtained by impedance&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haemodynamic variables were recorded in patients in the use of impedance cardiograph:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. arrives in the operating room;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. seating on the operating table;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. following the puncture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 10 min after spinal puncture;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. was laid in lithotomy or jack knife position;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. in the beginning and the end of the operation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. patient was placed in the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each measurement was monitoring and recorded the following data( ar findings):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac output (CO);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic vascular resistance (SVR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systolic index (SI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac index (CI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceleration index (ACI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart rate (HR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP) and mean (MAP) blood pressure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral oxygenation (SpO2); Patients were placed in the sitting position on the slab&#xD;
           (operating table) back to the doctor. Dural puncture was made at L3-L4 or L4-L5 with 27G&#xD;
           Tamanho spinal needle ( BBraun, Germany) by medial punction in aseptic condition, before&#xD;
           the punction was injected lidocaine 1% subcutaneous. 0.5% 4mg of heavy bupivacaine and&#xD;
           0.01% 10µg fentanyl were injected over 2 minutes after free flow of cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
           was obtained. After sitting for 10 minutes ( sensory block was checked by the dermatomes&#xD;
           with the methods of cold sensitivity) patients were asked to lie in the position wich&#xD;
           operation will be done (lithotomy or jack knife position).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 20 min. surgery was started. When anaesthesia was imperfect, 25-100µg of fentanyl was&#xD;
      given IV. General anaesthesia will be give in case of failure . These cases will be value&#xD;
      like a failure, patients will be exclude from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically significant hypotension will be define as a mean arterial blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate decrease of 20% below baseline values. Systolic arterial blood pressure will reduce to&#xD;
      90mmHG limit, intravenous ephedrine 5-10 mg will be injected. If heart rate will reduce to 45&#xD;
      bpm, bradycardia will be treated with atropine 0,5 mg IV.&#xD;
