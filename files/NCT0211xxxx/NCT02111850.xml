  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with&#xD;
      metastatic cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in&#xD;
      the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying these specific cells with a type of&#xD;
      virus (retrovirus) to attack only the tumor cells, and then giving the cells back to the&#xD;
      patient. This type of therapy is called gene transfer. In this protocol, we are modifying the&#xD;
      patient s white blood cells with a retrovirus that has the gene for anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402&#xD;
      incorporated in the retrovirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe number of these cells to infuse and to see&#xD;
      if these particular tumor-fighting cells (anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells) cause tumors to&#xD;
      shrink and to be certain the treatment is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults age 18-70 with metastatic cancer expressing the MAGE-A3 molecule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and&#xD;
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as&#xD;
           needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will&#xD;
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402&#xD;
           cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure, which removes only the white blood cells&#xD;
           from the patient.}&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown, the patients will be admitted to the hospital&#xD;
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 cells and aldesleukin.&#xD;
           They will stay in the hospital for approximately 4 weeks for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side&#xD;
           effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every&#xD;
           6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and $ &lt;= chains of a T&#xD;
           cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the DP0401/0402 restricted MAGE-A3 tumor antigen,&#xD;
           which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In co-cultures with HLA-DP0401/0402 and MAGE-A3 double positive tumors, the anti-&#xD;
           MAGE-A3- DP0401/0402 restricted (anti-MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR transduced T cells secreted&#xD;
           significant amounts of IFN-y with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine a safe dose of the administration of autologous CD4 cells transduced with an&#xD;
           anti- MAGE-A3-DP0401/0402 restricted (MAGE-A3-DP4) TCR and aldesleukin to patients&#xD;
           following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with&#xD;
           metastatic cancer expressing MAGE-A3-DP4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are HLA-DP0401/0402 positive and 18 years of age or older must have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic cancer whose tumors express the MAGE-A3-DP4 antigen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred following at least one&#xD;
           first line treatment for metastatic disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may not have:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be enriched for CD4 cells and transduced with the&#xD;
           retroviral vector supernatant encoding the anti-MAGE-A3-DP4 TCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will begin in a standard phase 1 dose escalation. After the MTD cell dose has&#xD;
           been determined, patients will be enrolled into the phase 2 portion of the trial at the&#xD;
           MTD established during the phase 1 portion of the study. In the phase 2 portion,&#xD;
           patients will be entered into two cohorts: cohort 1 will include patients with&#xD;
           metastatic melanoma; cohort 2 will include patients with renal cancer and other types of&#xD;
           metastatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen&#xD;
           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex&#xD;
           vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene-transduced PBMC plus IV aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor response every 1-6 months until off&#xD;
           study criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For each of the 2 strata evaluated in the phase 2 portion, the study will be conducted&#xD;
           using a phase 2 optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
           For each of these two arms of the trial, if 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a&#xD;
           clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the&#xD;
           first 21 evaluable patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will&#xD;
           continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that stratum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For both strata, the objective will be to determine if the treatment regimen is able to&#xD;
           be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a&#xD;
           modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Metastatic or locally advanced refractory/recurrent cancer that expresses MAGE-A3 as&#xD;
             assessed by one of the following methods: RT-PCR on tumor tissue defined as 30,000&#xD;
             copies of MAGE-A3 per 10^6 GAPDH copies, or by immunohistochemistry of resected tissue&#xD;
             defined as 10% or greater of tumor cells being 2-3+ for MAGE-A3, or serum antibody&#xD;
             reactive with MAGE-A3. Metastatic cancer diagnosis will be confirmed by the Laboratory&#xD;
             of Pathology at the NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have previously received prior first line standard therapy (or effective&#xD;
             salvage chemotherapy regimens) for their disease, if known to be effective for that&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients must be HLA-DP4 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and&#xD;

             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to&#xD;
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in&#xD;
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV&#xD;
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to&#xD;
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.&#xD;
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the&#xD;

             progressing disease after prior treatment. Note: Patients who have previously received&#xD;
             ipilimumab and have documented GI toxicity must have a normal colonoscopy with normal&#xD;
             colonic biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subjects must be co-enrolled in protocol 03-C-0277.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the&#xD;
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.&#xD;
