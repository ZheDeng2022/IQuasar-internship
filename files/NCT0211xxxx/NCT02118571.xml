  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to develop items for a patient-reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      measure to assess the patient's perspective and subjective experience of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      associated with schizophrenia (CIAS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) has been shown to be the strongest&#xD;
      predictor of functional impairment among people with schizophrenia because it is associated&#xD;
      with poor response to psychosocial interventions, employment status, and social functioning.&#xD;
      Because the subjective experience of CIAS is likely to be associated with patient burden,&#xD;
      distress, and motivation for treatment, it is important that this experience be assessed in a&#xD;
      reliable and valid manner and from the perspective of the patient's self report. No existing&#xD;
      instrument to assess CIAS has been developed with patient input directly about their&#xD;
      qualitative experience of impaired cognition during the item generation stage, in accordance&#xD;
      with FDA guidance for patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.&#xD;

             record within 2 years prior to the study) with the following clinical features:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a)Clinically stable and in the residual (non-acute) phase of their illness for at&#xD;
