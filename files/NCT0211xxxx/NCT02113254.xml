  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Age Macular Degeneration (AMD) is the first cause of blindness in industrialized&#xD;
      countries. The macular pigment (lutein and zeaxanthin) could play an important role in the&#xD;
      arisen of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with strong concentration in macular&#xD;
      pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment. This could, in the future,&#xD;
      represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective of this study is to detect&#xD;
      an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption of this corn at healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The age macular degeneration represents the first cause of blindness in industrialized&#xD;
      countries if it is not treated. In France, the AMD affects 600 000 persons and this figure&#xD;
      should continue to increase, notably because of the increase of the life expectancy. The&#xD;
      macula is responsible of the fine vision, the vision of colours and the perception of&#xD;
      contrasts. The macular pigment is present only at the level of the macular area. This pigment&#xD;
      is composed of three carotenoids: lutein, zeaxanthin, meso-zeaxanthin. The first two&#xD;
      compounds are of strictly food origin and are not produced in an endogenous way. A change of&#xD;
      the macular pigment density and/or the quality of the macular pigment is suspected to play a&#xD;
      role in the appearance and the evolution of the AMD. The food supplementation by corn with&#xD;
      strong concentration in macular pigment could increase the density of the macular pigment.&#xD;
      This could, in the future, represent a strategy of prevention of the AMD. The main objective&#xD;
      of this study is to detect an increase of the macular pigment density after the consumption&#xD;
      of this corn at healthy volunteers. The treatment will consist in a daily consumption of a&#xD;
      box of 125g of corn with strong zeaxanthin content during 10 weeks. This corresponds to a&#xD;
      daily contribution of at least 1,2 mg of lutein and 2,2 mg de zeaxanthin. After the inclusion&#xD;
      visit, the subject will be seen 5 times (after 3, 6, 8, 10, 14 weeks of treatment). In all&#xD;
      these visits, measures of the macular pigment will be realized. A blood sample will be&#xD;
      realized at the inclusion visit and during the visit at 6 and 10 weeks.&#xD;
