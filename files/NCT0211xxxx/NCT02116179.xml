      The purpose of the study are the following: 1) Pilot test and conduct baseline and 3 month&#xD;
      follow up assessments to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the DVD-based HIV/HCV&#xD;
      intervention by randomly assigning 210 Latino corrections-involved, outpatient abuse&#xD;
      treatment clients to either the experimental intervention or to a wait list control group;&#xD;
      and 2) to evaluate both participant and interventionist acceptability of this novel DVD-based&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They study hypothesis are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. participants in the intervention condition will report greater reductions in sexual risk&#xD;
           behaviors (e.g., unprotected sexual contact) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared&#xD;
           to the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. participants will report greater reductions in drug risk behaviors (e.g., sharing&#xD;
           injection equipment, drug use during sex) from baseline to 3 month follow-up compared to&#xD;
           the control group;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. participants who report more HIV prevention information, motivation, and behavioral&#xD;
           skills will report fewer sexual risk behaviors.&#xD;

      The specific aims for Stage1b are: (1) to pilot test and evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      DVD-based HIV intervention by recruiting 210 Latino offenders mandated to substance abuse&#xD;
      treatment; and (2) to evaluate both participant and interventionist acceptability of this&#xD;
      novel DVD intervention. Participants will be recruited from a local community agency that&#xD;
      provides outpatient substance abuse treatment services for court-mandated individuals.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be self-identified Latino/Hispanic, between the ages of 18 and 49,&#xD;
      heterosexual, and all participants will be involved with the criminal justice system.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into either an intervention or a wait-list control condition.&#xD;
      The intervention consists of one DVD-based group session facilitated by an interventionist.&#xD;
      Sexual risk, drug use, mental health, and background information will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, and again at 3 months after the intervention session. At the end of the&#xD;
      intervention session, each participant will complete an acceptability questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      interventionist will complete a checklist to assess treatment fidelity. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that both sexual risk and drug use behaviors will decrease between baseline and follow-up for&#xD;
      the intervention group compared to the control group. The project is innovative because it&#xD;
      will develop a DVD-based, culturally-appropriate and language specific, HIV/Hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      prevention intervention for Latino offenders. The proposed research is significant, because&#xD;
      it is expected to produce a brief HIV/Hepatitis C virus intervention that can be implemented&#xD;
      within the criminal justice system and targets a high risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that participants in the intervention condition will report significant&#xD;
      reductions in sexual risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sexual contact) and drug risk&#xD;
      behaviors (e.g. sharing injection equipment, drug use while having sex) from baseline to 3 -&#xD;
      month follow-up when compared to control group. The main analysis here is to compare the&#xD;
      proportion (or mean) of primary outcomes for those measured at 3-month (post-intervention) to&#xD;
      those measured at baseline (pre-intervention) between the intervention and control group. The&#xD;
      null is that there will be no differences, and alternative hypotheses would be that the&#xD;
      intervention group will report more of a reduction in risk behaviors than control group.&#xD;
      These hypotheses can be tested by either repeated-measures ANCOVA or regression with the&#xD;
      robust cluster estimator obtained after controlling for intervention condition.&#xD;
