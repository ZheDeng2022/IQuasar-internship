  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apoptosis is an evolutionary form of physiological cell death. Studies suggest that apoptosis&#xD;
      is involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases. Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF)&#xD;
      have an important role in the periodontal immune response. It is believed that HGF can be&#xD;
      diminished and/or eliminated by means of apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking is one of the most common risk factor of periodontal disease. Studies indicated that&#xD;
      smoking can increase the risk of periodontitis by enhancing the apoptosis of gingival&#xD;
      fibroblast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine and to investigate apoptosis of HGF in gingival&#xD;
      biopsies collected from smokers and non smokers who are diagnosed with chronic periodontitis&#xD;
      or aggressive periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty subjects will be invited to participate in this study. Patients will be allocated into&#xD;
      four groups (20 patients each). Gingival biopsies will be obtained from the base of papillae&#xD;
      during surgical treatment (open flap curettage) and will be examined by Immuno-histochemical&#xD;
      analysis. Immune-staining will be done using p53 monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms responsible for gingival tissue damage are poorly understood, and both&#xD;
      immune-mediated reactions and direct cytopathic effects of bacteria maybe involved. Based on&#xD;
      direct effect of bacteria in cell cultures, it has been suggested that apoptosis might play&#xD;
      an important role in periodontitis (Chen 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is normal physiologic process that contributes to&#xD;
      maintaining tissue homeostasis. The process of apoptosis can be modulated by various stimuli&#xD;
      hormones, cytokines, growth factors, infections and immune-responses (Renehan et al. 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other factors, the products of two genes that encode protein p53 and Bcl-2 have been&#xD;
      shown to play fundamental regulatory role in apoptosis. P53 is the protein product of&#xD;
      tumor-suppressor gene, and expression of P53 can induce apoptosis. This protein is also&#xD;
      implicated in the regulation of tissue dynamics, and is specifically thought to induce&#xD;
      apoptosis in terminally differentiated cells, including inflammatory cells (Bulut et&#xD;
      al.2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fibroblast is a type of cell that synthesizes the extracellular and collagen in connective&#xD;
      tissue. It plays a critical role in wound healing. Fibroblasts are the most common cells in&#xD;
      connective tissue. The main function of fibroblasts is to maintain the structural integrity&#xD;
      of connective tissue by continuously secreting precursors of extracellular matrix. it was&#xD;
      reported that apoptosis levels increased in gingivitis and periodontitis (Jarenberg et al.&#xD;
      2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for many diseases, and recent evidence indicates that&#xD;
      smoking adversely influences periodontal health. A number of epidemiologic studies have shown&#xD;
      strong association between smoking and prevalence and severity of periodontitis (Bostrom et&#xD;
      al. 1998). Whereas, the pathogenesis of periodontitis in smokers is poorly understood there&#xD;
      are data suggesting that smoking effects on the periodontal tissues include defects in&#xD;
      neutrophil function, impaired serum antibody responses to periodontal pathogens, and&#xD;
      potentially diminished gingival fibroblast function (Shivanaikar et al. 2001). Smokers are&#xD;
      considered a high-risk group for periodontitis, and smoking history is a useful clinical&#xD;
      predictor of future disease activity (Hanokia et al. 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigation of the effects of smoking on fibroblasts apoptosis in smokers with&#xD;
           periodontitis compared to non-smokers with periodontitis using immuno-histochemical&#xD;
           methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of apoptosis levels of gingival fibroblasts between chronic and aggressive&#xD;
           periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 subjects will be invited to participate in this study from the patients&#xD;
      referred to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Damascus.&#xD;
      The study will be approved by a specific Review Board. Subjects will be recruited according&#xD;
      to specific inclusion criteria after completion of medical and dental history questionnaires.&#xD;
      Patients will sign a consent form after being advised about the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of patients will be made according of the criteria approved by the 1999&#xD;
      international world workshop for a classification system of periodontal diseases and&#xD;
      conditions (Armitage 1999) using five clinical parameters and full mouth or panoramic&#xD;
      radiographs for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be allocated into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking Chronic Periodontitis group (ChP-S): comprise 20 patients who are smokers and&#xD;
           aged &gt; 45 years and have presence of ≥2 non-adjacent sites per quadrant that were not&#xD;
           first molars or incisors, with probing depth (PD) ≥5 mm, which bleed on gentle probing.&#xD;
           The demonstrated radiographic bone loss ≥30% of the root length, patient with poor oral&#xD;
           hygiene, the amount of accumulated plaque commensurate with the amount of clinical&#xD;
           attachment level (CAL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-smoking Chronic periodontitis group (ChP-NS): comprise 20 age-sex matched patients&#xD;
           who are non-smokers and have chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking Aggressive Periodontitis group (AgP-S): comprise 20 patients who are smokers and&#xD;
           aged &lt; 35 years and diagnosed with rapid attachment loss with periodontal pocket depth&#xD;
           (PD) &gt; 4 mm around at least three teeth other than the first molars and incisors. Rapid&#xD;
           bone destruction (&gt;50%bone loss at diseased sites). Weak relationship between dental&#xD;
           plaque and the severity of gingival inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-smoking Aggressive periodontitis group (AgP-NS): comprise 20 age- and sex matched&#xD;
           patients who are non-smokers and have aggressive periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard periodontal probe will be used for recording periodontal indices at six sites per&#xD;
      tooth. The examined clinical parameters include bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI),&#xD;
      clinical attachment loss (CAL) and periodontal pocket depth (PPD) and gingival index (GI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy collection and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The biopsy samples will be obtained from patients during surgical treatment (open flap&#xD;
           curettage) where biopsy is taken from the base area of papilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will be placed in 10% formalin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The samples will be then installed in paraffin wax.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples will be analyzed in the by means of p53 monoclonal mouse anti-human antibody.&#xD;
