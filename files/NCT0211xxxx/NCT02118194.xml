  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine if non-ambulatory persons with spinal cord&#xD;
      injury (SCI) who have already participated in at least 20 sessions of ReWalk training can be&#xD;
      further trained to achieve more advanced skills for use in the home or work place&#xD;
      environments and outdoor community mobility skills in the ReWalk exoskeleton.&#xD;

      Evaluation criteria will consist of the level of assistance, number of sessions and time to&#xD;
      perform each of the tasks. Because some of these tasks have never been performed in an&#xD;
      exoskeleton there is no standardized information to set a goal. As such, level of assistance&#xD;
      and time to complete those tasks will be recorded in each participant for a descriptive&#xD;
      analysis. Other tests, such as the six-minute walk test (6mWT), 10 meter walk test (10mWT)&#xD;
      and timed up and go (TUG) have a range of specific timed values that have been measured in&#xD;
      the exoskeleton by our investigators and others. These exoskeletal-assisted walking tests&#xD;
      have standardized criteria on which the participants will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend three to four, one to two-hour sessions per week for a total of 20&#xD;
      sessions in six weeks. Each session will consist of exoskeletal-assisted skill practice&#xD;
      during standing and walking mobility training. In order to determine the number of session to&#xD;
      learn the tasks, measurements will be performed one time weekly for the task-specific skills&#xD;
      and walking tests and again at the end of 20 sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will tested in the exoskeleton for ability to perform certain task-specific&#xD;
      indoor and outdoor mobility skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced indoor skills include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Performance on a an indoor six-minute walk test (6minWT) and ten meter walk test (10mWT)&#xD;
           on a smooth floor and on carpet;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Timed up and go test (TUG) performance indoors on a smooth floor and on carpet;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Home/work skills include: manipulating items on a counter top, retrieving an item from&#xD;
           an overhead cabinet, and/or retrieving an object from a refrigerator;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Door navigation skills include: a push button door, revolving door and/or a non-powered&#xD;
           door;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Elevator Skills include: pressing the call button outside an elevator, navigate the&#xD;
           elevator doors, pressing the floor selection buttons in an elevator, and/or exiting the&#xD;
           elevator doors; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Exoskeletal-assisted stair ascent and descent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced outdoor skills include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 10 mWT and 6minWT performance outdoors on concrete, asphalt, uneven surfaces, and grass.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exoskeletal-assisted walking on incline slopes (assessed as time to navigate a specified&#xD;
           distance) for: up slight slope, down slight slope, navigate up curb cut-out, and/or&#xD;
           navigate down curb cut-out.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ability to navigate up and/or down a curb (assessed as level of assistance required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: Additional skills may be tested and recorded as per each individual's ability and&#xD;
      competency.&#xD;
