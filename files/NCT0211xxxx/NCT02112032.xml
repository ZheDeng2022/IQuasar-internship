    <textblock>
      This study is to test how safe it is to give the combination of PEG IFN-α2b (SYLATRON) and&#xD;
      MK-3475, an investigational drug, to patients with advanced melanoma. Its effectiveness&#xD;
      against melanoma will also be evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and dose-seeking study of combination MK-3475 and peginterferon alfa-2b for&#xD;
      adult patients (≥18) with advanced melanoma. A total of 32 patients will be included.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo screening evaluations to determine eligibility within 28 days (4 weeks)&#xD;
      of the first dose. Each 21 day dosing period will constitute a cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginterferon alfa-2b is given subcutaneously, weekly according to the regimen below.&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2b (Sylatron) is FDA-approved for the adjuvant treatment of patients with&#xD;
      melanoma with microscopic or gross nodal involvement within 84 days of definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection including complete lymphadenectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK-3475 is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor,&#xD;
      thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. MK-3475 has an acceptable preclinical&#xD;
      safety profile and is being advanced for clinical development as an immunotherapy for&#xD;
      advanced malignancies. In this protocol, MK-3475 is being evaluated at 2 mg/kg intravenously&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for 2 years in combination with peginterferon alfa-2b at 1 µg/kg/week, 2&#xD;
      µg/kg/week, or 3 µg/kg/week by subcutaneous injection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
             unresectable stage III or IV melanoma. Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal&#xD;
             melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may be previously untreated or have received up to 3 prior systemic therapies&#xD;
             for metastatic disease. Prior radiation therapy (any number) and interferon use in the&#xD;
             adjuvant or metastatic disease settings is permitted (in this trial interferon is&#xD;
             mainly used to enhance or initiate immune responses to MK-3475). Vaccine therapy will&#xD;
             not be counted as systemic therapy. All prior therapies must have been discontinued&#xD;
             for at least 4 weeks. A 2 week washout for kinase inhibitors is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can be either ipilimumab naïve or refractory to ipilimumab, defined as&#xD;
             received at least two doses of ipilimumab and documented disease progression. Patients&#xD;
             who were re-treated with ipilimumab and patients who were on maintenance ipilimumab&#xD;
             will be allowed to enter the trial as long as there is documented PD. Progressive&#xD;
             disease will be defined as increase in tumor burden &gt; 25% relative to nadir (minimum&#xD;
             recorded tumor burden) which is confirmed by repeat assessment no less than four weeks&#xD;
             from the date of the first documented PD. Once PD is confirmed, initial date of PD&#xD;
             documentation will be considered as the date of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Full resolution of ipilimumab related AEs to baseline (including irAEs) off of steroid&#xD;
             treatment (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for irAEs for at least two weeks&#xD;
             prior to first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No history of severe irAEs from ipilimumab of CTCAE Grade 4 requiring steroid&#xD;
                  treatment; no history of CTCAE Grade 3 requiring steroid treatment (&gt; 10mg/day&#xD;
                  prednisone or equivalent dose) for &gt; 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Minimum of four weeks (wash out period) from the last dose of ipilimumab.&#xD;

             available tumor tissue for tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have measurable disease as per RECIST version 1.1. At least 1 of the&#xD;
             tumor sites must be amenable to biopsy and this may not be the site of disease used to&#xD;
             measure antitumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have adequate organ function as indicated by the following laboratory&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver&#xD;
                  metastases&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless&#xD;
                  the patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN unless the patient is&#xD;

             consent/assent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test&#xD;
             is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients enrolled in the study, who are not free from menses for &gt; 2 years,&#xD;
             post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized, must be willing to use&#xD;
             either 2 adequate barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method of&#xD;
             contraception to prevent pregnancy, or to abstain from heterosexual activity&#xD;
             throughout the study, starting with the first dose of study drug at visit 1 through&#xD;
             120 days after the last dose of study drug. Approved contraceptive methods include for&#xD;
             example: intra-uterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, cervical cap with&#xD;
             spermicide, male condoms, or female condom with spermicide. Spermicides alone are not&#xD;
             an acceptable method of contraception. Male patients must agree to use an adequate&#xD;
             method of contraception starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             four weeks prior to the first dose of study drug, or who has not recovered to CTCAE&#xD;
             Grade 1 or better from the AEs due to cancer therapeutics administered more than four&#xD;
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion&#xD;
             and may qualify for the study.&#xD;

        toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
