      The objective of this study was to determine (a) whether patients anesthetized with&#xD;
      intravenous propofol have less pain compared with sevofluorane for paediatric inguinal hernia&#xD;
      and undescended testis operations and (b) whether intravenous propofol anesthesia has better&#xD;
      quality of recovery compared with sevofluorane anesthesia in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period after paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations.&#xD;

      DIFFERENT INDUCTION TECHNIQUES ON AGITATION AND POSTOPERATIVE PAIN IN CHILDREN AFTER INGUINAL&#xD;
      HERNIA AND CRYPTORCHIDISM Inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism are probably the most common&#xD;
      operations in the paediatric age group. Inguinal hernia is the most common indication for&#xD;
      surgery in the paediatric age group and the incidence of inguinal hernia in those younger&#xD;
      than 18 years old varies from 0.8 to 4.4% (1). Cryptorchidism is the most common genital&#xD;
      anomaly in boys and incidence is 3.5% of all full- term infants (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances in surgical techniques and anesthesia management most of the children can be&#xD;
      discharged on the day after these kind of operations (3). Most studies of analgesia in&#xD;
      pediatric day case surgery have focused on the postoperative pain risk at night, because it&#xD;
      becomes the great problem for the parent. Because half of children experience clinically&#xD;
      significant pain after discharge according to pain studies done for children (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volatile anesthetics can activate peripheral neurons that play important role on pain&#xD;
      perception in postoperative period (3). Zhang et al reported that volatile anesthetics have&#xD;
      been demonstrated to have hyperalgesic effects (5). In addition the other studies reported&#xD;
      that volatile anesthetic induced pain enhancement was mediated by modulation of central&#xD;
      adrenergic and cholinergic transmission (6)(7). Also modulation of 5-Hidroxytriptamine3&#xD;
      receptor-mediated currents by volatile anesthetics may also play a role in their&#xD;
      pronociceptin effect (8)(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recovery profile studies comparing IV propofol anesthesia with inhaled anesthetics have&#xD;
      shown a better postoperative analgesia with propofol (10)(11). A recent study Tan et al shown&#xD;
      that the patients anesthetized with intravenous propofol anesthesia for surgery had less pain&#xD;
      than patients anesthetized with sevofluorane (12). A different study by Cheng et al&#xD;
      investigating the postoperative analgesic effects of nicotine nasal spray coincidentally&#xD;
      found that patients anesthetized with propofol had less postoperative pain than patients&#xD;
      anesthetized with isofluorane over the postoperative 24 hours (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal studies suggested that propofol suppressed nociceptive behavior. Propofol known to&#xD;
      have nociceptive effects by activating transient receptor potential ion channel (14)(15) has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to have analgesic and antihyperalgesic properties at sedative doses in a&#xD;
      human pain model (16) In normal rat model, propofol has direct actions on the dorsal horn&#xD;
      neurons of the spinal cord, which played an important role in the processing of sensory&#xD;
      information (17) In a rat formalin model, propofol produced antinociceptive effect in a&#xD;
      dose-dependent manner (18). Moreover, subhypnotic doses of propofol has been demonstrated to&#xD;
      delay and weaken remifentanil induced post-infusion hyperalgesia in human (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study was to determine (a) whether patients anesthetized with&#xD;
      intravenous propofol have less pain compared with sevofluorane for paediatric inguinal hernia&#xD;
      and undescended testis operations and (b) whether intravenous propofol anesthesia has better&#xD;
      quality of recovery compared with sevofluorane anesthesia in the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period after paediatric inguinal hernia and undescended testis operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL METHODS After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and written informed&#xD;
      consent, 100 American Society of Anaesthesiologists I-II children, aged between 2 and 12&#xD;
      years undergoing elective surgery for inguinal hernia repair and undescended testis were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. The study used a double-blind methodology with random allocation to&#xD;
      the two groups by a computer-generated list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients' parents will be instructed on the use of the Wong-Baker Faces Pain scales for&#xD;
      pain assessment before the induction of anesthesia. Both of the hands will be applied&#xD;
      Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics Cream (Lidocaine Hydrochloric acid, prilocaine, Astra&#xD;
      Zeneca, Istanbul, Turkey) 60 minutes before the operations by the nurse. All the children&#xD;
      were premedicated with midazolam hydrochloride 0.6 mg/kg orally; maximum 30 min prior to the&#xD;
      surgery and we made sure that the drug was given under the tongue to avoid first liver&#xD;
      passage. Patients will be monitored in the operating room. Heart rate (HR) mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure (MAP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were recorded. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized into 2 groups using a computer-generated random number table: the first group will&#xD;
      be inducted with iv propofol (Group P) and after sevofluorane inhalation will continue, the&#xD;
      second group (Group S) will be inducted and continued with sevofluorane. Anesthesia was&#xD;
      maintained with sevofluorane titrated to a value of 40 bispectrial index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.Grup 1: Sevofluorane 8% mask induction and continue with 2% sevofluorane I.Grup 2: Propofol&#xD;
      2.5mg/kg in induction and continue with 2% sevofluorane Fluid therapy was standardized during&#xD;
      and after surgery. During surgery, children received lactated Ringer's solution 6 ml/ kg/ h&#xD;
      whereas 5% dextrose with electrolytes was given at a rate of 4 ml/ kg/ h in the postoperative&#xD;
      period. Induction of anesthesia is performed using oxygen (FiO2 0.33), nitrous oxide (FiO2&#xD;
      0.66), and sevofluorane (increasing concentrations up to 8%) administered by mask. After&#xD;
      sevofluorane induction intravenous cannula will be inserted. The other group propofol&#xD;
      2.5mg/kg in induction and continue with 2% sevoflorane. After 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium and 1&#xD;
      mcg/kg fentanyl will be applied before intubation. 5 minutes after induction heart rate,&#xD;
      tension arterial, saturation will be recorded. Both of the groups will be maintained with 2%&#xD;
      sevofluorane and 40% nitrous oxide. All the operations will be done with the same technique&#xD;
      by the same surgeon. After spontaneous breathing , the reverse will be applied as 0.03 mg/kg&#xD;
      neostigmine ve 0.01 mg/kg atropine intravenous. After reversal of airway reflexes, the&#xD;
      patients will be extubated. After extubation the patients will be in postanesthesia recovery&#xD;
      room. Operation time, anesthesia time will be recorded. First eye opening, first verbal&#xD;
      command follow, staying time in PACU, first analgesic time, ambulation time, first oral&#xD;
      intake time, extermination time will be recorded according to the anesthesia completion time.&#xD;
      Completion of the surgery, 20 mg/kg rectal paracetamol will be applied as suppository form.&#xD;
      However If VAS≥3 then 20 mg/kg paracetamol will be applied in intravenous form. Heart rate,&#xD;
      tension arterial, saturation, respiratory rate, agitation scale, Wong-Baker Faces Pain rating&#xD;
      scale for pain will be assessed and recorded. If agitation score≥4 then 1mcg/kg fentanyl will&#xD;
      be applied intravenously. Wong-Baker Faces Pain rating scale will be taught to all parents&#xD;
      and how to sign according to shapes of the faces of all children (No pain-smiling face to&#xD;
      most pain-crying face). Transition from PACU to surgical ward was considered safe when&#xD;
      patient had achieved a Modified Aldrete Score 9 for at least 10 min, and SpO2 95% with oxygen&#xD;
      2 l/min or 92% without oxygen, signified recovery of physical, mental, and physiological&#xD;
      function to near preanesthetic levels. Furthermore, 10-point analogue scales were used to&#xD;
      measure parents' satisfaction with their child's overall anaesthetic and surgical care and&#xD;
      satisfaction with their participation in decisionmaking (0 . not at all satisfied, 10 .&#xD;
      extremely satisfied). All adverse events (bronchospasm, laryngospasm, desaturation,&#xD;
      hypotension, bleeding, reoperation) will be recorded for postoperative 0h(PACU), 10 min, 20&#xD;
      min, 30 min, 40 min, 50 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 6h, 12h, 24h.&#xD;
