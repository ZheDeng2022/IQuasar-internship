    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not there is an effect of pumpkin seed&#xD;
      oil supplementation, 2 grams per day, on blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) in&#xD;
      premenopausal women.&#xD;

      The research study will be conducted over a 12-week period. Overall, each participant will&#xD;
      meet with the researcher three times. During the first visit, after the participant has&#xD;
      signed the consent form, their blood pressure will be taken with a digital blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor. If her systolic blood pressure is greater than 140 mmHg or her diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure is greater than 90 mmHg, she will not be eligible to take part in this study. If the&#xD;
      participant is able to take part in this study, she will be given a code number to protect&#xD;
      confidentiality and randomly assigned to one of two groups, Group I or Group II. The&#xD;
      participant will then be asked to state their age, ethnicity, menopausal status, and whether&#xD;
      or not they are taking oral contraceptives. Next, height and weight will be taken with an&#xD;
      instrument called a Health-O-Meter. Body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat will be&#xD;
      calculated using an instrument called a Body Composition Analyzer. After all measurements are&#xD;
      taken, participants will be given instructions on how to keep a 3-day diet and supplement&#xD;
      diary. A booklet will be provided to help them record their diet for two nonconsecutive week&#xD;
      days and one weekend day. The 3-day diet and supplement diary is to be completed during the&#xD;
      week between the first and second session with the researcher. During this session the&#xD;
      participant will be asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire to help the researcher&#xD;
      asses the phytoestrogen content of her diet. At the end of the first session, the researcher&#xD;
      will schedule a second session with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second session will take place one week after the first session. During the second&#xD;
      session, measurements taken will be height, weight, BMI, percent body fat, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. Participants will be asked to return the 3-day diet and supplement diary to the&#xD;
      researcher. The researcher will review the diary and ask questions to clarify foods recorded.&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked to complete a physical activity questionnaire. Next,&#xD;
      supplements will be distributed. The participants will not have knowledge of which group they&#xD;
      are assigned to. Group I will receive 168 capsules, each capsule containing 1 gram of wheat&#xD;
      germ oil, in two pill bottles. One bottle will contain 100 capsules; the second bottle will&#xD;
      contain 68 capsules. Group II will receive 168 capsules, each capsule containing 1 gram of&#xD;
      pumpkin seed oil, in two pill bottles. One bottle will contain 100 capsules; the second&#xD;
      bottle will contain 68 capsules. Participants will be instructed to take 2 capsules per day,&#xD;
      every day for 12 weeks. Two capsules per day are equal to approximately a Â½ teaspoon or 18&#xD;
      kilocalories. It does not matter if they choose to take each capsule at the same time or at&#xD;
      different times during the day. To help remind participants to take their supplements each&#xD;
      day, they will receive a 7 day pill organizer and a daily check list. At this session,&#xD;
      participants will receive a second 3-day diet and supplement diary that is to be completed&#xD;
      one week before the final session. At the end of the second session, the researcher will&#xD;
      schedule the final session with the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third and final session will take place 12 weeks after the initial session. Measurements&#xD;
      taken during the final session will be height, weight, BMI, percent body fat, and blood&#xD;
      pressure. The participant will be asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire identical&#xD;
      the questionnaire filled out during the first session with the researcher. Participant will&#xD;
      be asked to return their 3-day diet and supplement diary, daily check list, pill organizer, 2&#xD;
      pill bottles, and any unused supplements. After completion of the study the participant will&#xD;
      receive a $20 Target gift card at this session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A potential risk of this study includes loss of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be&#xD;
      maintained by the use of code numbers rather than names on data containing documents. Digital&#xD;
      data analyses will be done using only code numbers and not identifiable data. Data recorded&#xD;
      on paper containing identifiable and non-identifiable participant information (consent forms,&#xD;
      data collection forms, 3-day diet and supplement diaries, physical activity questionnaires,&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaires, and participant daily checklists) will be kept in a locked&#xD;
      cabinet in Room 10132B in the Texas Woman's University, Houston Office of Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another potential risk of this study may be that the participant's normal schedule is&#xD;
      disrupted by coming to the Texas Woman's University, Houston campus. To minimize this risk,&#xD;
      sessions will be scheduled with the researcher in advance Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m.&#xD;
      to 5 p.m. to accommodate the participant's schedule.&#xD;
