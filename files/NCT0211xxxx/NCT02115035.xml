      The objective is to evaluate the overall response rate of Vermurafenib when administered&#xD;
      orally to patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the objective response rates of orally administered&#xD;
      Vermurafenib for patients with double refractory multiple myeloma. Double refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma is myeloma that has become refractory to two chemotherapeutic agents such as&#xD;
      bortexomib and lenalidomide. The study will be conducted in two stages with an interim data&#xD;
      analysis performed after enrollment of the initial 21 subjects to determine whether the study&#xD;
      will enroll an additional 20 subjects.&#xD;
