    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. The first part of the study looked at the absorption of&#xD;
      three different polyphenol preparations into the blood, the variability of their absorption&#xD;
      and whether their absorption could be enhanced by mixing with pollen shells. For this purpose&#xD;
      12 healthy volunteers were recruited. All participants received all the 3 supplements with&#xD;
      and without mixing with pollen shells so they had a total of 3 tests. For each test six blood&#xD;
      samples were taken over an 8 hour period. Urine samples were also collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oligopin was selected from the first study. The second part of study aims to look at the&#xD;
      effects of Oligopin on endothelial function by assessing vascular tone and function in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers using a non-invasive, direct measurement of vasodilatory capacity&#xD;
      (EndoPAT). Nitrate and nitrite measurements, as well as blood pressure measurements, will&#xD;
      also be recorded to provide a clear clinical assessment of the effects of this preparation&#xD;
      (if any) upon vascular function. The effects of Oligopin will be compared to a placebo&#xD;
      (methylcellulose-filled capsules) to allow a robust assessment of any clinical effects. A&#xD;
      total of 24 healthy volunteers will be recruited for this study.&#xD;

      three different polyphenol preparations into the blood, the variability of their absorption&#xD;
      and whether their absorption could be enhanced by mixing with pollen shells (pollen shells&#xD;
      have been shown to enhance lipid molecule absorption). For this purpose 12 healthy volunteers&#xD;
