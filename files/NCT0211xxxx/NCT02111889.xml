    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that response to kinase inhibitors is dependent on achieving&#xD;
      pharmacological active drug levels in tumor tissue and that quantitative PET imaging can&#xD;
      predict kinase inhibitors tumor concentrations. The ultimate aim is to develop a quantitative&#xD;
      PET based imaging tool to differentiate between patients who will respond to therapy with&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether tumor concentrations of kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors at pharmacological active doses can be predicted from PET studies using tracer&#xD;
      amounts (microdosing) of corresponding radiolabeled kinase inhibitors. This objective&#xD;
      includes the development and validation of pharmacokinetic models for radiolabeled kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors as well as validation of the microdosing concept for kinase inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Multiple agents targeting specific signaling proteins important for tumor growth&#xD;
      and angiogenesis, including (tyrosine) kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, have been&#xD;
      developed and have reached clinical approval. In general, however, these targeted agents&#xD;
      induce a response only in a subgroup of cancer patients, while all are exposed to potential&#xD;
      toxic therapies. Prior to treatment, it is unknown which patients will respond and why kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors are only effective in some, but not all, patients. Clearly, there is a need for a&#xD;
      non-invasive in vivo technique to identify those patients who may benefit from treatment with&#xD;
      a specific drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive technique that enables quantitative&#xD;
      measurements of molecular pathways and interactions with picomolar sensitivity and, as such,&#xD;
      it has the potential to fulfill the need mentioned above. We expect that response to kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors is dependent on achieving active drug levels in tumor tissue. Currently,&#xD;
      intratumoral kinase inhibitor levels are being investigated at our institution (ICK study).&#xD;
      However, these measurements require fresh tumor biopsies. We hypothesize that radiolabeled&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor PET imaging can quantify concentrations of labeled drug in tumor lesions,&#xD;
      thereby avoiding burdensome biopsies in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this study is to determine whether tumor concentrations of&#xD;
      kinase inhibitors at pharmacological active doses can be predicted from PET studies using&#xD;
      tracer amounts (microdosing) of corresponding radiolabeled kinase inhibitors. This objective&#xD;
      includes the development and validation of pharmacokinetic models for radiolabeled kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors as well as validation of the microdosing concept for kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives include exploration whether kinase inhibitor kinetics depend on&#xD;
      perfusion (as measured by [15O]water PET) or size (as measured by diagnostic CT/MRI) of tumor&#xD;
      lesions, to investigate the presence of a sink that accumulates kinase inhibitor, and to&#xD;
      investigate (in)activation of key pathways targeted by the specific kinase inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single center, non-randomized, interventional proof of concept study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with advanced, biopsy accessible tumors for whom standard&#xD;
      palliative treatment with the kinase inhibitor investigated in this study, i.e. erlotinib and&#xD;
      sorafenib, is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be treated with the kinase inhibitor according to standard&#xD;
      treatment. [11C] kinase inhibitor PET (i.e. sorafenib and erlotinib in this study, with the&#xD;
      aim to investigate others in future studies) and [15O]water PET will be performed before and&#xD;
      after two weeks of treatment. Tumor biopsies will be performed before and during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Enrollment in this study will require two tumor biopsies, 2x [11C] kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor PET, 2x [15O]water PET and arterial blood sampling. The biopsies may cause physical&#xD;
      discomfort. During therapy, follow-up will include standard laboratory analysis as well as&#xD;
      regular visits to the outpatient clinic. The radiation exposure is acceptable. Patients&#xD;
      treated with a kinase inhibitor as standard therapy may benefit from disease regression or&#xD;
      stabilization as it has proven clinical benefit in the patient population under&#xD;
      investigation. The results of this kinase inhibitor PET imaging study will be strongly&#xD;
      supportive for the development of non-invasive, personalized treatment strategies thereby&#xD;
      avoiding 1) cumbersome tumor biopsies, 2) unwanted exposure to potentially toxic drugs and 3)&#xD;
      costly therapy without clinical benefit.&#xD;
