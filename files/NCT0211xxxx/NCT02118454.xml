      The purpose of this study is to test whether twice-daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR)&#xD;
      calls made at the estimated times of patients' antiretroviral (ART) medication dosing and&#xD;
      three reminder calls for monthly clinic appointments, will result in improvements in ART&#xD;
      adherence, appointment attendance, health indicators (CD4 cell counts), coping skills, social&#xD;
      support, depressive symptoms, and other quality-of-life indicators, compared to a control&#xD;
      group receiving one IVR assessment call each week, over six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial of the IVR intervention with n=400 PLH taking first&#xD;
      line ART in India on a twice-a-day dosing schedule. The research is supported by an Indo-U.S.&#xD;
      Bilateral review and funding collaboration between NIH and ICMR. The research is being&#xD;
      implemented in Kolkata by Drs. Smarajit Jana (PI, India) and Protim Ray (Project Director) at&#xD;
      Durbar, a community-based organization providing HIV/STD prevention and community development&#xD;
      programs with sex workers and other at-risk communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is Phase 2 of a two-phase pilot project. Phase 1 was a one-month no-control pilot (n=46)&#xD;
      for feasibility, acceptability, and patient feedback on preferences for messaging content.&#xD;
      Phase 2 has two sites, described as Phases 2A and 2b, which will occur simultaneously and&#xD;
      differ only in their recruitment sites and corresponding sampling strategy (sample size,&#xD;
      gender ratio, eligibility criteria) based on site population characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2A will recruit n=80 women and n=20 men from Durbar's Mamata Care and Treatment&#xD;
           Center (MCTC) (providing HIV testing and treatment linkage and support) and associated&#xD;
           Mamata Network of Positive Women (MNPW), which focus on HIV+ sex workers and their male&#xD;
           partners and networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase 2B will recruit n=100 women and n=200 men from the ART Centre at the Calcutta&#xD;
           School of Tropical Medicine (STM), which hosts the largest ART center in the Northeast&#xD;
           Region of India and has over 3,000 active patients on first line ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sampling plan reflects the gender distribution of clients and patients at the two sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized within each site and gender sub-sample to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IVR Intervention: consisting of two (2) automated voice calls (&quot;intervention&#xD;
           messages&quot;) each day for six months, PLUS one IVR assessment call (consisting of four [4]&#xD;
           questions) every week for 6 months; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Control Condition: consisting of standard care, PLUS one IVR assessment call&#xD;
           (consisting of four [4] questions) every week for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be interviewed in-person by a research team member at baseline and&#xD;
      followed-up at 2- 4- and 6-months using structured questionnaires and recording information&#xD;
      from the participant's personal medical record (i.e., their &quot;ART Card&quot;) to assess background&#xD;
      characteristics and intervention impacts on ART adherence, health quality-of-life (i.e.,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, social support). All participants will receive one IVR assessment phone&#xD;
      call (consisting of four (4) questions during each week of the 6 month study. Each&#xD;
      once-a-week IVR assessment will ask about missed medication and the participant's&#xD;
      health/quality of life, and participants will respond by keying in a 1 (yes) or 2 (no) on&#xD;
      their mobile phone.&#xD;

      The originally proposed study aims were revised slightly during the review process from the&#xD;
      Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is NIH equivalent and partner funder of this&#xD;
      research (see &quot;ICMR Comments&quot; document). The original proposal examined comprehensive&#xD;
      messaging for adherence, risk reduction, and quality of life (i.e., emotional support),&#xD;
      compared to medication adherence messages only. The protocol was revised to compare&#xD;
      comprehensive messaging to standard care. The IVR intervention is built on Dimagi's original&#xD;
      ART adherence text-messaging support system called &quot;ARemind&quot;. Therefore, the aims of this&#xD;
      study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt the ARemind mobile phone ART adherence mobile phone messaging system for PLH in&#xD;
           Kolkata, India;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Further develop ARemind to address the co-occurring factors of ART non-adherence, poor&#xD;
           mental health, and transmission risks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examine the acceptability, engagement, and adherence by PLH to the IVR messaging system;&#xD;
           and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Examine the efficacy of the twice daily ART reminder calls with health messages compared&#xD;
           to standard care, for medication adherence only compared to standard care to improve&#xD;
           adherence and mental health, and reduce transmission risks, in a randomized controlled&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND The 2.3 million persons living with HIV (PLH) in India are being offered access to&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapies (ART) by the government. ART offers the possibility of improving&#xD;
      health and reducing HIV transmission by decreasing HIV viral loads in PLH. Yet, non-adherence&#xD;
      remains high globally, with an estimated 50% of PLH in India not maintaining adherence to 95%&#xD;
      of ART doses, which is considered the adherence rate needed to maintain HIV viral&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile phones have been used in the US and globally to increase ART adherence among PLH. As a&#xD;
      low cost, easily diffused intervention strategy in a country such as India in which the&#xD;
      mobile phone penetration rate is expected to reach 100% by 2014 (Informa World, 2010),&#xD;
      designing a mobile phone intervention to increase ART adherence is a potentially highly&#xD;
      efficacious intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, because HIV is a chronic infectious disease, PLH are also challenged with&#xD;
      maintaining mental health and reducing transmission risks (Swendeman et al., 2009a).&#xD;
      Furthermore, reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that ART adherence interventions are&#xD;
      more effective when a comprehensive approach is adopted (Malta, 2008; Rueda, 2006; Simoni,&#xD;
      2006). In particular, mental health symptoms and transmission acts that co-occur with and&#xD;
      undermine ART adherence (Kalichman, 2008, Malta, 2008) are likely to be behaviors that may&#xD;
      also be influenced by mobile phone delivered interventions. Thus, this study aims to adapt&#xD;
      and develop an intervention to improve and maintain medication and appointment adherence,&#xD;
      reduce transmission acts, and improve quality of life including mental health symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 pilot testing (June - August, 2013) was recently completed by the research team in&#xD;
      Kolkata with PLH (n=46) taking ART and clients of Durbar's Mamata Care and Treatment Center&#xD;
      (MCTC), members of Durbar's &quot;Mamata Network of Positive Women&quot; (MNPW), and their peers. Phase&#xD;
      1 involved a 1-month pilot test of the IVR messaging intervention, including baseline and a&#xD;
      follow up assessment, and brief open-ended feedback interview and focus group feedback&#xD;
      interviews at the follow up to inform the current protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three world-renowned HIV prevention and technology organizations will collaborate in Phase 2&#xD;
      research activities: 1) UCLA Center for HIV Identification, Prevention, and Treatment&#xD;
      Services (CHIPTS), with expertise in behavioral intervention development, adaptation, and&#xD;
      randomized trials for PLH and other high-risk populations; 2) Durbar, with expertise in&#xD;
      multi-level prevention and support services for high-risk populations in India; and 3) Dimagi&#xD;
      Inc., a technology company with expertise in mobile phone solutions for global health&#xD;
      challenges. Dimagi developed &quot;ARemind&quot; to assess and remind ART and appointment adherence&#xD;
      with feedback from PLH and providers in the U.S. and tested in a pilot study and prior&#xD;
      NIH-funded grants. The software reminds PLH through text-messaging (i.e. Simple Messaging&#xD;
      Service [SMS]) or Interactive Voice Response (IVR) methods. This program can also be&#xD;
      leveraged to address the co-morbid challenges of preventing transmission and improving mental&#xD;
      health and quality of life for PLH. In this study, ARemind will be adapted and developed for&#xD;
      PLH recruited from two sites in Kolkata, India; 1) a community based care and treatment&#xD;
      center operated by Durbar serving primarily female sex workers living with HIV (i.e., the&#xD;
      Mamata Care &amp; Treatment Center [MCTC] &amp; Mamata Network of Positive Women [MNPW]), and 2) PLH&#xD;
      recruited from the primary ART Centre at the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine (STM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND METHODS After recruitment and consenting into Phase 2, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized within site and gender sub-samples to either intervention or standard care&#xD;
      (control) conditions and complete the Phase 2 Baseline Survey. Participants who do not have&#xD;
      their own personal mobile phone will be provided with a mobile phone and phone line (i.e.,&#xD;
      Sim card) with service paid for by the research team during the 6-month study period. All&#xD;
      participants will complete in-person follow up interviews (with a research team member) every&#xD;
      two months for six months, which include medical record abstraction, and brief weekly IVR&#xD;
      assessments (on their own, via their mobile phone). Study documents and IVR messages will be&#xD;
      available in Bengali and Hindi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT The source of referrals will be MCTC staff or clients or MNPW network members or&#xD;
      their peers (Phase 2A), or STM ART Centre staff, patients or their peers (Phase 2B). Staff,&#xD;
      patients, or clients at from any of these sites will have recruitment scripts administered to&#xD;
      them by a member of the research team and will be provided with study information cards to&#xD;
      give to their patients, clients, or peers who they think may be interested in participating&#xD;
      in the research study. If the patient, client or peer is interested in finding out more about&#xD;
      the study, they will contact the research team directly using the phone number on the study&#xD;
      information cards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the Durbar MCTC Staff (Phase 2A) or STM Staff (Phase 2B) will administer a verbal&#xD;
      introduction script to patients in the waiting areas of the MCTC or STM. MCTC client flow is&#xD;
      modest, seeing less than a dozen PLH each day. STM patient flow sees hundreds of 1st-line ART&#xD;
      patients each day, with long lines and waiting times to see the physicians, lab technicians,&#xD;
      counselors, and to receive ART refills. The introduction script tells the patients/clients&#xD;
      where the recruiters are from and that they are part of a research study. Next a research&#xD;
      team member will describe the study to the people sitting in the waiting areas. If a&#xD;
      potential participant is interested in hearing more from the team member, they will go to a&#xD;
      private office within the MCTC (Durbar office - Phase 2A) or STM (Study office provided by&#xD;
      the STM - Phase 2B) where the research team member will administer the screening questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING [In-Person] If the patient, client, or peer is interested to find out if s/he is&#xD;
      eligible to participate based on the (introductory) recruitment script, the research team&#xD;
      member will privately administer the screening questions. If eligible based on self-report,&#xD;
      eligibility will be confirmed by the study staff reviewing the potential participant's ART&#xD;
      Card. Responses will be recorded in the Dimagi phone application by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [By Telephone] If the caller is interested to find out if s/he is eligible to participate&#xD;
      based on the (introductory) recruitment script, the research team member will administer the&#xD;
      screening questions. If the potential participant is eligible based on their self-report, an&#xD;
      in-person meeting will be scheduled at the MCTC or STM study offices. The screening questions&#xD;
      will be re-administered at the in-person meeting, confirmed by review of the ART Card, and&#xD;
      responses recorded in the Dimagi phone application by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durbar Staff will screen potential participants in a private room or private area at the&#xD;
      School of Tropical Medicine or the MCTC at Durbar. Self-report by potential participants of&#xD;
      the following information will determine their preliminary eligibility: 1) Age; 2) how long&#xD;
      on ART; 3) which ART regimen (1st, 2nd, 3rd line); 4) if received CD4 count result in past&#xD;
      two months (for Phase 2A at MCTC/MNPW) or past 2 months (for Phase 2B at STM); and 4) if&#xD;
      missed taking any ART doses in the past 6 months. If eligible based on self-report, verbal&#xD;
      consent will be obtained to review the potential participant's ART Card to confirm&#xD;
      eligibility by checking: 1) identity from photo, 2) Age, 3) how long on ART, 4) which ART&#xD;
      regimen (1st, 2nd), and 5) date of last CD4 count result. All screening information except&#xD;
      for identity (photo, name) but also including gender, language, and literacy (literate or&#xD;
      not) will be recorded on the Screening Questionnaire in order to compare ineligibles, those&#xD;
      who do not consent to participate, and consented participants. Screening data are entered&#xD;
      into a secure database in the Dimagi system using the study staff mobile phones with the&#xD;
      Dimagi application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONSENT &amp; ENROLLMENT If recruitment/screening is in-person, eligible participants will be&#xD;
      asked if they want to enroll in the study at that time. If they do, the research team member&#xD;
      will administer the Informed Consent Form. If recruitment/screening in over the telephone,&#xD;
      the research team member will make an in-person appointment with the eligible participant to&#xD;
      repeat the screening, confirm eligibility based on ART Card review, and administer the&#xD;
      Informed Consent Form, if the eligible participant wants to enroll in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE AND FOLLOW UP SURVEY INTERVIEWS Study interviewers will use mobile phones with a&#xD;
      survey application programmed by Dimagi to administer the baseline and follow-up surveys to&#xD;
      participants and record their responses. The Baseline and Follow-Up interviews at 2-, 4-, and&#xD;
      6-months will generally be scheduled on the same day as a medical visit at STM ART Centre, or&#xD;
      shortly after an ART Centre visit if the participant was recruited from MCTC/MNPW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART MEDICAL CARD ABSTRACTION All ART patients in India keep their own medical record and&#xD;
      carry it with them to their monthly appointments for check-ups and medication refill. The&#xD;
      &quot;ART Card&quot; includes the patient's name, photo, date of birth, address, phone numbers, contact&#xD;
      names and phone numbers, and information related to HIV treatment outcomes, including CD4&#xD;
      cell counts (conducted once every 6 months) and ART pill counts (i.e., an estimate of&#xD;
      adherence) collected at each monthly clinic visit. (The STM ART clinic also keeps a copy of&#xD;
      the record). During Screening and Baseline and Follow-Up surveys the ART Card will be&#xD;
      reviewed by the study interviewer to confirm the participant's identity and eligibility, and&#xD;
      then to record the participant's CD4 and ART pill counts and their dates in the survey&#xD;
      application. At Baseline, the prior two CD4 and prior 6 ART pill counts will be recorded. At&#xD;
      follow-up interviews the prior two pill counts and any new CD4 count will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WEEKLY IVR ASSESSMENT CALLS All participants will receive one IVR Assessment call each week&#xD;
      that consists of four questions, one on medication adherence, two on depressive symptoms, one&#xD;
      on physical symptoms. Responses are entered by pressing 1 (yes) or 2 (no) on the phone&#xD;
      keypad. Once a response is received, the next question plays. If an IVR assessment call is&#xD;
      not answered, the system attempts 3 repeat calls within one hour of the specified call time.&#xD;
      If participants do not respond to 2 consecutive weeks' IVR assessment calls, a study&#xD;
      interviewer will call the participant's phone (and other contacts, if needed) to confirm that&#xD;
      the mobile phone service is still active and remind the participant how the IVR system&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants select the day and time to receive the IVR assessment calls, which they confirm&#xD;
      or change at each follow up interview or can change by calling the study contact number. If&#xD;
      participants request it, they can decline to receive IVR assessment calls. Female&#xD;
      participants will receive calls with a female voice and vice versa for male participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feedback from the PLH CAB, service providers, another similar study in India, and our Phase 1&#xD;
      experience found that reading and technological literacy are low enough among some PLH that&#xD;
      this interactive feature may prove unreliable. Therefore, participants will receive a brief&#xD;
      training from the study interviewer at the baseline meeting on how the IVR assessment calls&#xD;
      function and how to respond using the keypad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION: IVR MESSAGING SYSTEM The IVR messaging system automatically sends pre-recorded&#xD;
      voice messages twice each day, once in the morning and once in the evening, to participants&#xD;
      in the intervention condition. The call times are linked to the times that a participant&#xD;
      reports typically taking his/her ART medication (twice a day is the standard dosing schedule&#xD;
      for 1st-line ART) or at an alternative time that the participant specifies in the Baseline&#xD;
      and Follow-Up Surveys. The most basic function of the calls is to act as &quot;alarm reminders&quot; to&#xD;
      take ART, whether or not a call is answered, while the messaging content has a dual function&#xD;
      of being engaging for participants and potentially impacting other study outcomes beyond ART&#xD;
      adherence. Messaging automatically stops after the 6-month follow up is completed or when a&#xD;
      participant declines receiving messages or withdraws from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IVR intervention messages are less than 60 seconds each and focus on several key domains&#xD;
      identified is being important and engaging by the target population and by the intervention&#xD;
      team: 1) Illness-related information (i.e., TB, malaria, but no HIV-specific messages) and&#xD;
      self-management strategies for medication adherence and symptom/side-effect management&#xD;
      (nausea, diarrhea, dehydration); 2) Wellness-related messages focused primarily on diet,&#xD;
      nutrition, and hygiene; and 3) Mental health related messages focused on self-management&#xD;
      strategies for stress-reduction, mood improvement, positive cognitions, and social support.&#xD;
      Not all message content is being evaluated by corresponding outcome measures. Specifically,&#xD;
      change in knowledge is not being assessed in order to reduce assessment burden and focus on&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes. The functional role of some messages is intended for engagement,&#xD;
      intervention framing, and motivation, in addition to behavioral cues. Over 120 messages were&#xD;
      developed, split about evenly across the three categories of illness, health, and mental&#xD;
      health messages. Messages were randomly sorted within each category and then sequenced in an&#xD;
      alternating order for the final message delivery queue. The number of messages was selected&#xD;
      to not have any message repeat over two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV &amp; STI &quot;Specific&quot; Messages Phase 1 results identified that some PLH preferred specific&#xD;
      messages about HIV/AIDS and risk behaviors, while others, particularly those with children,&#xD;
      preferred only general health messages to protect their privacy in the event someone else&#xD;
      answered the phone call. Therefore, from Baseline to the 2-month follow-up assessment,&#xD;
      participants will not receive messages that specifically mention HIV/AIDS or sexual behaviors&#xD;
      or sexually transmitted infections (STI), which we refer to as &quot;Specific&quot; messages. Specific&#xD;
      messages are intentionally not implemented from Baseline to 2-month follow up to allow&#xD;
      participants to actually experience the intervention modality before opting to receive&#xD;
      specific messages that might result in adverse events such as HIV disclosures. At 2-month and&#xD;
      4-month follow-up interviews participants can &quot;opt-in&quot; to receive &quot;Specific&quot; messages for the&#xD;
      following two months, with messaging preferences recorded in the survey application and&#xD;
      automatically linked to the Dimagi messaging system. Specific message libraries are currently&#xD;
      being prepared. Participants in the Intervention Condition will be able to opt-out of&#xD;
      receiving specific (i.e. HIV-related) IVR messages at any time by calling the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART Clinic Appointment Reminders The IVR messaging system also sends ART clinic appointment&#xD;
      reminders for the ART Centre visit scheduled for 8-weeks (2-months) after the baseline,&#xD;
      2-month, and 4-month follow-up interviews, or at a more specific date provided by the&#xD;
      participant. ART Centre follow-up visits are typically scheduled exactly four weeks apart.&#xD;
      The appointment reminder will be sent in the morning call 7 days in advance of the&#xD;
      appointment and again 2 days in advance. If the appointment reminder calls are not answered,&#xD;
      the system attempts 3 repeat calls within one hour of the specified call time and repeats at&#xD;
      the subsequent specified call times until answered or until the day of the scheduled&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;National Do Not Call&quot; (NDNC) Registry: India has a &quot;National Do Not Call&quot; (NDNC) registry&#xD;
      for cell phone numbers that is an &quot;opt-in&quot; registry. In order to be put on the NDNC registry,&#xD;
      cell phone owners must contact the registry to have their cell phone number added. Once&#xD;
      added, being on the NDNC registry prevents the cell phone from receiving &quot;robo-calls&quot; -&#xD;
      typically commercial solicitations. Since this study's &quot;IVR Messaging System&quot; and &quot;Weekly&#xD;
      Assessment Calls&quot; are technically &quot;robo-calls,&quot; the participant (if using their own cell&#xD;
      phone) must not be registered with the NDNC registry in order to participate in the study. If&#xD;
      the participant has previously registered with the NDNC registry, we will get permission from&#xD;
      the participant and assi ist them to remove their cell phone number from the NDNC registry&#xD;
      for the duration of the study. At the study completion, if requested, the researcher will&#xD;
      assist the participant to opt-in to the NDNC registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Message Monitoring and Follow Up The IVR system also monitors and reports through the Dimagi&#xD;
      system to the study team whether each call was answered and the duration of the call to&#xD;
      estimate whether it was listened to completely or not. Message monitoring reports will be&#xD;
      generated on a weekly basis. If the reports indicate that calls are not being answered by a&#xD;
      participant for two consecutive weeks at the phone number they specified, a study team member&#xD;
      will call the participant's phone (and other contacts, if needed) to confirm service is still&#xD;
      active or obtain a new preferred phone number from the participant (see Phone Follow-Up&#xD;
      Script).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME FOR ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES Total study time is 6.5 hours for control&#xD;
      group and 12.5 hours for the intervention group. The Baseline Interview, including informed&#xD;
      consent and instructions, will last about 2 hours. The three Follow-up Interviews will last&#xD;
      about 1 hour each. IVR Assessment messaging requires about 3 minutes for the participant to&#xD;
      listen and respond to the messages each week for 6 months (about 1.5 hours). Intervention&#xD;
      messaging requires about 2 minutes per day for x 6 months (about 6 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT All data will be coded with a unique participant identification number (PID)&#xD;
      generated by a computerized algorithm from the participant's name, father's name, age, sex,&#xD;
      and phone numbers collected in the &quot;Registration Information&quot; section of the baseline&#xD;
      interview. The interviews are conducted with computerized assessments using mobile phones&#xD;
      programmed by Dimagi Inc., with data stored on their HIPAA compliant servers in the United&#xD;
      States. The &quot;Registration Information,&quot; which includes locator information (i.e., phone&#xD;
      number and an alternate contact and phone number), will be stored in separate files from the&#xD;
      interview data on the Dimagi servers, with different password-protected access controls and&#xD;
      will only be accessible by the PI &amp; other research team members. The &quot;Registration&#xD;
      Information&quot; questions are repeated in the follow up interview to verify the participant's&#xD;
      identity as a study participant. Only study staff will have access to the &quot;Registration&#xD;
      Information&quot; via their study specific mobile phone and its installed assessment application&#xD;
      from Dimagi, with the phone password protected and the Dimagi application also having a login&#xD;
      ID and password.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signed consent forms will be stored in a locked file in a locked office at the Durbar&#xD;
      research office. All forms that record data in this study will be electronic and managed by&#xD;
      Dimagi: 1) Screener data, 2) Locator Form (i.e. &quot;Registration Form&quot;), 3) Baseline and&#xD;
      Follow-up survey data, and 4) IVR assessment data. At the completion of the study, all data&#xD;
      will be downloaded by the UCLA research team and permanently deleted from the Dimagi servers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSES Baseline descriptive analyses will be conducted with simple frequency&#xD;
      distribution methods (means, mode, ranges, standard deviations). Follow-up data will be&#xD;
      examined with linear and logistic regression. Unadjusted and adjusted longitudinal analyses&#xD;
      will be conducted with random coefficient models, a specific subset of the more general&#xD;
      multilevel modeling framework. Statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS computer&#xD;
      program. The sample size supports statistical power to detect responses to intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., effect size) of a mean change of 0.40 from baseline to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISKS Risks of participating in Baseline, Follow-Up, and focus group interviews are minimal.&#xD;
      Participants could experience some discomfort providing a response to questions regarding&#xD;
      frequency of sexual behaviors or alcohol use, or experience of HIV-related stigma,&#xD;
      discrimination or support. Participants will be told that answering any eligibility questions&#xD;
      or discussing topics during the focus group is entirely voluntary and that they may decide to&#xD;
      not answer any questions at any time. Steps will be taken to ensure the anonymity of&#xD;
      participant's self-disclosed age, sexual behaviors, and substance use for determining&#xD;
      eligibility. All screening questions will be asked in a private setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also a risk that a bystander could overhear an IVR message or that someone else&#xD;
      could answer the participants phone and hear an IVR message, which might result in questions&#xD;
      to the participant about the nature or purpose of the messages. However, IVR messages are&#xD;
      common in India, which can provide a common explanation for participants. Furthermore,&#xD;
      participants will know when IVR calls are expected as they choose the times to receive calls&#xD;
      and they can turn off their phones or ignore the calls if they are concerned about their&#xD;
      privacy at any time. HIV-status disclosure will only happen if the participant chooses to&#xD;
      disclose in response to a question from a bystander.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;National Do Not Call&quot; registry - There are no risks to a participant who removes their cell&#xD;
      phone number from the registry for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of gathering information with properly trained and supervised staff poses minimal&#xD;
      risk to the proposed participants. Some participants may benefit from interaction with an&#xD;
      attentive trained professional and feel good about being given a chance to express their&#xD;
      opinions. Project staff members are trained to offer referrals to appropriate resources at&#xD;
      the end of interviews with participants if they have heard a response that indicated that (or&#xD;
      if they observed) the participant to be in need of services they are not otherwise receiving.&#xD;
