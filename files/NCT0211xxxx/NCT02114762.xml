      This study evaluates the usefulness and safety of using a balloon to dilate (make larger) the&#xD;
      Eustachian tube in adults who have middle-ear disease due to Eustachian tube dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Eustachian tube is a biological tube that connects the back of the nose to the middle&#xD;
      ear. It is usually closed but needs to be actively opened by the action of certain muscles&#xD;
      during swallowing, yawning, and other activities which keeps the air pressure in the middle&#xD;
      ear (the part of the ear behind the eardrum) the same as the air pressure in the environment.&#xD;
      If the Eustachian tube does not open during swallowing, the middle-ear pressure progressively&#xD;
      decreases and persons may have the feeling of a &quot;stuffed up&quot; and/or &quot;full&quot; middle ear, may&#xD;
      have difficulty hearing and/or may develop fluid in their middle ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual treatment for a Eustachian tube that does not open well is to insert a tiny tube&#xD;
      (called a ventilation or tympanostomy tube) into the eardrum to keep the air pressure in the&#xD;
      middle ear the same as in the environment. However, those tubes naturally &quot;fall out&quot; over&#xD;
      time, and if the Eustachian tube opening function had not improved while they were in place,&#xD;
      new tubes will need to be inserted. In the past few years, doctors in the U.S. and Europe&#xD;
      described a simple procedure called &quot;balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube&quot; (BDET) or&#xD;
      &quot;balloon tuboplasty&quot; that they believe corrects the underlying cause of Eustachian tube&#xD;
      dysfunction and resolves its symptoms, signs and consequences. For that procedure, a tiny&#xD;
      balloon is inserted into the Eustachian tube, inflated to physically open the Eustachian&#xD;
      tube, deflated and then removed. Doctors who have used the method in adults and children with&#xD;
      symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction reported that BDET is safe and causes a short-term&#xD;
      and, perhaps, a long-term resolution of symptoms. However, no one has measured Eustachian&#xD;
      tube function before and after the procedure, and it is not known if BDET truly improves that&#xD;
      function or not, and if so, how that function is changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will enroll adult subjects with a tympanostomy tube inserted into at least&#xD;
      one eardrum or a chronic perforation in at least one eardrum for physician-diagnosed&#xD;
      Eustachian tube dysfunction or middle-ear fluid and document the presence/absence of&#xD;
      measurable Eustachian tube dysfunction using standard tests. If present, we will determine if&#xD;
      the Eustachian tube dysfunction improves after medical treatment of other diseases known to&#xD;
      cause Eustachian tube dysfunction. If the Eustachian tube dysfunction does not significantly&#xD;
      improve, we will perform the BDET procedure and measure the change in Eustachian tube&#xD;
      function at different times after the procedure.&#xD;
