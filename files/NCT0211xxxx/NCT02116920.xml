      AIM: To develop and standardize a cost effective methodology or algorithm for mRNA E6/E7 for&#xD;
      HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 as compared to commercially available assays which can be&#xD;
      incorporated to triage excess false positives from primary screening for cervical cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development and standardization of methodology /algorithm for mRNA E6/E7 testing for HPV&#xD;
           genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 using Real-time RT-PCR, in cervical samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the test performance of this HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay to HPV DNA by HC 2 as&#xD;
           secondary screening test, with the reference standard of colposcopy with biopsy, to&#xD;
           triage women found positive in primary screening by VIA , in a population based&#xD;
           screening for cancer of cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine number of false positives in the primary screening test after testing VIA&#xD;
           positives with a known high specificity secondary screening test (HPV-DNA HC II )&#xD;
           compared to HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Women in the age group of 30-65 years, who test positive on primary&#xD;
      cervical screening test VIA will be enrolled for the proposed diagnostic tests along with&#xD;
      reference standard of colposcopy with guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the age group of 30-65 years undergoing routine cervical cancer screening through&#xD;
      hospital ( Preventive Oncology screening clinic) and community based screening programs with&#xD;
      abnormal test result using the primary cervical cancer screening test VIA will be recruited&#xD;
      in the study. The primary screening test VIA will be administered by application of 5% Acetic&#xD;
      Acid to the cervix and visualizing the cervix with the help of a halogen focus lamp. VIA will&#xD;
      be considered to be positive if definite acetowhite lesions are visualized close to the&#xD;
      squamocolumnar junction.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Population: Women in the age group of 30-65 years, who test positive on primary&#xD;
      cervical screening test VIA will be enrolled for the proposed diagnostic tests along with&#xD;
      reference standard of colposcopy with guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: Women tested positive on primary screening test VIA with referrals for further&#xD;
      diagnostic testing at TMH will be enrolled under the study for proposed diagnostic tests&#xD;
      along with reference test at tertiary care facility , Dept. of Preventive Oncology, Tata&#xD;
      Memorial Hospital in Mumbai.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size To detect statistically significant difference in the test characteristics with&#xD;
      95% confidence limits, 80 % statistical power and alpha =0.05, we require to have around 180&#xD;
      cases of cervical intraepithelial neolplasia in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a demonstrated prevalence of around 2% for detecting high grade CIN lesions from our&#xD;
      urban and rural community based cervical screening programmes, we need to enroll around 9,000&#xD;
      women from population based cervical cancer screening, to get 180 cases of cervical&#xD;
      intraepithelial neolplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the age group of 30-65 years undergoing routine cervical cancer screening through&#xD;
      hospital ( Preventive Oncology screening clinic) and community based screening programs with&#xD;
      abnormal test result using the primary cervical cancer screening test VIA will be recruited&#xD;
      in the study. The primary screening test VIA will be administered by application of 5% Acetic&#xD;
      Acid to the cervix and visualizing the cervix with the help of a halogen focus lamp. VIA will&#xD;
      be considered to be positive if definite acetowhite lesions are visualized close to the&#xD;
      squamocolumnar junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for a positive VIA test are presented below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive VIA test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Opaque, dense, dull, definite, well defined aceto white lesions, touching the&#xD;
           squamocolumnar junction or close to the external os.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Strikingly dense acetowhite areas in the columnar epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Condyloma and Leukoplakia occurring closer to the squamocolumnar junction turning&#xD;
           intensely white after application of acetic acid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Growth on the cervix turning acetowhite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screened women who are tested Screen Positive by the primary screening test VIA will&#xD;
      become eligible for recruitment in the study . Screen positive women from the outreach&#xD;
      community screening programs will be referred to TMH ( Preventive Oncology screening clinic)&#xD;
      for further diagnostic verification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will be recruited from Hospital ( Preventive Oncology screening&#xD;
      clinic) and community based screening programmes in Mumbai. Medical Social Workers will&#xD;
      explain the details and the purpose of the study to participants attending the screening&#xD;
      clinic. Apparently healthy women in the age group of 30-65 yrs with an intact uterus and no&#xD;
      past history of cervical neoplasia will become eligible to participate in the programme. If&#xD;
      they are fulfilling the inclusion criteria given above, a written informed consent in the&#xD;
      vernacular language (either Hindi or Marathi) will be obtained from the participant and a&#xD;
      unique participant identification number will be assigned to the eligible women. Information&#xD;
      on socio demographic and reproductive variables will then be collected using a detailed&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic, reproductive and sexual history data will be recorded at screening following&#xD;
      informed consent..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen positive women will be tested for the presence of oncogenic HPV types by Hybrid&#xD;
      Capture-II (HC-II) and HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing as diagnostic test. In addition to the above&#xD;
      two tests all the screen positive women will also further receive Colposcopy with guided&#xD;
      cervical biopsy, the reference gold standard test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colposcopy will be performed by trained doctors and the colposcopy impression will be noted&#xD;
      down along with a punch biopsy from the aceto white area on the cervix detected by the&#xD;
      primary screening test VIA. Biopsy specimens will be fixed in 10% formalin and will be&#xD;
      processed and reported by the pathology laboratory at the Tata Memorial Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference standard for final disease status will be histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Test Counseling :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of all testing procedures post test counseling will be done by the Doctor and&#xD;
      Medical Social Worker to explain the significance and the results of the testing procedures&#xD;
      performed. The importance of follow up visit to understand the results of HPV/ mRNA E6/E7 and&#xD;
      cervical biopsy will be explained to the women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up and Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for opportunistic and reproductive tract infections (RTI) will be provided. Women&#xD;
      with High grade lesions (cervical precancers ) HSIL will be recommended to seek treatment&#xD;
      with cryotherapy or LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure) or by cold knife&#xD;
      conization at the Tata Memorial Centre Mumbai.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Project Period: Three years:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal submission, training, participant recruitment, data collection and analysis,&#xD;
      including follow-up of cases at the end of enrollment period&#xD;
