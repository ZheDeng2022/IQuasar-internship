  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shared Decision Making (SDM) is defined as a process where healthcare professionals and&#xD;
      patients make decisions together, using the best available evidence. SDM, as a communication&#xD;
      and decision method, can be used also with persons suffering from dementia. Yet, SDM with&#xD;
      persons with dementia or even with their family caregivers is not widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present research project aims to develop and evaluate an SDM framework in care planning&#xD;
      to be implemented in long-term care facilities, in order to obtain a constantly developing&#xD;
      care plan that focuses not only on the medical, physical, psychosocial and spiritual needs of&#xD;
      the resident, but that considers and documents his preferences and the actions taken by&#xD;
      caregivers to meet them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project is a controlled exploratory study. Case studies that involve a triad in&#xD;
      each case, composed by the resident with moderate or severe dementia, his family caregiver&#xD;
      and the professional usually taking care for the resident, will be used (n=16 professionals;&#xD;
      n=40 residents; n=40 family caregivers). Professional caregivers of two nursing homes, one&#xD;
      located in Italy and one in the Netherlands, will receive a specific training in SDM&#xD;
      principles and will guide the SDM interview within the triad. Primary outcome will be the&#xD;
      proportion of residents whose preferences and needs, together with the related actions to&#xD;
      meet them, are known, documented and satisfied in their 'life-and-care plans'. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes are the residents' and family caregivers' quality of life; the family caregivers'&#xD;
      sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction. Semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews and focus group interviews will be performed to assess satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Assessments are performed&#xD;
      at baseline and six months after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that the use of the SDM process in care planning will increase the number of&#xD;
      met needs and will improve the residents' and family caregivers quality of life, the family&#xD;
      caregivers' sense of competence and the healthcare professionals' job satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The key element of this study is that it will contribute to our knowledge about the efficacy&#xD;
      and feasibility of an SDM framework in care planning in long-term care facilities with&#xD;
      persons with moderate to severe dementia.&#xD;
