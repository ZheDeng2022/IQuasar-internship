      The goal of this study is to reduce infant and toddlers' secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in&#xD;
      a high risk, medically underserved population of maternal smokers. The program is called&#xD;
      &quot;Philadelphia FRESH (Family Rules for Establishing Smokefree Homes)&quot;. Participants are&#xD;
      recruited from low-income urban neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After&#xD;
      determining study eligibility via telephone screen, all participants complete an in-home&#xD;
      pre-intervention interview that includes self-reported smoking history, current smoking and&#xD;
      exposure patterns, and factors that relate to maternal smoking (such as depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      weight concerns, nicotine dependence,) as well as collection of child urine cotinine (a&#xD;
      biomarker used to detect SHSe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized after baseline to receive either (a) a moderately intensive (up&#xD;
      to 2 in-home sessions, 8 phone sessions) Behavioral Counseling intervention (BC) delivered&#xD;
      over a 16-week period by counselors trained and supervised by investigators, or (b) an&#xD;
      enhanced Self-Help Control (SHC) that uses brief advice and a detailed self-help manual for&#xD;
      SHSe-reduction and smokingcessation. Post intervention assessments include self-reports of&#xD;
      intervention process, factors associated with intervention effects, and intervention outcomes&#xD;
      that include child urine cotinine (to measure level of SHSe) and participant saliva cotinine&#xD;
      (to verify self-reported smoking quit status). Interviewers and data management staff remain&#xD;
      blind to the treatment assignment. All procedures are implemented after signed informed&#xD;
      consent and were approved by Temple University's Institutional Review Board.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study represents a community-based behavioral counseling trial designed to reduce infant&#xD;
      and toddlers' secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in a high risk, medically underserved&#xD;
      population of African American maternal smokers. The program is called &quot;Philadelphia FRESH&#xD;
      (Family Rules for Establishing Smokefree Homes)&quot;. Participants are recruited from low-income&#xD;
      urban neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania via posters on mass transit, newspaper ads,&#xD;
      and referral from pediatricians or community WIC clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mothers who smoke at least 5 cigarettes per day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have a child under 4 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report exposing their youngest child to at least 2 of her cigarettes per day. (Child&#xD;
           exposure to a cigarette is defined as a child being in the same room or car when adult&#xD;
           is smoking. Room is defined as 4-walls and a door that closes.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of a Axis I psychiatric disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  not proficient in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining study eligibility via telephone screen, all participants complete an&#xD;
      in-home baseline interview that includes self-reported smoking history, current smoking and&#xD;
      exposure patterns, and factors that relate to maternal smoking (such as depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      weight concerns, nicotine dependence,) as well as collection of child urine cotinine (a&#xD;
      biomarker used to detect SHSe).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to receive either a Behavioral Counseling intervention (BC)&#xD;
      delivered over a 16-week period by master's level counselors trained and supervised by&#xD;
      PhD-level investigators, or an enhanced Self-Help Control (SHC) that uses a detailed&#xD;
      self-help manual for SHSe-reduction and smoking cessation. Post intervention assessments at&#xD;
      16 weeks, 3- and 12-month follow-up include self-reports of factors associated with&#xD;
      intervention effects and intervention outcomes that include child urine cotinine (to measure&#xD;
      level of SHSe) and participant saliva cotinine (to verify self-reported smoking quit status).&#xD;
      Interviewers and data management staff remain blind to the treatment assignment. All&#xD;
      procedures are implemented after signed informed consent and were approved by Temple&#xD;
      University's Institutional Review Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral Counseling (BC): Mothers randomized to receive BC complete two in-home, and up to&#xD;
      a 8 proactive telephone counseling sessions within a 16-week period. Mothers also receive&#xD;
      four health education and self-help mailings sent in two week intervals during the first 8&#xD;
      weeks of their participation to supplement the counseling content. (These four mailings are&#xD;
      identical to the self-help materials received by the control group.) The overarching goal of&#xD;
      child SHSe reduction is intended to be achieved through specific BC objectives. These&#xD;
      objectives include facilitation of health education regarding the dangers of SHSe and&#xD;
      smoking, plus the benefits of SHSe-reduction and smoking cessation to maternal and child&#xD;
      health. Additional objectives include (a) building family-level social support to facilitate&#xD;
      home-level smoking behavior change; (b) fostering coping and problem-solving skills to help&#xD;
      participants manage smoking urges as well as general life stressors; (c) providing and&#xD;
      modeling abundant positive reinforcement following SHSe reduction efforts to facilitate&#xD;
      confidence and motivation for more challenging smoking behavior change goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-Help Control (SHC) group: Participants in SHC group receive an intervention binder with&#xD;
      brief advice by telephone on how to use the manual for SHSe reduction. The binder contains&#xD;
      information identical to the BC group, however, all binder content is included in this single&#xD;
      mailing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study outcomes include change in (a) maternal-reported child SHSe (reported as&#xD;
      cigarettes exposed per day) obtained via validated timeline follow-back methods; and (b) baby&#xD;
      urine cotinine- a biomarker of SHSe standard in tobacco exposure studies. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include (a) change in maternal cigarettes smoked per day and (b) maternal reported 7-day&#xD;
      point prevalence abstinence, bioverified by saliva cotinine. Urine and saliva samples were&#xD;
      assayed for cotinine using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry as&#xD;
      an indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke.&#xD;

    <description>Behavioral counseling used evidence-based smoking cessation intervention components as well as a theoretically-framed focus on behavioral shaping to promote the adoption of smoke-free homes and cars. Sessions included two, 1-hour in-home counseling and seven, 5-15 minute telephone follow-up sessions over 16 weeks. Content included health ed around the benefits of eliminating children's exposure to secondhand smoke; skills training around adoption and maintenance of smoke-free environments; goal setting, problem solving, and positive reinforcement for progress toward goals; coping skills training for smoking urge and mood management; and home support for maternal smoking behavior change achieve through family contracts and home detailing promoting pro-smoke-free home norms.</description>
