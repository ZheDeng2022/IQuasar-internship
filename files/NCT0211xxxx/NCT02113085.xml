      The purpose of the study is to implement a full-scale efficacy trial of the My Life program.&#xD;
      Conducted in partnership with the Oregon DHS Foster Care Program, the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention will be being evaluated with a randomized experimental longitudinal design. Two&#xD;
      hundred and ten youth, ages 16.5-17.5, will be enrolled in 3 waves, and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either a comparison group that receives typical foster care services or to a treatment group&#xD;
      that participates in the key elements of the model, including instruction in&#xD;
      self-determination skills, support in leading their own coordinated inter-agency transition&#xD;
      planning meetings, and participation in workshops with mentors. Outcomes, including youth&#xD;
      self-determination, quality of life, employment, mental health, educational achievement and&#xD;
      independent living, are assessed pre-intervention, at the conclusion of intervention, and at&#xD;
      12 months post-intervention. The proposed study will provide important information on the&#xD;
      efficacy of the model for all youth exiting the foster care system, yielding unequivocal data&#xD;
      on whether enhanced self-determination mediates, at least partially, various outcome areas,&#xD;
      including mental health, educational achievement, employment, independent living, and quality&#xD;
      of life; evaluating the effect of special education status, gender, and race as moderating&#xD;
      influences on the impact of the intervention. Foster care experiences, such as trauma and&#xD;
      placement instability, will be considered as covariates; direct effects of the intervention&#xD;
      on these key foster care experiences will also be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to their same age peers in the general population, youth who transition to adult&#xD;
      living from foster care are less likely to have stable housing, to be connected to a caring&#xD;
      adult, to graduate from high school, to go to college, or to be employed (e.g., Avery, 2001;&#xD;
      Pecora et al., 2003; Goerge et al., 2002). They are more likely to engage in risky sexual&#xD;
      behaviors, to become a single parent, and to be homeless or involved in the criminal justice&#xD;
      system (e.g., Courtney et al., 2006; Smithgall, Gladden, Yang &amp; Goerge, 2005). While&#xD;
      consensus exists about the poor outcomes of these youth and policies have been adopted (e.g.,&#xD;
      Foster Care Independence Act) aimed at improving their transition, evidence-based practices&#xD;
      have yet to be validated for achieving this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skill development focused on self-determination enhancement, shown to be associated with&#xD;
      transition success of young people in special education, could have unrealized potential to&#xD;
      prepare youth in foster care for the sudden independence they experience when they abruptly&#xD;
      age out of foster care. The overlapping nature of these at risk groups (approximately 40% of&#xD;
      youth in foster care receive special education services) further suggests that skill&#xD;
      development for self-determination enhancement could have cross-cutting benefits. To gather&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy and feasibility data for youth approaching transition from foster homes,&#xD;
      a pilot study using a randomized, 2 groups X 3 repeated measures design was conducted in&#xD;
      Oregon (entitled My Life). Sixty youth, ages 16.5 through 17.5, in foster care and special&#xD;
      education, were randomly assigned to either a control group that received community as usual&#xD;
      services (CAU) or an experimental group that received one-to-one coaching designed to enhance&#xD;
      self-determination (My Life). The My Life intervention group experienced a statistically&#xD;
      significant increase in self-determination (as measured by the ARC; Wehmeyer &amp; Kelchner,&#xD;
      1995) in comparison to the control group. Youth who participated in the intervention were&#xD;
      also more likely to exhibit improvement in employment outcomes and in overall well being and&#xD;
      to report greater involvement in the transition planning process over time as compared to the&#xD;
      control group. In addition to providing evidence of its efficacy, the My Life pilot provided&#xD;
      important feasibility information and estimates of effect size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the promising findings of our randomized controlled pilot of the My Life intervention,&#xD;
      the goal of this R01 proposal is to undertake a full-scale efficacy trial of the My Life&#xD;
      program. We are proposing to expand the work conducted in our initial investigation to&#xD;
      include all youth preparing to exit foster care (i.e., youth receiving and not receiving&#xD;
      special education services), and to specifically assess the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
      mental health. The proposed study, which builds on the promising findings of our initial&#xD;
      work, will provide important information on the efficacy of the model for all youth exiting&#xD;
      the foster care system, providing data on the intervention's direct effects on critical&#xD;
      outcomes, including quality of life, mental health, education, employment, employment and&#xD;
      independent living, and whether enhanced self-determination mediates, at least partially, the&#xD;
      intervention's effects on these critical outcomes. Additionally, the study will investigate&#xD;
      whether disability, gender and race moderate the effect of the intervention on distal&#xD;
      outcomes. Trauma symptoms and placement instability experienced at baseline will be&#xD;
      considered as covariates; the potential direct effects of the intervention on these key&#xD;
      foster care experiences also will be explored at completion of treatment and follow along.&#xD;
      The proposed study has four specific aims: 1) We will recruit 210 foster youth, 16.5 to 17.5&#xD;
      years of age and randomly assign them to either the My Life intervention group or a community&#xD;
      as usual control group that receives typical services (CAU). The intervention is designed to&#xD;
      increase youth's self-determination in preparation for aging out of care and to provide for&#xD;
      follow along assessment of their outcomes during this challenging and high-risk period. To&#xD;
      recruit youth, we are collaborating with Oregon DHS and will target Oregon's most densely&#xD;
      populated area: Multnomah County; 2) We will use a multiple agent, multiple indicator&#xD;
      strategy for measuring key constructs to assess youth at baseline, intervention termination&#xD;
      (12-month post-baseline) and follow-up (12-month post-intervention completion). We also will&#xD;
      collect DHS Foster Care and school district archival records at these three time points.&#xD;
      Brief phone interviews will be conducted every 60 days with participating youth regarding&#xD;
      recent service and support utilization, global ratings in key outcome areas, stressful&#xD;
      events, and contact with supportive adults. Thus, a total of 13 60-day phone interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted over the entire 24-month period of study enrollment; 3) Using a series of&#xD;
      modeling analyses, we will test intervention efficacy and the key elements of our theoretical&#xD;
      model. Specifically, we will test for stability versus change of self-determination, mental&#xD;
      health adjustment, academic achievement, quality of life, employment and independent living,&#xD;
      with intervention group assignment (My Life vs. CAU) modeled as a dummy variable with&#xD;
      anticipated direct effects on outcomes for the key constructs. In a second series of&#xD;
      analyses, we will test the hypothesized mediator effects of self-determination on mental&#xD;
      health adjustment, academic success, quality of life, employment and independent living, and&#xD;
      explore whether disability, gender and race moderate the impact of the intervention on key&#xD;
      outcomes. The influence of trauma and placement instability on distal outcomes will be&#xD;
      examined, as will the intervention's impact on these key foster care experiences. 4) We will&#xD;
      track fidelity of implementation to document adherence to intervention protocols and perform&#xD;
      analyses to identify intervention components actively associated with major outcomes as well&#xD;
      as possible differences in intervention components for foster youth with a disability versus&#xD;
      those without. Oregon DHS has a strong interest in this project and we anticipate that they&#xD;
      will work to maintain delivery of active intervention components.&#xD;
