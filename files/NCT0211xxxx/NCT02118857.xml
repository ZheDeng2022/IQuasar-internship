  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human body houses a huge microbial ecosystem, including the intestinal and oral&#xD;
      microbiota. Both these ecosystems, and, in particular, the intestinal one, are responsible&#xD;
      for maintaining human health. The response of the organism to the diet and the relative&#xD;
      alteration of the susceptibility to disease are worth of investigation to comprehend the role&#xD;
      of the microbiota to maintain the state of well being in humans. This concept, which is the&#xD;
      overall scientific basis of the entire project, perfectly fits with the declared scopes of&#xD;
      Horizon 2020. Understanding the impact of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets on human&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota is aligned to the Grand Societal Challenge of the Horizon 2020 scheme,&#xD;
      which is addressing the human nutritional needs and the impact of food on human physiological&#xD;
      functions. In particular, studying the link between dietary habits and the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota activity will be pivotal to improve the food-based promotion of health and well&#xD;
      being. The project aims at studying how the omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets may affect&#xD;
      the oral intake of microorganims, and the composition of the oral and fecal microbiota. With&#xD;
      the aim to build up a permanent European platform for such type of studies, ten Research&#xD;
      Units (RUs) are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National and,&#xD;
      especially, foreign Institutions, covering 12 different countries. About 50 omnivore,&#xD;
      vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be recruited. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be asked to fill in diaries, describing their dietary habits, and to collect biological&#xD;
      samples (saliva, feces and urine), once a week for three weeks. For obvious ethical&#xD;
      constraints, biopsies will be not available in this study. RUs will share their tasks, mainly&#xD;
      depending on the nature of the samples to be studied, namely foods and biological samples.&#xD;
      Based on the different dietary habits, the presumptive intake of microorganims will be&#xD;
      estimated using literature data and, especially, culture-dependent methods. Typing and&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance of some food related microbial communities or foods will be also&#xD;
      investigated. The microbial diversity of foods, whose microbiota has never been studied in&#xD;
      depth, will be characterized by PCR-DGGE and deep sequencing. The metabolome characterization&#xD;
      will complete the overview on foods. After collecting and preparing biological samples from&#xD;
      the three diet groups, the oral and fecal microbiota will be studied. The viable cell number&#xD;
      of several microbial groups will be estimated in fecal samples, before freezing.&#xD;
      Preliminarily, the microbial diversity of saliva and fecal ecosystems will be analyzed&#xD;
      through PCR-DGGE. PCR assessment of genetic basis of antibiotic resistance will be also&#xD;
      carried out. Selected numbers of biological samples will be further subjected to next&#xD;
      generation sequencing, aiming at determining representative individuals/samples of the three&#xD;
      types of diet. Only for feces, representative samples (e.g., 4/5 for each diet) will be&#xD;
      subjected to meta-omics analyses based on meta-genomic, meta-transcriptomic and&#xD;
      meta-proteomic approaches. An integrated and iterative workflow will be also developed, by&#xD;
      assembling an in house synthetic meta-genome. The functionality of fecal samples and/or of&#xD;
      isolates from feces will be characterized based on fecal genotoxic and anti-genotoxic&#xD;
      activities, and modulation of the immune response. In agreement with an holistic approach,&#xD;
      the metabolome analysis of saliva, feces and urine will complete the characterization of&#xD;
      biological samples. All data available from the different RUs will merge into a common&#xD;
      database, whose structure will be developed during the project. Based on the literature data&#xD;
      (ISI Web of Knowledge), this is the first study that aims at correlating the effect of the&#xD;
      main dietary habits on the oral and fecal microbiota through integrated meta-omics analyses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to find the relationship between diet and saliva and&#xD;
      fecal microbiota, through high-throughput and integrated meta-omics (genomic, transcriptomic,&#xD;
      proteomic and metabolomic) analyses. Several questions are still debated within this context.&#xD;
      For instance, what is the daily intake of microbes and their role on the balance of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota? How is the intestinal microbiota affected by the main types of diet&#xD;
      (omnivore, vegetarian and vegan)? Which are the prevailing microbial groups at intestinal&#xD;
      level, depending on the type of diet? What is the presumptive contribution of each microbial&#xD;
      group in maintaining the host health? The quantitative and qualitative determination of the&#xD;
      main microbial groups harboured in foods, depending on dietary habits, responds to an earlier&#xD;
      question and coincides with one of the objectives of this project. The estimation of the&#xD;
      diversity (genomics), functional activity (transcriptomics and proteomics) and metabolites&#xD;
      (metabolomics) of, especially, the fecal microbiota coincide with the holistic approach of&#xD;
      this project and responds to several of the earlier questions. Considering the close&#xD;
      correlation between the balance of different microbial populations in various niches of the&#xD;
      human body and the onset of metabolic pathologies, this project shall furnish novel knowledge&#xD;
      that may highlight possible relationships between diet and dismetabolisms. Diet has to be&#xD;
      considered as the most appropriate and inexpensive tool to determine a stable and favourable&#xD;
      oral and intestinal microbiota, which prevents diseases and guarantees human longevity. These&#xD;
      overall objectives of the project shall be reached on the basis of specific targets, such as:&#xD;
      (i) the identification of biological, molecular and metabolic markers specific to the type of&#xD;
      diet; (ii) the estimation of the differences in the microbiota and metabolome of saliva and&#xD;
      feces, both among individuals and between types of diet; (iii) the estimation of the&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative differences on the microbial intake connected to the type of&#xD;
      diet; and (iv) the identification of the functional features of fecal samples related to the&#xD;
      type of diet, which can be regarded as indicators of disease susceptibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to reach the overall objective of this project, ten Research Units (RUs; RU1-10)&#xD;
      are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National and, especially, foreign&#xD;

           and storage of biological samples, and microbiological analyses of fecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI.1. Recruitment of individuals and administration of diaries (RU1, 4, 6, 8) About 50&#xD;
           omnivore, vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be&#xD;
           recruited.Vegetarian and vegan individuals will be recruited with the cooperation of the&#xD;
           Italian Scientific Society of Vegetarian Nutrition. Omnivore individuals will be&#xD;
           recruited through advertisements published at the Universities. About 50 healthy&#xD;
           volunteers will be recruited including an approximately equal number of omnivores,&#xD;
           vegetarians and vegans (age 18-59 years, male/female ratio ca. 1:1). Recruited&#xD;
           volunteers will be asked to sign a consensus document, to record their dietary habits.&#xD;
           The diaries will be elaborate to get detailed information on food characteristics,&#xD;
           allowing an easy identification of the products on the market and an estimation of the&#xD;
           presumptive microbial load ingested. The Ethics Committee of the Universities will be&#xD;
           informed before the project will start.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI.2. Handling, preparation and storage of biological samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). Each&#xD;
           individual will supply samples of saliva, feces and urine weekly, for a time span of&#xD;
           three weeks. Triplicate samples will be pooled before analyses in order to limit the&#xD;
           intra-individual variability. Handling will be carried out differently depending on the&#xD;
           type of biological samples (saliva, feces, urine) and subsequent analyses (e.g., DNA,&#xD;
           RNA, proteome). Simultaneously with the recruitment of individuals and collection of&#xD;
           biological samples, most of the RUs will be involved in setting up the&#xD;
           techniques/methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI.3. Microbiological analyses of fecal samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). In the first time the&#xD;
           viable counts will be performed by plating fresh fecal material on different selective&#xD;
           culture media, to enumerate the most common fecal microbial groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AI.4. Set up of techniques/methods (RU1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Simultaneously with&#xD;
           the recruitment of individuals and collection of biological samples, most of the RUs&#xD;
           will be involved in setting up the techniques/methods. In order to establish an&#xD;
           independent and competitive platform for meta-omics analyses, RU3 will purchase&#xD;
           equipment for high throughput sequencing, which is a main economic investment in this&#xD;
           project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTIVITY II. Food microbiota and metabolome. Based on the information from dietary&#xD;
           diaries, the most representative foods of the 3 diets will be split in 3 categories: (i)&#xD;
           low (TBC, 10^3 cfu/g); (ii) intermediate (TBC 10^3 - 10^6 cfu/g); and (iii) high (TBC ¬≥&#xD;
           10^6 cfu/g) microbial load. For foods of group (i) the microbial number will be&#xD;
           estimated based on literature data. For foods of groups (ii) and (iii) the microbial&#xD;
           number will be determined based on literature data in the case of well known products&#xD;
           with low market differentiation (e.g., Parmigiano Reggiano cheese), whereas appropriate&#xD;
           analyses will be done in the case of products with large market variability (e.g.,&#xD;
           Mozzarella cheese). In the latter case, the analyses will involve a large number of&#xD;
           products available in the market. The microbial diversity of foods will be studied more&#xD;
           in depth first by PCR-DGGE (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel&#xD;
           electrophoresis) and when needed by deep sequencing on the basis of level of complexity&#xD;
           and current knowledge of the microbiota of the specific foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AII.1 Quantitative determination of microorganisms in foods (RU 4, 5; 7). The analysis&#xD;
           of foods will be shared between RU4 and 5, and some samples will be analysed by both RU&#xD;
           to reciprocally validate the results. Subsequently, RU4 will characterize selected foods&#xD;
           by LH-PCR (Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis, and the results&#xD;
           will be compared with those obtained by RU7 using PCR-DGGE. RU5 will identify a large&#xD;
           collection of isolates from foods, aiming at finding possible relationships with a&#xD;
           reduced anti-genotoxic activity of the fecal waters and presence of specific&#xD;
           microorgansims in the ingested foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AII.2 Microbial diversity in foods (RU 2, 3). First, this activity will consider poorly&#xD;
           characterized foods that are specifically eaten by veregetarians and vegans based on&#xD;
           records from diaries. Both micro- and mico-biota will be investigated. PCR-DGGE analyses&#xD;
           for yeasts and filamentous fungi will be based on the amplification of parts of the&#xD;
           D1/D2 domain encoding for the subunit LSU or 26S of the rRNA, and the ITS (Internal&#xD;
           transcribed spacer) regions. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene will be targeted to&#xD;
           detect bacteria. After DGGE analysis, the resulting gels will be digitalised and&#xD;
           analysed by the software Bionumerics. Dendrograms will be subjected to cluster analysis&#xD;
           to exclude from the further sequencing those samples having a coefficient of similarity&#xD;
           85%; such selection will save costs of the next generation sequencing, and will assure&#xD;
           to get a manageable quantity of data to be analyzed via bio-informatics. RU3 will&#xD;
           perform the deep sequencing using libraries of amplicons of variable genes of taxonomic&#xD;
           interest and using specific procedures according to the type of sequencing platform that&#xD;
           will be purchased. The sequencing results will be elaborated on a bioinformatic basis by&#xD;
           the RU2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AII.3 Food metabolome (RU 10). Based on the information on dietary habits, the fermented&#xD;
           foods most represented in the three diets, will be analysed to find a possible&#xD;
           relationship between chemical compounds ingested (e.g., salycilic acid) and&#xD;
           presumptively recovered in biological samples. The metabolome analyses will be carried&#xD;
           out by GC-MS/SPME (Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry /solid-phase microextraction)&#xD;
           and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTIVITY III. The microbiota of feces and saliva. Preliminarily, all saliva and fecal&#xD;
           samples from all the ca. 150 volunteers will be subjected to PCR-DGGE analyses to get an&#xD;
           overview of the microbial diversity. RT-PCR-DGGE (Real Time- Polymerase Chain Reaction-&#xD;
           Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) will be also considered to estimate viable&#xD;
           populations in feces. Based on these analyses, representative samples of each dietary&#xD;
           habit will be subjected to next generation sequencing. The output of all these results&#xD;
           should allow, step by step, the selection of 4/5 fecal samples for each of the three&#xD;
           diets to be subjected to meta-omics analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTIVITY III.1. Study of the biodiversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.1.1. PCR-DGGE Profiling (RU 2, 3, 8) PCR-DGGE analyses for yeasts and filamentous&#xD;
           fungi will target 26S rRNA and ITS regions, while V3 and/or V6-V8 regions of the 16S&#xD;
           rRNA will be studied for bacteria. Both DNA and RNA (after RT-PCR) will be used as&#xD;
           target to investigate total and viable populations, respectively. Under the same&#xD;
           experimental conditions, RU3 will characterize the bacterial diversity of saliva&#xD;
           samples. After DGGE, image and cluster analyses from DNA and RNA samples it will be&#xD;
           possible to define a difference between the global and viable population. The&#xD;
           dendrograms of similarity will be used to exclude from the further sequencing activity&#xD;
           those samples having a coefficient of similarity ¬≥ 85%; such selection will save costs&#xD;
           of the next generation sequencing analyses, and will assure to get a manageable quantity&#xD;
           of data to be analyzed via bio-informatics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.1.2. Next Generation Sequencing (RU 3, 8) Deep sequencing on selected saliva and&#xD;
           fecal samples will be done using libraries of amplicons of variable genes of taxonomic&#xD;
           interest. All sequencing results obtained both for bacteria and fungi will be elaborated&#xD;
           on a bioinformatic basis by the RU2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.1.3. Antibiotic resistance (RU 7) DNA extracted directly from saliva and fecals&#xD;
           samples will be screened for the occurrence of genes encoding for resistances to several&#xD;
           antibiotics using PCR assays. Samples, resulted to be positive for antibiotic resistance&#xD;
           (AR) genes, will be used to isolate antibiotic-resistant lactobacilli, lactococci and&#xD;
           enterococci. After identification, isolates showing values of minimum inhibitory&#xD;
           concentration (MIC) higher than the corresponding breakpoints will be confirmed by PCR&#xD;
           amplification of the corresponding AR genes. The possibility of transferring AR genes&#xD;
           localized on genetic mobile elements from isolates to bacteria of clinical interest will&#xD;
           be evaluated by conjugation trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.2. Meta-omics analyses of selected fecal samples According to the cascade approach,&#xD;
           the results from the study of the microbial diversity of fecal samples will select 4/5&#xD;
           individuals representative of each of the 3 types of diet (4/5 x 3 = 12/15) to be&#xD;
           subjected to meta-omics analyses. The meta-omics approaches will provide an in house&#xD;
           database, consisting of the DNA and RNA sequences from the fecal microbiomes of the&#xD;
           12/15 individuals, which will allow a complete view of the synthesized proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.2.1. Meta-genomics (RU3, 8) Fecal DNA will be quantified and a shotgun sequencing&#xD;
           protocol will be applied for meta-genomic analysis. This task should be performed by the&#xD;
           RU3, depending on performance and availability of the sequencing platform, which will be&#xD;
           engaged full time in the analysis of DNA and cDNA amplicons of feces and saliva.&#xD;
           Alternatively, specialized companies will carry out this task as a service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.2.2. Meta-transcriptomics (RU 6) The overall microbial gene expression profile will&#xD;
           be characterized using an innovative Illumina-based Metatranscriptomic approach and the&#xD;
           protocol set up during first months of the project. cDNA will be sinthetised from RNA&#xD;
           according to optimized procedures. Random amplification of the cDNA will be performed&#xD;
           and the cDNA will be sequenced by using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The sequenced&#xD;
           meta-transcriptomes will be assembled together using Velvet/MetaVelvet or SOAPdenovo&#xD;
           packages to achieve the largest possible consensus sequence. The transcripts sequences&#xD;
           will be annotated using well-established pipelines and transcripts will be searched&#xD;
           using RPS-BLAST (Reversed Position Specific- Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) against&#xD;
           KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) and&#xD;
           the Genbank databases. Bacteria-like reads identified by nr BLASTX will be further&#xD;
           searched against the COG database. The functional roles of the sequences will be&#xD;
           assigned based on the KEGG and COG searches.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIII.2.3. Meta-proteomics (RU1) Based on the workflow designed within the first months&#xD;
           of activity, proteins will be extracted from each fecal sample and analysed by gel-free&#xD;
           and/or gel-based proteomics. The identification of peptides will be performed using the&#xD;
           mass spectrometer Finnigan LCQ Deca XP MAX. Differential proteomic analysis will be&#xD;
           carried out. For peptide identification, the Open Mass Spectra Search Algorithm will be&#xD;
           used to search MS/MS spectra against the available databases. To retrieve further&#xD;
           functional information, the proteins based on COG classification will be annotated. The&#xD;
           identified COGs will be mapped on KEGG metabolic pathways database and visualized by the&#xD;
           online application of iPath. After FDR correction, all identified peptides will be&#xD;
           searched against UniProtKB and then mapped. To address the highest functional level of&#xD;
           all the identified proteins, the identified COGs onto KEGG pathways will be mapped.&#xD;
           Besides the common microbial core, inter-individual and inter-diet differences will be&#xD;
           determined in terms of metabolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTIVITY IV. Functional characterization. The characterization of some functional&#xD;
           features of fecal samples and of microbial isolates from fecal samples will strengthen&#xD;
           the link between diet and intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIV.1 Fecal genotoxic and anti-genotoxic activities (RU 5) Samples of fecal water (FW)&#xD;
           will be prepared and the genotoxicity will be determined by Comet assay. The HT29&#xD;
           enterocytes (10^6 cells/assay) co-exposed to FW and incorporated into LMA slide will be&#xD;
           subjected to Single-Cell Gel-Electrophoresis (SCGE) and analysed by epifluorescence.&#xD;
           Several microbial isolates from foods will be investigated for the inhibitory activity&#xD;
           towards genotoxic and mutagenic compounds, which are potentially present in the&#xD;
           intestine. The effect of the microorganism-genotoxin co-incubation will be assayed&#xD;
           through the evaluation of the residual genotoxic activity of the compounds using the&#xD;
           SOS-Chromotest (target Escherichia coli PQ37 sfiA:lacZ) and, in parallel, the Comet&#xD;
           assay (target enterocytes HT29).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AIV.2. Fecal microorganisms and modulation of the immune response (RU 9) The conditions&#xD;
           for growth and differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) and Caco-2 cells will be set up&#xD;
           within the first months of activity. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria will be isolated&#xD;
           from all fecal samples and used as irradiated bacteria to detect the expression of&#xD;
           immune mediators in enterocytes. Transcript and cognate protein secretion levels of IL-8&#xD;
           and tolerogenic TGF-beta (Transforming growth factor beta) and TSLP (Thymic Stromal&#xD;
           Lymphopoietin) will be determined. Irradiated bacteria will be also used to stimulate&#xD;
           surface markers in DC cells. Total RNA will be extracted from the Caco-2 and DC cells,&#xD;
           and cDNA will be prepared to look at the relative gene expression of IL-8, TGF-beta,&#xD;
           TSLP, TNF-alpha, IL-12p40 and IL-10; the concentration of the corresponding gene&#xD;
           products will be determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ATTIVITY V. Saliva, fecal and urine metabolome (RU10). To complete the &quot;omics&quot; approach,&#xD;
           the metabolome of samples of feces, urine and saliva will be analysed with three&#xD;
           techniques (GC-MS/SPME, FTIR/ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared/Attenuated Total&#xD;
           Reflectance) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) according to the protocols previously&#xD;
           set up. Chemical compounds will be identified using mass spectra databases as well as&#xD;
           mass spectra data in the literature and/or data from pure chemical compounds. Upon&#xD;
           thawing of urine and saliva samples, the NMR analysis will be performed within 2 h.&#xD;
           Fecal samples will be prepared giving the maximum importance to the complete recovery of&#xD;
           water-soluble molecules. The NMR spectra will be prepared for statistical analysis by&#xD;
           correcting the little peaks misalignments through iCoshift algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ATTIVITY VI. Statistical elaboration of the results (all RUs). During project&#xD;
           development, RU2 will take care of the maintenance of the website in collaboration with&#xD;
           the partner CBS (Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, NL), the site will&#xD;
           collect all the results from the different research activities. This database will be&#xD;
           used for analysis in &quot;R mode&quot; to assess the impact of various descriptors in determining&#xD;
           the diversity of the three diets, and in &quot;Q mode&quot; to determine difference between the&#xD;
           three diets. During the same time, the most relevant results will be disseminated&#xD;
           through scientific publications into peer-reviewed journals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking into account the topic to be studied, this project has undoubtedly applied potential&#xD;
      aspects. For instance, the knowledge of the effect of diet on human microbiota could result&#xD;
      in the preparation of appropriate guidelines to be distributed in campaigns of integrated&#xD;
      care promotion. Consumer preferences, attitudes, needs, behaviour, lifestyle and education&#xD;
      will be taken care of, and communication between consumers and the food chain research&#xD;
      community will be enhanced in order to improve informed choice and its impact on quality of&#xD;
      life. Empowering individuals to improve and manage their health through correct dietary&#xD;
      habits will result in cost savings to healthcare systems.&#xD;
