  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most relevant factor predicting morbidity and mortality after liver resections is the&#xD;
      ability of the remnant liver to regenerate. The investigators recently demonstrated that&#xD;
      serotonin and thrombospondin-1, two growth factors abundantly stored in platelets, seem to&#xD;
      play a critical role in liver regeneration of patients after liver resection. The&#xD;
      investigators now aim to gain more precise insight concerning the relevance of platelets and&#xD;
      platelet derived growth factors in liver regeneration in humans. The investigators will focus&#xD;
      on specific alpha-granula release as a key regulator of postoperative LR. Using peri- and&#xD;
      intraoperative blood and tissue samples, platelet adhesion, granula release and induction of&#xD;
      gene expression known to be involved in liver regeneration form experimental studies will be&#xD;
      analyzed. This study should allow the investigators to verify observations from preclinical&#xD;
      models and evaluate their relevance in the human setting. Furthermore, this might enable the&#xD;
      investigators to identify new therapeutic targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators could previously show that platelet derived growth factors like TSP-1 and&#xD;
      5-HT are of relevance in human liver regeneration. In this project the investigators aim to&#xD;
      elucidate how platelets specifically release their granules. Indeed, while dense granules&#xD;
      stored 5-HT induces proliferation of hepatocytes, alpha-granules stored TSP-1 reduces their&#xD;
      proliferative potential. More importantly, various pro-proliferative growth factors as VEGF&#xD;
      are also stored in alpha-granules. Therefore, a systemic reduction in platelet counts would&#xD;
      reduce both, pro and anti-proliferative factors. A highly regulated granula release has been&#xD;
      postulated to allow platelets to exert specific functions. In 2008, Italiano et al. presented&#xD;
      convincing in vitro evidence that platelets store molecules in separate granules, which they&#xD;
      are able to specifically release upon platelet activation. Furthermore, results by other&#xD;
      groups support this finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the aim of this project to characterize platelet activation in patients with liver&#xD;
      resection and determine if specific platelet activation profiles correlate with clinical&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 40 patients undergoing hemihepatectomy will be included. Patients will be closely&#xD;
      monitored perioperatively. Plasma, serum, platelet and tissue preparation will be performed&#xD;
      as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis No. 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating platelet activation markers increase after liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To confirm the investigators initial observation of specific granula release, platelet&#xD;
      activation will be monitored during liver regeneration. In particular, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate platelet activation markers during the perioperative period. In a descriptive&#xD;
      manner, the investigators will identify perioperative fluctuations of platelet activation as&#xD;
      a reflection of physiologic processes during liver regeneration. This should enable the&#xD;
      investigators to elucidate the occurrence of platelet activation in the human setting, as it&#xD;
      has been described in murine models. More importantly, the investigators analyses could&#xD;
      identify potential treatment targets in patients with insufficient hepatic regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis No. 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra platelet granula contents decrease after liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioactive molecules stored in platelet alpha granules (intra platelet - IP), will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the perioperative period. As during serum preparation all platelets&#xD;
      degranulate, IP levels of granula contents will be calculated by subtraction of plasma from&#xD;
      serum growth factor values. Furthermore to confirm these calculated values, platelet extracts&#xD;
      will be generated and comparatively analyzed for IP growth factor levels. The investigators&#xD;
      will further be able to identify perioperative fluctuations of IP growth factors as a&#xD;
      reflection of specific intrahepatic release during liver regeneration, by comparing blood&#xD;
      samples prior and one day after liver resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis No. 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelets are locally enriched and activated at the site of liver regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the process of a classical hemihepatectomy, the portal vein of the tumor containing&#xD;
      liver lobe is initially ligated before mobilization and dissection of the liver. The increase&#xD;
      of portal pressure within the remaining liver after partial hepatectomy is believed to be the&#xD;
      major inducer of liver regeneration. (37-40) To evaluate if platelets play a critical role&#xD;
      during the process of initiation of liver regeneration, tissue specimens will be collected&#xD;
      prior to portal vein ligation and one hour after portal vein ligation (at the time of&#xD;
      initiation of liver regeneration)(study design is illustrated in figure 3). Liver specimens&#xD;
      will then be comparatively analyzed for platelet adhesion and protein as well as mRNA&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further evaluate the relevance of platelets in the tightly regulated process of liver&#xD;
      regeneration, blood will be collected 1 hour after portal vein ligation. In particular, blood&#xD;
      will be drawn from the portal vein (prior to the liver) and from a liver vein (after the&#xD;
      liver). From these samples platelets will be isolated and the degree of activation will be&#xD;
      evaluated (details see below). Furthermore, the content of IP growth factors and platelet&#xD;
      extracts will be analyzed to reflect their intrahepatic release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis No. 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative platelet activation has an impact on postoperative outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The predictive potential of platelet activation markers and IP growth factors to identify&#xD;
      patients with poor postoperative clinical outcome will be analyzed. As outcome parameters&#xD;
      postoperative LD, morbidity or mortality will be evaluated. These analyses might identify&#xD;
      markers to select patients that should not undergo hepatectomy but be better served with&#xD;
      alternative treatments. Furthermore, potential treatment targets in patients with&#xD;
      insufficient hepatic regeneration could be identified.&#xD;
