  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety profile, initial response rates and&#xD;
      progression free survival for the combination therapy of neoadjuvant system ipilimumab&#xD;
      followed by ILI with melphalan in patients with in transit melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will lead to a larger response rate&#xD;
      than either therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of regional LPAm plus systemic ipilimumab will cause larger changes in immune&#xD;
      cell populations than are seen with either therapy along.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in immune cell populations will predict progression free survival.&#xD;

             IIIB, IIIC, or stage IV (AJCC staging must be documented in patient's medical record,&#xD;
             as determined by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and/or whole body PET scan, and&#xD;
             MRI of the brain within 4 weeks prior to administration of study drug)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with Stage IV disease must have had all distant disease resected at least 30&#xD;
             days prior to regional treatment.&#xD;

          3. Patient must be greater than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod status of 0-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient's disease must be bi-dimensionally measurable by caliper or radiological&#xD;
             method as defined in the RECIST criteria. For subjects with a single lesion, archived&#xD;
             tissue must be available for research analysis. The sum of target lesion diameters&#xD;
             should be at least 10 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Disease to be treated by ILI must be distal to the planned site of tourniquet&#xD;
             placement (which for the leg is generally the apex of the femoral triangle, or for the&#xD;
             arm is distal to the deltoid insertion). If provider feels ILI appropriate with&#xD;
             disease in these areas, patient may be enrolled with PI approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient must have adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. White blood count (WBC) of greater than 2000 m3&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the&#xD;
             last dose of investigational product, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is&#xD;
             minimized. WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not&#xD;
             undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation,&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy&#xD;
                  (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater than&#xD;

             products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products&#xD;
             such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to&#xD;
             prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (eg,&#xD;
             vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or&#xD;
             equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours before the start of ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Men of fathering potential must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid&#xD;
             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of&#xD;
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient must provide a signed and dated written informed consent prior to registration&#xD;
             and any study-related procedures.&#xD;

             protected health information at any institution subject to US HIPAA regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Ability to read and understand English and the ability to complete paper +/-&#xD;
             electronic survey assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             not have unstable angina (angina symptoms at rest) or new onset angina (began within&#xD;
             the last 3 months) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Autoimmune disease: History of or current active autoimmune diseases, [e.g. including&#xD;
             but not limited to inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD], rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune&#xD;

             systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune vasculitis, autoimmune neuropathies (such as&#xD;
             Guillain-Barre syndrome). Vitiligo and adequately controlled endocrine deficiencies&#xD;
             such as hypothyroidism are not exclusionary.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have had a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI&#xD;
             obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel&#xD;
             perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of or current immunodeficiency disease [e.g. splenectomy or splenic&#xD;
             irradiation].&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Psychiatric conditions or diminished capacity that could compromise the giving of&#xD;
             informed consent, or interfere with study compliance; any underlying medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the investigator will make the&#xD;
             administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a&#xD;
             condition associated with frequent diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2, interferon, or other non-study&#xD;

             investigation therapies; or chronic use of systemic corticosteroids (used in the&#xD;
             management of cancer or non-cancer-related illnesses). However, during the course of&#xD;
             the study, use of corticosteroids is allowed if used for treating irAEs, adrenal&#xD;
             insufficiencies, or if administered at doses of prednisone greater than or equal to&#xD;
             7.5mg daily or equivalent.&#xD;

                  pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after cessation&#xD;
                  of study drug, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of&#xD;
             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is&#xD;
             stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course&#xD;
             of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before study&#xD;
             enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study&#xD;
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. All WOCBP&#xD;
             MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving ipilimumab. If the&#xD;
             pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive ipilimumab and must not be&#xD;
             enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Antineoplastic therapy, radiotherapy, or any other investigational drug within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to first study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Current treatment, or treatment in the previous 24 months, for another non-melanoma&#xD;
             malignancy, with the exception of adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
