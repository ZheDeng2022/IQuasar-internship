    <textblock>
      The purpose of the first part of this study or the dose escalation portion of the study is to&#xD;
      determine what dose of BKM120 and Abraxane is safe to give when the two drugs are used at the&#xD;
      same time in patients who are diagnosed with a solid cancer. A solid cancer is a cancer that&#xD;
      does not involve the blood, bone marrow or lymph nodes. Dose escalation determines the least&#xD;
      toxic and most effect dose of this drug combination for treatment. Once this dose is&#xD;
      established, it will be used for the dose expansion phase of the study where we will&#xD;
      determine the effect of BKM120 and Abraxane in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial&#xD;
      or ovarian cancer. We will see whether the combination of both drugs improves the response&#xD;
      and survival of patients treated on the two drug regimen. Also we will try to find out&#xD;
      whether there are changes in tumors that can help us determine what patients are more likely&#xD;
      to respond to BKM120 and Abraxane.&#xD;

      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of BKM120 in combination with weekly&#xD;
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with a recurrent solid tumor and in particular a&#xD;
           recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the MTD and DLT of BKM120 in combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel&#xD;
           (Abraxane®) thereby establishing the recommended phase II dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain pilot data on the clinical tumor response utilizing RECIST criteria of BKM120 in&#xD;
           combination with weekly nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) in patients with a history of&#xD;
           recurrent endometrial or a recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated with BKM120 and&#xD;
           nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane®) and a history of recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore molecular markers that my serve as potential molecular predictors of response&#xD;
           including PIK3CA, mTOR, KRAS, PTEN and p53 mutations as well as amplification of ErbB2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To test the predictive value of PIK3CA and KRAS mutations in predicting response to this&#xD;
           regimen in women diagnosed with a recurrent endometrial or ovarian cancer.&#xD;

                  contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                       of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without&#xD;
                       hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of&#xD;
                       oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                       confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects&#xD;
                       on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for&#xD;
                       that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;

&#xD;
                         2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                            suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as&#xD;
                  BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving&#xD;
                  offspring must use condom during treatment and for an additional 16 weeks after&#xD;

                  during dosing of any study agent and for 16 weeks after final dose of study&#xD;
                  therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
