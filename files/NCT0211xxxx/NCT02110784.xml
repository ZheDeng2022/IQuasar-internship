    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      therapeutic course of Eurartesim® in travellers who contracted malaria due to infection by P.&#xD;
      vivax in endemic countries.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vivax malaria occurs throughout the tropical, subtropical and some of the temperate latitudes&#xD;
      globally. During a primary infection some P. vivax parasites become dormant in the liver&#xD;
      (hypnozoites) during large periods of time and might subsequently cause multiple blood-stage&#xD;
      relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asexual stages of P. vivax are generally still sensitive to chloroquine (CQ) throughout&#xD;
      most of the world with the exception of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea where high therapeutic&#xD;
      failure rates ranging from 5-84% have been reported. Also, there are reports of chloroquine&#xD;
      failure from other countries and regions where the species is endemic; in particular, the&#xD;
      presence of CQ-resistant vivax strains is now well described in several countries, including&#xD;
      India, Brazil, Peru and Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of the dormant stages and the prevention of relapses is reached throughout the&#xD;
      8-aminoquinolines (primaquine is the only commercially available in this indication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatments recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for the radical cure of&#xD;
      CQ-resistant vivax malaria are Artemisinin based Combination Therapies (ACTs) with partner&#xD;
      drugs having very long half-life, combined with a two weeks regiment of primaquine (WHO,&#xD;
      2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among a variety of suitable artemisinin-based combinations, the fixed combination of&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and piperaquine (PQP )is considered an excellent therapeutic&#xD;
      approach since it has got all the requirements considered essential for showing a positive&#xD;
      benefit/risk ratio in malaria therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sigma-Tau i.f.r. S.p.A. has developed a DHA+PQP formulation (Eurartesim®) manufactured&#xD;
      according to international Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards and has recently&#xD;
      received marketing authorization in Europe via a centralized procedure by the European&#xD;
      Medicine Agency (EMA) for uncomplicated episodes of P. falciparum malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A substantial amount of data have been collected in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum&#xD;
      malaria treated with the DHA+PQP combination. In addition, several studies have provided&#xD;
      evidence of high cure rate in patients with P. vivax malaria treated with DHA+PQP, however,&#xD;
      no data are available so far on efficacy and safety of the DHA+PQP treatment in patients with&#xD;
      imported P. vivax malaria. Acquiring data is therefore of particular importance since malaria&#xD;
      represents an important burden among all travel-acquired illnesses considering not only the&#xD;
      number of cases (10-20% of the imported malaria cases are due to P. vivax infection) but also&#xD;
      the potential of a fatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      therapeutic course of Eurartesim® in travellers who contracted malaria due to infection by P.&#xD;
      vivax in endemic countries. The results of such &quot;proof of concept&quot; study will be used for&#xD;
      estimating the failure rate in a precise way and to dimension one or more subsequent phase&#xD;
      III trials of comparative efficacy.&#xD;
