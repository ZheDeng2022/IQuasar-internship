      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess whether probiotic supplementation reduces the frequency of recurrent wheezing in&#xD;
           infants .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identifying the presence of environmental and genetic factors to recurrent wheezing in&#xD;
           infants, which may serve as major confounders of the effect of probiotics in the sample&#xD;
           studied risk factors .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check the effect of probiotics as the recurrence of wheezing in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effects of probiotics on the immune response of the infant wheezing ,&#xD;
           through the measurement of IL - 10 , IL - 12 and Interferon-gama before and after&#xD;
           intervention with the use of probiotics .&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Patients attended at the Infant Hospital of the Federal University of Pernambuco will&#xD;
           undergo clinical investigation and completion of baseline examinations is eligible to&#xD;
           participate in the study after informed consent from parents or guardians. Infants with&#xD;
           recurrent wheezing, six months to two years of age, will be divided into two groups -&#xD;
           one receiving the formula with probiotics (treatment group) and the other formula with&#xD;
           similar organoleptic characteristics, placebo (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowchart of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;

           flowchart second Guide - 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMPLEMENTATION OF RESEARCH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local and survey period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital das Clinicals, Federal University of Pernambuco - UFPE, Brazil. Period April&#xD;
           2014 to Abril 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method of Selection of Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample selection of recurring wheezing infants attended at Infant Hospital das Clinicas&#xD;
           UFPE, to be considered eligible for admission to the study and meet the criteria for&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion. The wheezing infants selected as eligible for the study&#xD;
           remained with wheezing even using inhaled corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of Randomization and Allocation Mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A simple randomization of patients will be by draw of numbers 1 - 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed by a third person who used a randomization program on the&#xD;
      computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequence of random numbers, recruitment and allocation of patients to the intervention by&#xD;
      the principal investigator of the study will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample size calculation was based on two studies on probiotics and asthma, whereas a&#xD;
           level of less than 5% , a power study of 80% and an acceptable error of up to 20%, 60&#xD;
           patients significance can be sufficient to analyze the number of desired effect&#xD;
           evaluation of wheezing in infants and reject or accept the null hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operationalization Steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The infants were considered eligible for the study, will have the free and informed&#xD;
           consent to participate in the study signed by their parents and or guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These patients initially attended, shall undergo a medical examination protocol with&#xD;
      questions and answers QE - EISL (technical interview with the parents or guardians) and&#xD;
      achievement of immediate skin test sensitivity to major aeroallergens and food allergens&#xD;
      (mites, cat and dog epithelium, molds, feathers, cockroaches, egg yolk, egg white and cow's&#xD;
      milk proteins) through the skin prick test and chest radiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients before starting probiotics or placebos, will the dosage of the cytokines IL-10,&#xD;
      IL-12 and INF-gamma, IgE and eosinophils.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wheezing infants will be using the inhaled corticosteroid beclomethasone 50mcg - 02 jets&#xD;
      per day (100mcg - dia), found this medication for free, brand name and specifications: Clenil&#xD;
      HFA 50mcg spray 200 doses as initial and fundamental treatment for wheezing this age group,&#xD;
      at doses considered minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formula with probiotics containing 10 CFU (Colony Forming Unit)/g consortium of probiotic&#xD;
      strains of lactobacilli, lactococcus, streptococcus, yeasts and acetobacter type in&#xD;
      appropriate concentrations per gram. It will be supplied in lyophilized form, in each sachet&#xD;
      containing 1 g of the probiotic, to be used in addition to milk, juice or yoghurt in the&#xD;
      first morning meal once daily. The placebo will be supplied in the same way with the same&#xD;
      organoleptic characteristics of formula with probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this period, the infant wheezing present crisis, parents or guardians will note the&#xD;
      day of wheezing attacks and treatment used in a standardized form with open answers, which&#xD;
      will be provided, and will contact you by telephone, with the researcher. Parents or&#xD;
      guardians will receive a daily record of control, to assess the occurrence of wheezing&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eight weeks of using probiotics, infants will undergo new measurement of cytokines IL -&#xD;
      10 , IL - 12 and Interferon - gama, with the objective to evaluate the immune response of&#xD;
      probiotics in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and at the end of each period, the patient will undergo physical examination and&#xD;
      parents or guardians to an interview, to assess the occurrence of wheezing attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data will be analyzed to assess whether supplementation with probiotics reduces the&#xD;
      frequency of wheezing in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Masking and Allocation Mechanism&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third member of the study will assign a number to probiotics and placebo recipients in&#xD;
      accordance with the numbers of randomization, without the knowledge of the investigator and&#xD;
      the patient. Containers should be equal and contain substances of the same organoleptic&#xD;
      characteristics. The containers will be provided in numerical order, as service and previous&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments Measurement and Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
      QE- EISL: written questionnaire (International Study of Wheezing in Infants) - see Appendix&#xD;
      01, which is an instrument consisting of 45 questions on demographic characteristics,&#xD;
      wheezing and its potential risk factors. Originally developed in Spanish, was translated into&#xD;
      Portuguese (Brazilian) and validated. This protocol will be used with closed questions with&#xD;
      answers, using the technical interview, conducted by the researcher, the parents or&#xD;
      guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of Informed Consent Form (ICF) - see apêncice 02 - after approval thereof in having&#xD;
      their children participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control plug - clinical - see Appendix 03: will be used by parents or guardians to describe&#xD;
      the date, &quot; wheezing &quot; and perceived treatment need, while using the probiotic or placebo (08&#xD;
      weeks) and 08 weeks more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prick Test: standardized extracts dihiclorada histamine (10mg/ml) and 0.9% saline (FDA -&#xD;
      Immunotech , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil) will be used. The extracts will be dripped on the volar&#xD;
      surface of the forearm and then performed one puncture with sterile lancet. As a positive&#xD;
      control we histamine and negative saline control. The diameter of each reaction will be&#xD;
      evaluated after 15 minutes and the result expressed as positive if wheal ≥ 3mm negative&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eosinophil count and total serum IgE Dosage: will be held in peripheral blood collection&#xD;
      vessel with qualified professional lab, in the amount of 7.0 ml. The reference values are&#xD;
      appropriate for age and standardization of laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest radiography: held at the radiology department of the Hospital das Clinicals - UFPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of IL - 10 , IL - 12 and Interferon-gama: will be held in peripheral blood collection&#xD;
      vessel with qualified professional lab in the amount of 5.0 ml. This blood will be taken to&#xD;
      the Laboratory Ageu Magalhães, which will be submitted to centrifugation and performed by the&#xD;
      supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the count of cytokines in serum.&#xD;
      Then the cultivation of these cells for 48 hours and subsequent counting of cytokine IL - 10&#xD;
      , IL - 12 and Interferon - gama is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peripheral blood mononuclear cells at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL are collected&#xD;
      from the patients of the treatment group and the placebo group and are incubated with&#xD;
      phytohemaglutinin (PHA ; 10μg/ml) for 48 hours. Production of IL - 10, IL - 12 and Interferon&#xD;
      - gama in culture supernatant will be analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      (ELISA) kits. The detection limit for these cytokines will be 5ρg/ml .&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods for Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For statistical analysis Initially , a probability distribution (percent analysis) is&#xD;
           performed. Subsequently, the techniques of normal distribution and homogeneity of&#xD;
           variances by means of ShapiroWillks and bartlett, respectively, tests will be applied to&#xD;
           characterize the use of the parametric Student's t tests or Manny Whitney for&#xD;
           independent samples. For categorical variables the chi- square test for association with&#xD;
           Yates correction will be used. Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation (&#xD;
           parametric test ) or median and standard error ( nonparametric test ) with a&#xD;
           significance level of p &lt; 0.05 . 21 for Windows 2011 - to generate the analyzes , the&#xD;
           statistical package SPSS will be used.&#xD;
