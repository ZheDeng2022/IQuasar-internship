  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the First-In-Man clinical investigation is to assess the Picasso NAV&#xD;
      Catheter's ability to collect intracardiac signals within the desired chambers (atrial and/or&#xD;
      ventricle) in the heart for the analysis of complex arrhythmias.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation&#xD;
        in this clinical investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age &gt; 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have signed the Patient Informed Consent Form (ICF)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are scheduled to undergo a clinically-indicated catheter ablation&#xD;
             procedure for the management of a complex arrhythmia. (Patients having undergone a&#xD;
             previous ablation procedure may be included.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have failed at least one antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) (including AV nodal&#xD;
             blocking agents such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers) as evidenced by&#xD;
             recurrent symptomatic complex arrhythmia, or intolerable to the AAD&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Complex arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, atypical flutter, ventricular&#xD;
             tachycardia) defined as patients who have been diagnosed with a complex arrhythmia&#xD;
             anytime within the last 5 years prior to enrolment. Symptoms may include, but are not&#xD;
             restricted to, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, left&#xD;
             ventricular dysfunction, or other symptoms, or any combination of the above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. At least one episode of the complex arrhythmia must have been documented by ECG,&#xD;
             Holter, loop recorder, telemetry, implanted device, or transtelephonic monitoring&#xD;
             within 12 months of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post-, and follow-up testing and&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A complex arrhythmia secondary to a reversible cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Atrial arrhythmias: patients with a left atrial size &gt;55 mm (echocardiography,&#xD;
             parasternal long axis view).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction &lt; 25%&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. NYHA Class III or IV&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Significant congenital anomaly or medical problem that in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator would preclude enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Atrial arrhythmias: patients with structural atrial disease such as a prior history of&#xD;
             atriotomy from prior atrial surgery, presence of an atrial septal defect, and/or&#xD;
             presence of an atrial septal closure patch.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of or current blood clotting or bleeding abnormalities, contraindication to&#xD;
             systemic anticoagulation (i.e., heparin, warfarin, dabigatran, or a direct thrombin&#xD;
             inhibitor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects that have ever undergone valvular cardiac surgical procedure (ie,&#xD;
             ventriculotomy, atriotomy, and valve repair or replacement and presence of a&#xD;
             prosthetic valve)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Any cardiac surgery within the past 60 days (2 months) (includes PCI)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Concurrent enrollment in a study evaluating another device or drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A complex arrhythmia secondary to electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, or&#xD;
             non-cardiac cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Presence of intra-cardiac thrombus or myxoma, interatrial baffle or patch, tumor or&#xD;
             other abnormality that precludes catheter introduction or manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Presence of a condition that precludes vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women of child bearing potential whom are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become&#xD;
             pregnant during the course of the clinical investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Active illness or active systemic infection or sepsis.&#xD;
