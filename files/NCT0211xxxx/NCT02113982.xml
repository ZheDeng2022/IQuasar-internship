      This is a 4-stage, non-randomized, open-label, dose escalation and expansion, multicenter&#xD;
      study. A cycle of therapy is 21 days. Stage 1 was a dose-escalation stage. During Stages 2-4,&#xD;
      patients are treated at the MTD or maximum tested dose at which multiple DLTs are not&#xD;
      observed during Stage 1.&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Has evidence of persistent or recurrent AML in the peripheral blood and/or bone&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities Grade ≥ 2 from previous&#xD;
             chemotherapy (excluding alopecia, nausea, fatigue, and liver function tests (as&#xD;
             mandated in the inclusion criteria)).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, wide-field radiation, or&#xD;
             biologic therapy within 14 days of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The patient has received treatment with another investigational agent within 14 days&#xD;
             of study entry.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. The patient has an active malignancy and/or cancer history (excluding AML, BPDCN, or&#xD;
             antecedent MDS) that may confound the assessment of the study endpoints. Patients with&#xD;
             a past cancer history (within 2 years of entry) with substantial potential for&#xD;
             recurrence and/or ongoing active malignancy must be discussed with the Sponsor before&#xD;
             study entry. Patients with the following neoplastic diagnoses are eligible:&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,&#xD;
             organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or&#xD;
             any NYHA Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled angina, history of&#xD;
             myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months of study entry, uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias not controlled by medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., COPD,&#xD;
             pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the investigator would put the patient&#xD;
             at significant risk for pulmonary complications during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The patient has known active or suspected CNS leukemia. If suspected, CNS leukemia&#xD;
             should be ruled out with relevant imaging and/or examination of cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy - with the exception of low-dose&#xD;
             prednisone (≤ 10 mg/day) - for treatment or prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
             (GVHD). If the patient has been on immunosuppressive treatment or prophylaxis for&#xD;
             GVHD, the treatment(s) must have been discontinued at least 14 days prior to study&#xD;
             treatment and there must be no evidence of Grade ≥ 2 GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, DIC, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. The patient is pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. The patient has known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) active or&#xD;
             chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. The patient is oxygen-dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. The patient has any medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator places&#xD;
             the patient at an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stage 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        BPDCN and AML patients will be grouped separately.&#xD;
