      The study is to collect the body composition data using five different methods-bioimpedance&#xD;
      analysis (Tanita®), DXA (GE Medical), BodPod (Life Medical), deuterium dilution (heavy&#xD;
      water), body circumferences (tape measure, TC2), and tissue thickness by ultrasound (GE&#xD;
      Medical, BodyMetrix).&#xD;

      If you are eligible and you choose to participate in this study, you will be asked to come to&#xD;
      the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge between 7:00 and 11:00am after a&#xD;
      10-hour fast (nothing to eat or drink besides water for 10 hours prior to your appointment).&#xD;
      The study visit will take approximately five hours. During the visit, you will complete the&#xD;
      informed consent process and then complete several body measurements and body composition&#xD;
      procedures immediately afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Measurements (about 10 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of body measurements will be taken by trained staff. These measurements include&#xD;
      height and weight. These measurements will be completed twice during this time. You will wear&#xD;
      a hospital gown and bathing suit for these measurements. Your BMI will be calculated from&#xD;
      these measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition and Circumference Measurements Deuterium Dilution (heavy water) This test is&#xD;
      to measure the amount of water in your body. After a fasting urine sample is collected, you&#xD;
      will drink a glass of water that has been enriched with an atom called a stable isotope&#xD;
      (deuterium). After you drink this non-radioactive heavy water, you will provide urine samples&#xD;
      several times over the next 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole Body DXA Scan, about 20 minutes This scan measures the amount of bone, muscle, and fat&#xD;
      in your body. The scan will be performed using a whole-body scanner. You will be required to&#xD;
      wear a hospital gown, to remove all metal-containing objects from your body, and to lie down&#xD;
      on the table. You will be carefully positioned on the table, and your legs will be placed&#xD;
      together using two Velcro straps. A scanner emitting low energy X-rays and a detector will&#xD;
      pass along your body. You will be asked to remain completely still while the scan is in&#xD;
      progress. The scan takes approximately ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) (about 20 minutes):&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests will measure the amount of fat in your body. You will be asked to change into a&#xD;
      hospital gown and to remove all footwear and socks/stockings. Once changed and barefoot, you&#xD;
      will be asked to stand on a scale (similar to a large gym scale) and to hold on to hand&#xD;
      electrodes on each side of the scale. You will be asked to step off of the scale once the&#xD;
      measurement is complete (less than one minute). You will repeat this procedure on three&#xD;
      different BIA systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BodPod (about 30 minutes) This test will estimate the amount of fat mass and fat free mass in&#xD;
      your body. You will be required to change into a swimsuit and swim cap that we will provide&#xD;
      for this procedure. If your swimsuit meets the necessary criteria, you can bring and wear it&#xD;
      for the procedure, or PBRC will provide one for you. You will step onto a scale for a quick&#xD;
      weight measurement. Next, you will sit inside of the system like you are sitting in a chair.&#xD;
      The door of the system will be closed, but you will have a window so that you can see outside&#xD;
      of the system while the measurements are completed. The test will be completed in about 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circumferences (about 30 minutes) This test will measure the circumferences of your waist,&#xD;
      hip, neck, arms, and legs and the lengths of your forearm, upper arm, thigh, and lower leg.&#xD;
      The circumference measurements will be made by a trained observer using a calibrated tape&#xD;
      measure and an automated circumference measurement device (KX-16). These measurements will be&#xD;
      made in about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (about 30 minutes) An ultrasound is a procedure that uses sound waves to create a&#xD;
      picture of an organ or soft tissue. This test measures the size of your tissue thicknesses&#xD;
      for fat and skeletal muscle. For this procedure, you will be asked to raise your shirt,&#xD;
      disrobe from the waist up, or change into a hospital gown and lie flat on your back on an&#xD;
      examination table, or sit on a chair, or stand for measuring your leg dimensions. A gel will&#xD;
      be spread on the ultrasound probe, and the probe will be applied directly to the skin on your&#xD;
      arms, legs, and abdomen. You will feel slight pressure when the probe is applied. The entire&#xD;
      procedure will take approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
