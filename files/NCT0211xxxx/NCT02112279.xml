    <textblock>
      Clostridium-difficile (C-difficile) is a gram positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that&#xD;
      can lead to severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. According to Schroeder (2005),&#xD;
      there are approximately 3 million cases annually with a mortality rate of 1-2.5 %. It is most&#xD;
      often associated with overuse of antibiotics. According to Bartlett &amp; Gerding (2008), 15-25%&#xD;
      of anti-microbial-associated diarrhea is caused by C-difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if donor fecal microbiota transplant via&#xD;
      colonoscopy reduces refractory C-difficile infection better than current routine methods such&#xD;
      as continued antibiotic treatment. Specifically, we hypothesize that fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplant via colonoscopy will result in a higher C-difficile cure rate in affected patients&#xD;
      versus care as usual in a retrospective cohort.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium-difficile (C-difficile) is a gram positive anaerobic spore-forming bacterium that&#xD;
      can lead to severe diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. According to Schroeder (2005),&#xD;
      there are approximately 3 million cases annually with a mortality rate of 1-2.5 %. It is most&#xD;
      often associated with overuse of antibiotics. According to Bartlett &amp; Gerding (2008), 15-25%&#xD;
      of anti-microbial-associated diarrhea is caused by C-difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if donor fecal microbiota transplant via&#xD;
      colonoscopy reduces refractory C-difficile infection better than current routine methods such&#xD;
      as continued antibiotic treatment. Specifically, we hypothesize that fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplant via colonoscopy will result in a higher C-difficile cure rate in affected patients&#xD;
      versus care as usual in a retrospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current concerns with C-difficile&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increase in C-difficile exposure in hospital settings, especially for immune compromised&#xD;
      patients has been noted. The long life of C-difficile spores with poor ability for cleaning&#xD;
      agents to kill the spores is a particular concern for patients in critical care and oncology&#xD;
      units. In addition, although C-difficile has been considered a hospital acquired disease,&#xD;
      there has been an increase in community acquired C-difficile infection with the last few&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concern was expressed by Muto, et al (2005) regarding the relationship between an&#xD;
      unexpected outbreak of C-difficile infection following an increase in fluoroquinalone use.&#xD;
      They found that exposure to levofloxacin was an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      C-difficile-associated diarrhea and appeared to contribute substantially to the outbreak.&#xD;
      They recommended restricted use of levofloxacin and the other implicated antibiotics to&#xD;
      control the outbreak. In 2005 the Center for Disease Control (CDC) issued a warning regarding&#xD;
      a new, highly toxic strain of C-difficile that was resistant to fluoroquinalone antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Sethi, et al, (2010), demonstrated the difficulty in eradicating C-difficile&#xD;
      infections. In their study of fifty-two patients with C-difficile, the bacteria were&#xD;
      suppressed to undetectable levels in stool samples from most patients during treatment. At&#xD;
      1-4 weeks after treatment, 56% of patients who had samples tested were asymptomatic carriers&#xD;
      of C-difficile. They found that skin contamination and environmental shedding of C-difficile&#xD;
      often persist at the time of resolution of diarrhea, and recurrent shedding is common 1-4&#xD;
      weeks after therapy (58% for skin contamination and 50%, for environmental shedding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with fecal microbiota Microbiotas are friendly, beneficial bacteria. Microbiotas&#xD;
      produce essential nutrients such as short-chain fatty acids; control epithelial cell growth;&#xD;
      prevent overgrowth of infectious organisms; boost intestinal immunity; and prevent&#xD;
      inflammation, diarrhea and other intestinal conditions. This essential ecosystem provides an&#xD;
      important balance between health and disease in the body. The goal for fecal microbial&#xD;
      transplant is to re-establish fecal microbial homeostasis with increased microbial diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal microbiota transplants are a relatively new direction in treating C-difficile&#xD;
      infections (CDI) that are refractory to accepted antibiotic treatment. In a retrospective&#xD;
      medical record review of 70 patients with recurrent CDI who had undergone fecal&#xD;
      transplantation performed via colonoscopy, Matilla, et al (2011) concluded that fecal&#xD;
      transplantation through colonoscopy seems to be an effective treatment for recurrent CDI and&#xD;
      also for recurrent CDI caused by the virulent C-difficile 027 strain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a systematic review of the literature, in 317 patients treated across 27 case&#xD;
      series and reports, intestinal microbiota transplant demonstrated disease resolution in 92%&#xD;
      of cases. Among the variables that determined procedural success were treatment prior to&#xD;
      procedure, relationship of the donor to the patient, route of fecal microbiota instillation&#xD;
      and amount of fecal microbiota solution delivered. (Gough, Shaikh &amp; Manges, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-group study was conducted with 13 participants randomized to each group. Results&#xD;
      demonstrated resolution rates of C-difficile were (81%) for the vancomycin group with&#xD;
      subsequent donor fecal transplant via nasoduodenal tube; (31%) vancomycin only group; and&#xD;
      (23%) vancomycin with bowel lavage group; p&lt;0.0001 (van Nood, et al; 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a published report of proceedings of a Canadian Working Group to discuss the issues of&#xD;
      fecal microbiota transplant, many important concerns were brought forward, including the need&#xD;
      for donor screening, standardization of the donor fecal transplant material and the use of&#xD;
      biologic material as an un-approved drug (Allen-Vercoe, et al, 2012). These issues must be&#xD;
      addressed in any study to ensure that patient safety and study reliability are at the&#xD;
      forefront in the determination of the effectiveness of fecal transplant to treat C-difficile&#xD;
      infections that are refractory to approved antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a one-group convenience sample interventional study with a qualitative&#xD;
      component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Active recruitment will involve one-to-one explanations with in-patients at a&#xD;
      community hospital and out-patients presenting one of the study physicians for care of&#xD;
      refractory C-difficile infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures I. Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients must be 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient must have a positive C. difficile test within the 10 days prior to the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continued symptoms of c-difficile infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients must have failed at least two courses of appropriate antibiotic therapy for C.&#xD;
           diff to be a candidate for this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Informed consent must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All antibiotics must be discounted at least 72 hours prior to the infusion. The patient&#xD;
           may continue on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) but their use should be noted pre- and&#xD;
           post- transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A standard colonoscopy prep will be given the day before the procedure (Laxative regimen&#xD;
           and clear liquids only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient must provide a clean, dry blender that will be used to blend the stool mixture.&#xD;
           The blender will be discarded after use and will not be re-used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Donor: if Familial versus purchased donor stool&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The donor must be 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The closer the relationship between the donor and the recipient the better. Spouses and&#xD;
           partners, first degree relatives, or household members are preferred.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Donors must have no history of Hepatitis B or C, HIV, recent communicable disease,&#xD;
           incarceration, high-risk sexual behavior, inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal&#xD;
           malignancy or colon polyps. They may not have traveled an area known to be endemic for&#xD;
           diarrheal illnesses in the past 6 months, taken antibiotics in the past 3 months for any&#xD;
           reason, or be on any immunosuppressive drugs or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Donors must test negative for Hepatitis B and C and HIV, and have stool specimens&#xD;
           negative for C. Difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, ova and parasites, other&#xD;
           pathogenic bacteria, giardia antigen and cryptosporidium antigen within 10 days prior to&#xD;
           the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Informed consent must be obtained from the donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Setting A. A Gastroenterology Laboratory in an acute care 377-bed non-teaching hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Procedure A. Prior to Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Verify physician order for Bowel Recolonization Therapy (or Fecal Bacteriotherapy) via&#xD;
           colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stool from donor must be brought in to the hospital in an approved container, received&#xD;
           by hospital staff, labeled with the donors name, the recipients name and the recipients&#xD;
           medical record number and sent to Endoscopy for preparation for procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) The stool from donor should be formed and of adequate quantity. b) The stool from&#xD;
           donor should be collected as close in time to instillation as possible, preferably&#xD;
           within 6-8 hours of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed consent must be obtained from the donor and the recipient. B. Preparation of&#xD;
           donor sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Personal protective equipment (mask, eye protection, gown and gloves) must be worn&#xD;
           throughout the preparation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blend stool and non-bacteriostatic normal saline in a blender until stool reaches a&#xD;
           liquid slurry consistency. Add more non-bacteriostatic normal saline until desired&#xD;
           consistency achieved. The stool should be blended to the approximate consistency of a&#xD;
           milkshake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Filter stool solution into a sterile container with 6 layers of gauze pads, removing as&#xD;
           much particulate matter as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Large volumes of 300-700 ml should be used for delivery through the colonoscope into the&#xD;
           cecum or terminal ileum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Container with fecal slurry must be labeled with recipients identification information&#xD;
           and delivered immediately to bedside for instillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Instillation via Colonoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Stool mixture is administered into the terminal ileum and cecum through the biopsy channel&#xD;
      of a colonoscope while the patient is sedated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Equipment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           (1) 5 syringes (at least 60 cc each) (2) K-Y jelly or water-soluble lubricant (3) Chux&#xD;
           pads (4) Exam gloves&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Complete hand hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Verify correct patient by using two patient identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Put on gloves and place a drape/chux under the patients buttocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Administer 300-700 ml of slurry through biopsy channel of colonoscope with a piston&#xD;
           syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Dispose of any leftover slurry into toilet. Dispose of waste.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Remove gloves and complete hand hygiene.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Document&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Date and time of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Amount of fecal slurry administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Results and patients response to procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Observe patient for at least 15-30 minutes, until VS are stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurement and data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All study patients will keep a stool diary for the 30 days following the transplant&#xD;
                noting number of stools, time of passage, character of stool, and any changes in&#xD;
                the patients quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All study patients will have a C. difficile toxin determination test at 14 days and&#xD;
                28 days after the procedure per physician order. C. difficile testing may be&#xD;
                conducted using one of three methods: PCR, Illumegene, or EIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Recurrence of C. difficile is determined by C. difficile tests, signs and symptoms,&#xD;
                as well as the consistency of stools produced.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Study patients will be contacted at 7, 14 and 28 days following the procedure for&#xD;
                any concerns. A self-addressed envelope will be provided to the study participants&#xD;
                to return their completed post-procedures log to the research team after 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Records for patients who undergo this procedure will be maintained by the research&#xD;
                team in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Analysis Data analysis will be completed using measures of central tendency and raw&#xD;
                percentages. Results of the post-procedure phone calls and the patient logs will be&#xD;
                analyzed using qualitative measures based on phenomenology and measures of central&#xD;
                tendency for quantitative aspects.&#xD;
