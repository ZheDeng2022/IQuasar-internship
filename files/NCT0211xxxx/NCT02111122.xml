    <textblock>
      Sleep wake disturbance is a common problem in Parkinson's disease patients and so far the&#xD;
      therapeutic possibilities for symptomatic relief are limited. Small, open-label studies&#xD;
      indicate that the use of Xyrem (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) might be of benefit in this situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to show a beneficial effect of the study medication in a randomized&#xD;
      cross-over trial, that fulfills strict scientific criteria.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-motor symptoms as excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are markedly impairing quality of&#xD;
      life in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. Beside the disturbing character of these symptoms,&#xD;
      EDS for example is also linked to a decrease in cognitive abilities or mood, i.e. depression&#xD;
      [1,2]. The most prominent cause for EDS is a disruption of nocturnal sleep [3]. Furthermore&#xD;
      disrupted nocturnal sleep is also likely influencing quality of life of partners or&#xD;
      caregivers. This aspect of non-motor symptoms has not been investigated in detail so far. In&#xD;
      conclusion, we are firmly convinced that the improvement of nocturnal sleep in PD patients is&#xD;
      a promising potential strategy to reduce several symptoms and adverse events in PD patients&#xD;
      and their partners or caregivers. Moreover, sleep modulation is a recently introduced&#xD;
      approach of potential neuroprotective strategies, e.g. since sleep deprivation was linked&#xD;
      with neurodegenerative processes in the brain [4,5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has already been shown in a recent study that the nocturnal application of sodium oxybate&#xD;
      in PD patients is not only improving nocturnal sleep quality, but is accompanied by a&#xD;
      reduction in EDS [6]. There were, however, significant methodological limitations to this&#xD;
      study, since it was a single-arm, open-label, uncontrolled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the nocturnal application of sodium oxybate seems to be a promising treatment for&#xD;
      PD patients, but methodologically correct evidence is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational product used in this study is Xyrem, which was approved by Swissmedic in&#xD;
      June 2006 for the treatment of cataplexies in patients with narcolepsy. Xyrem belongs to the&#xD;
      class of sedatives. The chemical name for sodium oxybate is sodium 4-hydroxybutyrate and its&#xD;
      molecular formula is C4H7NaO3. Xyrem oral solution contains 500 mg of sodium oxybate per&#xD;
      milliliter of USP Purified Water, neutralized to pH 7.5 with malic acid. It has to be taken&#xD;
      orally at night in a split dose regime. It is eliminated mainly by metabolism with a&#xD;
      half-life of 0.5 to 1 hour. Pharmacokinetics are nonlinear with blood levels increasing&#xD;
      3.8-fold as dose is doubled from 4.5 to 9 g. The pharmacokinetics are not altered with repeat&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact mechanism of Xyrem is unknown. However, Xyrem is enhancing deep sleep and therefore&#xD;
      strengthening nocturnal sleep. Since disturbed nocturnal sleep and EDS are major non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms in patients suffering from PD we aim to investigate the profit of Xyrem application&#xD;
      for PD patients (for detailed information see Arzneimittel-Kompendium der Schweiz 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Data to Date&#xD;
&#xD;
      An uncontrolled open-label study administered nocturnal sodium oxybate for excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness in PD [6]. No other tested treatment so far - be it stimulants, be it continuous&#xD;
      dopaminergic stimulation overnight - has yielded such a dramatic improvement of EDS: mean&#xD;
      Epworth sleepiness scale values dropped down from 15.6 points (severe sleepiness, comparable&#xD;
      to patients with narcolepsy) to 9.0 (normal values) (Table 1). In addition, sleep quality and&#xD;
      fatigue improved as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of safety, the Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) went up from 7 to 13, but oxygen&#xD;
      saturations remained stable on sodium oxybate [6]. There were, however, significant&#xD;
      methodological limitations to this study. First, it was open-label, and second, excessive&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness was assessed only by subjective measures, i.e. with validated&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard maximal dose, corresponding to the maximal dose used in this study, is 9g&#xD;
      (corresponds to 18ml) per night in a split dose regime. As Xyrem is approved for long-term&#xD;
      use and is only applied over 6 weeks in the current study, no specific precautions concerning&#xD;
      the duration of intake has to be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria in the present study meet the contraindications in case of Xyrem&#xD;
      application listed by Swissmedic: subjects are not included in case of pregnancy, application&#xD;
      of other CNS sedative drugs (opioids, barbiturates), severe medical conditions as liver&#xD;
      failure, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure and severe depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As most drugs, Xyrem can potentially and in few cases lead to several adverse events. Since&#xD;
      the maximal dose is also accompanied by a higher occurrence of adverse events, the initial&#xD;
      dose is set at 3g per night, which is even below the suggested starting dose according to the&#xD;
      &quot;Arzneimittelcompendium&quot; and is carefully and stepwise increased to the individual optimal&#xD;
      dose carefully. The key feature of a safe application is accurate monitoring of the patients,&#xD;
      which is warranted with regular visits and phone calls in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xyrem has been associated with potential breathing depression. In the study of Ondo et al.&#xD;
      [6] total apneas mildly increased after the application of nocturnal sodium oxybate, whereas&#xD;
      oxygen de-/saturation values remained stable. Nevertheless, subjects with elevated AHI or low&#xD;
      oxygen saturation are not included in the present study (see exclusion criteria section 7.2).&#xD;
      However, AHI will be measured before and after drug application in all subjects, allowing a&#xD;
      better evaluation of this aspect in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, there is no approved medication for sleep disturbances or EDS in PD. So far, the&#xD;
      application of nocturnal sodium oxybate has revealed the largest improvements in PD patients.&#xD;
      Modafinil or Rivotril have been demonstrated to have some benefits on EDS or sleep in PD&#xD;
      patients. However, these medications are not really an alternative treatment since the&#xD;
      effects are only moderate and the experience of their application in PD patients is still&#xD;
      insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefits and Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xyrem is a drug licensed by the FDA and Swissmedic for the use in patients with narcolepsy,&#xD;
      and its tolerability in clinical practice is very good. It is known that the use of Xyrem&#xD;
      leads to an improvement of the quality of nocturnal sleep in patients suffering from&#xD;
      narcolepsy, reducing EDS. In dealing with patients it is well known that sleep disturbances&#xD;
      of any kind (endogenous as well as exogenous) impair daytime vigilance and at the same time&#xD;
      quality of life. It is known that non-motor symptoms of PD, i.e. EDS, have a major impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life of patients - as well as their carers. Improving nocturnal sleep would&#xD;
      therefore be a promising possibility to enhance the patients' daytime wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the mentioned symptomatic effect on EDS, sleep modulation might in the future&#xD;
      emerge as a potential disease modulating strategy. Experimental animal data have shown an&#xD;
      aggravation of neurodegenerative disease with sleep restriction (6) - it is currently under&#xD;
      investigation if sleep modulation can work the opposite way as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thereby the controlled risk of the mentioned adverse events in section 4.5 must be seen in&#xD;
      relation to the potential benefit of improved quality of life of patients and carers as well&#xD;
      as its potential influence on motor and non-motor symptoms and long-term disease&#xD;
      modification.&#xD;
