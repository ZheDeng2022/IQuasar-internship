  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accurate staging of patients with pancreatic cancer is critical to avoid the expense,&#xD;
      morbidity, and mortality related to unnecessary surgery. While several tests are available&#xD;
      for assessing such patients, consensus has not been achieved on the optimal approach. As a&#xD;
      matter of fact, pancreatic cancer staging is discussed controversially due to conflicting&#xD;
      evidence and certainly EUS has lost grounds due to improvements in CT technology. Thus, the&#xD;
      role of EUS and EUS-guided FNA varies among treatment centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to better define the role of EUS in predicting resectability,&#xD;
      as compared to high resolution cross-sectional imaging.&#xD;

      Registry procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIGH-RESOLUTION PANCREATIC PROTOCOL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN EXAMINATION: performed&#xD;
           on at least 16-section multi-detector row (MD) CT and reviewed using multi-planar&#xD;
           reconstructions, with images obtained following the oral administration of water and&#xD;
           pancreatic protocol intravenous iopamidol, with images acquired in the pancreatic and&#xD;
           portal venous phases of contrast enhancement, reconstructed as thin slice (at 1 mm -&#xD;
           pancreatic phase or 2 mm - portal venous phase increments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EUS EXAMINATION: performed within 2 weeks of the MDCT, aiming visualization of the&#xD;
           pancreas, main surrounding vascular structures, celiac and mediastinal lymph nodes,&#xD;
           liver and left adrenal gland, with EUS-FNA performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
           investigator/examiner to confirm/exclude metastases and for the confirmation of&#xD;
           malignancy in the primary tumor. Patients confirmed by EUS as having distant metastases&#xD;
           are to be deferred from the planned surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SURGICAL INTERVENTION: aiming to provide curative intent (R0) resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HISTOPATHOLOGICAL POSTOPERATIVE STAGING: with evaluation of loco-regional invasiveness&#xD;
           and degree of complete surgical resection (R0/R1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS: with phone-calls on an every 6 month basis, for up to 2 years,&#xD;
           retaining the following data: survival (or not), date of decease and its direct cause&#xD;
           (if applicable), the presence of tumor recurrence (or not).&#xD;
