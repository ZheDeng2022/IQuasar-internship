      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Different parts of the brain are involved in feeling touch. Researchers want to study&#xD;
      whether repetitive magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the sensory cortex affects how sensation&#xD;
      feels. rTMS is a repeated magnetic pulse that interferes with brain activity. It affects a&#xD;
      small part of the brain beneath the scalp. Researchers want to find out the role of sensory&#xD;
      cortex in sensing different types of touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find out the role of sensory cortex, a brain area, in sensing different types of touch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults ages 18 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be pre-screened with a telephone interview. Then they will be screened&#xD;
           with physical and psychological exams and a urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Session 1, participants will have an MRI brain scan and fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For MRI, a magnetic field and radio waves take pictures of the brain. Participants will&#xD;
           lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. A coil will be placed over&#xD;
           their head. They will perform a task during the scan. The scanner makes loud knocking&#xD;
           noises. Participants will get earplugs. They will be in the scanner for up to 60&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Sessions 2 and 3, participants will take urine tests. Their perception of touch will&#xD;
           be measured. Then rTMS will be used to stimulate their sensory cortex and scalp for&#xD;
           about 20 minutes. Their perception of touch will be measured again.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For rTMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through&#xD;
           the coil and creates a magnetic pulse that affects activity in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test how parts of sensory cortex relate to different aspects of touch&#xD;
      sensation. Healthy male and female adults (ages 18-45) will be enrolled. We will use low&#xD;
      frequency repetitive transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to temporarily reduce&#xD;
      activation in parts of the sensory cortex and will examine the effect of this procedure on&#xD;
      perception of touch stimuli. After screening, participants will undergo three testing&#xD;
      sessions. Session 1 will involve questionnaires and anatomical and functional MRI scans&#xD;
      (non-invasive brain imaging) that will be used for localizing the correct regions to&#xD;
      stimulate with the rTMS. Sessions 2 and 3 will involve active and control rTMS and testing of&#xD;
      gentle (non-painful) touch sensation.&#xD;
