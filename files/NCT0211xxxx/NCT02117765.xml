  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 1 diabetes (T1D), immune defense cells in the body attack and destroy&#xD;
      insulin-producing beta cells leaving affected people with a lifelong need for daily insulin&#xD;
      injections. Even with insulin injections, blood glucose (sugar) control is imperfect and&#xD;
      leads to many health complications and a shortened life span. This is a pilot clinical trial&#xD;
      to test the safety of a drug, ustekinumab, in 20 adult subjects with recent-onset T1D.&#xD;
      Ustekinumab is currently licensed for use in psoriasis where it has proven to be both highly&#xD;
      effective and safe and so the investigators hope to see a similar effect in T1D. This trial&#xD;
      will also be used to determine the best dosage and frequency of the drug to be given to&#xD;
      people with T1D to help design future studies on the drug's effectiveness. The investigators&#xD;
      hope that if the drug can block immune cells soon after the development of diabetes, any&#xD;
      remaining insulin-producing cells may be protected, and regenerate, thus producing more&#xD;
      insulin so that individuals may be insulin free, or require less insulin.&#xD;

      The investigators will perform an open-label pilot safety study (Phase I/II clinical trial)&#xD;
      with a total of 20 adult (18-35 years old) subjects with recent-onset T1D. There will be four&#xD;
      study cohorts, which will be recruited sequentially all to the treatment arm: five subjects&#xD;
      will be given ustekinumab, 45mg subcutaneously (SC) at 0, 4, 16, 28 and 40weeks, five&#xD;
      subjects will be given ustekinumab, 90mg SC at weeks 0, 4, 16, 28 and 40, five subjects will&#xD;
      be given 45mg SC at weeks 0, 4 and 16 and five subjects will be given 90mg subcutaneously&#xD;
      (SC) at weeks 0, 4 and 16. Recruitment and screening for the pilot study will be completed&#xD;
      within the first 6 months. The follow up period is 1 year from the first dose.&#xD;
