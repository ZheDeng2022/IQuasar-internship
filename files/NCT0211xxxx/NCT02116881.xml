    <textblock>
      Despite of technological advances in surgery, incisional hernia and bowel obstruction remain&#xD;
      frequent surgical complications. To date, the relationship between these two types of surgery&#xD;
      and the occurrence of incisional hernia remains unclear. This is an observational study to&#xD;
      evaluate outcomes of incisional hernia with respect to the incision site and adhesion-related&#xD;
      bowel obstruction after open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The relationship between type of the approach and occurrence of incisional hernia remains&#xD;
      unclear. This single center, prospective observational cohort study will be conducted to&#xD;
      evaluate characteristics and outcomes of incisional hernia with regard to the impact of&#xD;
      incision site and length and adhesion-related bowel obstruction, after open and laparoscopic&#xD;
      colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incisional hernia and bowel obstruction rate within two years after colorectal surgery,&#xD;
           either clinically and/or radiologically detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients scheduled for an elective colorectal operation will be asked for informed consent&#xD;
      at the outpatient clinic or in the hospital on the day before surgery. All patients will be&#xD;
      followed with a strictly controlled protocol with regard to bowel preparation, antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis, and postoperative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of hospital discharge, patients will be asked by a blinded investigator to fill&#xD;
      the Hospital Experience Questionnaire (HEQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient clinic follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Each patient will be contacted by phone call and if needed by e-mail or postal mail,&#xD;
      concerning incisional hernia, small bowel obstruction, and Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ) at&#xD;
      1st, 12th and 24th months after the operation. Incisional hernia will be assessed using a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire during phone calls. This questionnaire contains items concerning the&#xD;
      site, treatment and recurrence of incisional hernia. And if the patient has contact with the&#xD;
      emergency department because of complaints related to bowel obstruction among appointments,&#xD;
      that information would also be recorded by the questionnaire. As a part of the routine care,&#xD;
      during outpatient clinic visits related to primary disease which needed operation, these&#xD;
      patients will be assessed by physical examination concerning incisional hernia, and BIQ at&#xD;
      1st, 12th and 24th months after the operation. Incisional hernia could be diagnosed&#xD;
      clinically, or radiologically, according to symptoms reported by the patient. During these&#xD;
      visits, patients will be asked about wound problems (infection, dehiscence, or incisional&#xD;
      hernia) and clinical symptoms related to bowel obstruction (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      abdominal distention, or obstipation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospital Experience Questionnaire (HEQ) - In this questionnaire, the patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction throughout the pre- and post-operative periods will be evaluated. The HEQ&#xD;
      includes questions about complications, pain, length of hospital stay, time span until&#xD;
      resumption of a normal diet, and return to daily activities (Dunker MS, Surg Endosc&#xD;
      1998;12:1334-40)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Body Image Questionnaire (BIQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Consists of ten items evaluating body image and cosmesis after surgery. Body image and&#xD;
      cosmetic scales measure the patient's satisfaction with physical appearance (Dunker MS, Surg&#xD;
      Endosc 1998;12:1334-40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incisional hernia is defined as &quot;any abdominal wall gap with or without a bulge in the area&#xD;
      of a postoperative scar perceptible or palpable by clinical examination or imaging&quot;. All&#xD;
      sites of hernia will be considered: midline incision, Pfannenstiel (transverse), trocar site,&#xD;
      specimen extraction site and ileostomy closure site. Incisional hernia occurring in patients&#xD;
      in the laparoscopic group who ultimately need a laparotomy for conversion or postoperative&#xD;
      complications within 30 days postop will be analyzed in the open group. Reoperation is&#xD;
      defined as any return to the operating theatre (RTT) for an intra-abdominal procedure or&#xD;
      wound complication on the index admission, or on a subsequent admission to hospital within 28&#xD;
      days of the initial resection. Conversion to an open operation is defined as performance of a&#xD;
      conventional midline laparotomy, with an abdominal incision greater in size than that&#xD;
      initially needed for specimen retrieval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early postoperative fascial dehiscence is distinguished from later incisional hernia, being&#xD;
      defined by a clinically palpable gap in the abdominal fascia, with or without wound&#xD;
      dehiscence, during the first 30 days after surgery. The distinction is made because these&#xD;
      patients required a re-intervention, which precluded further long-term follow-up for&#xD;
      incisional hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel obstruction is defined based on accepted clinical and radiologic criteria, including&#xD;
      abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting, obstipation, and distended bowel loops with air&#xD;
      fluid levels, as evident on an abdominal X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The datasheet will be password-protected, with only the principal investigator and&#xD;
      co-investigators having access to the information. Red-Cap (Research Electronic Data Capture)&#xD;
      application will also be used to monitor and protect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Sample size calculation was based on a study published by Duepree et al. from Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic in 2003 [3]. With a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, for a&#xD;
      difference of 10% in the incidence of incisional hernia after laparoscopic and open&#xD;
      colorectal surgery, a sample size of 140 patients per group was calculated. The number was&#xD;
      increased to 160 patients per group upon taking into account an estimated rate of 10% of&#xD;
      patients being lost to follow-up. Incidence of incisional hernia was expected to be 5% for&#xD;
      the laparoscopic approach and 15% for open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      - All patients will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Significance will be&#xD;
      determined at the p&lt;0.05 level (2-tailed). Differences in baseline characteristics will be&#xD;
      evaluated using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test&#xD;
      for continuous or ordinal data. Using a set of preoperative and operative risk factors as&#xD;
      independent variables and development of incisional hernia as a dependent variable, logistic&#xD;
      regression analyses will be conducted, with the primary outcomes defined as presence of&#xD;
      incisional hernia at incision or extraction site within 24 months of operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hernia rates in relation to observation time were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier life-table&#xD;
      method and compared via log rank test.&#xD;
