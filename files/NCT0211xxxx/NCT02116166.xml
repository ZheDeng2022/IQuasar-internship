  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate how and why the loss of muscle mass&#xD;
      occurs with aging. Tissue collected from young subjects will be compared to previously&#xD;
      collected tissue from elderly subjects, as well as previously collected data on muscle&#xD;
      function/mass to further investigate cellular and molecular pathways that have recently been&#xD;
      shown to be important for the aging process in muscle. The Principal Investigator (PI) and&#xD;
      the study team will look for specific proteins (called biomarkers) that can be present in the&#xD;
      muscle tissue in various amounts in different individuals. This study will increase the&#xD;
      investigators understanding of the processes of muscle atrophy (loss of mass) and functional&#xD;
      loss at older age and will help to find new treatments and interventions aimed at improving&#xD;
      the quality of life and independence of America's rapidly expanding elderly population.&#xD;

      For this project, we will continue to gain mechanistic insight into age-related muscle loss&#xD;
      and to maximize the utility of the tissue we previously collected (Claude D. Pepper Older&#xD;
      Americans Independence Center (OAIC); Skeletal muscle apoptosis and physical performance;&#xD;
      Oxidative RNA/DNA damage and repair in aged human muscle (Developmental Study), IRB #&#xD;
      429-2005) and we will collect muscle tissue from additional young subjects. This project will&#xD;
      specifically test whether inflammatory pathways and DNA repair mechanisms are altered and/or&#xD;
      involved in the development of sarcopenia and the related decline in physical function&#xD;
      observed in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. We will further determine the association of skeletal muscle mass and function with&#xD;
      intramuscular mediators of inflammation. Focus will be on inflammatory proteins (e.g.,TNF,&#xD;
      TNFR1, pIkBα, pIKKb, CCL2, ZIP14, ZnT2) and genes (e.g., IL-6, TNFa, IL11β, IL-8, CCL2, CCR2,&#xD;
      NFkB p50, NFkB p65, ZIP14) and metals (e.g., copper, zinc, and iron). We hypothesize that the&#xD;
      majority of these markers will be upregulated in muscle from older individuals when compared&#xD;
      to young.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. For the first time, we will determine the age related effect of DNA damage on pattern&#xD;
      and dynamics of mRNA translation in human muscle tissue by genome wide analysis using&#xD;
      &quot;ribosome profiling.&quot; The recently developed deep-sequencing techniques of RNA-seq and&#xD;
      &quot;ribosome profiling&quot; will be implemented on human muscle. This will allow us to explore on a&#xD;
      genomic scale and at single-nucleotide resolution, the effect of age-related DNA damage on&#xD;
      transcriptional fidelity and translational kinetics. Importantly, for the first time, these&#xD;
      phenotype changes will be compared with genome mapping of DNA damage, a major factor driving&#xD;
      mammalian aging. We hypothesize that older muscle has greater modification of translational&#xD;
      patterns compared to young muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle tissue samples remaining following the completion of this research will be stored and&#xD;
      used in the future to explore new avenues of research related to aging.&#xD;
