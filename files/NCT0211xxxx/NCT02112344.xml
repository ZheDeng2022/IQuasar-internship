  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary (SCCUP) site metastatic to cervical lymph nodes at&#xD;
      presentation is a relatively rare entity forming about 2% of all head and neck carcinomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically patients are treated with ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection (MRND) and&#xD;
      post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a lack of consensus on the radiotherapy target volumes that should be treated after&#xD;
      neck dissection. The most common radiotherapy techniques are either unilateral cervical lymph&#xD;
      node irradiation to achieve local control in the ipsilateral neck or TMI of the head and neck&#xD;
      region with the aim of eradicating the primary and the microscopic neck disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of the ipsilateral hemi-neck alone is of low toxicity and may achieve local control&#xD;
      in the cervical nodes. Potential occult primary sites in the head and neck mucosa, and any&#xD;
      sub-clinical metastatic disease in the contralateral side of the neck are left untreated. If&#xD;
      a primary tumour subsequently becomes apparent the previous radiotherapy may make further&#xD;
      radiotherapy difficult to deliver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some groups recommend bilateral neck and total mucosal irradiation in this setting claiming&#xD;
      improved local control. With conventional radiotherapy technique this is at the price of&#xD;
      significant acute toxicity and chronic morbidity, mainly xerostomia with its associated&#xD;
      complications and effects on quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has been shown to reduce the dose to salivary gland&#xD;
      tissue and consequently may reduce the incidence of xerostomia and improve quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL) in head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis of parotid-sparing IMRT at the University of Michigan established a mean dose&#xD;
      threshold for both stimulated (26 Gy), and unstimulated (24 Gy) saliva flow rates. For the&#xD;
      same end-point (less than 25% of flow at baseline one year post radiation) Roesink et al&#xD;
      established a TD50 of 39 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed a planning study to assess the feasibility of IMRT to spare the&#xD;
      parotid gland while delivering bilateral neck and TMI. The mean dose to the contralateral&#xD;
      parotid gland using IMRT was below the threshold of 24 Gy for unstimulated salivary flow,&#xD;
      predicting a fairly low risk of radiation induced xerostomia. The mean dose to the&#xD;
      ipsilateral parotid gland was 32 Gy which was below the TD50 dose based on the Roesink data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses the safety and tolerability of delivering IMRT in clinical practice to&#xD;
      treat patients with SCCUP of the head and neck region, who require bilateral neck and&#xD;
      pan-mucosal irradiation.&#xD;
