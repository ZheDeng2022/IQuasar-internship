      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In deep brain stimulation (DBS), a device called a neurostimulator is placed in the chest.&#xD;
      It is attached to wires in parts of the brain that affect movement. DBS might help people&#xD;
      with movement disorders like Parkinson s disease (PD), dystonia, and essential tremor (ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To provide DBS treatment to people with some movement disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adults 18 years and older with PD, ET, or certain forms of dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have&#xD;
           blood and urine tests and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI brain scan. The participant will lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal&#xD;
           cylinder with a magnetic field. They will be in the scanner about 60 minutes. They will&#xD;
           get earplugs for the loud noises. During part of the MRI, a needle will guide a thin&#xD;
           plastic tube into an arm vein and a dye will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram. Metal disks or sticky pads will be placed on the chest, arms, and&#xD;
           legs. They record heart activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of memory, attention, concentration, thinking, and movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will have DBS surgery. The surgery and hospital care afterward are&#xD;
           NOT part of this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study doctors will see participants 3 4 weeks after surgery to turn on the&#xD;
           neurostimulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return every month for 3 months, then every 3 months during the first&#xD;
           year, and every 6 months during the second year. Each time, participants will be&#xD;
           examined and answer questions. DBS placement will be evaluated with MRI. The&#xD;
           neurostimulator will be programmed. At two visits, participants will have tests of&#xD;
           movements, thinking, and memory.&#xD;

&#xD;
      3.1 Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide DBS therapy and follow-up management&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain a cohort of patients treated with DBS who can participate in other NIH protocols&#xD;
      addressing the efficacy of functional surgery and the relevant physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect physiology, programming, and efficacy data related to DBS therapy and motor and&#xD;
      cognitive function in these patient populations. All the data collected will be an outcome of&#xD;
      standard of care and all analyses will be retrospective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment under this protocol will be based on the current standard of care for DBS&#xD;
      therapy. All tests and study procedures will be administered per standard and routine&#xD;
      clinical care. Subjects may be enrolled in the study to support participation in other DBS&#xD;
      protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 18 years and older with medically refractory PD, dystonia, and/or ET may participate&#xD;
      in this study. Other indications will be added with subsequent amendments if FDA approval of&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation is extended to other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment that is rendered in this protocol is standard of care for PD, dystonia, and ET.&#xD;
      Patients confirmed to have medically refractory PD, dystonia or ET will be offered DBS as a&#xD;
      therapeutic option per standard of care procedures and routine clinical care. Patients will&#xD;
      be evaluated for their eligibility for the procedure and the risk/benefit balance for&#xD;
      surgical therapy will be assessed (Lang et al., 2006). After completing the evaluation, a&#xD;
      decision will be made on recommending the procedure. At that point the patients will be&#xD;
      referred for the surgical intervention to the NIH Surgical Neurology Branch or to&#xD;
      collaborating surgeons in the community. If the surgery is performed at the NIH, the&#xD;
      Neurology DBS team can be involved in surgical planning, target selection, intraoperative&#xD;
      physiology recording and testing, as specified under SNB protocols. After the surgery, the&#xD;
      patients will be followed in the NIH DBS clinic and the DBS programming will be initiated and&#xD;
      performed as outlined below. The patients will be followed up for at least two years, and&#xD;
      then they will have the option to transfer their care back to the neurologists in the&#xD;
      community or continue care with the NIH Neurology team until care in the community is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, patients can be enrolled in the protocol at various points in relation to DBS&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding the movement disorder of the subject and observations of their standard of&#xD;
      care treatment will be collected. Data may be used for future research questions that are&#xD;
      related to subjects movement disorder and/or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate effects of DBS before and 1 year after surgery using clinically-generated&#xD;
           data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Severity of PD motor symptoms (measured by the UPDRS III scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Changes in dystonia severity (measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia&#xD;
                rating scale (Burke et al., 1985)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Changes in tremor severity (measured by the Tremor Rating Scale (TRS))&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Levels of effective drug therapy for PD patients using the Levodopa Equivalent Drug&#xD;
                Dosing (LEDD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Changes in behavior, performance of activities of daily living and complications of&#xD;
                therapy as measured by the UPDRS I, II, and IV scales&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate effects of DBS before and 1 year after surgery on quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. For PD patients (measured by UPDRS part II and other scales such as the PDQ-39)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For the Dystonia and ET patients (measured by the SF-12 scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate radiographic correlation of DBS electrode position and clinical changes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate neurophysiological mechanisms of DBS and relevant basal ganglia physiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected will be done as standard of care and all analysis will be retrospective.&#xD;
