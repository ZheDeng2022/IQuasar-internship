    <textblock>
      Sepsis is common in the ICU and is associated with high mortality that reaches up to 60%,&#xD;
      increased duration of hospitalization and additional costs [1,2].Early diagnosis and&#xD;
      stratification of severity are of great importance in order to timely apply proper and&#xD;
      adequate treatment [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative stress is implicated in inflammation and sepsis and sepsis severity seems to&#xD;
      correlate with increased oxidative stress [7,8]. Monitoring of oxidative stress has been done&#xD;
      so far with various markers which reflect the different pathways of oxidative stress as is&#xD;
      oxidosis of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids; yet the antioxidant capacity of various enzymes&#xD;
      and vitamins has been studied [9]. However these methods do not reflect oxidative stress as a&#xD;
      whole, are time consuming, need special laboratory procedures and are costly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidation-reduction potential is a new technique that enables bedside assessment of the&#xD;
      oxidative status. It is based on measuring the balance of oxidants and reductants in human&#xD;
      blood with a simple plasma test that reports results immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidation-reduction potential, used for oxidative monitoring in ICU patients, might correlate&#xD;
      with sepsis severity and may be used in addition to other clinical and/or inflammatory&#xD;
      markers to assess severity and possibly prognosis.&#xD;

      4. Procedures/evaluation of the trial 4.1 Evaluation at entry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected oxidative parameters that will be assessed in this study will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)&#xD;
      in plasma protein carbonyls (CO) in plasma total antioxidant capacity in plasma (TAC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory parameters that will be measured are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-Reactive protein in plasma Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in whole blood Troponin-I in&#xD;
      whole blood Soluble CD14 subtype presepsin ( sCD14-ST) in whole blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      .2. Time of assessment Measurements will be performed within the first 24hours upon entry and&#xD;
      daily regarding the ORP detection and oxidative markers for a period of 10 days, if sepsis is&#xD;
      not present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the presence of sepsis diagnosis, measurements will be performed daily until the 7th day&#xD;
      of the septic episode plus at the time of sepsis resolution or at the point of death and at&#xD;
      the end of the follow-up period, on the 28th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the inflammatory markers measurements will be performed as followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C-Reactive protein in plasma daily Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in whole blood at&#xD;
      admission and/or sepsis diagnosis and every 72h until resolution/death and on the 28th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Troponin-I in whole blood at admission and/or sepsis diagnosis and during sepsis according to&#xD;
      heart ultrasound findings and on the 28th day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soluble CD14 subtype presepsin ( sCD14-ST) in whole blood&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Blood collection and store Arterial blood from an indwelling arterial catheter will be&#xD;
      drawn from each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood will be kept in a tube with sodium heparin, immediately centrifuged at 1,370g and a&#xD;
      small portion will be used for the detection of ORP while the remaining fraction will be&#xD;
      collected and stored at -80o C until further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Assessment of the oxidative markers ORP will be immediately assessed using the device&#xD;
      RedoxSYS of Luoxis (Ampio Pharmaceuticals Inc, CO, USA) The device reports two measurements&#xD;
      static ORP, and capacity for every plasma sample [11 ].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For TBARS, a slightly modified assay of Keles et al. [12 ] will be used, while plasma protein&#xD;
      carbonyls will be determined based on the method of Patsoukis et al. [13 ]. TAC determination&#xD;
      will be based on a previously described method [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded for each subject are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Past medical history Patients wil be divided in medical, surgical and trauma groups.&#xD;
      (comprising patients with renal disease, diabetes, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, immunocompromized states, cerebrovascular disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be recorded during ICU stay for each subject, are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      APACHE II score at entry SOFA score at enry and upon all other timepoints. Sepsis severity&#xD;
      (sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock), upon diagnosis and for the rest timepoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all timepoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen concentration (FiO2), partial oxygen pressure , mode of mechanical ventilation, static&#xD;
      compliance, tidal volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pH Blood lactate Levels of vasopressors and inotropes (noradrenaline, adrenaline,&#xD;
      dopamine, dobutamine, vasopressin. The peak dose will be recorded within the last 24h).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temperature (peak value in the last 24h)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every day a full blood count and biochemical examinations will take place. Data to be&#xD;
      recorded in all timepoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood leukocyte count Platelets Fibrinogen Prothrombin time/Partial thromboplastin time&#xD;
      Urea/Creatinine Transaminases Bilirubin (total, conjugated) Uric acid Blood albumin (every 3&#xD;
      days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance cultures upon entry. Blood, bronchial secretions, urine cultures at sepsis&#xD;
      diagnosis and of any other fluid or tissue connected with the sepsis cause according to the&#xD;
      attending physician. Specimens of all cultures will be repeated during the septic episode&#xD;
      according to the attending physician's opinion and will also be recorded.&#xD;
