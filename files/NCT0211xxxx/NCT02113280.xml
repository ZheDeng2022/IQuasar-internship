  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with wear and tear in their knees (osteoarthritis) are often referred to orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeons following a sudden worsening of pain and mechanical symptoms (grinding, locking,&#xD;
      giving way) in their knee due to tears of their meniscal cartilages. These tears are&#xD;
      described as degenerative as they are not usually caused by a single injury but rather&#xD;
      accumulation of wear and tear. It is not clear from the current available evidence what the&#xD;
      best treatment for these patients is. Their underlying arthritis is not bad enough to require&#xD;
      joint replacement yet and they were usually managing well with minimal problems from their&#xD;
      knee until experiencing the meniscal tear. However, some of their symptoms are likely to be&#xD;
      due to the arthritis rather than just the tear. Current treatment for these patients is&#xD;
      usually in the form of conservative treatment with physiotherapy and supervised exercise or&#xD;
      using arthroscopy (key-hole surgery) to trim the damaged area of the meniscus. We know from&#xD;
      previous research that most of these patients will improve over time to some extent but it is&#xD;
      not clear whether a greater improvement can be expected following surgery and if so, whether&#xD;
      this applies to all patients with this problem or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is intended to compare the outcome of patients with proven degenerative meniscal&#xD;
      tears imaged on MRI scans, when they are assigned to arthroscopy followed by supervised&#xD;
      exercise or supervised exercise alone. They will be randomly assigned and the outcome will be&#xD;
      assessed using patient-completed questionnaires (Knee Outcome Osteoarthritis and injury Score&#xD;
      [KOOS], SF12, visual analogue score for pain) and whether the patients go on to require&#xD;
      further surgery during the period of the trial. The patients will be assessed at baseline, at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.&#xD;
