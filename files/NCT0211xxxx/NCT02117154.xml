      This study aims to evaluate relative contributions of fasting plasma glucose and postprandial&#xD;
      glucose at various HbA1c levels using 6-day CGM. Evaluation of the relationship between&#xD;
      HbA1c, CGM, serum fructosamine and eAG, will also be looked into.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fasting hyperglycaemia is the main contributor in Malaysian T2DM patients with poor&#xD;
           glycaemic control (high HbA1c), postprandial hyperglycaemia plays a more important role&#xD;
           with lower HbA1c levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There is good correlation between HbA1c, CGM, serum fructosamine and eAG in Malaysian&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is formed via a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by the exposure&#xD;
      of haemoglobin to plasma glucose. The HbA1c assay is widely used to assess glycaemic control&#xD;
      in diabetes mellitus (DM) over a 60 to 90 day period and has been shown to correlate with the&#xD;
      development of complications in both Type 1 (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) HbA1c, Fasting Plasma Glucose and Post-prandial Glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have looked at the relationship between fasting glucose, post-prandial&#xD;
      glucose and HbA1c, yielding conflicting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001, one study examined the relationships between plasma glucose and HbA1c in 371 T2DM&#xD;
      patients who were on lifestyle modification or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). These patients&#xD;
      performed self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) 5 to 6 times per day (fasting, pre-meal and&#xD;
      2 hours post-prandial). In this study HbA1c had better correlation with pre-prandial glucose&#xD;
      rather than postprandial hyperglycaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A landmark study was carried out in 2003 using one-day, 4-point, SMBG profiles in 290 T2DM&#xD;
      patients who were on oral anti-diabetic drugs (OAD) but not on insulin. This study suggested&#xD;
      that in patients with HbA1c &lt; 8.5%, post-prandial hyperglycaemia was the main contributor to&#xD;
      excessive glucose levels. Conversely, in patients with HbA1c levels ≥ 8.5%, fasting&#xD;
      hyperglycaemia predominated. This pattern has been proposed to reflect the natural&#xD;
      progression of T2DM, with post-prandial hyperglycaemia occurring earlier in the course of&#xD;
      T2DM and fasting hyperglycaemia gradually predominating with progressive β-cell failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This concept was challenged later, where 7-point SMBG profiles at baseline and after 24 weeks&#xD;
      were performed in 1699 patients with T2DM (on OAD or insulin therapy) with HbA1c ˃ 7%. It&#xD;
      found that fasting hyperglycaemia was the main contributor to overall hyperglycaemia (76-80%)&#xD;
      from the lowest to highest HbA1c levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another similar study was carried out in Taiwan in 2010 (Asian descent), with several key&#xD;
      differences. This is important as Asian T2DM patients have been shown to have a predominantly&#xD;
      insulin secretory defect as opposed to the insulin resistance which typifies T2DM in&#xD;
      Caucasians. Different ethnic populations have also been shown to glycate haemoglobin at&#xD;
      different rates. HbA1c is consistently higher in African Americans compared to non-Hispanic&#xD;
      White, no matter if normal glucose tolerance (by 0.13-0.21%), pre-diabetes (by 0.26-0.30%) or&#xD;
      diabetes (by 0.47%). Another key difference in the taiwanese study was the use of continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitoring (CGM) over a 3 day period in 121 T2DM patients treated with OAD, which&#xD;
      provided a far greater number of measured glucose values compared to SMBG. It found that&#xD;
      post-prandial hyperglycaemia contributed significantly (80%) to overall hyperglycaemia when&#xD;
      HbA1c was &lt; 7%. At levels of HbA1c &gt; 7%, the study reported that both fasting and&#xD;
      post-prandial glucose levels made equal contributions to the overall glycaemic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (B) HbA1c, serum fructosamine and estimated average glucose (eAG)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although HbA1c is regarded as the gold standard in the assessment of overall glycaemic status&#xD;
      in diabetes mellitus, there are several limitations to its use. Factors affecting erythrocyte&#xD;
      turnover, such as haemoglobinopathies (which are more prevalent in Asians), chronic renal&#xD;
      failure, recent blood transfusion and erythropoietin therapy may render HbA1c unsuitable for&#xD;
      assessing glycaemic status. In such instances, other methods for assessing glycaemic control&#xD;
      may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fructosamine is formed when plasma glucose reacts with protein. Serum fructosamine levels&#xD;
      have been used to indicate average glucose levels over a 2 to 3 week period. The correlation&#xD;
      between serum fructosamine and HbA1c levels has been described in Caucasians but not in an&#xD;
      Asian population12. It was reported that there was discordance between HbA1c and&#xD;
      fructosamine, especially in the presence of nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMBG and CGM are alternatives to HbA1c in assessing chronic glycaemia. The A1c-derived&#xD;
      Average Glucose (ADAG) study looked at 700 individuals (300 T1DM, 300 T2DM and 100 healthy&#xD;
      individuals). HbA1c, 8-point SMBG and 48-hour CGM were assessed monthly over a 4 month&#xD;
      period. Glucose levels accrued from SMBG and CGM were used to calculate estimated average&#xD;
      glucose levels (eAG).The ADAG study identified a linear relationship between HbA1c and eAG&#xD;
      over the preceding 8-12 weeks for both T1DM and T2DM patients with normal erythrocyte&#xD;
      lifespan. One of the limitations of the ADAG study was the under-representation of Asians&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By performing our study, we aim to evaluate the glycaemic profiles of T2DM patients over a&#xD;
      wide spectrum of HbA1c, by using 6 day CGM, from Asian perspectives. We also hope to&#xD;
      establish positive correlation among HbA1c, serum fructosamine, estimated average glucose and&#xD;
      CGM in this group of population.&#xD;
