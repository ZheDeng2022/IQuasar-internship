      The aim of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted parenting&#xD;
      support program for Somali parents living in Sweden on children's and parent´s mental health.&#xD;
      In recent years the Somali population in Sweden has increased and is currently one of the&#xD;
      largest groups among ethnic minorities. Most of the Somali people have arrived as refugees&#xD;
      and have experienced war, trauma and conflict. Research shows that migration to a new social&#xD;
      context/society is challenging for a family and may together with previous experiences of&#xD;
      war, separation, create stress and mental illness. This leads to consequences such as family&#xD;
      violence, child abuse, relational problems, drug problems and school problems for children.&#xD;
      There is a vast knowledge on the association between parents' mental health, positive&#xD;
      parent-child relationship and children's health and well-being. Previous studies have shown&#xD;
      that parenting programs aimed to support parent-child relationship and/or improve parental&#xD;
      skills have positive effects on parental mental health and on children's behavior. Most&#xD;
      municipalities in Sweden offer their residents a structured parenting program, but these&#xD;
      programs do not reach those of ethnic minorities. Studies show that parenting programs mainly&#xD;
      target parents who can speak Swedish fluently and that the parenting programs are not yet&#xD;
      culturally adapted.&#xD;

      In recent years the Somali population in Sweden has increased and is currently one of the&#xD;
      largest groups among ethnic minorities in Sweden (http://www.scb.se). Most of the Somali&#xD;
      people living in Sweden have arrived as refugees and they have experienced war, trauma and&#xD;
      conflict. Research shows that migration to a new social context/society is challenging for a&#xD;
      family and may together with previous experiences of war, separation, create mental&#xD;
      ill-health (Bhugra, 2004; FoU, 2008). According to several studies, refugee families have&#xD;
      poorer health and low social status compared to the native Swedish (Bhugra, 2004). Previous&#xD;
      studies reported that both parents and children who have experienced war and conflict suffer&#xD;
      from stress and are at risk for mental ill-health. This stress leads to various consequences&#xD;
      such as family violence, child abuse, relational problems between parents and children, drug&#xD;
      problems and school problems for children (Ajdukovic, et al., 1993; James, 1997; Schimtz, et&#xD;
      al., 2003). Experience of war and conflict has further shown to have a negative impact on&#xD;
      parent's ability to care for their children (Jack, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a vast knowledge on the association between parents' mental health, positive&#xD;
      parent-child relationship and children's health and well-being (e.g. Bremberg, 2002).&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that parenting programs aimed to support parent-child&#xD;
      relationship and/or improve parental skills have positive effects on parental mental health&#xD;
      and on children's behavior (Lindsay et al., 2011; Bjorknes et al., 2013; Stewart-Brown et&#xD;
      al., 2011). For example, parents who have participated in parenting programs report feeling&#xD;
      less worried, stressed and depressed (Lindsay, et al., 2011; Marcynyszyn, et al., 2011,&#xD;
      Phelan, et al., 2012; Stewart-Brown, et al., 2004). Hence, by supporting parents in their&#xD;
      role as parents, improvements can be seen in both parents' and children's health and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Swedish governmental national strategy, parents should be offered support&#xD;
      and knowledge on how to strengthen their parenting role (Reports, 2008). Almost all the&#xD;
      municipalities in Sweden offer their residents a structured parenting program. However, these&#xD;
      parenting programs do not reach all residents in the municipalities, especially those of&#xD;
      ethnic minorities (Fabian, et al., 2006; Fabian, et al., 2004), due to language barriers and&#xD;
      lack of information about existing parenting programs to the ethnic minorities. Studies show&#xD;
      that parenting programs mainly target parents who can speak Swedish fluently and that the&#xD;
      parenting programs are not culturally adapted (Kling, et al., 2010). Other international&#xD;
      studies emphasize that single or young parents, families with low socioeconomic status or who&#xD;
      live in deprived areas, have low attendance and high drop out of parenting program (Byrne, et&#xD;
      al., 2013; Stewart-Brown, et al., 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts have been made to culturally adapt parenting programs both in USA, Australia and in&#xD;
      Norway. According to (Cardona et al., 2012) cultural adaptation needs to comprise aspects of&#xD;
      language, culture and context. In a study by Bjorknes, et al. ( 2013), the cultural&#xD;
      adaptation made included not to have mixed groups with both mothers and fathers and to&#xD;
      deliver the parenting program with help the of &quot;link workers&quot; of Somali and Pakistani&#xD;
      background. While many Somali parents in Sweden do not attend or have no information about&#xD;
      the parenting programs that exist in their municipality, the number of participating families&#xD;
      might increase substantially if these programs are offered in Somali and are culturally&#xD;
      adapted to Somali families' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a parenting support program on&#xD;
      parents' and children's mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What are the effects of the parenting support program on children's mental health?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are effects of the parenting support program on parents' mental health and parents'&#xD;
           self-efficacy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the cost effectiveness of the intervention? Methodological approach: A&#xD;
           randomized controlled trial will be conducted with one intervention group (i.e.&#xD;
           provision of the Connect parenting program) and one control group (i.e. 'usual&#xD;
           activities) consisting of Somali parents living in Borlänge Municipality. When&#xD;
           applicable, both parents will be randomized together as one family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: the intervention consists of Connect, an already established and scientifically&#xD;
      evaluated parent program. The program is based on attachment theory and focuses on the needs&#xD;
      of the child/youth and the parent from an attachment perspective. Connect is a 10 week&#xD;
      program, which addresses nine different principles on child development, parent-child&#xD;
      relationship and challenging interaction. Parents meet together in small groups with a&#xD;
      maximum of eight families together with group leaders for one hour sessions each week. In&#xD;
      relation to this, parents are offered some beverages and snacks half an hour before the&#xD;
      session. Both parents will be invited to the parenting program participation. The&#xD;
      intervention will be held in Somali language by group leaders of Somali background. In total&#xD;
      eight group leaders will be recruited and receive four days of Connect training course by&#xD;
      Connect instructors. Instructors will give also mentorship during parenting program. The&#xD;
      program will be proceeded by two sessions (6 hours) on cultural specific challenges, which&#xD;
      will be based on the results from the qualitative study (I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting and data collection: Parents will be recruited from the Social services and Somali&#xD;
      associations in Borlänge. Several information meetings will be held in different facilities&#xD;
      within the social services and Somali associations. Parents who are eligible and give their&#xD;
      consent to participate will be asked to fill in the baseline data. Baseline data will be&#xD;
      collected before randomization. The intervention will be evaluated by a semi-structured&#xD;
      questionnaire. Outcome measures will be collected two and six months after the program has&#xD;
      ended in the intervention group, with similar data collection times in the control group. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will be translated into the Somali language. They will be filled out by the&#xD;
      same parent throughout the study. If both parents participate the intervention their data&#xD;
      will pooled if their answer is about the same child. The questionnaires will be answered at a&#xD;
      time and location chosen by parents/children, during whom a Somali speaking researcher/person&#xD;
      will be present in order to support parents/children in filling out the questionnaires if&#xD;
      problems arise (e.g. when parents are illiterate). Outcomes: Primary outcome is improved&#xD;
      children's mental health. Secondary outcomes are, improved parents' mental health, and&#xD;
      parents' self-efficacy. The questionnaire will include information about the&#xD;
      socio-demographic factors and is based on validated instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and analyzes: A power analysis was conducted to determine the required sample&#xD;
      size. When comparing two independent sample means, with alpha set at 0.05, and power at 0.80,&#xD;
      we need a total sample of 128 children (I: 64 C: 64) to detect a medium difference (d =.5).&#xD;
      These groups will be expanded to 75 per group (a total sample of 150 children) since we&#xD;
      expect 20% loss during the follow up. Intention-to-treat will be used. This means that&#xD;
      analyses will include all randomized parents in the groups to which they were randomly&#xD;
      assigned, regardless of their adherence with the entry criteria, regardless of the treatment&#xD;
      they actually received, and regardless of subsequent withdrawal from treatment or deviation&#xD;
      from the protocol. The specific statistical analysis used with each outcome variable will be&#xD;
      determined by the distribution of the outcome variables. Intergroup comparison will be made&#xD;
      between the control group and intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance A number of studies show that many evidence-based parenting programs improve&#xD;
      parental skills and parental mental well-being. Parents perceived to be less stressed,&#xD;
      depressed and that they have more confident in their parenting role after undergoing&#xD;
      parenting program. By evaluating the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate parenting&#xD;
      program to Somali parents living in Sweden the project is attempting to contribute to the&#xD;
      wellbeing of both children and parents with Somali background. The result will be used to&#xD;
      inform stakeholders and policy makers and hopefully be used in other municipalities in&#xD;
      Sweden. Furthermore, the results will be disseminated through international conferences and&#xD;
      publication in international open-access journals&#xD;
