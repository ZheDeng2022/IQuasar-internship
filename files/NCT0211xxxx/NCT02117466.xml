      In this study the investigators will evaluate the uptake of 89Zirconium labeled cetuximab in&#xD;
      extra-hepatic colorectal metastases. The investigators hypothesize that uptake of&#xD;
      89Zr-cetuximab is required for response to cetuximab. If no uptake is present the&#xD;
      investigators will escalate the dose cetuximab and repeat the 89Zr-cetuximab PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the clinical benefit rate of cetuximab in the patients with&#xD;
      and without uptake. The ultimate goal is to create a selection tool that can predict response&#xD;
      of cetuximab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Currently, third line systemic treatment for patients with advanced, wild type&#xD;
      K-RAS and as has recently been demonstrated with wild type N-RAS (thereafter referred to as&#xD;
      wild type RAS) colorectal cancer (CRC) includes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#xD;
      inhibition with the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab. This type of treatment has a modest but&#xD;
      significant beneficial activity in this patient group with improved progression-free and&#xD;
      overall survival. Although it is known that patients with advanced wild type RAS CRC will not&#xD;
      respond to anti-EGFR treatment, it is not understood why patients with wild type RAS CRC do&#xD;
      not all benefit from this type of therapy. Apart from other potential gene mutations involved&#xD;
      in response to treatment, differences in the variability of pharmacokinetics may play a&#xD;
      crucial role in the response to anti-EGFR treatment. In non-responders insufficient drug&#xD;
      accumulation may occur in the tumor due to pharmacokinetic processes, such as cetuximab&#xD;
      sequestration in the liver which expresses high levels of EGFR, or due to low levels of EGFR&#xD;
      expression in tumor lesions. Our main hypothesis is that uptake of cetuximab in metastases is&#xD;
      required for response and that achieving cetuximab uptake by increasing its dose will result&#xD;
      in improved clinical benefit in patients with advanced CRC with wild type RAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART I:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to demonstrate 89Zr-cetuximab uptake in non-hepatic metastases at standard dose or at&#xD;
           cohort wise increased cetuximab doses (dose escalation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the association between 89Zr-cetuximab uptake in non-hepatic metastases and&#xD;
           treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART II To determine the response rate with an optimized dose of cetuximab as has been&#xD;
      selected in part 1 in patients without 89Zr-cetuximab tumor uptake at standard dose of&#xD;
      cetuximab (dose extension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a multicentre non-randomized intervention study; phase I-II dose&#xD;
      escalation/extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with histopathologically confirmed advanced CRC with wild type&#xD;
      RAS, without local treatment options, aged â‰¥ 18 years, with a life expectancy of at least 12&#xD;
      weeks, who are candidates for anti-EGFR antibody monotherapy (3rd line palliative treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: In the first part we will perform an exploratory PET study in patients with&#xD;
      metastasized, RAS wild type CRC without local treatment options, who will be treated with&#xD;
      cetuximab. We hypothesize that uptake of 89Zr-cetuximab in metastases is required for&#xD;
      response to cetuximab. We will analyze targeting of 89Zr-cetuximab to metastases and the&#xD;
      association between 89Zr-cetuximab tumor uptake and tumor response. Early response evaluation&#xD;
      will be done with 18F-FDG PET. In a subgroup of 20 patients with metastasis within the field&#xD;
      of view (18 cm) including the heart, tumor perfusion will be measured with 15O-water PET&#xD;
      scans. In addition, we will investigate the hypothesis that increasing the cetuximab dose&#xD;
      results in uptake in patients without uptake in metastases of 89Zr-cetuximab when cetuximab&#xD;
      is given at the standard dose regimen. In the second part we will study whether dose&#xD;
      adjustments based on 89Zr-cetuximab targeting results in an improved response and clinical&#xD;
      benefit rate. In addition, EGFR expression and saturation with cetuximab is studied in tumor&#xD;
      biopsies obtained during treatment. Molecular pathways activated by EGFR and kinase&#xD;
      activities as well as phosphoproteomics will be studied in tumor biopsies and skin biopsies&#xD;
      before and after start of treatment. In addition, the relation of microRNA (miRNA) and&#xD;
      peptide profiles in relation to response to therapy will be studied.&#xD;
