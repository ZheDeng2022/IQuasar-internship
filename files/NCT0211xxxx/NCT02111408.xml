    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate sleep disordered breathing, autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction, and post stroke depression in acute and chronic stroke patients. Furthermore, to&#xD;
      explore the interaction between these comorbidities, and their relation to stroke aetiology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to fifty percent of stroke patients suffer less noticeable comorbidities after the acute&#xD;
      phase of a stroke and often the rest of their life. It concerns sleep disordered breathing&#xD;
      (SDB), post stroke depression (PSD), and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. These&#xD;
      comorbidities are seldom recognized, but are associated with a poorer outcome after stroke,&#xD;
      reduced quality of life as well as an increased risk of new vascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the course of the comorbidities, the relationship between the mentioned&#xD;
      diseases or which patients are more commonly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the following hypotheses, and assess the results compared&#xD;
      to the stroke aetiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Stroke patients with SDB have an impaired autonomic function&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stroke patients with SDB have an increased risk of PSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stroke patients with autonomic dysfunction have an increased risk of PSD&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will examine stroke patients for signs of sleep disordered breathing,&#xD;
      autonomic dysfunction and depression, both in the acute phase (days), in the chronic phase&#xD;
      (months) and the very chronic state (years). Thereby the investigators can map the&#xD;
      comorbidities course over time. At the same time the patients will be tested for peripheral&#xD;
      small and large artery disease as well as MRI will be used to investigate sign of cerebral&#xD;
      small vessel disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on power calculations 335 individuals will be enrolled in order to satisfy the project&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
