      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of IL-YANG Inactivated&#xD;
      Split Influenza Vaccine (IL-YANG FLU Vaccine Vial INJ.) administered as a single&#xD;
      intramuscular injection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label study. Subjects providing voluntary written informed consent underwent&#xD;
      protocol-specific assessments and tests within 4 weeks prior to administration of the study&#xD;
      vaccine, and those who met all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were considered&#xD;
      eligible were sequentially enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study received 0.5ml of the study vaccine as an intramuscular&#xD;
      injection in the deltoid muscle, and returned to the clinic every day for the first 3 days.&#xD;
      On Day 14 post-vaccination, subjects underwent the safety assessments. On Day 28&#xD;
      post-vaccination, subjects returned for safety and immunogenicity assessments.&#xD;
