  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To purpose of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a&#xD;
      computerized working memory training in improving cognitive functioning and alcohol use&#xD;
      outcomes, in individuals with alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind design. The&#xD;
      intervention group will perform repeated cognitive training (5 sessions à 30-40 min / week)&#xD;
      with increased difficulty during 5 consecutive weeks using the Cogmed® software. The&#xD;
      non-intervention group however, will perform the same training tasks, but without the&#xD;
      increase in difficulty. Thus our study controls for non-specific effects such as regular use&#xD;
      of computer, adhering to a training program and expectation effects. In order the complete&#xD;
      the study, each participant has to complete minimum 20 training sessions within a maximum&#xD;
      time period of 6 weeks. The study will be conducted at the Center for Dependence Disorders in&#xD;
      Stockholm, situated within the premises of the Karolinska University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      They study will include 50 subjects with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Research&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited through public advertisement and from within the Center for&#xD;
      Dependence Disorders in Stockholm. After an initial brief telephone screening, potential&#xD;
      subjects will be invited to the clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm and&#xD;
      screened in-person for study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study intervention: Cogmed® Training Program Cogmed® working memory training is a&#xD;
      computer program that will be administered online. The program consists of 7 verbal and&#xD;
      non-verbal working memory tasks and gives immediate performance feedback to the subject&#xD;
      undergoing training. Each training session is 90 trials and lasts for approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes per day, 5 days a week and during a total training period of 5 weeks (i.e. total&#xD;
      training time approximately 12,5 hours). In order to complete the study each subject must&#xD;
      complete 20 - 25 training sessions within maximum 6 weeks. The program adjusts the difficulty&#xD;
      of the different tasks trial-by-trial, which allows for each subject to train at a level&#xD;
      adjusted to his or her current WM capacity (see (Klingberg et al. 2005) for detailed&#xD;
      description). As a control condition, equivalent to the placebo arm in a pharmaceutical&#xD;
      trial, the Cogmed® program consists of a Standard Training program that lets the user train&#xD;
      the same tasks but without the increase in difficulty. Thus it allows clinical trials of the&#xD;
      software to control for non-specific effects such as regular use of computer, adhering to a&#xD;
      training program and expectation effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Procedures After inclusion-visit, subjects will come back to the clinic for weekly&#xD;
      follow-up visits over the span of 5 weeks. The visits can be scheduled ±3 days from the&#xD;
      outline below, to accommodate the schedule of each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUDIT questionnaire will be administered through the telephone. If the subject has a total&#xD;
      score &gt; 16 and at least 3 points on question number 1 (3-4 drinks per week or more) the&#xD;
      subject will called in for a screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Written and verbal research subject information about the study details from the&#xD;
      study physician. Data will be collected on a number of items related to current alcohol use&#xD;
      and life time history of dependence. In addition scales related to physical well being and&#xD;
      trauma will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following is the procedure for the inclusion and for the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1: Inclusion ( week 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine dip test and breathalyzer to confirm absence of psychoactive substance and alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for analysis of U-Ethyglucoronide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples for bio-bank storage (genetic markers, plasma and serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of depressive symptoms (MADRS) and craving (Short-DAQ (right now) and OCDS&#xD;
           (last 5 days))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological Testing using the CANTAB® + Digit Span Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Introduction to the Cogmed® software and verbal and written training instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of personal login and password for Cogmed® software and completion of&#xD;
           first training session&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedure Randomization will be done according to a randomised block design.&#xD;
      The total sample size is 50 individuals. The personal login for each subject is associated&#xD;
      with either active or control training - however neither study coordinator or the subjects&#xD;
      know which group they are since this is not evident during the first day of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period: (Week 1-Week 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1: Follow-up visit Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breathalyser to confirm sobriety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TLFB for alcohol and nicotine since last visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for analysis of U-Ethyglucoronide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of depressive symptoms (MADRS) and craving (Short-DAQ (right now) and OCDS&#xD;
           (last 5 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2, 3 and 4 Follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Same procedure as Week 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 5: Test Day (Day 35)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine dip test and breathalyser to confirm absence of psychoactive substance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine sample for analysis of U-Ethyglucoronide&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TLFB for alcohol and nicotine since last visit; Confirm sobriety on day before test day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of depressive symptoms (MADRS) and craving (Short-DAQ (right now) and OCDS&#xD;
           (last 5 days))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological Testing using the CANTAB® + Digit Span Task&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Payment for completed training sessions in food coupons (50 SEK / completed session) +&#xD;
           their choice on Kirby Monetary Choice Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Voluntarily enrolment in treatment program at the Center for Dependency Disorders,&#xD;
           Stockholm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine sample will be taken at every visit to the clinic in order to analyze presence of&#xD;
      psychoactive substances (screening, inclusion and test day) and for analysis of&#xD;
      U-ethylglucoronide (inclusion, every week visit and test day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breathalyser:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit at the clinic, the research subjects will be tested for presence of alcohol&#xD;
      using the alcohol breathalyser (Lion S-D2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will leave blood samples for the bio-bank for genetic analysis and plasma and&#xD;
      serum analysis of inflammatory markers, neuroendocrine hormones etc which will be analyzed&#xD;
      after the completion of study. Total blood sampling for the bio-bank will be 28 ml of blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiological Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured by study nurse, on each visit to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Information and Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all potential research subjects will be&#xD;
      competent and adequately informed by the investigator of every relevant aspect of the study&#xD;
      before consenting to participate. Both oral and written information will be given, addressing&#xD;
      the aims, methods, sources of funding, institutional affiliations of the researchers, the&#xD;
      benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential research subject will also be informed of the right to refuse to participate in&#xD;
      the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring&#xD;
      that the potential subject has understood the information, the investigator will seek the&#xD;
      potential subject's freely-given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit Ratio of the Study The risks involved in this study are justified by the&#xD;
      anticipated benefits for the participants. Besides the potential benefit of the intervention,&#xD;
      the patients establish contact with addiction healthcare professionals, which hopefully will&#xD;
      encourage them to enroll in treatment programs. Thus, many patients with AUD that never had&#xD;
      any treatment will be referred to treatment after the study. Furthermore, research subjects&#xD;
      will also be compensated with 50 SEK / completed training session (maximum 25 x 50 = 1250)&#xD;
      and additional 100-200 SEK depending on their choice on the Kirby Monetary Choice&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks for the individual subject are discussed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not anticipated that subject enrollment in the present study will cause any significant&#xD;
      health related risks. However, the following potential risks are recognized:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inconvenience of repeated visits and possible loss of confidentiality (related to&#xD;
           clinical information, psychiatric assessment scales, and urine screens).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Risks associated with blood drawing include minor pain of venipuncture and some soreness&#xD;
           after removal of the needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Monetary Choice Questionnaire involves &quot;fooling&quot; the subject since we tell them that&#xD;
           one of their choices will be selected at random - while in fact we have decided&#xD;
           beforehand which of the different options they will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Minimizing Potential Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. As a guard against the loss of confidentiality, all information will be stored on locked&#xD;
           files which can be accessed only by members of the research staff for this project. No&#xD;
           names or other identifying information will be used in publications that stem from this&#xD;
           research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The blood sampling will be performed by an experienced research nurse, and venipuncture&#xD;
           will be performed maximum one time per visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Even though we may &quot;fool&quot; our subjects, this is necessary in order to make sure that no&#xD;
           one gets a lot more compensation than any other subject. Furthermore, this procedure&#xD;
           will not result in any discomfort for the individual, only a small increase in&#xD;
           compensation for their study participation. This procedure is necessary in order to get&#xD;
           the subject to answer truthfully which option they would choose, since any offer could&#xD;
           potentially be the real one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We base our power estimation on effect sizes reported by Klingberg (2010) in a review of&#xD;
      previous studies on computerized cognitive training. Difference between active and control&#xD;
      groups regarding pre/post-test performance on working memory tasks have been around 40 % for&#xD;
      trained tasks and 15 % for untrained tasks, with an effect size of approximately 1.0 (Cohens&#xD;
      d). However, effect sizes for improvement in other cognitive or reasoning tasks have been&#xD;
      weaker (around 0.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given an effect size of 1.0, alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80 a sample size of 36 is&#xD;
      sufficient in order to detect a difference between the groups regarding working memory&#xD;
      improvement (calculated using STATA software power program). Thus, our sample size of 50 is&#xD;
      adequate.&#xD;
