      This research is being done to see if using a combination of rectal indomethacin and&#xD;
      epinephrine spray during endoscopy, can prevent pancreatitis that may occur after ERCP (a&#xD;
      type of gastrointestinal endoscopy).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is the most common complication of endoscopic&#xD;
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with an estimated incidence of 3-7% among average&#xD;
      risk patients and 15-20% among patients at high risk for developing PEP. Around 500,000 -&#xD;
      700,000 ERCPs are performed annually in U.S. Even with a modest incidence of 5%, PEP results&#xD;
      in approximately $150 million in healthcare costs in the US alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent landmark controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of rectal nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drug - NSAIDs (indomethacin) over placebo in preventing PEP among patients&#xD;
      at high risk for PEP. Also, epinephrine sprayed on the major duodenal papilla was shown to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of PEP in multiple studies. Our group performed a network meta-analysis&#xD;
      (NMA) which simultaneously compared 16 drugs evaluated in 99 randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      with 25,313 patients, to determine their relative efficacy using direct and indirect&#xD;
      comparisons. Interestingly, the NMA ranked epinephrine as the best performing drug, followed&#xD;
      by rectal NSAIDs and nafamostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indomethacin acts on pancreatic inflammation while epinephrine sprayed on duodenal papilla&#xD;
      keeps the pancreatic duct open by reducing papillary edema. The use of these drugs in&#xD;
      combination may potentially synergistically reduce or further reduce the incidence of PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A combination of papillary spray of epinephrine and rectal indomethacin is&#xD;
      superior to the use of rectal indomethacin alone, for PEP prophylaxis among patients at high&#xD;
      risk for PEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size justification: Based on the information from earlier controlled trials, the&#xD;
      Investigators assume that PEP incidence will be 10% in the rectal NSAID arm (Group A) and it&#xD;
      will be reduced to 5% by the additional use of papillary spray of epinephrine (Group B).&#xD;
      Therefore, a total of 474 patients in each arm, or 948 patients in total, will be required to&#xD;
      see a 50% difference between the groups with a power of 0.8 and two sided alpha of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consenting: Patients scheduled to undergo ERCP will be screened for patient&#xD;
      based inclusion / exclusion criteria and will be consented, in the private waiting area of&#xD;
      the endoscopy units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures and delivery of drugs: During ERCP performed according to standard&#xD;
      clinical care, if the endoscopist determines that the patient meets the criteria for&#xD;
      'high-risk', the study coordinator will randomize the patient to either group A or B in a 1:1&#xD;
      fashion using a web-based central randomization system. Randomization will be stratified by&#xD;
      each center and a randomly varying block size will be used. The patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to either Group A - Patients will receive 20 ml of normal saline sprayed on the duodenal&#xD;
      papilla and surrounding regions of edema, over a period of 1 minute using any ERCP&#xD;
      cannulation catheter, at the end of procedure, just before the withdrawal of endoscope;&#xD;
      followed by 100 mg of rectal indomethacin OR Group B - Patients will receive 20 ml of 0.02%&#xD;
      epinephrine sprayed on the duodenal papilla and surrounding regions of edema, over a period&#xD;
      of 1 minute using any ERCP cannulation catheter, at the end of procedure, just before the&#xD;
      withdrawal of endoscope; followed by 100 mg of rectal indomethacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Plan: For the statistical analysis of primary end point, the difference in&#xD;
      proportion of PEP among the two groups will be calculated by stratifying the site and by&#xD;
      combining patients from all sites, as separate analyses. A two sided p-value of &lt;0.05 will be&#xD;
      considered statistically significant. The severity of PEP, mortality and other complications&#xD;
      related to PEP will also be compared among the two groups. The data on the risk factors of&#xD;
      PEP, incidence of PEP will be used for the development of PEP risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) charter: An Independent DSMB, clinical trial monitor&#xD;
      (safety officer) will be formed consisting of five endoscopists from India and U.S., with&#xD;
      expertise in biostatistics and clinical trial methodology. DSMB will review study related&#xD;
      documentation including and not limited to, protocol, standard operating procedures, consent&#xD;
      form, data entry forms; monitor study performance, will ensure adherence to good clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines and regulatory requirements; and will make appropriate recommendations to&#xD;
      the investigators. All adverse events, will be reported to the safety officer by the study&#xD;
      coordinators at each center. Blinded interim analysis will be performed at 33% and 66% of the&#xD;
      sample size. If the PEP incidence or complication rate is &gt;25% in any of the treatment&#xD;
      groups, DSMB will break randomization code and will terminate the study. During interim&#xD;
      analysis, if a statistically significant difference is found between the two groups&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.001), the study will be terminated for ethical considerations.&#xD;
