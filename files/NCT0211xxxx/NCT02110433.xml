    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a serious and common disease. HF is marked by a high rate of preventable&#xD;
      hospitalizations through proper care. As such, it is a key target for telemedicine programs.&#xD;
      However, currently published data are inconclusive. Investigators propose a multicenter&#xD;
      randomized study of innovative telemedicine involving the usual patient monitoring daily&#xD;
      weight monitoring, clinical signs and in one of three groups in our study of BNP testing in&#xD;
      the patient's home all associated with a regular education reinforcement. The objective is to&#xD;
      identify early cardiac decompensation to allow to treat ambulatory and thus prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of more serious events such as death or rehospitalization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a disease that has several specificities. It is both common&#xD;
      and severe. This is a disease associated with high mortality and especially a high rate of&#xD;
      hospitalization. These are partly due to the severity &quot; per se &quot;of the disease but also to&#xD;
      the non optimal management of CHF and non-formal education of patients and their caregivers.&#xD;
      Indeed, the majority of hospitalized patients shows some clinical signs of decompensation up&#xD;
      to 5 days before hospitalization and could avoid to go to the emergency room and&#xD;
      hospitalization by an adequate ambulatory reaction and care. It is on this premise that&#xD;
      underlies the concept of the application of telemedicine in CHF. Telemedicine is the&#xD;
      monitoring of biological or clinical data in the patient's home with the transfer of&#xD;
      information remotely either to a specific structure often managed by nurses or to the GP or&#xD;
      cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most studies of telemedicine, effectiveness of the concept is based on the notion of&#xD;
      monitoring of some markers with low sensitivity or specificity. This monitoring generates a&#xD;
      lot of information which, because of the better education of the patient and from its&#xD;
      systematic examination or through technology (internet, phone, SMS) or through remote&#xD;
      monitoring of the nurse often leads to detection of sources of unnecessary hospitalization&#xD;
      and offset the advantage gained in the early detection of decompensation. In addition, the&#xD;
      low sensitivity and specificity of clinical signs generate many warnings that cause difficult&#xD;
      remote management by the patient and the doctor. BNP is a blood biomarker recognized as&#xD;
      having a high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of CHF and the rate change was&#xD;
      correlated with a change in the prognosis. Its dosage is conventionally performed in&#xD;
      peripheral blood using POCT devices or not. More recently, it is possible to perform the&#xD;
      dosage by the patient itself at home, including a satisfactory feasibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why, in the HELP study , Investigators wanted to study the impact of the addition of&#xD;
      BNP measurement at patient's home to a innovative device for telemedicine monitoring&#xD;
      combining patient perception of clinical signs of HF decompensation, daily weight monitoring&#xD;
      and strengthening patient education but also specific training of doctors by E learning in&#xD;
      order to promote implementation of the ESC recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the HELP study is to determine the impact of a tele monitoring&#xD;
      strategy based on either a telemonitoring of the weight associated with an educational&#xD;
      reinforcement (clinical monitoring arm) or on the same track associated with a BNP assay at&#xD;
      home performed by the patient every week and in case of symptoms suggestive of decompensation&#xD;
      (bioclinical monitoring arm) on a primary endpoint including death from all causes,&#xD;
      unscheduled re-hospitalization or CHF admission to the emergency department compared to a&#xD;
      control group (usual monitoring arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be secondarily analyzed the impact in terms of re-hospitalizations, deaths emergency&#xD;
      admissions, the number of false positives (unconfirmed suspected cardiac decompensation),&#xD;
      false negatives (undetected cardiac decompensation), the effect of monitoring quality of life&#xD;
      and economic impact of these medical strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, inclusion, and exclusion criteria HELP (n° ansm 2013-A00899-36 ) is a&#xD;
      multicentric, prospective, open label, randomized, ambulatory study. The authors are solely&#xD;
      responsible for the design and conduct of this study, all study analyses, the drafting and&#xD;
      editing of the paper, and its final contents. HELP study benefit form a specific grant of the&#xD;
      Ile de France regional health agency, France. The aim was to initially include 330 patients&#xD;
      suffering from ambulatory CHF according to inclusion and exclusion criteria Study procedures&#xD;
      Patients should be followed by the study investigators. After signing the informed consent&#xD;
      (approval by a French legal ethical committee on 8 th October 2013 N° 2013-A00899-36-3101),&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into three arms according to their type of CHF (systolic CHF and&#xD;
      CHF with preserved systolic function defined by the coexistence of signs of CHF and an&#xD;
      ejection fraction&gt; 45%). Patients will therefore be included into a standard of care arm&#xD;
      (placebo group), one arm followed by clinical and telemonitoring arm ( Cordiva System (R)&#xD;
      arm) followed by bio-clinical monitoring (BNP and Cordiva (R) monitoring system arm) .&#xD;
      Patients will be seen per protocol at inclusion and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo arm group: Patients will be managed per consensus guidelines Clinicians could&#xD;
           see the patients as many times as necessary in order to optimize their therapy and could&#xD;
           make BNP measurement (but not using Home BNP monitoring)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cordiva System (R) arm : Patient will see their cardiologist every three months and&#xD;
           benefit from telemonitoring of their weight and general well being through a specific&#xD;
           communicant device. Patients have to answer to 8 specific binary questions based on the&#xD;
           main precipitating factors for decompensation and measure their body weight every day.&#xD;
           If not they will be contact after two missing measures. Patient will be contact by phone&#xD;
           call every month in order to reinforce the initial patient therapeutic education and&#xD;
           patient-'s compliance. Patient have access to specific printed documents and to a&#xD;
           specific web based platform where he can find some PowerPoint presentation on CHF&#xD;
           aetiology, signs and therapy and where he can try to answer to monthly quiz in whom&#xD;
           questions are based on key messages about CHF according to guidelines and consensus&#xD;
           paper on patient therapeutic education. The cardiologist has access to a specific&#xD;
           platform. In this platform they could find the E CRF of their patients and the patient&#xD;
           's quiz result in order to help him to analyse patient comprehension of HF and patient&#xD;
           reactivity in case of decompensation. The cardiologist could also find some PowerPoint&#xD;
           presentation on CHF and AHF management according to ESC guidelines. He could also read&#xD;
           the monthly report of the telemonitoring nurse and the daily results of weight and&#xD;
           general being measurement of his patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BNP and Cordiva (R) monitoring system arm : In this group, patients and doctors have&#xD;
           access to the platform detailed above and had also access to BNP home monitoring.&#xD;
           Patients had to measure the BNP plasma level using Alere home based BNP device&#xD;
           heartcheck in a weekly basis in order to follow this parameter up. In case of clinical&#xD;
           signs of CHF or a significant weight increase identified by the tele monitoring or the&#xD;
           patient, the nurse will ask to the patient to do an extra measurement of home BNP&#xD;
           testing in order to exclude a CHF decompensation (BNP &lt; 100 pg/ml or remaining stable (&lt;&#xD;
           30% increase).&#xD;
&#xD;
      End Points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary end point is a composite end point including Unplanned hospitalizations for CHF with&#xD;
      hospital stay &gt; 1 day / all-cause death / non-programmed emergency department admission&#xD;
      related to CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoint are based on an analysis of the impact of the strategy used in the two&#xD;
      interventional arms compared to the placebo group for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each parameter of the composite end point analyzed separately&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  emergency admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of all cause death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of HF hospitalizations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adherence to the strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  False positive induced by the system (visits to the GP or cardiologist proposed by the&#xD;
           telemonitoring system without final evidence of HF decompensation and without increase&#xD;
           of diuretics )&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical cost and efficience of the technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost of the different strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cost efficacy of the different strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization for heart failure was defined per protocol by an in-hospital stay of more&#xD;
      than one night in addition with intravenous use of diuretics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Events in the three groups were analyzed using parametric student t&#xD;
      test. Percentages were compared using Chi2 tests. Kaplan Meier time to event function for&#xD;
      readmission or death from any cause were calculated. For each end point, investigators also&#xD;
      estimated the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval using a Cox proportional-hazards To&#xD;
      calculate sample size, analyzing recent clinical trial data, investigators expected at least&#xD;
      40% of SOC subjects will have at least one cardiovascular event within 1 year. Assuming a 40%&#xD;
      reduction in the occurrence of the primary end point in the telemonitoring groups ,&#xD;
      investigators estimated that a sample size of at least 110 subjects in each group would&#xD;
      provide 80% power (α = .05) for detection of a reduction in primary end point. An initial&#xD;
      goal enrollment of 330 subjects was proposed. According to the event rate in the control&#xD;
      group study size could be secondarily extended to 600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub group analysis Actual prespecified sub group analysis were defined according to some&#xD;
      patients characteristics or locations : Investigators also tested for interactions between&#xD;
      each pair of subgroups and the main treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age (cut off 65 y old ) and above and below median value. PSEF versus REF (defined by EF &gt;&#xD;
      45%) aetiology of CHF as defined by the investigator High symptomatic patients vs low&#xD;
      symptomatic patients according to NYHA class Heart failure units management (defined by the&#xD;
      investigator as working in such a structure) vs all others High neurohormonal activation&#xD;
      patients vs low neurohormonal activation defined as initial BNP higher or lower than 300&#xD;
      pg/ml and in an second analysis by median initial BNP value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      patient adherence to the &quot; phone call system &quot; (&lt;75% vs. ≥75%) BNP Compliant vs non compliant&#xD;
      patients defined by an compliance to daily measurement plus BNP measurement in BNP group&#xD;
      higher than 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Highly implicated vs low implication patients defined according to the monthly connection to&#xD;
      the patient site and median value during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good HF education level vs low HF education patients defined by tertile value of quiz&#xD;
      performance (global, knowledge and situation questions as isolated value).&#xD;
