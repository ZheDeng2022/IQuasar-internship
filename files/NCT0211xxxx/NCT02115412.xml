  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that nearly 50% of patients with chronic conditions around the globe do&#xD;
      not adhere to their prescribed medicine, leading to enormous cost to the healthcare&#xD;
      providers. Non-adherence can be due to various forms and have multiple causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this need, Philips Research has developed Medication Non-adherence model. This&#xD;
      tool will help in developing a systemic way of assessing medication non-adherence and&#xD;
      providing decision support for targeted intervention to healthcare professionals. The aim of&#xD;
      this study is to validate this model with 750 chronically ill patients in UK.&#xD;
