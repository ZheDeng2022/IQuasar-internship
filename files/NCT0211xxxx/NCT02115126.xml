      This is a non-blinded, not placebo controlled, randomized, parallel phase 2 pilot study to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunological response and the safety of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-derived tumor&#xD;
      antigen, Latent Membrane Protein-2 (LMP2)-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines alone or&#xD;
      co-administered with the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001, in patients with EBV+ lymphoma in the&#xD;
      setting of autologous stem cell transplant with infusion of mature T cells. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive vaccine alone or vaccine co-administered with the TLR9 ligand,&#xD;
      DUK-CPG-001. Randomization will be stratified by 2 disease types: Hodgkin lymphoma and&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the ability of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) derived tumor antigen, LMP2 loaded&#xD;
           DC vaccine co-administered with a Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand, DUK-CPG-001, to&#xD;
           induce EBV derived tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cell response in patients with EBV+&#xD;
           lymphoma in the setting of autologous stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the ability of an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) derived tumor antigen, LMP2 loaded&#xD;
           DC vaccine administered alone to induce EBV derived tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cell&#xD;
           response in patients with EBV+ lymphoma in the setting of autologous stem cell&#xD;
           transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of using LMP2- loaded DC vaccine alone or co-administered with&#xD;
           the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001, in patients with EBV+ lymphoma in the setting of&#xD;
           autologous stem cell transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate duration of the presence of long term memory cells after administration of an&#xD;
           LMP2 loaded DC vaccine alone or co-administered with the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate duration of multi-functional CD8 T cell responses after administration of an&#xD;
           LMP2 loaded DC vaccine alone or co-administered with the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate duration of Th1, Th2 and Th17 CD4 T cell responses as well as CD4+CD25+Foxp3+&#xD;
           regulatory T cell (Treg) responses after administration of an LMP2 loaded DC vaccine&#xD;
           alone or co-administered with the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the disease free survival (DFS) of patients with EBV+ lymphoma in the setting&#xD;
           of autologous stem cell transplant who receive LMP2-loaded DC vaccines alone or&#xD;
           co-administered with DUK-CPG-001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population Patients with EBV+ lymphoma who are in a complete remission (CR) after&#xD;
      salvage therapy with plans to proceed to autologous peripheral stem cell transplant .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune response will be defined as an increase in number of spots to 25-fold more than at&#xD;
      baseline, or at least 200 spots per 105 CD8+ T cells, by Day 7 post 2nd vaccination (i.e., a&#xD;
      patient with a baseline of 1 spot/105 CD8+ T cells who achieved 25 spots/million would not be&#xD;
      counted as a response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Leukapheresis #1: The first pheresis will be performed after that patient has obtained a&#xD;
           complete remission, but prior to transplant. Complete remission will be determined based&#xD;
           on Cheson Criteria100. No special preparative regimen is required prior to pheresis but&#xD;
           it must occur at least 2 weeks after most recent chemotherapy and most recent&#xD;
           granulocytic growth factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pheresis will last approximately 4 hours to collect a goal of 1 x 108 nucleated&#xD;
           cells/kg. This will follow standard stem cell transplant Standard Operating Procedures&#xD;
           (SOPs). The cells will be transferred to John Sampson's GMP facility (Duke Brain Tumor&#xD;
           Immunotherapy Processing Laboratory) where the sample will be divided into DC cell&#xD;
           product for making vaccine, T cells for re-infusion during transplant, and research&#xD;
           sample that will go to Yiping Yang's lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As described below, they will subsequently be defrosted and the T cells will be infused&#xD;
           at the time of the autologous stem cell transplant. This will follow standard stem cell&#xD;
           transplant Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).Please see appendix 8.6 Cell collection:&#xD;
           removal of PBMCs by leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Leukapheresis # 2: This is a standard-of-care pheresis to collect cells for the&#xD;
           autologous stem cell transplant and will be performed as per the usual stem cell&#xD;
           transplant and pheresis SOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Leukapheresis will follow institutional norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stem Cell Transplant will follow institutional norms. The standard minimum infusion of&#xD;
           CD34+ PBSC cells required for autologous stem cell transplant is 2 x 106 cd34+ cells/kg&#xD;
           (range 2-7). The standard transplant preparative regimens used are BEAM or BCV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. T Cell Infusion: T cells will be thawed and infused through an IV after the autologous&#xD;
           stem cell graft infusion has been completed. This will be infused following the stem&#xD;
           cell transplant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for re-infusion of thawed transplant&#xD;
           products (SOP ABMT-GEN-017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post Transplant Vaccine #1: Nine -13 weeks status PBSC transplant, patients will receive&#xD;
           their first post-transplant vaccination. At the time of vaccination, ANC must be &gt; 1.5.&#xD;
           Delays beyond 13 weeks may be allowed after discussion with the PI. Delays beyond the 13&#xD;
           weeks will be decided on by the PI on a case by case basis but will only be allowed if&#xD;
           delay is due to a slow ANC recovery that has been attributed to a medication or if the&#xD;
           delay was for a non-medical reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Post Transplant Vaccine #2: Four weeks +/- 7 days after post-transplant vaccine #1, a&#xD;
           second Boost vaccination will be administered. At the time of vaccination ANC must be &gt;&#xD;
           1.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Subjects who are randomized to the CPG arm will receive CPG immediately after vaccine #1&#xD;
      and vaccine #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7) Blood samples for evaluation of immune response will be collected throughout the study&#xD;
      procedures. Specifically, blood samples will be obtained within 7 days prior to initial&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Blood will also be collected prior to receiving vaccine # 1 and #2 on the day&#xD;
      on which vaccine is administered or up to 2 days before hand. In addition, blood will be&#xD;
      drawn 7 days after each vaccination and at one, three and six months after the second&#xD;
      vaccination. These blood samples will be used for analyzing T cell responses as detailed in&#xD;
      section 3.7. The day 7 draws must be drawn +/- 2 day. The one, three and six month draws may&#xD;
      occur +/- 1 week.&#xD;
