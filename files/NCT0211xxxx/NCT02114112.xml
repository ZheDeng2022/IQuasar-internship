      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP)&#xD;
      cycling to continuous NCPAP in successful weaning of preterm infants of 25-28 weeks gestation&#xD;
      to nasal prongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 40 infants with a gestational age (GA) of 25-28 weeks ventilated for&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and extubated to NCPAP are eligible for the study. They&#xD;
      will be randomized to NCPAP cycling {Group A; cycling between NCPAP of 4 cm and 1litre per&#xD;
      minute of nasal prongs} or to continuous CPAP at 4 cm of water (Group B). Primary outcome is&#xD;
      the number of babies who came off NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the intervention and&#xD;
      remained off NCPAP for the next 72 hours. The duration of NCPAP, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia&#xD;
      (BPD) at 36 weeks post menstrual age and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) stage ≥3 will be&#xD;
      the secondary outcomes.&#xD;

      Randomized Controlled Trial to Study the Effect of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure&#xD;
      (NCPAP) Cycling on Successful Weaning when Compared with Continuous Nasal Positive Airway&#xD;
      Pressure (NCPAP) in Premature Infants of 25-28 weeks gestations Background: In Canada,&#xD;
      preterm babies of &lt; 28 weeks gestation constitute 12% of all newborn admissions and their&#xD;
      survival has increased from 65% to 72%. In Alberta, the premature birth rate has been&#xD;
      increasing over the past several years and although these preterm infants make up a small&#xD;
      percentage of births, they add disproportionately to the mortality, morbidity and cost of&#xD;
      medical care. Their rate of long-term neurodevelopmental disability is also&#xD;
      disproportionately high. Advances in neonatal ventilation and neonatal care including&#xD;
      increased use of antenatal steroids, postnatal surfactant, improved mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and early use of total parenteral nutrition have improved survival of extremely low birth&#xD;
      weight (ELBW) premature infants. Despite these advances, the incidence of Bronchopulmonary&#xD;
      Dysplasia (BPD) in these infants remains high in Southern Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perinatal risk factors and the duration of mechanical ventilation, including high inspired&#xD;
      oxygen, high peak inspiratory pressure, lower positive end-expiratory pressure, higher&#xD;
      ventilation rate and hypocarbia (Partial pressure of carbon dioxide &lt; 40 cm of water at 48 to&#xD;
      96 hours) are associated with later development of BPD in these premature infants. Although&#xD;
      pressure-induced injury might play a role in the injury leading to 'new' BPD, alveolar over&#xD;
      distention is likely to be a more important contributing factor. Atelectasis also contributes&#xD;
      to BPD as ventilation of the atelectatic lung leads to pulmonary parenchymal injury through&#xD;
      the sheer stress of repeatedly reinflating collapsed alveoli. Despite various preventive and&#xD;
      treatment strategies including permissive hypercapnia, high frequency ventilation,&#xD;
      antioxidants, indomethacin, fluid restriction and use of diuretic, the prevalence of BPD&#xD;
      continues to be unacceptably high. It is unclear whether minimum ventilator pressure exposure&#xD;
      to premature lungs could prevent increasing incidence of BPD with the use of nasal continuous&#xD;
      positive airways pressure (NCPAP) cycling ( NCPAP for a few hours alternating with continuous&#xD;
      nasal flow) when compared with continuous NCPAP. High pressure on the ventilator or&#xD;
      continuous NCPAP possibly remains an underlying mechanism for pressure and volume induced&#xD;
      injury to the lungs and exhaustion of the respiratory muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged ventilation may predispose diaphragmatic myofibrils to disuse atrophy or failure of&#xD;
      normal growth, which contributes, to difficulties in weaning infants from mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator support including Nasal continuous positive airways pressure (NCPAP). Age and&#xD;
      gestation dependent changes in contractile function of the diaphragm include decreased&#xD;
      fatigue resistance with advancing maturation and Ventilator Induced Diaphragmatic Dysfunction&#xD;
      (VIDD). The combination of high work, rapid breathing, and low-oxidative capacity suggests&#xD;
      respiratory muscle fatigue in the infant with respiratory disease. Even short-term controlled&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation produces significant remodeling and functional alterations of the&#xD;
      diaphragm, which could impede efforts at discontinuing ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation has also been associated with infections, subglottic&#xD;
      stenosis and aspiration. Therefore, clinicians strive to wean early from the ventilator and&#xD;
      avoid reintubation once infants are extubated. Clinical signs of respiratory failure after&#xD;
      extubation include apnea (prolonged cessation of respiration for 20 seconds or more and/or&#xD;
      associated with cyanosis; abrupt, marked pallor or hypotonia; bradycardia), respiratory&#xD;
      acidosis or increasing oxygen requirements. These problems may lead to reintubation and&#xD;
      ventilation with their attendant morbidity and economic costs. NCPAP appears to stabilize the&#xD;
      upper airway, improve lung function and reduce apnea. Randomized trials have shown that&#xD;
      NCPAP, applied prophylactically after extubation, reduces the need for additional ventilatory&#xD;
      support and is associated with a lower incidence of BPD compared to mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
      NCPAP supports the compliant chest wall of the neonate by providing a pneumatic splint to&#xD;
      counteract the tendency to move paradoxically during inspiration or to collapse upon&#xD;
      expiration. NCPAP has been used to prevent extubation failure and as an alternative to&#xD;
      intubation and ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome in very preterm infants. The&#xD;
      optimal method of weaning infants from NCPAP remains unanswered. Although some Neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care units try abrupt discontinuation of NCPAP, most wean on an ad hoc basis by&#xD;
      gradually decreasing either time spent on the Infant Flow Driver (IFD) or the NCPAP pressure.&#xD;
      Early discontinuation of NCPAP may carry the risk of pulmonary atelectasis, apnea and&#xD;
      bradycardia. The most common reason for failure to wean on NCPAP is respiratory acidosis,&#xD;
      apneas, bradycardias, and increasing oxygen requirements above 60%. Similarly, the most&#xD;
      common reason for re-ventilation is respiratory acidosis. In a prospective study in 2011 on&#xD;
      preterm infants with resolving respiratory distress syndrome, NCPAP impeded systemic and&#xD;
      pulmonary venous return but did not compromise systemic arterial pressure or heart rate. The&#xD;
      important issue, therefore, is the rationale of continuing NCPAP when supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      requirement have ended, in the absence of moderate-to-severe apnea. Mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and NCPAP both tend to cause barotraumas and possibly BPD in premature infants. It is unclear&#xD;
      whether preterm infants who undergo NCPAP cycling with free flow of oxygen are at less risk&#xD;
      for BPD compared to those who are dependent on continuous NCPAP. In a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial of discontinuation of NCPAP in 2011, authors found that almost all preterm infants&#xD;
      breathing room air tolerated a 6 hour pause in NCPAP with no increase in apnea and&#xD;
      bradycardia. A reduction in the subsequent use of NCPAP was also observed. These findings led&#xD;
      to the development of a strategy to further reduce ventilator induced trauma and thus BPD.&#xD;
      This strategy used non-invasive intermittent continuous positive airway pressure ventilation&#xD;
      by alternating NCPAP with continuous nasal flow (CNF) via nasal prongs for ELBW infants. This&#xD;
      method of ventilation is termed cycling of NCPAP. In our subjective clinical experience,&#xD;
      cycling of NCPAP with CNF reduces the duration of respiratory support and therefore would be&#xD;
      expected to reduce the incidence of BPD. Cycling reduces duration of NCPAP and dependency,&#xD;
      trauma and or deviation of nasal septum, feed intolerance due to gastric distension,&#xD;
      agitation from pain/discomfort and nosocomial infection. The benefits of cycling NCPAP in&#xD;
      comparison to continuous NCPAP in premature infants have not been studied in clinical trials.&#xD;
      The aim of this pilot study is to establish the ability of NCPAP cycling to prevent&#xD;
      reintubation, decrease the duration of respiratory support and thereby, the incidence of BPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for this study: There is no evidence in the literature that premature infants who&#xD;
      are treated with NCPAP cycling alternating with continuous nasal air flow (CNF) versus NCPAP&#xD;
      without alternating CNF do better or worse in the immediate newborn period. We speculate that&#xD;
      NCPAP cycling or weaning will gradually shift the work of breathing from the supportive&#xD;
      intervention to the baby without producing fatigue of respiratory muscles and trauma to the&#xD;
      developing lungs. Currently, this mode of respiratory support is being used in our Neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit. It is largely determined by personal preferences with little clinical&#xD;
      data, only experimental or anecdotal evidence without any long-term outcomes data. A&#xD;
      retrospective study to confirm benefits of cycling NCPAP with CNF versus continuous NCPAP is&#xD;
      not feasible since duration of this alternative therapy has varied in infants of different&#xD;
      gestational ages. There is equipoise regarding the role of cycling NCPAP with CNF versus&#xD;
      continuous NCPAP without CNF in premature infants. Therefore, it would be prudent to study&#xD;
      the benefits of NCPAP cycling versus continuous NCPAP in premature infants. Our pilot study&#xD;
      will address the importance of NCPAP cycling as a useful weaning mode in ELBW infants.&#xD;
      Results of this pilot study will inform future power and sample size calculations for a&#xD;
      larger randomized controlled trial. Information obtained from this study will also fill gaps&#xD;
      in the existing knowledge in neonatal medicine and will resolve current controversies&#xD;
      concerning the use of NCPAP cycling with CNF versus continuous NCPAP in ELBW infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that more infants receiving NCPAP cycling with CNF will&#xD;
      successfully wean to nasal prongs in 72 hours compared with continuous NCPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for pilot study: Our pilot study is an initial or preliminary investigation&#xD;
      designed to test research hypothesis, gather data, and validate the scientific approach and&#xD;
      methodology for NCPAP with CNF cycling versus continuous NCPAP. Results of this study will be&#xD;
      an applied to designing a randomized controlled trial and in applying for an operating grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question: Does the use of NCPAP cycling with CNF in preterm infants of 25-28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation enable successful weaning of babies to nasal prongs in 72 hours when compared to&#xD;
      continuous NCPAP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine if a regimen on NCPAP with CNF will be&#xD;
      more successful in weaning babies to nasal prongs in 72 hours compared with continuous NCPAP&#xD;
      in premature infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods: 1. Study Design: We propose a prospective, open label, pilot, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of two different methods of respiratory support after extubation in&#xD;
      premature infants in Neonatal intensive care unit. The two methods of respiratory supports&#xD;
      are alternating NCPAP and CNF versus continuous NCPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Subjects specifications: Settings: The study will be conducted in the level III Neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit at the Foothills Medical Centre in Calgary, Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population: All premature infants 25-28 weeks gestational age admitted to Neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample selection: Infants will be identified according to inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (described below). After obtaining informed consent from their parent(s), they will be&#xD;
      randomized and included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.Randomization: This will be achieved using a computerized random number generator. We will&#xD;
      use random block sizes of 2 and 4 to increase the likelihood of equal enrolment into each&#xD;
      group. Randomization procedure will occur on site, will be concealed and undertaken by health&#xD;
      personnel who will be not involved in our study. Treatment allocation cards will be wrapped&#xD;
      in foil and inserted into opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes which will be kept in&#xD;
      a locked drawer in the Neonatal intensive care unit. Envelopes will be opened sequentially at&#xD;
      the time of allocation. 4. Inclusion criteria: All premature infants born between 25-28 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and extubated to NCPAP for at&#xD;
      least 72hours are eligible. RDS will be defined by clinical criteria and radiological&#xD;
      findings. 5. Exclusion criteria: Infants with major congenital anomalies including complex&#xD;
      heart disease, central causes for respiratory depression, persistent pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      and air leaks will be excluded from the study. 6. Recruitment: Infants meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were identified and investigators approached their parents&#xD;
      during the early clinical course while the baby is still ventilated to obtain informed&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Intervention: Predefined extubation criteria were used in guiding the decision to extubate&#xD;
      infants. The criteria for extubation are peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm water, positive&#xD;
      end expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water, intermittent mandatory ventilation rate of 10 to 20&#xD;
      and fraction of inspired oxygen 0.30 or based on attending physician's decision. Two hours&#xD;
      prior to extubation, infants were started on caffeine therapy. All infants were extubated to&#xD;
      Infant Flow Driver NCPAP as per standard practice. Infants, who remain on NCPAP for at least&#xD;
      72 hours and meet the Weaning from NCPAP criteria, were randomized to either the Weaning&#xD;
      regimen with cycling or the continuous NCPAP regimen without cycling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weaning regimen in intervention arm: The weaning protocol was as follows:- 10 hours on NCPAP&#xD;
      followed by 2 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at 1litre per minute flow for 12 hours&#xD;
      8 hours on NCPAP followed by 4 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at 1litre per minute&#xD;
      flow for 12 hours 6 hours on NCPAP followed by 6 hours on binasal Hudson's nasal cannula at&#xD;
      1litre per minute flow for 24 hours 4 hours on NCPAP followed by 8 hours on binasal Hudson's&#xD;
      nasal cannula at 1litre per minute flow for 24 hours Each infant was assessed following every&#xD;
      12-hour period clinically, with blood gases and a chest radiograph at the end of the first&#xD;
      cycle &amp; at the end of intervention. Continuous NCPAP regimen: After the infant is randomized&#xD;
      to this group, he/she was placed on Infant Flow Driver CPAP at a pressure of 4 cm of water&#xD;
      for 72 hours continuously. At the end of 72 hours, the infant was weaned to NP at 1litre per&#xD;
      minute. If an infant meets the failure criteria, continuous NCPAP was restarted. Blood gas&#xD;
      analysis was done at 12-hour intervals, which is in keeping with the standard of care for&#xD;
      monitoring infants who are being weaned off of respiratory support. The infant's ACoRN score&#xD;
      will be plotted every 12 hours or sooner if there is an acute deterioration. Success was&#xD;
      defined as remaining off NCPAP for 72hours after the intervention. Weaning from NCPAP&#xD;
      Criteria: 1) ACoRN respiratory score≤4 and 2) NCPAP pressures equal to 5 cm of water and 3)&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen requirement less than 40% and 4) potential of hydrogen (pH) &gt;7.25 and 5)&#xD;
      Tolerating time off NCPAP well during nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ACoRN respiratory score ≥5 or increase from previous score by 2 points in a 12 hour&#xD;
           period or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. supplemental oxygen more than 50% or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. acidosis with pH&lt;7.25 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. apnea with bradycardia or desaturation requiring stimulation &gt;1/hour or&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. apneic episode requiring Positive Pressure Ventilation with Bag &amp; Mask in a 12 hour&#xD;
           period. Criteria to Reintubate at any point during the study include&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Acidosis with pH ≤7.2 or two consecutive pH≤7.25 or 2) Fractional inspired oxygen more&#xD;
      than 50% or Partial pressure of carbon dioxide ≥70 or 3) Severe recurrent apnea (≥2 apneas&#xD;
      requiring intermittent positive-pressure ventilation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygen concentration will be titrated by the clinical team to achieve a transcutaneous oxygen&#xD;
      saturation of between 88 and 92% as per the policy in our neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: Number of babies who came off the NCPAP at the end of 72 hours of the&#xD;
      intervention and remained off NCPAP for 72 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total duration of NCPAP after the intervention,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BPD at 36 weeks of post-conceptional age,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ROP stage 3 and more Additional data collection: gestational age, birth weight, RDS,&#xD;
           antenatal steroids, surfactant treatment, sepsis, Intraventricular hemorrhage, Patent&#xD;
           ductus arterioses, pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, Necrotizing enterocolitis. A data&#xD;
           collection form will be used to gather information regarding the antenatal history,&#xD;
           birth data, and details of ventilation, details of intervention, complications and&#xD;
           outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Sample size: Since this was a pilot study the investigators&#xD;
      planned to enroll 20 premature infants in each group by randomization. The results of this&#xD;
      study will help to plan a complete randomized controlled trial. For full study sample size&#xD;
      estimation: The sample size estimates will be based on the results obtained from our pilot&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Data was analyzed using statistical package statistical analysis system (SAS)&#xD;
      with the assistance of a biostatistician. A test for difference in proportions was performed&#xD;
      and a 95% confidence interval for the difference provided. Student's t-test was used for&#xD;
      continuous variables where the data is normally distributed and Chi square-test for&#xD;
      categorical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: The study was submitted to the research ethics board of University of&#xD;
      Calgary. Confidentiality of patient data was enforced throughout the study. Study number&#xD;
      identified each patient only. Written informed consent was obtained from parents prior to&#xD;
      enrolment in the study. Participation in the study was voluntary and parents were allowed to&#xD;
      withdraw their infants at any time during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of the study: In the year 2009, a total of 110 infants were born between 25 and&#xD;
      28 weeks gestation at Foothills Medical Centre. Therefore investigators planned to complete&#xD;
      the study within two years.&#xD;
