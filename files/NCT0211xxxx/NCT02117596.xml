  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Damage and scarring of a transplanted kidney has become the most common cause of loss of the&#xD;
      transplanted kidney. This kidney damage is a complex process caused by many factors including&#xD;
      injury during obtaining and transplanting the kidney, injury from the immune system, injury&#xD;
      from infections, and injury from drugs used to stop rejection. This injury leads to scars&#xD;
      that decrease the kidney's ability to function properly, and over time the kidney is lost.&#xD;
      Prograf® (tacrolimus) has been one of the main drugs used to prevent rejection. However, when&#xD;
      used over time it has been shown to cause chronic damage and scarring in the transplanted&#xD;
      kidney.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this experimental study is to determine whether children can safely be&#xD;
      withdrawn from Prograf® after transplantation and changed to Rapamycin® (sirolimus). Recent&#xD;
      research studies in adult transplantation have demonstrated that with the use of Rapamycin®&#xD;
      (sirolimus), it is possible to discontinue the use of Prograf (tacrolimus) with no increase&#xD;
      in rejection, with decreased scarring in the kidney, and with improvements in kidney function&#xD;
      and survival of the kidney. A total of 50 children will enroll in this study at university&#xD;
      centers around the country. This study will last about 3 years.&#xD;

      Advances in immunosuppressive therapies in pediatrics have been associated with rapidly&#xD;
      falling incidence of acute rejection and improving allograft survival. In recent analyses of&#xD;
      the NAPRTCS database, acute rejection is no longer the most common cause of hospitalization&#xD;
      or allograft failure. Chronic rejection has now become the most common cause of allograft&#xD;
      failure and accounts for over 35% of allograft loss. Chronic rejection is a complex clinical&#xD;
      condition that includes both immunologic and non-immunologic causes and is more accurately&#xD;
      referred to as Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN). Although Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)&#xD;
      have played a central role in reducing acute rejection and improving allograft survival, it&#xD;
      has long been shown that they contribute to interstitial fibrosis and chronic allograft&#xD;
      nephropathy. Recent trials in adult transplantation have demonstrated that with the use of&#xD;
      the TOR-inhibitor, Sirolimus, it is possible to withdraw Calcineurin inhibitors with no&#xD;
      increase in rejection and with improvements in allograft function, interstitial fibrosis and&#xD;
      long term survival (1). We hypothesize that the use of Sirolimus (SRL) in pediatric kidney&#xD;
      transplantation will allow the withdrawal of Calcineurin inhibitor and improved kidney&#xD;
      function and long term survival. We plan to enroll 50 patients at the time of&#xD;
      transplantation. Patients will receive routine immunosuppression of CNI (Prograf),&#xD;
      Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) and prednisone. Those patients with normal function and no&#xD;
      rejection episodes after 6 months of transplantation will undergo a slow conversion from&#xD;
      Prograf to Sirolimus (Rapamune). We will then assess the rate of rejection, allograft&#xD;
      function, fibrosis on biopsy, and allograft survival over the following 18 months.&#xD;
