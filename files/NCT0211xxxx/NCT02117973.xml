    <description>iAssist is an electronic displacement sensor based instrumentation system that provides intra-operative verification at each surgical step (bone cuts alignment and resection level); in order to help reduce bone cuts errors. iAssist features simple and intuitive instrumentation that is based on conventional total knee arthroplasty instrumentation. iAssist should take less than 2-3 minutes (on average) to setup</description>
