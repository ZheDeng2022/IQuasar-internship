  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open-label, prospective, single arm, multicenter study of&#xD;
      everolimus in histologically confirmed, neuroendocrine carcinoma G3 /neuroendocrine tumor G3&#xD;
      after failure of first-line platin-based chemotherapy (open-label pilot study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to provide a second line therapy to patients with any type of&#xD;
      platinum based first line chemotherapy, to gather data on disease control rate and&#xD;
      progression free survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As more efficient drugs are urgently needed for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors the&#xD;
      investigator evaluated phosphorylated Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and effectors in a&#xD;
      series of NEC G3 at the Charité Center. Everolimus showed antiproliferative effects in&#xD;
      bronchial NET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a second approach the data of this study should be the basis to generate another study to&#xD;
      further explore everolimus as maintenance therapy in NEC G3/ NET G3.&#xD;
