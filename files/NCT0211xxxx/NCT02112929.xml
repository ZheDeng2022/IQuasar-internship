  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to use hyperpolarized xenon gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      computed tomography to develop a new technique capable of objectively and quantitatively&#xD;
      describing regional and structural lung abnormality. Since this is a relatively novel&#xD;
      technique, the investigators first need to acquire imaging and clinical data from a group of&#xD;
      participants with normal lungs. The investigators hope to generate an &quot;atlas&quot; of normality,&#xD;
      which will form the foundation of future studies to compare with patients suffering from&#xD;
      chronic respiratory disease. The investigators also aim to validate the new technique in&#xD;
      terms of intra-subject reproducibility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the gold standard for assessment of lung function in chronic respiratory disease&#xD;
      is spirometry. This is combined with anatomical imaging (chest x-ray and computed tomography)&#xD;
      for structural assessment. Spirometry only measures global lung function. It provides no&#xD;
      information regarding the different regions of the lung or about the supporting &quot;framework&quot;&#xD;
      of the lung itself, the parenchyma. In addition, changes in lung function as measured with&#xD;
      spirometric indices do not correlate coherently with the symptoms experienced by patients,&#xD;
      nor reflect their decline in health. This weak relationship is probably because the lung is a&#xD;
      complex regional organ where localized disturbances of a variety of factors including gas&#xD;
      flow (ventilation), blood flow (perfusion) and gas transfer all combine to impair respiratory&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI has the advantage of being an imaging technique free from ionizing radiation making it&#xD;
      safe and practical for diseases such as asthma and obstructive lung disease where repeated&#xD;
      follow-up scans are necessary. Hyperpolarized xenon, in the doses given for imaging has been&#xD;
      shown to be safe. Conventional MRI has limited use in respiratory disease, because the lung&#xD;
      is largely composed of air spaces that do not generate an MR signal. Hyperpolarized noble&#xD;
      gases can resolve this problem.&#xD;
