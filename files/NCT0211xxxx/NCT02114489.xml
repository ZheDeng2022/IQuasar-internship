      Aseptic osteonecrosis of the hip (AOH) concern 1 Swiss young adult to 1000 (30-40 years old).&#xD;
      They are responsible to a severe joint destruction and in the majority of cases a joint&#xD;
      replacement. To the hip, we can distinguish 4 stages of osteonecrosis according to Ficat: 1,&#xD;
      2, 3, 4. Stage 3 and 4 AOH management are unanimous surgical. But management of stage 1 and 2&#xD;
      are unclear. Bisphophonates are mainly used for bone and osteoporosis diseases. They decrease&#xD;
      the bone turn over, and the risk of fracture. They also decrease the bone marrow oedema and&#xD;
      the pain associated to this oedema. Ibandronate is a bisphosphonate with a rapid effect, a&#xD;
      short half-life, easy to manage, and with few side effects. We designed a double-blind&#xD;
      prospective randomized trial aiming to evaluate the efficacy of an infusion of ibandronate&#xD;
      versus placebo on pain and AOH progression in patients with stage 1 and 2 AOH. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      is that there will be a pain reduction &gt;=20 mm on the VAS scale (SD 10mm) in the ibandronate&#xD;
      group versus placebo, and a non radiological progression in the treated group.&#xD;

      Aseptic osteonecrosis of the hip (AOH) concern 1 Swiss young adult to 1000 (30-40 years old).&#xD;
      They are responsible to a severe joint destruction and in the majority of cases a joint&#xD;
      replacement. AOH represented 10% of the hip replacement in Switzerland. It could be multiple.&#xD;
      In this situation, they can be associated with a specific disease, justifying more&#xD;
      collaboration between surgeon and specialist on bone diseases or rheumatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially patient with AOH presents mechanical pain and dysfunction. Either surgeon or&#xD;
      rheumatologist can suspect the diagnosis. To the hip, we can distinguish 4 stages of&#xD;
      osteonecrosis according to Ficat: 1, 2, 3, 4. The unfavourable evolution to a worst stage is&#xD;
      common and depend on the necrosis surface: less than 10% at 3 years if the surface is small,&#xD;
      25% if the surface is moderate, 84% if the surface is extended. In case of fortuitous&#xD;
      discovery, natural evolution to the collapse from stage 1 is 55%, from stage 2 56% and from&#xD;
      stage 3 96% with a median time of 39 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mainly, in case of early Ficat stage (1), the final diagnosis is supported by a specific&#xD;
      image on MRI. It could be confounding with a differential diagnosis of transient&#xD;
      osteoporosis. Stage 3 and 4 AOH management are unanimous surgical. But management of stage 1&#xD;
      and 2 are unclear. Based on the physiopathology, associating 2 hypothesis (one vascular, one&#xD;
      osseous), bisphosphonates could be interesting to decrease the pain and the bone defect whom&#xD;
      evaluated to a joint collapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bisphophonates are mainly used for bone and osteoporosis diseases. They decrease the bone&#xD;
      turn over, and the risk of fracture. They decrease the bone marrow oedema and the pain&#xD;
      associated to this oedema. Ibandronate is a bisphosphonate with a rapid effect, a short&#xD;
      half-life, easy to manage, and with few side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding these considerations, a study gathering surgeons, specialist in bone diseases and&#xD;
      radiologist is necessary. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to increase the knowledge&#xD;
      in this pathology and to well manage patients. The exact diagnosis of AOH needs a radiologic&#xD;
      expertise, the well management of movement and staging evolution needs an orthopaedic&#xD;
      management, the deliverance of treatment and bone efficacy of it needs a bone diseases&#xD;
      expertise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized double blind with placebo study was designed. All consecutive&#xD;
      patients (18-50 yo) seen in OTP and RHU/CMO units of the CHUV with a confirmed diagnosis of a&#xD;
      single stage 1 or 2 according to Ficat AOH by an MRI could be included. After informed and&#xD;
      signed consent, they will be randomized to receive either placebo or 3 mg of ibandronate.&#xD;
      Infusion will be performed in 15 minutes. Size effect (pain VAS, Harris, Womac, EQ5D, gait&#xD;
      parameters, blood analysis) and side effects will be record at day 3, 7, month 1, 3, and 6.&#xD;
      If a patient has a persistent pain (same or worse VAS) at M3, a second infusion will be&#xD;
      performed, only with ibandronate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M1 and M3 an MRI will be performed to confirm the stage 1 (DD transient osteoporosis) only&#xD;
      for the stage 1 previous diagnosed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At M3 and M6 an X ray and an MRI will be performed for all patients to analyze the stage&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point will be at M6 for pain VAS and radiological progression. Patients who&#xD;
      need a second infusion at 3 months would be considered as not survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize a reduction of 20 mm on the VAS scale (SD 10mm) in the ibandronate group&#xD;
      versus placebo, and a non radiological progression in the treated group. With a power to 90%&#xD;
      and an alpha of 0.05 we want to include 50 patients. Drugs: Patients will be allowed to have&#xD;
      pain killers or NSAI prescribe by the investigator or the GP. All drugs have to be noted in&#xD;
      the diary. All patients will receive a physiotherapy prescription of one treatment per week,&#xD;
      over a period of 3 months. Moreover, the patient may freely choose any physiotherapist. The&#xD;
      prescription will be given by the investigator. Furthermore, the sessions can be spaced out&#xD;
      during the last three months, at the investigators discretion. On one hand participants will&#xD;
      be asked to not overwork. On other hand, participants will be asked to not adapt a non&#xD;
      weight-bearing status either.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the economical point of view, looking at the CHUV scale only, 10% of the hip&#xD;
      arthroplasties made for AOH means 30 patients each year. If the treatment allows postponing&#xD;
      10 years the need of an arthroplasty as one study published with a lower methodology&#xD;
      suggests, it means an economy of CHF 1'200'000 each year.&#xD;
