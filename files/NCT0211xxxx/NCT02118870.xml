      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in ACS patients treated with DES is still&#xD;
      under debate. This is especially true for STEMI patients in the era of new anticoagulants and&#xD;
      antiplatelet agents. Yet, the potential benefits of longterm dual antiplatelet therapy in&#xD;
      avoiding thrombotic complications may be clearly counterbalanced by a higher risk of major&#xD;
      bleeding complications. In particular, the COMBO dual therapy stent, being associated with&#xD;
      early re-endothelization, may allow for a reduction of the duration of DAPT (dual anti&#xD;
      plateled therapy) without increasing the thrombotic risk, while reducing the risk of severe&#xD;
      bleeding complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the current study is to demonstrate a non-inferiority of a strategy of short-term DAPT&#xD;
      (90 days) as compared to standard 360 days DAPT in ACS patients treated with Combo stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, investigator-initiated study designed&#xD;
      to enroll 1500 patients with ACS receiving a COMBO dual-therapy stent who will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to either short term (90 days) or to standard (360 days) DAPT. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized within hospitalization (before discharge in case additional revascularization is&#xD;
      deemed necessary and performed during hospitalization). Clinical visit is scheduled at 90,&#xD;
      and 360 days, whereas a telephone contact will be performed at 180 and 720 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of up to 1500 ACS patients (male and female) older than 18&#xD;
      years amenable to percutaneous treatment and treated with a COMBO stent. Subjects must meet&#xD;
      all of the eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent.&#xD;

      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 investigational sites in Europe and Asia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (clinic) visits are scheduled at 90 and 360 days, whereas a telephone contact will&#xD;
      be performed at 180 and 720 days. Patients randomized to short-term DAPT will continue on&#xD;
      monotherapy with ASA after 90 days unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiplatelet therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be treated with Aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitor. Prasugrel (10 mg/day) or&#xD;
      Ticagrelor (180 mg/day) are strongly recommended as compared to Clopidogrel (75 mg/day)).&#xD;
      Long term DAPT arm: will continue DAPT with P2Y12 inhibitors and ASA up to 360 days, after&#xD;
      which patients will continue on monotherapy with ASA only, unless contraindications for ASA&#xD;
      emerge Short term DAPT arm: will continue DAPT with P2Y12 inhibitors and ASA up to 90 days,&#xD;
      after which patients will continue.&#xD;
