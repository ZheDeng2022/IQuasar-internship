      The primary objective of this open-label phase Ib trial is to determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose and the recommended phase II dose for the combination of PF-03446962 plus regorafenib in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The secondary objectives are to describe the&#xD;
      safety and tolerablility, and to describe the clinical activity of PF-03446962 plus&#xD;
      regorafenib in terms of response rate and progression free survival&#xD;

             contraceptives must be continued throughout the trial by either sex and for 2 months&#xD;
             (60 days) following last dose of either drug. Hormonal contraceptives are not&#xD;
             acceptable as a sole method of contraception. (Women of childbearing potential must&#xD;

             ECGs should be obtained over a brief period of time (e.g., within 15-20 minutes) to&#xD;
             confirm the abnormality. The average QTc interval will be determined from the 3 ECG&#xD;
             tracings by manual evaluation and will be used to determine if the subject will be&#xD;
             excluded from the study. The same method of QTc determination must be used throughout&#xD;
             the subject's participation in the trial.&#xD;
