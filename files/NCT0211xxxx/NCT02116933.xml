    <textblock>
      Grafting of autologous stromal cell trial is a prospective study comparing routine fat&#xD;
      grafting versus stromal vascular fraction enriched fat grafting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to objectively compare outcomes between autologous fat grafting&#xD;
      breast augmentation and stromal vascular fraction enhanced autologous fat grafting for&#xD;
      cosmetic breast augmentation in a carefully designed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given the option of participating in one of two studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A small, level I study will compare AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in the same patient. One&#xD;
           breast will be treated with AFG alone (control) and the other breast with SVF-enriched&#xD;
           AFG (experimental).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A larger, level II study comparing AFG to SVF-enriched AFG in different patients. The&#xD;
           patient will either receive AFG alone in both breasts or SVF-enhanced AFG in both&#xD;
           breasts.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must consent in writing to participate in the study by signing and dating an&#xD;
             informed consent document indicating that the patient has been informed of all&#xD;
             pertinent aspects of the study prior to completing any of the screening procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female of any race, age 21-65.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must desire a small breast augmentation with a Â½-1 cup size increase in their&#xD;
             breast volume. (If they wish to have a larger breast size increase, then they must&#xD;
             understand a secondary procedure may be required to achieve that size increase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a normal physical exam with no breast masses, no nipple discharge,&#xD;
             no fibrocystic disease, no axillary adenopathy and/or history of abnormal bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or lactating when enrolled in the study and must agree&#xD;
             to have a pregnancy test (urine or blood) prior to the surgical procedure. - The&#xD;
             patient should also not be trying to get pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a stable weight and not be fluctuating in their weight (otherwise&#xD;
             this will distort volumetric measurements of breast size post operatively, making it&#xD;
             impossible to determine true augmentation volume from SVF-enriched AFG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must also consent to be photographed before and after the procedure and at&#xD;
             the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the&#xD;
             study must also consent to undergo ultrasound imaging of the breast prior to the&#xD;
             procedure and after the procedure to evaluate and treat any oil-filled cysts that may&#xD;
             arise due to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients in the level I (randomized) and level II (nonrandomized) part of the&#xD;
             study must also consent to allow their results to be included in any scientific&#xD;
             research, scientific publication, or presentations at scientific meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients in the level I and level II part of the study must also consent to allow&#xD;
             their photos to be used for publication in scientific journals, internet website, and&#xD;
             patient educational material such as brochures, before and after photos, and patient&#xD;
             education videos.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients in the study must also agree to have mammography done when indicated&#xD;
             after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients in the study must agree to have a biopsy of any suspicious abnormality&#xD;
             seen on mammography, ultrasound, or MRI during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be anemic at the time of the procedure (Hg &lt; 10). If they are anemic&#xD;
             at the time of enrollment, they can still be included in the study if the anemia is&#xD;
             corrected pre-operatively with iron supplementation. This must be continued during the&#xD;
             study to avoid any adverse reporting that may not be related to the procedure (i.e.&#xD;
             anemia not caused by SVF-enriched fat grafting)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have no history of abnormal bleeding during surgery, bruising and no&#xD;
             personal/family history of coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be off aspirin and other NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the procedure and&#xD;
             have a normal blood coagulation panel within two weeks of surgery: Pts &gt; 150K, PT(INR)&#xD;
             &lt; 1.3, APTT &lt;1.3Ãcontrol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal renal function (demonstrated by a Creatinine â¤ 1.5 mg/dl,)&#xD;
             and no urinary tract infection (less than 5 WBCs on UA and leukocyte esterase negative&#xD;
             on U/A Dipstick). If a UTI is present, the patient may still enroll if this is treated&#xD;
             pre-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a multigenerational family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer is present, a&#xD;
             surgical or medical oncologist must evaluate the patient to obtain pre-operative&#xD;
             clearance and to provide reassurance that they do not need BRCA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior radiation to the chest wall (for Hodgkin's disease) may not be&#xD;
             included in the study.&#xD;
