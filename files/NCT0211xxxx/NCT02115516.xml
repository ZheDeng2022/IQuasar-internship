      TÜCHMI-002 is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge dose finding trial with two chemoprophylactic regimens and subsequent controlled&#xD;
      human malaria infection (CHMI), designed to establish a regimen of PfSPZ Challenge under&#xD;
      chemoprophylaxis, with PfSPZ Challenge administered IV, that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provides consistent sterile protection against CHMI with homologous sporozoites in&#xD;
           healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is a practical regimen for PfSPZ Challenge chemoprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will receive three immunizing PfSPZ Challenge IV injections 4 weeks apart under&#xD;
      oral chemoprophylaxis. The trial is sequential and has two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) In the first stage, the PfSPZ Challenge dose is increased sequentially from 3,200 to&#xD;
      51,200 PfSPZ among the three groups. Controls for the three groups will receive 0.9% Sodium&#xD;
      Chloride (NaCl) as placebo. All volunteers will receive a standard chemoprophylactic regimen&#xD;
      of chloroquine (CQ) for 10 weeks. Briefly, 10 mg/kg CQ base will be given as loading dose&#xD;
      followed by weekly doses of 5 mg/kg CQ base. Homologous CHMI is done with 3,200 PfSPZ&#xD;
      Challenge IV eight weeks after the last immunizing PfSPZ Challenge injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) In Stage B, accelerated regimens with CQ and CQ plus ER-AZ will be assessed. Initiation of&#xD;
      Stage B of the trial is dependent upon demonstration of at least 75% (6 out of 8) protective&#xD;
      efficacy against homologous CHMI in Stage A, no PfSPZ Challenge related SAEs and approval by&#xD;
      the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC). CHMI is done with 3,200 PfSPZ Challenge (NF54) IV ten&#xD;
      weeks after the last immunization with PfSPZ Challenge under chemoprophylaxis. Injections are&#xD;
      either done over 28 or 10 days, chemoprophylaxis is given for 5 weeks and 15 days,&#xD;
      respectively. Control groups will receive 0.9% NaCl IV as placebo under the respective&#xD;
      chemoprophylactic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transition from Stage A to Stage B depends on a positive safety and efficacy review and&#xD;
      approval by an independent SMC. Safety and efficacy data will also be submitted to the&#xD;
      regulatory authorities (FDA in the U.S. and Paul-Ehrlich-Institute in Germany) as well as to&#xD;
      the Ethics Committee. Sponsor, SMC and principal investigator will select PfSPZ dose after&#xD;
      review of safety and efficacy data. In case of 100% efficacy of more than one dose regimen&#xD;
      and comparable tolerability and safety, the higher PfSPZ dose will be used. Information about&#xD;
      the selected dose together with the updated volunteer information document stating the dose&#xD;
      will be submitted to the ethics committee for approval before initiation of Stage B. In case&#xD;
      that PfSPZ Challenge related SAEs occur or efficacy of the best regimen is below 75% the&#xD;
      study will not proceed to Stage B.&#xD;

With demonstration of the effectiveness of ER-AZ, the 2nd and 3rd immunizations will be done under ER-AZ alone, otherwise CQ prophylaxis will continue and ER-AZ will not be administered for the 2nd and 3rd injections.

        In case of inconclusive results of laboratory tests or other diagnostic procedures, test&#xD;
