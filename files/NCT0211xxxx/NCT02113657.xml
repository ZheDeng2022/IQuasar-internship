  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the impact of ipilimumab on the immune&#xD;
      system of patients currently receiving hormone therapy. The safety of these drug combinations&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of melanoma. Its use to treat prostate cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive ipilimumab by&#xD;
      vein over about 90 minutes at Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10. Your blood pressure will be measured&#xD;
      every 30 minutes during the infusion, as well as an hour after you are finished receiving the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will continue to receive your current hormone therapy as scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given standard drugs (such as steroids) to help decrease severe side effects. You&#xD;
      may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a study visit before each dose of ipilimumab, then every 4 weeks for a total of&#xD;
      3 visits after the last dose of ipilimumab. At each of these visits, the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood&#xD;
           will also be used and to measure your protein, PSA levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 7 tablespoons) and urine will be collected to test for biomarkers. (Weeks&#xD;
           7, 14, and 22 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1Â½ teaspoons) will be drawn to check your testosterone level. (Week 10&#xD;
           only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (up to 10 tablespoons) will be drawn to test your immune system. You will sign a&#xD;
           separate consent form for this blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 14 and 22, the following tests and procedures will be performed to check the status&#xD;
      of the disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may have a chest x-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT scans or MRIs of the abdomen, pelvis. If the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
           needed, you will also have a CT scan of the chest. If a CT scan of the chest is done, a&#xD;
           chest x-ray is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have additional bone scans or CT scans or&#xD;
      MRIs of the abdomen, pelvis, or chest to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive the study drug for up to 10 weeks. You will remain on study (receiving your&#xD;
      standard hormone therapy) for up to a total of 22 weeks. You will be taken off study&#xD;
      treatment if you have intolerable side effects, if the disease gets worse, or if you are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions. If you develop certain side effects or have certain side&#xD;
      effects for a long period of time, you may be taken off study. The study doctor will let you&#xD;
      know if you need to be taken off study.&#xD;
