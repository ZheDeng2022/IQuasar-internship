  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improving end-of-life care and the suffering caused by poorly controlled symptoms is an&#xD;
      important public health concern. The development of an automated telephone symptom monitoring&#xD;
      and support system that assists caregivers in providing end-of-life care and communicating&#xD;
      information to the patient's hospice nurse has the potential to enhance the management of&#xD;
      common end of life symptoms, thus reducing the suffering of patients at end of life as well&#xD;
      as the suffering of their family caregivers. This study has developed such a system and is&#xD;
      testing the effectiveness of this system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals dying from cancer often live out their lives at home with a host of poorly&#xD;
      controlled symptoms. Ineffective symptom management results, in part, from inadequate&#xD;
      monitoring of patients once they leave the treatment-focused arena of the clinical setting.&#xD;
      The changing pattern of symptoms is challenging as care strategies and recommendations from&#xD;
      previous encounters with healthcare providers become quickly outdated. The burden of&#xD;
      end-of-life care largely falls to family caregivers, usually a spouse or partner, who feel&#xD;
      enormous pressure to provide physical and supportive care but often lacks the knowledge and&#xD;
      skill resulting in significant caregiver burden and distress that may extend into&#xD;
      bereavement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, clinical trial proposes to develop and test a telecommunication system,&#xD;
      Symptom Care by Phone- Hospice that has been designed to bridge the divide between home and&#xD;
      palliative care support for patients at the end of life and their family caregiver.&#xD;
      SCP-Hospice has three elements: 1) daily monitoring of symptoms common at end of life, 2)&#xD;
      automated alerting of the hospice nurse case manager about symptoms that have exceeded a&#xD;
      pre-set threshold for symptom severity or caregiver distress about symptoms, and 3)&#xD;
      automated, just in time, tailored care management strategies for the caregiver to implement&#xD;
      to address the patient's symptoms. Caregivers call the SCP-Hospice system daily to report&#xD;
      patient symptoms and then are immediately provided automated, tailored care suggestions&#xD;
      paired to the specific symptom profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are to test whether the SCP-Hospice intervention reduces&#xD;
      severity and distress from 12 different symptoms and whether it decreases caregiver burden,&#xD;
      anxiety, depressed mood and distress about the patient's symptoms and improves caregiver&#xD;
      sleep when compared with usual care. The mechanisms that explain how SCP-Hospice affect these&#xD;
      outcomes also will be explored. Other aims will compare patient care strategies utilized by&#xD;
      caregivers and evaluate caregiver and Hospice nurse satisfaction with the SCP system.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention in Project 1 SCP utilizes a multi-faceted system. The SCP-Hospice symptom management model will include several features: 1) a computer-based telecommunication system to monitor symptoms as perceived and reported by the family caregiver; 2) tailored care management messages that SCP provides directly to the caregivers to promote care management based on the individualized patient symptom profile and caregiver distress; and 3) an automated alerting function that notifies the hospice nurse of unrelieved symptoms that have exceeded a pre-set threshold.</description>
