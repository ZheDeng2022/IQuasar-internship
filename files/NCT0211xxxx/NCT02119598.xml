  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research on prehospital telestroke systems is recommended by the American Stroke Association,&#xD;
      as it may facilitate early stroke diagnosis, assessment of stroke severity and selection of&#xD;
      patients for specific stroke treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience with prehospital telemedicine for assessment of stroke severity is limited.&#xD;
      Prehospital telestroke is a very promising concept, facilitating specialized stroke care in&#xD;
      very early stage based on integration of bidirectional audiovisual communication with point&#xD;
      of care laboratory analysis, vitals and decision support software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the safety, the technical feasibility and&#xD;
      the reliability of in-ambulance telemedicine using a prototype third generation telemedicine&#xD;
      system (PreSSUB 3.0).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Timely treatment can effectively reduce the burden of stroke and should begin with optimal&#xD;
      prehospital stroke care. The slogans 'Time is brain' and 'Competence is brain' adequately&#xD;
      point out that acute stroke is a time-critical medical emergency requiring specialized&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pursuant to ongoing technological developments and in line with the American Stroke&#xD;
      Association and the European Stroke Organisation guidelines, the implementation of telestroke&#xD;
      for optimizing inhospital stroke care is currently applied in several countries. Research on&#xD;
      prehospital telestroke systems is recommended by the American Stroke Association, as it may&#xD;
      facilitate early stroke diagnosis, assessment of stroke severity and selection of patients&#xD;
      for specific stroke treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience with prehospital telemedicine for assessment of stroke severity, however, is&#xD;
      limited to the TeleBAT project and two recent pilot studies conducted in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Prehospital telestroke is a very promising concept, facilitating specialized stroke care in&#xD;
      very early stage based on integration of bidirectional audiovisual communication with point&#xD;
      of care laboratory analysis, vitals and decision support software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the Prehospital Stroke Study at the Universitair ziekenhuis Brussel (PreSSUB), we&#xD;
      have developed and tested several prototypes for prehospital telemedicine. The current system&#xD;
      consists of commercially available hardware and a Web-based telemedicine platform. The data&#xD;
      are transmitted to a multimedia server unit over a mobile (ultra)broadband connection (3G or&#xD;
      4G). Data privacy is secured by password-protected logins, role-based access control, and&#xD;
      hypertext transfer protocol secure encryption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of a feasibility study using the 4G network in healthy volunteers have recently&#xD;
      been reported and feasibility data using the 3G network in healthy volunteers are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building further on the reassuring safety and feasibility data specified above, the next&#xD;
      logical step is to evaluate this system for prehospital telemedicine in the real-life&#xD;
      situation involving transportation of patients in the Paramedic Ambulance team&#xD;
      (PIT)-ambulance to the UZ Brussel.&#xD;

    <description>A successful prehospital teleconsultation is defined as a personal interaction between a patient in a moving ambulance and a remote teleconsultant, based on wireless audiovisual communication and optional reporting of vital parameters (e.g. blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, glycemia), neurological deficit, key history taking, medication anamnesis, and/or patient identification.</description>
