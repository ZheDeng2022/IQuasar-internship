    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a&#xD;
      drug or other substance becomes available to the body) of JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 (test)&#xD;
      compared with JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 (reference) in healthy participants under fed&#xD;
      conditions at a single dose of 150 milligram (mg).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label (all&#xD;
      people know the identity of the intervention), 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence crossover&#xD;
      (participants may receive different interventions sequentially during the trial), and&#xD;
      single-center study of JNJ-54781532. The duration of study will be approximately of 5 weeks&#xD;
      per participant. The study consists of 3 parts: Screening (that is, 21 days before study&#xD;
      commences on Day 1); Open-label Treatment (consists of 2 single-dose treatments, either&#xD;
      JNJ-54781532 formulation 1 [reference] or JNJ-54781532 formulation 2 [test]), in subsequent&#xD;
      2-treatment periods, each separated with washout period of 7 days); and End-of-Study (done&#xD;
      upon completion of the 72-hour pharmacokinetic sampling on Day 4 of Period 2, or at the time&#xD;
      of early withdrawal). All the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2&#xD;
      treatment sequences to ensure that they receive both of the following treatments, one in each&#xD;
      period. Followed by an overnight fast of at least 10 hours participants will be administered&#xD;
      with study treatment 30 minutes after high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. Participants will not&#xD;
      be allowed to have food until 4 hours of drug administration. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and post-dose of study treatment. Relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of two formulations of JNJ-54781532 (test and reference) will be evaluated&#xD;
      primarily. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
