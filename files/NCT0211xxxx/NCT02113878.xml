  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called buparlisib (BKM120) as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This phase Ib study is combining standard chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and&#xD;
           BKM120 to assess tolerability of this combination in high risk patients with locally&#xD;
           advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). The investigators will&#xD;
           also obtain preliminary information about the efficacy of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participant will receive the study drug buparlisib once daily, by mouth, for 45&#xD;
           days. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each cycle. It will&#xD;
           include special instructions for taking the study drug at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be&#xD;
           administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who&#xD;
           participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The&#xD;
           dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study&#xD;
           before and how well they have tolerated their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive weekly cisplatin injection. Cisplatin will be given&#xD;
           intra-venously (IV) on days: (1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43) at DFCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will receive daily radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy&#xD;
           (IMRT) for 7 weeks, delivered at DFCI. IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional radiation therapy&#xD;
           that uses computer-generated images to show the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams&#xD;
           of radiation of different intensities are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type&#xD;
           of radiation therapy reduces the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators would like to keep track of the participant's medical condition.&#xD;
           Follow-up will continue every 4 to 12 weeks after the end of treatment for the first&#xD;
           year and at the investigator's discretion thereafter.&#xD;
