      Background: Atrophic gastritis (AG) is the single most important precursor condition for&#xD;
      gastric cancer (GC) known so far. H. pylori infection is the most important causative agent&#xD;
      of gastritis, and subsequent AG. The GastroPanel test (Biohit HealthCare, Helsinki, Finland),&#xD;
      a blood test evaluating the four biomarkers specific for the gastric mucosa pepsinogen I&#xD;
      (P-PGI), pepsinogen II (P-PGII), gastrin-17 (P-G-17) and H. pylori antibody (P-HpAb), is the&#xD;
      first non-invasive diagnostic tool providing possibilities for detecting the patients at risk&#xD;
      for GC and peptic ulcer as well as malabsorption of vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, calcium and&#xD;
      some drugs. A well designed clinical study is warranted to fully assess the performance of&#xD;
      GastroPanel examination in detecting the gastric lesions which can lead to GC. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to perform a clinical study in an adult population in United Kingdom in&#xD;
      order to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the GastroPanel test in evaluating AG and other&#xD;
      specific gastric conditions associated with an increased risk for GC. Methods: Two hundred&#xD;
      and fifty patients (45 years and older, both genders) will be enrolled among the patients&#xD;
      with dyspepsia referred for gastroscopy at Homerton University Hospital (London, United&#xD;
      Kingdom). During the same visit, all patients are subjected to gastroscopy examination, with&#xD;
      directed biopsies from the antrum and corpus, following the protocol of the operative link on&#xD;
      gastritis assessment (OLGA) classification for chronic gastritis and Sydney Classification.&#xD;
      Biopsies are examined at the Pathology laboratory of Homerton University Hospital and&#xD;
      interpreted using the OLGA staging system as well as the Sydney system for classification of&#xD;
      gastritis. Specific aims: The principal goal of this clinical trial is to establish the&#xD;
      performance of the GastroPanel examination in detecting AG and other specific gastric&#xD;
      conditions associated with an increased risk for GC. In particular, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate AG in the antrum, AG in the corpus, AG in both antrum and corpus (=atrophic&#xD;
      pangastritis), biopsy-confirmed dysplasia (intestinal metaplasia) of the gastric mucosa. For&#xD;
      all these conditions, the investigators will calculate the diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      GastroPanel test.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the diagnosis of most gastric and oesophageal diseases, requires an endoscopic&#xD;
      examination which is an invasive, time-consuming and expensive procedure. At present, there&#xD;
      are few non-invasive methods (e.g. tests for Helicobacter pylori) available for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of the upper gastrointestinal tract diseases. Any of these tests do not, however, give&#xD;
      possibilities for a comprehensive diagnosis of the different phenotypes of gastritis, i.e.,&#xD;
      whether superficial or atrophic, and located in the antrum or corpus. Importantly, these&#xD;
      tests do not give any clues about the severity (grade) of these lesions, as defined by the&#xD;
      Sydney and OLGA classification .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obviate the excessive use of this invasive and expensive procedure (endoscopy), there is&#xD;
      an urgent need to develop non-invasive diagnostic tools capable of accurately detecting the&#xD;
      patients at high risk for GC, i.e. the different phenotypes of gastritis as well as their&#xD;
      related H. pylori infections . After ELISA-testing for P-PG I, p-PG II, P-G-17 and P-Hp-Ab in&#xD;
      a plasma sample, an endoscopic examination can be preserved only for those patients whose&#xD;
      GastroPanel test results suggest AG, whereas an endoscopic examination can be avoided in&#xD;
      subjects with negative GastroPanel result, or in whom the test biomarkers indicate a&#xD;
      non-atrophic gastritis or a healthy stomach (18). Gastroscopy is also recommended if the&#xD;
      GastroPanel examination reveals high acid output (P-G-17 below 1,0 pmol/l) or chronic H.&#xD;
      pylori infection with symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is conducted as collaboration between Biohit HealthCare (Helsinki,&#xD;
      Finland) and Homerton University Hospital (London, UK) (hereafter called &quot;the Partners&quot;). The&#xD;
      study is performed in Homerton Hospital, supervised by a steering committee consisting of&#xD;
      members from both research Partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment of the patients in the study will take place at Homerton Hospital including&#xD;
      consecutive patients over 45 years of age, referred for gastroscopy at the Outpatient&#xD;
      Department of Endoscopy. The estimated cohort to be screened is at least 250 subjects (both&#xD;
      genders), to reach a cohort of 100 patents enriched with equal numbers (n=25) of all&#xD;
      conditions (see: Section 2, above) classified as study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient enrolment is taking place in a single step. In brief, the potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients are identified among the gastroscopy-referral outpatients by the members of the&#xD;
      research team. At this stage, every patient will be asked to consent the study and sign a&#xD;
      written consent to participate. Because all patients are enrolled among the subjects&#xD;
      attending the 11 Endoscopy clinic due to an appointment to gastroscopy, their preparation&#xD;
      will be compliant with the preparatory steps needed for the GastroPanel examination (details&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are all adult females and males, with dyspeptic symptoms (epigastric pain,&#xD;
      bloating and epigastric discomfort). However, the following patients should be considered&#xD;
      non-eligible: 1) the patients whose treatment requires surgery, or immediate follow-up&#xD;
      treatment for major symptoms, as well as 2) those that refuse to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, all patients examined with the GastroPanel test will be subjected to&#xD;
      gastroscopy, providing the histological confirmation to be used as the gold standard in&#xD;
      calculating the performance indicators for the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participating in this study shall undergo a routine gastroscopy examination,&#xD;
      which will be complemented by biopsy sampling from the antrum and corpus, according to the&#xD;
      principles of the Sydney and OLGA classification sampling. In endoscopy, all observed&#xD;
      abnormal mucosal lesions are noted and photographed, and if necessary (e.g. suspicion of&#xD;
      malignancy) subjected to additional biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS 21.0.0 for Windows (IBM, NY, USA)&#xD;
      and STATA/SE 13.0 software (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). The descriptive statistics will be done&#xD;
      according to routine procedures. Performance indicators (sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      predictive value, PPV, negative predictive value, NPV and their 95%CI) of individual markers&#xD;
      and whole GastroPanel test will be calculated separately for each study endpoint, using the&#xD;
      STATA/SE software and the diagti algorithm introduced by Seed et al. (2001). This algorithm&#xD;
      also calculates the area under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) called AUC, for each&#xD;
      biomarker at each endpoint. Because GastroPanel is a quantitative ELISA test, these ROC&#xD;
      curves can be used to identify the optimal sensitivity/specificity balance that gives each&#xD;
      biomarker an optimal threshold for detection of each study endpoint. Significance of the&#xD;
      difference between AUC values can be estimated using STATA's roccomb test with 95%CI.&#xD;
