      The purpose of this study is to identify and screen potential subjects for preliminary&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in a malaria related clinical trial conducted at the Seattle&#xD;
      Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) or one of our partnering sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a continuous study enrolling approximately 350 participants per year to establish&#xD;
      preliminary eligibility for participation in ongoing or future Seattle Malaria Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) clinical research studies. Data collected may be used to support&#xD;
      preliminary eligibility for a current or future Seattle MCTC clinical research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to maximize efficiency of the screening process potential participants who contact&#xD;
      the site will be pre-screened using an IRB-approved screening form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants who contact the site may be asked to come in for an in-person&#xD;
      screening visit. They will be given a consent form to read and sign if they should choose to&#xD;
      participate in the screening process. If they have any questions during this process research&#xD;
      staff will be available. This visit includes an in-depth medical history review, travel&#xD;
      history, physical exam, blood draw, electrocardiogram test (ECG), and a urine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Seattle Malaria Clinical Trials Center (Seattle MCTC) is conducting research to combat&#xD;
      malaria. Malaria is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected&#xD;
      mosquito and affects millions of people worldwide. Malaria can cause a wide range of medical&#xD;
      problems, and may even result in death if the infection is not treated. Currently there are&#xD;
      many medications, preventative measures and malaria vaccines being developed to fight malaria&#xD;
      that will need to be tested before they can be made available to the general public. The&#xD;
      Seattle MCTC is conducting clinical research studies for this purpose and is in need of&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers to take part in upcoming studies.&#xD;
