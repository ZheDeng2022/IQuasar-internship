  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is assessing quality of life in children with a physical disability who&#xD;
      participate in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP), where children&#xD;
      with physical disabilities are able to participate in more organized sports and active&#xD;
      programs with the use of adaptive equipment. This study would assess a child's self reported&#xD;
      and parent perceived quality of life before and after child participation in HSP for the&#xD;
      winter season. The investigators aim to determine the level of child and parent happiness and&#xD;
      satisfaction in specific quality of life aspects including: physical activities and health,&#xD;
      feelings, moods, self perception, home life, friends, school, learning and bullying. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that children with any physical disability will have a more&#xD;
      satisfactory reported quality of life after participating in HSP for one or many years.&#xD;

      The purpose of this proposed research is to quantify the impact of participation in an&#xD;
      adaptive ski/snowboarding program on parent perceived and child self-reported health related&#xD;
      quality of life. To this effect, the study will assess children's self-perception of&#xD;
      psychological, emotional, physical health of participants as well as their parents perception&#xD;
      of the same, through the use of a validated self reported quality of life questionnaire,&#xD;
      KIDSCREEN-52, before and after participating in an adaptive ski/snowboarding program every&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the level of subject and parent satisfaction and happiness, through a&#xD;
           composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life questionnaire, following participation in&#xD;
           the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital Sports Program (HSP) for one winter season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the long-term impact of repeated participation in an adapted&#xD;
           ski/snowboarding program through a composite of 10 aspects in a quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaire, following participation in the Children's Hospital Colorado Hospital&#xD;
           Sports Program (HSP) for consistent winter seasons.&#xD;

        the investigators will only be recruiting from children already participating in HSP; they&#xD;
        will not be recruiting for children to join HSP.&#xD;
