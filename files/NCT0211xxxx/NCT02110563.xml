  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational&#xD;
      anticancer drug DCR-MYC. DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid&#xD;
      particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC. MYC oncogene activation is important to&#xD;
      the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. In this study the Sponsor&#xD;
      proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this first-in human study, DCR-MYC will be administered by 2 hour intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion, once weekly for 2 weeks followed by a rest week (3 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients&#xD;
      with either solid tumor malignancies, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma that have&#xD;
      not responded to previous treatment. The highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be&#xD;
      administered will be identified. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 expansion cohorts at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or highest safe dose&#xD;
      identified for further study which may be lower):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy Cohort: 6 patients, tumor biopsies to be performed pre-dosing and Cycle 2/Day 11;&#xD;
           same assessments as dose escalation cohorts&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PNET Cohort: Up to 20 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors; same assessments&#xD;
           as dose escalation cohorts, however fewer PD (cytokine) assessments and no PK&#xD;
           assessments&#xD;
