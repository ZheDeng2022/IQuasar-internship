  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of verapamil, a P-glycoprotein (P-gp)&#xD;
      inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of ASP015K. This study will also assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ASP015K administered alone and also and in combination with verapamil.&#xD;

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on day -1 and remain confined until&#xD;
      day 15.&#xD;
