  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Liquid Biopsy System (LBS) is a new catheter (thin tube) designed for sampling blood&#xD;
      directly from coronary arteries. These arteries supply blood to muscles of the heart and can&#xD;
      become blocked by 'plaques' leading to chest pain (angina) and heart attacks. Recent research&#xD;
      has shown that development of ' plaques' inside coronary arteries is controlled by chemicals&#xD;
      (biomarkers) released into the blood from damaged areas of the artery wall. The LBS is&#xD;
      designed to collect blood samples at the exact site of plaque formation. By testing these&#xD;
      blood samples for biomarkers of plaque formation, it is hoped that new diagnostic tests and&#xD;
      treatments for heart disease may be developed. The proposed investigation is use the LBS in&#xD;
      humans to detect these biomarkers. The safety of the LBS has already been demonstrated in&#xD;
      both human and animal studies. The study will enroll 70 patients with coronary artery disease&#xD;
      who are undergoing routine percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is a procedure used&#xD;
      to open up a blocked coronary artery. It uses a catheter on the end of which is a special&#xD;
      balloon that is inflated inside the blocked artery to open up the vessel and restore blood&#xD;
      flow. A small metal spring (stent) is usually inserted to keep the blood vessel open. This&#xD;
      study will test if the LBS device, when used just prior to a PCI procedure, can detect&#xD;
      biomarkers released by diseased coronary arteries. The study will also determine if the&#xD;
      presence of these biomarkers is linked to the long term health of the patient. The study will&#xD;
      take place at Papworth Hospital, over a period of approximately 8 months (including telephone&#xD;
      based patient followup calls 30 days, 6 months, 1, 2 and 3 years after the procedure to&#xD;
      determine patient health).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Clinical Investigation is to use the PlaqueTec Liquid Biopsy System (LBS)&#xD;
      to determine which biomarkers detected locally within the coronary artery can give&#xD;
      information on the state of atherosclerotic disease. The LBS is a novel CE-marked class III&#xD;
      coronary catheter designed for sampling blood directly from the coronary arteries. The LBS is&#xD;
      unique in that it can capture &quot;gradients&quot; of biological molecules within the coronary artery&#xD;
      and by analysing the samples it collects it can unequivocally identify which biomarkers have&#xD;
      been locally released within the coronary artery. The samples can then be analysed for a&#xD;
      variety of biomarkers using standard analytical techniques. Cardiologists should find this of&#xD;
      great benefit as recent studies have shown that coronary artery disease is controlled and&#xD;
      directed by the release of specific biological molecules into the blood from diseased areas&#xD;
      of the coronary arteries. The safety and performance of the LBS has been proved previously in&#xD;
      a recent First In Man study. The Clinical Investigation study will enroll 70 patients and&#xD;
      will be observational in nature. The study is designed to use the device in its intended&#xD;
      application (i.e. as an adjunct to a PCI procedure, such as the deployment of a stent) and to&#xD;
      collect biomarker gradients released locally within the coronary artery. It will then follow&#xD;
      up on the health status of the patients and see if the release of certain biomarkers is&#xD;
      associated with particular clinical outcomes. The device will be used to look for locally&#xD;
      released biomarkers at two different stages of the deployment of a stent, i.e. before and&#xD;
      after its deployment. The first stage is prior to the deployment of the stent and the LBS&#xD;
      will collect blood samples to look for the release of &quot;natural&quot; biomarkers gradients, i.e.&#xD;
      those biomarkers that are naturally released during the progression and development of&#xD;
      diseased regions within the artery. The second stage is to use the LBS to collect blood&#xD;
      samples across a diseased artery that has just be perturbed (by &quot;pre-ballooning&quot;, a procedure&#xD;
      carried out just prior to stent insertion) and will looked for &quot;induced&quot; biomarker gradients,&#xD;
      i.e. those molecules that are released by a diseased plaque when it ruptures. The insights&#xD;
      gained by collecting biomarker gradients at these two stages will give very important&#xD;
      information on what causes a region of artery to become diseased and how diseased portions of&#xD;
      the artery affect the blood and cause heart attacks. The samples that are collected by the&#xD;
      LBS in the above clinical settings will be analysed for a series of biomarker gradients&#xD;
      previously selected by PlaqueTec' s Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) for their potential role&#xD;
      in causing atherosclerosis. The data collected by the LBS will be for research only and will&#xD;
      not be used to affect the patient treatment. In summary, the LBS study will deliver&#xD;
      completely new insights into coronary artery disease and will significantly increase the&#xD;
      understanding of this hugely significant disease. Patients who need an elective percutaneous&#xD;
      transluminal interventional coronary procedure will be considered for this study. Patients&#xD;
      requiring emergency interventional procedures will be excluded. The study duration is&#xD;
      estimated to be about 8 months with a three year follow up period.&#xD;
