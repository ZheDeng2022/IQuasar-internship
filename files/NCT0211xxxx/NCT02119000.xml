  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bowel preparation is a crucial step prior to colonoscopy to help with the optimal assessment&#xD;
      of the colonic mucosa. Inadequate bowel preparation increases the length of the procedure,&#xD;
      and is associated with decreased lesional detection rates. The ideal bowel preparation&#xD;
      formulation should be able to completely clean the bowel, without leaving solid or liquid&#xD;
      residues, and without modifying the mucosal appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bowel preparation may be administered in hospitalised patients or in the ER. Patients have&#xD;
      less control on their environment and the intake of the bowel preparation. For example, there&#xD;
      may be a delay in pharmacy delivery or inadequate supervision by the treating personnel.&#xD;
      Hospitalised patients have more comorbidities, are usually less autonomous and mobile - both&#xD;
      can add to the barriers leading to an adequate bowel preparation. Multiple studies have&#xD;
      identified hospitalization status as an independent risk factor for poor bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to access which bowel preparation regimen, between PEG 3350&#xD;
      with electrolytes 2L the day before and 2L the day of the colonoscopy vs bisacodyl + PEG 3350&#xD;
      with electrolytes 1L the day before and 1L the day of the colonoscopy, results in the&#xD;
      cleanest bowel preparation in hospitalised patients.&#xD;
