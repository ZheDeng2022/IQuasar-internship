    <measure>Rates of Adverse Events Among Patients</measure>
    <time_frame>From study baseline to completion, approximately 1 year. However, adverse events not resolved by then will be followed up with until they are resolved.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were collected and reported to test the safety and efficacy of the device.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician and subject satisfaction will be ranked on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is extremely dissatisfied and 6 is extremely satisfied.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Photographic Evaluation using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post last treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Photos will be a taken at baseline and post treatment and then improvement assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale. This scale ranges from 0 to 3, where 0 is 0-25% clearance from baseline photograph, 1 is 25-50% clearance from baseline photograph, 2 is 50-75% clearance from baseline photograph, and 3 is 75-100% clearance from baseline photograph.</description>
