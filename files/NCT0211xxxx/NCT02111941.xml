      This pilot clinical trial studies the safety and immunogenicity of vaccine therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with stage IIIC-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity cancer following surgery and chemotherapy. Vaccines made from a person's&#xD;
      peptide treated white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of folate receptor alpha dendritic cell (FRalphaDC)&#xD;
      vaccination (folate receptor alpha-peptide loaded dendritic cell vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Measure time to disease recurrence of patients treated with FRalphaDCs. II. Measure&#xD;
      overall survival of patients treated with FRalphaDCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of&#xD;
      FRalpha-specific interleukin (IL)-17-secreting T helper (Th) cells, as determined by&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces an increase in the number of&#xD;
      FRalpha-specific T cells that secrete interferon (IFN)gamma, tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      (TNF)alpha, IL-10, and granzyme B, as determined by ELISpot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces antibodies specific for FRalpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination induces a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)&#xD;
      skin reaction specific for FRalpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Measure FRalpha expression in patients' primary tumors and in tumors that recur after&#xD;
      FRalphaDC vaccine treatment (when available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine whether FRalphaDC vaccination is associated with changes in peripheral blood&#xD;
      immune cell subsets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell vaccine&#xD;
      intradermally (ID) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive folate receptor alpha peptide-loaded dendritic cell&#xD;
      vaccine ID on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 months for 7 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
