  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to record electrical brain activity during DBS surgery and after&#xD;
      DBS surgery using the Medtronic Activa PC+S deep brain stimulation (DBS) system, a modified&#xD;
      DBS pulse generator. The goal of the study is to investigate if the electrical brain activity&#xD;
      can help customize DBS therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Activa PC+S system will be implanted and programmed under the same clinical procedures&#xD;
      and standard of care as the Activa PC system. After implantation and standard clinical&#xD;
      programming, participants in our research study will be asked to return for additional&#xD;
      research visits where the recording sub-circuit of the device will be activated and local&#xD;
      field potentials (LFP) will be recorded in the device and transmitted through telemetry to a&#xD;
      base station for storage and future analysis. The sensing, or recording, sub-circuit will be&#xD;
      disabled, non-invasively, at the end of each research visit to minimize impact to battery&#xD;
      life of the device.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants must be undergoing DBS lead placement for Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
             that requires them to be awake during microelectrode recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants have been treated with levodopa/carbidopa, and with a dopamine&#xD;
             agonist, at the maximal tolerated doses as determined by a movement disorders&#xD;
             neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants must have a Hoehn and Yahr stage &gt;= 2 in the medications OFF&#xD;
             state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants must have documented improvement in motor signs on versus off&#xD;
             dopaminergic medication, with a change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale&#xD;
             motor (UPDRS III) score of &gt;= 30% off to on medication. Patients with tremor&#xD;
             predominant form of PD, quantified as a UPDRS tremor score in any one limb greater&#xD;
             than or equal to 3 and UPDRS sum of axial score (speech, posture, gait, balance) less&#xD;
             than or equal to 5, who do not reach the 30% threshold, may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants must have evidence of complications of medication, e.g.,&#xD;
             wearing off signs, fluctuating responses and/or dyskinesias, and/or medication&#xD;
             refractory tremor, and/or impairment in the quality of life on or off medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants must have the ability to understand instructions in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential participants are males or females between the ages of 21 and 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
