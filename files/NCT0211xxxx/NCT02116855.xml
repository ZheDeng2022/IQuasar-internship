    <textblock>
      A multi centre two year long term escalating dose tertiary prophylaxis study on the efficacy&#xD;
      and cost saving of individualized low dose prophylaxis regimens for boys with severe&#xD;
      hemophilia A in China staring with a low dose regimen in step I, an escalated low dose&#xD;
      regimen in step II and a tailored dose regimen based on individual PK profiles in step III.&#xD;
      The dose escalation criteria are adjusted according to patterns and frequencies of joint&#xD;
      bleeding and assessed in each subject every 3 months. Efficacy of the 3 different dose&#xD;
      regimens are measured by the Annualized Joint Bleeding rate (AJBR) as a primary end point and&#xD;
      the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS ) and QoL scores (CHO-KLAT and PedsQoL) , image&#xD;
      studies of target joints by Ultrasound, X-ray and MRI examinations, consumption of factor&#xD;
      VIII and inhibitor rates as secondary end points.&#xD;

    <description>A multi centre 2 year long term tertiary prophylaxis study designed with a three step escalating dose protocol adjusted by individual joint bleeding patterns/frequencies to study the effect and cost saving of 3 low dose /cost prophylaxis regimens in boys with severe hemophilia A and arthropathy in China. Each patient will start treatment with a low dose regimen in step I and be assessed every 3 months according to the escalating criteria.</description>
