  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled, two-arm study. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of Momchilovtsi yogurt on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improving intestinal digestion and bowl movement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adjusting blood total Cholesterol and Triglycerides levels;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adjusting microbiological flora (Clostridium perfringens bacteria, Lactobacillus and&#xD;
           Bifidobacterium) in gastrointestinal tract;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adjusting short chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) in in&#xD;
           gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;

      1. Quality control of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1 Study monitoring and source data verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Monitoring was done according to the monitoring plan by a representative of the&#xD;
           investigator, who checked the case report forms for completeness and clarity, and&#xD;
           cross-checked them with source documents. In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent&#xD;
           communications (letter, telephone, fax, e-mail), by the study monitor ensured that the&#xD;
           investigation was conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements.&#xD;
           Study close-out was performed by the study monitor upon closure of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 On-site audits:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the Institutional Review Board, and an&#xD;
           auditor authorized by the sponsor may request access to all source documents, case&#xD;
           report forms, and other study documentation for on-site audit or inspection. Direct&#xD;
           access to these documents was guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support&#xD;
           at all times for these activities. Medical records and other study documents may be&#xD;
           copied during audit or inspection provided that subject names are obliterated on the&#xD;
           copies to ensure confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Documentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A case report form was provided for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All protocol-required information collected during the study was entered by the&#xD;
           investigator, or designated representative, in the case report form. Details of case&#xD;
           report form completion and correction were explained to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the case report form&#xD;
           pages as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day&#xD;
           that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study&#xD;
           procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final&#xD;
           examination. An explanation should be given for all missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A source data location list was prepared prior to study initiation. This list was filed&#xD;
           in both the trial master file and the investigator study file and updated as necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The completed case report forms were reviewed and signed by the investigator named in&#xD;
           the clinical study protocol or by a designated sub investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The sponsor would retain the original of all completed case report forms. The principal&#xD;
           investigator kept the copies of all completed case report forms for 25 years after the&#xD;
           trial based on Good Clinical Practice requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Quality assurance of study products:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All products used in this study were manufactured and provided by Bright Dairy &amp; Food&#xD;
           Co., Ltd. The quality test of study products was conducted by Shanghai dairy products&#xD;
           quality supervision and inspection station. The study products were stored at the study&#xD;
           site and assigned to the subjects by the investigator. The amount of products received&#xD;
           and assigned were filed on product distribution list by the investigator. The study&#xD;
           products were not allowed to be given to anyone who didn't participated in the study. No&#xD;
           sales of unassigned products was allowed. After the completion of the study, the&#xD;
           unassigned products need to be returned to Bright Dairy &amp; Food Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The products were labeled with study code. A master participation list was completed&#xD;
           which identifies each patient full name and unique identification number. The identity&#xD;
           of the specific product was blind to patients, support staff and investigators. The&#xD;
           unmasking occurred to the investigators and statistical analyses team only after&#xD;
           completion of statistical analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study data were recorded on Case Report Forms (CRFs) and then entered into saved in the&#xD;
           form of Excel files. Data was double entered and cross-validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Management of subject withdrawal:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A number of 120 subjects were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If, in the investigator's opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental&#xD;
                to the patient's well-being,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If they are lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all cases, the reason for and date of withdrawal must be recorded in the Exit Form&#xD;
           and in the subject's medical records and the sponsor's representative must be notified&#xD;
           within 5 days. The subject must be followed up to establish whether the reason was an&#xD;
           adverse event, and, if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedure of an&#xD;
           adverse event (described bellow). The investigator must make every effort to contact&#xD;
           subject lost to follow-up. Attempts to contact such subject must be documented in the&#xD;
           subject's records (e.g., dates and times of attempted telephone contact).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigator must be notified of all serious or unexpected adverse events within 48&#xD;
           hours. Notification does not depend on whether there is a connection to the study&#xD;
           formula or not. All adverse events must be documented on the appropriate pages of the&#xD;
           case report forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistical analysis plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis was performed for the intent-to-treat population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square test was used comparison between study groups for categorical data. For continuous&#xD;
      outcomes, t-test was used for between-group comparison, paired t-test was used for pre-post&#xD;
      comparison within each study group.3. Non-parametric methods were used for non-normal data,&#xD;
      data with unequal variances. The analysis was completed using the statistical package&#xD;
      SPSS17.0.&#xD;
