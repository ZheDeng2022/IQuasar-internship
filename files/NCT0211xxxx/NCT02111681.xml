  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the use of Calypso beacon implants as a way to determine&#xD;
      where the lung tumor is located during radiation treatment. The Calypso beacons are small&#xD;
      devices that are implanted in the lungs, near the tumor. They are able to send a signal to a&#xD;
      tracking system to show where they are, and where the tumor is, as the patient holds their&#xD;
      breath for the radiation treatment. The investigators want to find out what effects, good&#xD;
      and/or bad, that this has on the patient and the way they treat the cancer in your lungs.&#xD;

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologic proof of malignancy suitable for thoracic radiation&#xD;
             therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients planning to undergo radiation therapy for primary or recurrent malignancy of&#xD;
             the lung or metastatic malignancy to the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS ≥ 60%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to hold their breath for &gt;20 seconds for 5 times&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to tolerate flexible bronchoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with life expectancy of at least 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients able to have bronchoscopic placement of Calypso as confirmed on a recent&#xD;
             (within the past 8 weeks) CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are able to comply with the protocol follow-up schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to comply with instructions for DIBH&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with implants in the chest region that contain metal or conductive materials&#xD;
             (e.g., metal implants, rods, or plates) which Calypso Medical considers will interfere&#xD;
             with the Calypso System's electromagnetic localization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active implanted devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and drug&#xD;
             infusion pumps since the effects of the Calypso System operation on these devices are&#xD;
             unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically significant active infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bronchiectasis in the region of the intended implantation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to nickel.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose lung tumors are being monitored with MR imaging (MR imaging of the&#xD;
             anchored transponders is safe but yields an image artifact around the anchored&#xD;
             transponders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Posterior lesions that would be &gt;19cm distance from Calypso detector plate. Patients&#xD;
             may be treated in the prone position in order to meet the required minimum distance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other medical condition or laboratory value that would, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator, preclude the patient from participation in this&#xD;
             clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are deemed unable to safely undergo or tolerate flexible bronchoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate anesthesia or sedation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients enrolled in any other clinical studies the investigator believes to be in&#xD;
             conflict with this investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or nursing&#xD;
