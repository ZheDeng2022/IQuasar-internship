        <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>

        <description>The ORR is defined as best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based on RECIST v1.1. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new non-target lesion. A confirmed CR or PR is defined as 2 CRs or 2 PRs that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>

        <description>The BOR includes CR, PR, stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), and non-evaluable (NE) based on RECIST v1.1. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. The PD is defined at least 20% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and/or new lesion. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. The NE is defined as either when no or only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment.</description>

        <title>Disease Control Rate (DCR) Based on Investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1 in Dose-expansion Phase</title>
        <description>The DCR is defined as a BOR of confirmed CR, confirmed PR, or SD based on RECIST v1.1. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. The DCR at &gt;= 8 weeks and &gt;=24 weeks are reported.</description>

        <title>BOR Based on Investigator-assessed Modified RECIST v1.1 in Dose-escalation Phase</title>
        <description>The BOR includes CR, PR, SD, PD, and NE per Modified RECIST v1.1. The CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. The PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no new nontarget lesion. The PD is defined at least 20% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and/or new lesion. The SD is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for disease progression. The NE is defined as either when no or only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment.</description>

        <description>The TTR is defined as the time from the first dose of treatment until the first documentation of a subsequently confirmed OR (confirmed CR or confirmed PR) based on modified RECIST v1.1. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no new non-target lesion) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The TTR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The TEAEs are defined as events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal Vital Signs and Physical Examinations Reported as TEAEs in Dose-expansion Phase</title>
        <description>Number of participants in dose-expansion phase with abnormal vital signs reported as TEAEs are reported. Abnormal vital signs is defined as any abnormal finding in the vital sign parameters (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate). Abnormal physical examination findings are defined as any abnormal finding in the following body systems: head and neck, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urogenital, musculoskeletal, neurological, psychiatric, dermatological, hematologic/lymphatic, and endocrine systems, and weight.</description>

Participants with PD-L1 positive (&gt; 1% tumor cell membrane or &gt; 1% immune cell staining) and PD-L1 negative (&lt;= 1% tumor cell membrane and &lt;= 1% immune cell staining) were evaluated for this outcome measure.</population>
