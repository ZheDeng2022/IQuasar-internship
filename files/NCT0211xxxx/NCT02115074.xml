  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optico-chiasmatic gliomas have therapeutic feature since surgical resection plays a secondary&#xD;
      role. Unlike other sites, many of these tumors are not amenable to complete resection either&#xD;
      because of anatomical location, and sometimes they only can be biopsied. A substantial number&#xD;
      of children will have recurrences following resection or will experience progression&#xD;
      following incomplete tumor removal or biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Celebrex is a Cox-2 inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties, while statins&#xD;
      are known to increase the sensitivity of gliomas to anti-tumor agents. Their association&#xD;
      could be administered for long periods, in the hope of much reduced risk of toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a national, multicentric, interventional, open-label, non-comparative, and&#xD;
      non-randomized phase I study evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of the Fluvastatin in&#xD;
      combination with fixed-dose of Celebrex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project involves 10 SFCE health centers accustomed to phase I / II studies(Société&#xD;
      Française de Lutte contre les Cancers et Leucémies de l'Enfant et de l'Adolescent - French&#xD;
      Society for the Fight against Cancer and Leukemia in Children and Adolescents).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation scheme only concerns Fluvastatin, and is based on a CRML model (Continual&#xD;
      Reassessment Method Lilelihood approach). Dose associated with a probability of DLT closest&#xD;
      to 25% will be considered as Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escalation phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included by cohort of 2. First patient will be included at the first dose&#xD;
      level of Fluvastatin (2mg/kg/day). The second patient will be included only after sufficient&#xD;
      time to assess the absence of DLT on first patient. In absence of DLT during the first 28-day&#xD;
      cycle, dose escalation will be allowed (4, then 6 and 8 mg/kg/day of Fluvastatin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and all subsequent patients will be treated at the dose level which DLT&#xD;
      probability is closest to 25%, without skipping step. Intra-patient dose escalation is not&#xD;
      allowed. Treatment will be administered until progression, or unacceptable toxicity for one&#xD;
      year. A minimum of 21 patients will be included during the 1st step, including a minimum of 6&#xD;
      patients receiving RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion phase :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At RP2D, the number of subjects will be increased to reach a total of 14 evaluable patients,&#xD;
      in order to better characterize RP2D safety. Patients will be included in the expansion phase&#xD;
      according CRML model as well, to confirm the recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probabilities of DLT associated with each dose level will be re-estimated by CRML&#xD;
      progressively, without the need to suspend inclusions. Results could modify RP2D retained&#xD;
      during 1st step (dose reduction or a dose re-escalation).&#xD;

grade 3 or 4 neutropenia leading to a delay of therapy superior to 7 days&#xD;
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia requiring transfusions over a period superior to 7 days&#xD;
grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities, excepted the following events:&#xD;
nausea and vomiting despite appropriate symptomatic treatment,&#xD;
grade 3 fever, and grade 3 liver toxicity but rapidly reversible,&#xD;
grade 3 elevation of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels, but rapidly reversible (back &lt;3 X normal within 2 weeks after interruption of treatment)&#xD;
Toxicity leading to dose reduction (&lt;75% dose protocol) will also be considered as a DLT, although the grade of toxicity does not in itself justify this classification</description>
