      The goal of this clinical research study is to test the use of a minimally invasive&#xD;
      multimodality image-guided (MIMIG) intervention system used for performing a lung biopsy. The&#xD;
      safety of the MIMIG intervention system will also be studied.&#xD;

      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to take part in this study, the following information about their&#xD;
      routine standard of care lung biopsy will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the procedure How long it takes to complete the procedure How long the needle&#xD;
      is inserted to collect the biopsy sample The number of CT scans used during the procedure The&#xD;
      radiation dose level used Any complications and/or side effects the patient may experience&#xD;
      The results of the diagnosis from the biopsy sample Researchers will take appropriate steps&#xD;
      to keep the patient's information private. However, there is no guarantee of absolute&#xD;
      privacy. The patient's information will be kept in a password-protected computer at MD&#xD;
      Anderson for up to 7 years and will only be permitted to be viewed by the study doctor and&#xD;
      members of the research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the patient's routine lung biopsy, the doctor will use the MIMIG intervention system&#xD;
      to help guide the needle for the biopsy the lung biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's active participation on this study will be over after the lung biopsy procedure&#xD;
      is over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first CT scan will be used as a map to guide a needle into the tumor with the MIMIG&#xD;
      intervention system. After that, a second CT scan will be done to confirm that the needle tip&#xD;
      has been properly inserted inside the lung tumor. Based on the results from these images, the&#xD;
      tumor will then be biopsied the same way it would be as part of normal routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of the MIMIG intervention system to help guide the&#xD;
      needle for the lung biopsy is not FDA approved or commercially available. The use of the&#xD;
      MIMIG intervention system is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient agrees to take part in this study, the following information about the&#xD;
      patient's routine standard of care lung biopsy will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accuracy of the procedure How long it takes to complete the procedure How long the needle&#xD;
      is inserted to collect the biopsy sample The number of CT scans used during the procedure The&#xD;
      radiation dose level used Any complications and/or side effects the patient may experience&#xD;
      The results of the diagnosis from the biopsy sample Researchers will take appropriate steps&#xD;
      to keep the patient's information private. However, there is no guarantee of absolute&#xD;
      privacy. The patient's information will be kept in a password-protected computer at MD&#xD;
      Anderson and will only be permitted to be viewed by the study doctor and members of the&#xD;
      research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the patient's routine lung biopsy, the doctor will use the MIMIG intervention system&#xD;
      to help guide the needle for the biopsy the lung biopsy. The patient will also have an&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) needle placed in the patient's vein to give the patient indocyanine green&#xD;
      (IC-Green). IC-Green is a dye that allows researchers to see the patient's veins and other&#xD;
      organs during the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the lung biopsy is complete, the patient's active participation on this study will be&#xD;
      over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first CT scan will be used as a map to guide a needle into the tumor with the MIMIG&#xD;
      intervention system. After that, a second CT scan will be done to confirm that the needle tip&#xD;
      has been properly inserted inside the lung tumor. A fiberoptic endoscope (a small camera with&#xD;
      a light) will be inserted through the CT guided needle to the tumor to help doctors see the&#xD;
      tumor blood vessels. IC-Green will also be given by IV to allow doctors to see the blood&#xD;
      vessels of the tumor. Based on the results from these images, the tumor will then be biopsied&#xD;
      the same way it would be as part of normal routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The use of the MIMIG intervention system to help guide the&#xD;
      needle for the lung biopsy is not FDA approved or commercially available. The use of the&#xD;
      MIMIG intervention system is investigational. The use of fiberoptic endoscope for lung tumor&#xD;
      vessels imaging is not FDA approved or commercially available. The use of fiberoptic&#xD;
      endoscope is investigational. The use of IC-Green in combination with fiberoptic endoscope&#xD;
      for lung tumor vessels imaging is not FDA approved or commercially available. The use of&#xD;
      IC-Green in combination with fiberoptic endoscope is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 24 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
