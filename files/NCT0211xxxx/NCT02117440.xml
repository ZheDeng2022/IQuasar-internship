  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to apply various scans such as functional imaging,&#xD;
      Fluorodeoxyglucose_Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET), 62Cu-ETS (Copper) PET,&#xD;
      Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (V/Q SPECT), cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT/CT, and pulmonary function tests before,&#xD;
      during and after treatment to see if it predicts how well the treatment works for your cancer&#xD;
      and how well your lungs function during treatment. A Computerized Tomography (CT) will also&#xD;
      be performed along with both of these procedures to help the researchers see clearly where&#xD;
      your cancer or your healthy lung is located. The researchers also perform blood tests in this&#xD;
      study to look for markers in your blood to see if it helps them determine your risk of&#xD;
      developing side effects from radiation to the lungs. They will also measure your&#xD;
      health-related quality of life before, during and after treatment. The researchers hope that&#xD;
      this study will help them in the future to design radiation treatment plans that provide the&#xD;
      best treatment for each individual patient.&#xD;

      Primary aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if tumor metabolic activity plus volume measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT and&#xD;
           tissue/tumor perfusion measured by 62Cu-ETS-PET before and during treatment predicts CT&#xD;
           tumor response 3 months after completion of treatment and 1 and 2 year local-regional&#xD;
           progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if functional imaging based lung dose-volume histograms (DVH) more&#xD;
           accurately predict changes in diffusion capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)&#xD;
           compared to the DVH based on simulating CT. Degree of lung toxicity will also be&#xD;
           documented by functional scans such as Tc-99m HMPAO imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine if baseline level, or changes in blood markers such as TGFÃŸ1 measured&#xD;
           during the course of radiation, predict changes in DLCO.&#xD;

    <description>Investigate predictive models for long-term tumor control and late treatment lung toxicity by using FDG-PET-CT, V/Q SPECT-CT and blood test during the course of radiation therapy. As secondary analysis, demographic and baseline clinical variables will be added to the model to determine if they add predictive value.</description>

        Potentially eligible patients include all patients with stage I to IV lung cancer. Patient&#xD;
        cannot have started systemic treatments or radiation treatments prior to enrollment on the&#xD;
        study. Informed consent will be obtained in writing prior to initiating the study using a&#xD;
        consent form approved by the local IRB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed lung cancer, or clinically diagnosed lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC stage I to IV lung cancer requiring radiation therapy (3D conformal or&#xD;
             stereotactic) or systemic therapy, with or without surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients participating treatment trials including targeted therapy, experimental&#xD;
