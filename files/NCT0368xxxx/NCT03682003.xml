      Many biomarkers have been evaluated in sepsis, especially for prognostic purposes, but none&#xD;
      has yet been shown to have sufficient sensitivity or specificity for routine use in clinical&#xD;
      practice. However, highlighting a biomarker facilitating the evaluation of the severity of&#xD;
      sepsis remains relevant in a pathology where survival is largely conditioned by the&#xD;
      initiation of an early and adapted treatment. Recent evidence suggests that hepcidin, which&#xD;
      is the key hormone for systemic regulation of iron metabolism, may be an interesting&#xD;
      prognostic biomarker. The synthesis of this peptide is regulated by the iron stocks of the&#xD;
      body, erythropoiesis, but also inflammation. The mechanisms inducing the expression of&#xD;
      hepcidin during inflammation are multiple: interleukin-6 (IL-6) in particular,&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokine is a strong inducer of hepcidin. In addition, its expression is&#xD;
      increased by the effect of lipopolysaccharide via Toll-like receptors . In septic patients,&#xD;
      elevated levels of hepcidin or pro-hepcidin have been reported . A new role for hepcidin in&#xD;
      the control of inflammatory and / or immune response has recently been reported. Thus, in a&#xD;
      model of murine septic shock, the deleterious character of a lack of expression of hepcidin&#xD;
      could be demonstrated . In humans, hepcidinemia has been shown to be a predictive factor in&#xD;
      the development of immunotolerance in hepatic transplant patients. Hepcidin therefore plays a&#xD;
      major role in the regulation of the inflammatory and / or immune response and in particular&#xD;
      during sepsis. The investigators therefore hypothesize that hepcidin could be the marker of&#xD;
      an adverse prognosis in septic patients expressing this&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is to evaluate the prognostic value of plasma hepcidin assayed on admission&#xD;
      to intensive care on mortality at D28 in severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity of plasma hepcidin assayed at admission to intensive care on mortality at D28 in&#xD;
      patients with severe sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first step, a search for the hepcidin threshold value with the best sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity to predict death on D28 will be performed using a receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics (ROC) curve. This threshold value will be used to evaluate the primary&#xD;
      endpoint and also determine specificity and positive and negative predictive values.&#xD;
