  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery often have a lot of pain after surgery,&#xD;
      which can lead to a need for a lot of narcotic pain medication. These medications can have&#xD;
      many side effects that can make recovery more difficult including nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      dizziness, being overly sleepy, itchiness, inability to urinate, confusion, inability to have&#xD;
      a bowel movement, longer time before being able to start walking. These side effects can make&#xD;
      the hospital stay longer. The use of gabapentin, which is a non narcotic pain medication that&#xD;
      focuses on nerve pain, has been used in smaller head and neck surgeries including removal of&#xD;
      tonsils, sinus surgery, thyroid surgery. Studies in patients needing orthopedic or OB/Gyn&#xD;
      surgery have shown improved pain control with gabapentin. Potential benefits to future&#xD;
      patients include improved pain control, less narcotic associated side effects and faster&#xD;
      functional recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing head and neck cancer surgery frequently experience significant post&#xD;
      surgical pain, which often necessitates the use of narcotic pain medication. However, opioids&#xD;
      can have multiple side effects that can complicate the head and neck cancer surgery patients&#xD;
      postoperative care including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sedation, pruritis, urinary&#xD;
      retention, delirium, constipation, and time to ambulation. This, in turn, may affect patient&#xD;
      length and cost of hospital stay. Consequently, a multimodal approach to analgesia is often&#xD;
      employed with a focus on use of scheduled acetaminophen +/- NSAIDs supplemented with&#xD;
      narcotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of gabapentin in the head and neck surgery literature has largely been limited to&#xD;
      outpatient surgeries, including tonsillectomy in children and adults, functional endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery, and thyroidectomy. Indeed, a recent systematic review examined RCT comparing&#xD;
      multimodal analgesia with gabapentin to analgesia without gabapentin in the otolaryngology&#xD;
      literature. The majority of these studies employed preoperative dosing only, with only 1&#xD;
      study providing a single postoperative dose as well. The control group pain regimen among&#xD;
      these studies did vary and included a combination of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, dexmedetomidine,&#xD;
      or clonidine supplemented with opioids. The studies focused on the impact of gabapentin on&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain determined by subjective measurement of reduction in visual analog&#xD;
      pain scale. Of note, these patients were not hospitalized for longer than 24 hours. The&#xD;
      thyroid and sinus studies consistently demonstrated improved pain control with use of&#xD;
      gabapentin compared to control. The data was slightly more variable across the tonsillectomy&#xD;
      studies. Moreover, 7 studies also measured the need for breakthrough pain medication and&#xD;
      supplemental analgesia; each of these studies demonstrated significantly less supplemental&#xD;
      analgesia consumption in the gabapentin group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only study examining the utility of gabapentin in pain management in head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients (glossectomy with anterolateral thigh free flap) examined the utility of a single&#xD;
      preoperative dose. The authors concluded that this led to a significant reduction in&#xD;
      subjective postoperative pain scores, morphine requirement, and nausea and vomiting compared&#xD;
      to controls. This study did not employ postoperative gabapentin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a recent meta analysis (133 RCT) examining literature across multiple surgical&#xD;
      specialties pertaining to the efficacy of perioperative gabapentin supplementation vs&#xD;
      placebo. The meta analysis indicated both the efficacy of gabapentin supplementation in&#xD;
      decreasing opioid requirement (measured via morphine equivalent units) in the experimental&#xD;
      group during the first 24 hours (P&lt;0.001), as well as a good safety profile across a wide&#xD;
      range of loading and maintenance doses (200 to 1200 mg) of gabapentin. The significant&#xD;
      reduction in opioid requirement was independent of surgery type. Moreover, the gabapentin&#xD;
      group demonstrated a significant decrease in VAS postoperative pain scores, nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      and itching; however, sedation scores were increased. Only 8 of these 133 RCT examined the&#xD;
      effect of gabapentin outside the immediate 24 hour period, and all 8 trials demonstrated&#xD;
      improvement in chronic pain scores at 3 months post-operatively. Finally, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction scores and preoperative anxiety were also significantly improved with the use of&#xD;
      gabapentin compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators propose, for the first time, a superiority double blind randomized&#xD;
      controlled placebo trial examining the effect of perioperative supplementation with&#xD;
      gabapentin in head and neck cancer patients undergoing surgery. The primary purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the difference in morphine equivalent units between the experimental&#xD;
      (i.e. perioperative gabapentin) and control group (i.e. no perioperative gabapentin). The&#xD;
      secondary purpose of this study is to determine differences across the two groups in relation&#xD;
      to the following: visual analog pain scores, cost and length of stay, medication side&#xD;
      effects, and incidence of postoperative complications. Of note, in order to maximize&#xD;
      reliability of the visual analog scale (VAS), prior studies have employed the Jadad scoring&#xD;
      system, which the investigators will also implement in the study.&#xD;
