  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods to assess&#xD;
      brain changes following spaced theta burst stimulation (TBS), a new form of repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), in 10 healthy participants. The investigators will&#xD;
      measure the effects of both excitatory (intermittent, iTBS) and inhibitory (continuous, cTBS)&#xD;
      TBS applied to the motor cortex, a system that when stimulated produces a readily observable&#xD;
      behavioral response (e.g., movement of a given body regions). In addition to brain activity,&#xD;
      we will assess the effects of TBS on motor responses and pain perception. The goal is to&#xD;
      determine how brain activity and blood flow during tasks and at rest change following the&#xD;
      applications of spaced cTBS and iTBS. Additionally, the aim is to determine the duration of&#xD;
      the spaced TBS effects on brain activity and behavior. This study will provide an&#xD;
      understanding of the functional brain and behavioral changes that occur following spaced TBS&#xD;
      to the motor cortex and has implications for reducing the long treatment schedules associated&#xD;
      with classical rTMS protocols.&#xD;

      Overall study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a functional MRI study of 10 healthy participants recruited from&#xD;
      the community using a cross-over design over two days. On day 1, half of the participants&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive iTBS and half will receive cTBS. On scan day 2 the alternate&#xD;
      form of TBS will be applied such that all participants will have completed iTBS and cTBS&#xD;
      sessions at the end of the two study days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scan days 1 and 2 will be identical except that iTBS will be applied on one day and cTBS&#xD;
      on the other. The duration of the MRI scan session will be approximately 120 minutes each&#xD;
      day. The iTBS and cTBS scans sessions will be separated by at least 3 days to ensure that the&#xD;
      effects of scan day 1 are not carried over to scan day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each scan day will consist of the following sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-scan session&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Baseline scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TBS (individually targeted to M1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-TBS scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 healthy individuals from the community will be recruited. Potential participants will be&#xD;
      screened using the MRI Safety Screening Questionnaire, the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation&#xD;
      Adult Safety Screen (TASS), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) to exclude&#xD;
      individuals with contraindications to MRI, TMS, or with cognitive impairments, respectively.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to refrain from taking any analgesic medication for 24 hours prior&#xD;
      to scan days. At the start of each scan day, participants will first undergo a Pre-scan&#xD;
      session outside of the scanner. In this session, baseline resting motor thresholds and pain&#xD;
      thresholds to laser stimuli will be obtained. Participants will also have the opportunity to&#xD;
      practice the motor and pain tasks that they will perform in the MRI sessions during this&#xD;
      time. For the motor task participants will be asked to tap their finger when a verbal and/or&#xD;
      auditory cue is provided. For the pain task, participants will passively experience and rate&#xD;
      laser stimuli applied to different regions of the dorsum of their fingers/hands using a 0-10&#xD;
      numerical rating scale (NRS). Ratings will be made for both pain intensity and pain&#xD;
      unpleasantness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On both scan days (iTBS and cTBS) baseline MRI scans will be acquired. These scans will&#xD;
      include the following: a high-resolution anatomical scan, a resting-state scan, a motor task&#xD;
      scan, a pain task scan, cerebral blood flow imaging, and an interleaved TMS-fMRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be removed from the scanner and receive a spaced TBS session (either&#xD;
      iTBS or cTBS depending on the day) whereby 2 TBS protocols are applied with a 15 minute break&#xD;
      in between. TBS will be applied at The stimulation will be delivered at 90% of the resting&#xD;
      motor threshold. The brain region that will be targeted is the M1 region with the highest&#xD;
      activity from the fMRI motor task that occurred in the baseline scan. In this way, each&#xD;
      participant will receive TBS that is individually targeted based on their brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following TBS, participants will then receive their post-TBS MRI scans as described in the&#xD;
      baseline scan session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Specifics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS administration: Using single pulse TMS the scalp position of lowest motor threshold for&#xD;
      the right first dorsal interosseous or abductor pollicis brevis muscles will be determined.&#xD;
      Resting motor threshold (rMT) will be defined by the lowest power setting producing a visible&#xD;
      muscle contraction in 50% trials utilizing PEST software. The investigators will then perform&#xD;
      40 seconds of cTBS or iTBS (depending on the session), which will be followed by 15 minutes&#xD;
      of spacing, and then an additional 40 seconds of cTBS or iTBS as has been previously&#xD;
      described. The individualized TBS target location for the left M1 will be determined by using&#xD;
      each participants' functional motor task MRI scan and Localite Neuronavigation. The baseline&#xD;
      structural scan obtained during scan 1 will also be utilized for this localization process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain induction assessment procedures: On the scanning days, baseline warmth sensation&#xD;
      threshold, heat-pain threshold (HPTpre) and suprathreshold stimulus intensities and maximum&#xD;
      heat tolerance temperature (HTTpre) will be determined for each volunteer using an MRI-safe&#xD;
      infrared diode laser stimulator. A 1.5 s, heating ramp up to 20 °C/s will be applied to 10-20&#xD;
      spots (40 mm2) on the hairy skin of the hand and fingers (but not the thumb) of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain threshold will be determined using a random staircase method of assessment. The average&#xD;
      laser power necessary to produce a rating of &quot;1&quot; will be used to establish the pain&#xD;
      threshold. To determine an intensity-effect relationship, pulses will then applied with&#xD;
      increasing stimulus intensities to different areas of the dorsum of the hand/fingers with at&#xD;
      least 30 s between stimuli. Subjects will be asked to rate the pain intensity and&#xD;
      unpleasantness immediately after each stimulus (0 to 10, NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulus intensities will be increased in 300 mW increments. Intensity increases will be&#xD;
      continued until a given subject reports a level of moderate pain intensity (5 out of 10,&#xD;
      NRS). This intensity will be considered &quot;suprathreshold&quot; for the scan studies. In order to&#xD;
      train volunteers in rating their pain with an 11-point numerical rating scale (0 to 10, NRS),&#xD;
      the temperature of the laser will then be set to evoke random skin temperatures for 5 s&#xD;
      between the individual HPTpre and HTTpre separated by 30-s intervals, and the volunteers were&#xD;
      asked to rate their pain. For scans after rTMS-augmented hypnotic analgesia or hypnotic&#xD;
      analgesia alone (sham rTMS + hypnotic analgesia), heat pain scores evoked by the&#xD;
      pre-established threshold and suprathreshold laser powers will be assessed following each&#xD;
      scan. Decreased pain ratings will determine the strength of any analgesic effect TBS.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to rate their laser-evoked pain following each stimulus during each&#xD;
      scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiologic data acquisition: Throughout the scanning procedure we will monitor peripheral&#xD;
      autonomic physiology using MRI compatible EKG leads and a chest belt that monitors&#xD;
      respiration. This will allow us to compute respiratory sinus arrhythmia, which provides a&#xD;
      good estimate of vagal tone, which, in turn, is associated with better cardiac health and&#xD;
      self-soothing. Customized algorithms developed here at Stanford for simultaneous fMRI/EEG to&#xD;
      remove MRI scanner artifact from the EKG tracing will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
