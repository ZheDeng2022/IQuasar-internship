      Primary Objective: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects&#xD;
      aged 6 to less than 17 years undergoing various types of surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects aged 6 to less&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, two-part, multi-center, open-label study designed to evaluate the PK and&#xD;
      safety profile of EXPAREL in pediatric subjects aged 6 to less than 17 years when&#xD;
      administered intraoperatively at the end of surgery via local infiltration. 90 pediatric&#xD;
      subjects undergoing spine and/or cardiac surgeries are planned for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label study in subjects aged 6 to less than 17&#xD;
      years undergoing spine or cardiac surgeries. There will be 2 treatment groups: Group 1 will&#xD;
      include subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years, while Group 2 will include subjects aged 6 to&#xD;
      less than 12 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, safety study in subjects aged 6 to less than&#xD;
      17 years undergoing spine or cardiac surgeries. There will be 2 treatment groups: Group 1&#xD;
      will include subjects aged 12 to less than 17 years, while Group 2 will include subjects aged&#xD;
      6 to less than 12 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 30 days prior to study drug administration. During the&#xD;
      screening visit, subjects will be assessed for past or present neurologic, cardiac, and&#xD;
      general medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude them from&#xD;
      study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo their pre-planned spinal or cardiac surgeries per the institution's&#xD;
      standard of care. On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive the study drug intraoperatively at&#xD;
      the end of surgery via local infiltration into the surgical site. Dosing of EXPAREL will be&#xD;
      based on body weight, with a starting dose of 4 mg/kg (maximum 266 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no required length of stay in the hospital; subjects may be discharged based on the&#xD;
      medical judgment of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call will be scheduled for all subjects on Day 7. A final follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be made on Day 30 to all subjects who would have received the study drug.&#xD;

          <description>American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification was determined by physicians using the ASA Physical Status Classification System which assesses the patient's pre-anesthesia medical co-morbidities. ASA 1 patients would be considered a normal, healthy patient. ASA 2 is a patient with mild systemic disease (eg, smoker, well controlled diabetes or high blood pressure (HBP)). ASA 3 is a patient with severe systemic disease (eg poorly controlled diabetes or HBP). ASA 4 is a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life (eg, recent myocardial infarction, stroke).</description>

      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans whether or not considered drug-related. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug without any judgment about causality.&#xD;
Serious AEs were defined as per clinicaltrials.gov.</desc>
