      The goal of this pilot study is to characterize the effects of probiotics on the oral&#xD;
      microbiota in older patients with dysphagia at risk for pneumonia. A total of 20 participants&#xD;
      will be recruited from the UW Health Inpatient Swallowing Consult Service. Participants will&#xD;
      have a dysphagia diagnosis along with documented aspiration on videofluoroscopy. Each&#xD;
      participant will receive a once daily VSL#3 probiotic blend (dissolved in thickened liquid as&#xD;
      applicable) for 28 days. A baseline assessment will be completed to collect data on&#xD;
      demographics, health history and behaviors, usual diet, level of oral intake, and&#xD;
      patient-reported swallow function. Oral swab (buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum) as well as&#xD;
      saliva sample collections will be completed. Data on adherence and adverse events will be&#xD;
      collected weekly. Bacterial DNA will be extracted from oral samples and 16S rRNA sequencing&#xD;
      techniques will be used to identify contents of oral microbiota at baseline, week 2, and week&#xD;
      4. Oral microbial composition will be compared between the time points, and treatment&#xD;
      feasibility (recruitment and retention rates) in this population will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment will consist of VSL#3, 3 grams (g), taken orally once a day for 4 weeks. The VSL#3 will be delivered in the form of a sachet of freeze-dried powder. Participants will be instructed to mix the sachets with water to consume. Those participants taking thickened liquids will mix the sachet with liquids thickened to the level (nectar versus honey) prescribed by their clinician. In order to facilitate delivery of the probiotic solution throughout the oral cavity, participants will be instructed to swish the solution in the mouth for up to 10 seconds (as tolerated) prior to each swallow.</description>

    <description>Probiotics are dietary supplements composed of live microorganisms that are normally found within the human microbiome. Probiotics, specifically Lactobacilli and Streptococcus salivarius, have been shown to alter oral microbial composition and to inhibit oral pathogens that contribute to dental caries and periodontal disease. The probiotic chosen for this study is VSL#3, a blend of 8 strains of bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Streptococcus salivarius. VSL#3 has been well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. VLS#3 was chosen as the treatment substance for this project due to its successful use in trials examining an array of outcomes and its combination of several strains of bacteria.</description>
