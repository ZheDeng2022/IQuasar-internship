  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic injury is a relatively rare and result in significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates for the incidence of pancreatic injury range from 0.2-12% of abdominal traumas.&#xD;
      Many factors, such as patient stability, the acuity of concomitant life-threatening injuries,&#xD;
      and the need for damage control procedures must therefore be balanced when considering the&#xD;
      proper approach to pancreatic injury management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, few prospective studies have investigated the perioperative management of patients&#xD;
      with pancreatic trauma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic trauma, while uncommon, presents challenging diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas&#xD;
      to trauma surgeons. Indeed, injuries to the pancreas have been associated with reported&#xD;
      morbidity rates approaching 45%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease 's characterization at a specific therapeutic level will allow for a better&#xD;
      management of patients treated. To do so, the strategy is to integrate precise prospective&#xD;
      clinical records extensive clinical treatment data in a large cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the clinical departments, participating in the study, include patients, with a tight&#xD;
      collaboration between Trauma, Intensive Care and Surgery departments. Demographics and&#xD;
      clinical parameters are collected in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once after the diagnosis is confirmed, the inclusion of patients is performed, before a&#xD;
      scheduled hospital management, and after eligibility criteria checking, and consent form&#xD;
      signature. During clinical management, several samples are collected: blood samples and&#xD;
      surgical specimens. As usual practice, post-operative treatment will be prescribed at&#xD;
      investigator's discretion, with help of a pre-established algorithm. Several samples are also&#xD;
      collected during this exam (blood and biological tissue sample).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time as these managements, clinical data regarding medical history, pre-hospital&#xD;
      treatment history, surgical history, treatments history, post-operative treatment if&#xD;
      prescribed, treatments history between surgery and imageological diagnosis are recorded.&#xD;
      Clinical data are also collected 12 months after discharge during a scheduled visit organized&#xD;
      as usual practice, for long-term study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies will be performed along the cohort setting-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of operative and non-operative treatment of pancreatic trauma:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of the diagnosis time and treatment time of patients with pancreatic trauma&#xD;
           and whether or not the treatment is missed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of specific treatment of patients with pancreatic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of surgical methods and intraoperative conditions in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
           trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of ICU resuscitation treatment of patients with pancreatic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of endoscopy and other conservative treatments for patients with pancreatic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of nutritional support treatment for patients with pancreatic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study of treatment methods for damage control and non-damage control in patients with&#xD;
           severe pancreatic trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the biologic samples are stored on sites at -80°C, or at room temperature depending on&#xD;
      the samples: Samples collected in tubes, are sent immediately, at room temperature, to the&#xD;
      central pathology department in Jinling Hospital, Nanjing, China. All the other samples,&#xD;
      stored at -80°C, are sent to the Research Institute of General Surgery, Medical School of&#xD;
      Nanjing University, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples analyses are performed by dedicated research center: DNA, and RNA extraction for&#xD;
      transcriptome analysis, histological analyzes, etc:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological analyzes: Analysis of the structure of the excised pancreas or intestinal&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular Biology: Whole genome expression analyses are performed using microarray and&#xD;
      followed by Gene Ontology and clustering analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota: Bacterial composition of the ileal mucosa-associated microbiota is analyzed at&#xD;
      the time of surgery using 16S (MiSeq, Illumina) sequencing. The obtained sequences are&#xD;
      analyzed using the Qiime pipeline to assess composition, alpha and beta diversity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunology: Phenotype of immune cells: Immune cells are extracted from blood and fresh&#xD;
      mucosal tissues. The phenotype of these cells is analyzed by cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of neutrophil extracellular traps:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concentrations of cell-free DNA, cell-free nucleosomes, neutrophil elastase (NE) and&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured in sera and plasma by Human Cell Death Detection ELISA or&#xD;
      sandwich ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pancreatic tissue was removed rapidly and divided into different parts for later analyses.&#xD;
      One was used for confocal microscopy and one third was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for&#xD;
      biochemical quantification of pancreatic myeloperoxidase (MPO), histone 3, and histone 4&#xD;
      levels, etc. One was fixed in formalin for histologic analysis.&#xD;
