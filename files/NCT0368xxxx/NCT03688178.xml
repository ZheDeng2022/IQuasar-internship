  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be consented following tumor resection then&#xD;
      undergo leukapheresis for harvest of peripheral blood leukocytes for generation of dendritic&#xD;
      cells. Subjects will then receive standard of care (planned 6 weeks) radiation therapy (RT)&#xD;
      and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) at a standard targeted dose of 75 mg/m2/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cycle of TMZ comprises a targeted dose of 150-200mg/m2/day for 5 days every 4 (+2)&#xD;
      weeks for up to 12 cycles (patients with unmethylated MGMT gene promoter will receive only&#xD;
      cycle 1). All patients will receive up to a total of 10 DC vaccines called pp65 CMV dendritic&#xD;
      cells (DC). Dendritic Cell (DC) vaccines #1-3 will be given every two weeks, thus delaying&#xD;
      the initiation of TMZ cycle 2 for patients receiving TMZ. All remaining TMZ/vaccine cycles&#xD;
      will be 4 (+2) weeks in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first 3 DC vaccines given during Cycle 1 of TMZ, the remaining DC vaccine&#xD;
      injections are given on Day 21 (+/- 2 days) of each TMZ cycle. Subjects with unmethylated&#xD;
      MGMT will only receive one cycle of adjuvant TMZ; however, their vaccine schedule will follow&#xD;
      the same 4 (+ 2) week TMZ cycle schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following RT, patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups. Groups 1 and 2 will be blinded.&#xD;
      The groups differ in the type of pre-conditioning received prior to DC vaccine #4;&#xD;
      additionally, Group 3 will be receiving infusions of varlilumab 7 days prior to and with&#xD;
      vaccine #1 and 7 days prior to vaccine #3+. The pre-conditioning for each group is as&#xD;
      follows: Group 1: Unpulsed DC pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 2:&#xD;
      Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) pre-conditioning prior to DC vaccine #4; Group 3: Td pre-conditioning&#xD;
      prior to DC vaccine #4 and varlilumab infusion at 7 days prior to each DC vaccine (except DC&#xD;
      vaccine #2) with Td pre-conditioning prior to vaccine #4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common endemic β-Herpesvirus, and over half of adults have&#xD;
      been infected with CMV. CMV does not usually cause significant clinical disease but can cause&#xD;
      health problems for people with weakened immune systems. Expression of proteins unique to&#xD;
      human CMV has been reported within a large proportion of malignant gliomas (MGs), including&#xD;
      detection of the human CMV immunodominant protein pp65-LAMP (pp65-lysosomal-associated&#xD;
      membrane protein). Human CMV antigens were not detected in surrounding normal brain samples.&#xD;
      The presence of highly-immunogenic human CMV antigens within MGs affords a unique opportunity&#xD;
      to target these tumors immunologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells in the immune system. DCs are activated&#xD;
      then migrate to the lymph nodes to interact with T cells and B cells, which initiates the&#xD;
      adaptive immune response. This study generates autologous DCs from peripheral blood&#xD;
      leukocytes obtained from the subject during leukapheresis. RNA transfection is the method&#xD;
      used in this study for loading antigens onto DCs. DCs are pulsed with human CMV pp65-LAMP&#xD;
      mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) toxoid is used for active immunization in children and adults against&#xD;
      infection with the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium diphtheria. It is thought&#xD;
      that Td toxoid induces an inflammatory milieu within the intradermal vaccine site, thereby&#xD;
      promoting the migration of injected tumor-specific DCs. Additionally, in the context of&#xD;
      vaccinating the host with tumor-derived peptides, conditioning the vaccine site with Td&#xD;
      toxoid has demonstrated enhanced immunogenicity with these peptides. Previous trials have&#xD;
      suggested that giving the Td prior to immunotherapy may help improve the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      DC vaccine by activating the immune response. This study will further examine whether Td&#xD;
      helps activate the immune response by comparing subjects who receive Td pre-conditioning to&#xD;
      subjects who receive autologous unpulsed DCs as pre-conditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Varlilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets CD27, a critical molecule&#xD;
      in the activation pathway of lymphocytes. Varlilumab is an agonist anti-CD27 mAb that has&#xD;
      been shown to activate human T cells in the context of T cell receptor stimulation. In&#xD;
      pre-clinical models, varlilumab has been shown to mediate anti-tumor effects and may be&#xD;
      particularly effective in combination with other immunotherapies. Anti-CD27 mAb has emerged&#xD;
      as a novel costimulatory immune modulator that depletes TRegs without impairing activated&#xD;
      effector T cells to improve antitumor immunity. We hypothesize that TReg inhibition through&#xD;
      Varlilumab may increase polyfunctional immune responses to CMV.&#xD;
