    <textblock>
      : A split-mouth controlled clinical trial was carried out on 21 healthy, three to seven years&#xD;
      old children, with 42 pairs (84 molars) of contralateral mandibular primary molars indicated&#xD;
      for pulpotomy. One paired tooth in one side was designated to Biodentine (Group 1) and the&#xD;
      other side for MTA (Group 2) as a pulp medicament. All pulpotomized teeth were finally&#xD;
      restored with stainless steel crowns. Subjects were monitored clinically and radiographically&#xD;
      at one, three, six and 12 months.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study was a split-mouth controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 21 patients with 42 pairs of molars (84 molars) was determined using online&#xD;
      sample size calculator (Sealed envelope.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population included three to seven years old healthy and cooperative patients who&#xD;
      presented at the Pediatric Dental Clinic, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University and had two&#xD;
      matched bilateral deep carious mandibular primary molars indicated for pulpotomy, that met&#xD;
      specific inclusion criteria. Written consent was obtained from the parent/guardian after&#xD;
      explaining the full details of the treatment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for inclusion in this study were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No history of spontaneous pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of tenderness to percussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of physiologic or pathologic tooth mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No clinical evidence of pulpal inflammation or degeneration, such as history of swelling&#xD;
           or presence of sinus tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restorable teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of radiographic evidence of internal or external root resorption, pulpal&#xD;
           calcification, or osseous disease (periapical or furcation infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, teeth were excluded if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evidence of necrosis after access cavity preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemostasis could not be achieved within three min after direct contact with a wet cotton&#xD;
           pellet, prior to material placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matched molars in each pair were randomly designated using computer software (Random.org) to&#xD;
      Group 1: which received Biodentine (Septodont, France), or Group 2: which received MTA&#xD;
      (Angelus- Londrina, Brazil), as pulp medicament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative periapical radiograph using periapical film size two (Speed D Film, Kodak, US)&#xD;
      was taken for the molars considered for treatment. Radiographs should be of proper film&#xD;
      density and contrast for proper radiographic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulpotomy procedure was performed by the same operator. Local anesthesia was induced and&#xD;
      rubber dam isolation was performed, followed by caries removal and deroofing of the pulp&#xD;
      chamber using a #330 high-speed carbide bur mounted in a water-cooled high speed turbine. The&#xD;
      coronal pulp tissue was amputated using a sterile sharp spoon excavator. The pulp chamber was&#xD;
      irrigated with normal saline. Pulp hemostasis was achieved using a sterile wet cotton pellet&#xD;
      applied for two to three min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 1: Biodentine was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A capsule was&#xD;
      gently tapped on a hard surface (to diffuse powder); five drops of liquid from the single&#xD;
      dose dispenser were poured into the capsule which was placed in a triturator for 30 sec. The&#xD;
      mixture was then introduced into the pulp chamber using amalgam carrier until the entire pulp&#xD;
      chamber was completely filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group 2: MTA was used according to the manufacturer's instructions; the powder was mixed&#xD;
      with sterile water in a 3:1 powder/water ratio to obtain a thick creamy paste, then placed on&#xD;
      the floor of the pulp chamber using a messing gun and compacted against the pulp orifices&#xD;
      with a condenser over a moist cotton pellet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molars of both groups were finally restored with stainless steel crowns (3M, ESPE, Unitek,&#xD;
      US) cemented with GI cement. An immediate postoperative radiograph using periapical film size&#xD;
      two was taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treated patients were followed up at one, three, six and 12 months after the pulpotomy&#xD;
      for clinical and radiographic evaluation as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatric&#xD;
      Dentistry . Independently, two examiners evaluated the teeth clinically and radiographically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulpotomized teeth were judged as clinically successful if they met the following&#xD;
      criteria: Absence of sensitivity, pain, tenderness to percussion, abscess, fistula or tooth&#xD;
      mobility. Radiographic success was defined if there were normal periodontal ligament space,&#xD;
      absence of furcation or periapical radiolucency, absence of internal or external root&#xD;
      resorption. Widening of the periodontal ligament was not considered failure in absence of&#xD;
      other concurrent pathologies.&#xD;
