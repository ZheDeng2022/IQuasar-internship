      The primary purpose of this multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase&#xD;
      II study is to investigate if oral vitamin C may change the biology of low-risk myeloid&#xD;
      malignancies; i.e., clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS), low-risk&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)-0/1 by reversing&#xD;
      the epigenetic changes characteristic of these disease entities. The epigenetic regulator&#xD;
      TET2 is the gene most often affected in CCUS. Preclinical studies have shown that active&#xD;
      demethylation by the TET enzymes is dependent on vitamin C, and the investigators and&#xD;
      collaborators have shown that plasma vitamin C levels are exceedingly low in hematological&#xD;
      cancer patients but are easily corrected by oral vitamin C. This study is part of an array of&#xD;
      EVITA studies aimed at clarifying whether the standard of care of patients with myeloid&#xD;
      malignancies should be changed and oral vitamin C supplement added to the treatment&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Recent investigations have shown that mutations in epigenetic regulators are&#xD;
      common, both in the apparently normal hematopoiesis of the elderly and in patients (pts) with&#xD;
      myeloid cancers. It was long anticipated that DNA methylation was a permanent silencing mark,&#xD;
      but with the discovery of the ten eleven translocation (TET) enzymes it became clear that&#xD;
      active demethylation occurs. The initial steps in this process are catalyzed by TET enzymes,&#xD;
      which are, however, frequently mutated and methylated in hematological cancers. The Jumonji&#xD;
      enzymes, which catalyze histone demethylation, are also aberrantly regulated in hematological&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C (VitC) was identified in the 1930'ies as the necessary micronutrient in the&#xD;
      prevention of scurvy. Unlike plants and most animals, humans are unable to synthesize vitC&#xD;
      from glucose due to lack of the required enzyme, L-gulonolactone oxidase. Therefore, vitC&#xD;
      must be provided through the diet. Recent studies recognize vitC as an important cofactor for&#xD;
      the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase family. These include the TET enzymes, which are&#xD;
      involved in the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to its oxidized derivatives&#xD;
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), 5-carboxyl cytosine (5-caC), and 5-formylcytosine (5-fC),&#xD;
      and the Jumonji enzymes that are involved in histone demethylation. Accordingly, vitC may&#xD;
      potentially play an important role in the regulation of DNA and histone demethylation.&#xD;
      However, &gt; 80 percentage of hematological cancer pts were found to be severely vitC&#xD;
      deficient. Interestingly, analyses of 20 participants included in the investigators' recently&#xD;
      conducted randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study (NCT02877277) show that the level of&#xD;
      vitC in MDS and CMML pts undergoing treatment with azacitidine, is easily elevated to the&#xD;
      normal range by oral vitC supplement (unpublished data). When pts that were already taking&#xD;
      vitC supplements were switched to placebo, the vitC levels quickly dropped below the normal&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown that the formation of 5-hmC and its derivatives may be compromised in&#xD;
      healthy individuals and pts with TET mutations. However, since many of these mutations are&#xD;
      heterozygous, and since the three TET enzymes (TET1, TET2, and TET3) may have some&#xD;
      redundancy, restoration of vitC to physiological levels might have an impact on the level of&#xD;
      5-hmC/5-mC in individuals with TET mutant clonal hematopoiesis or hematological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of 5-hmC/5-mC levels in peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the&#xD;
      participants in the pilot study also showed a clear trend toward increased 5-hmC in the vitC&#xD;
      arm, however, after designing the trial the investigators realized that 5-hmC/5-mC levels are&#xD;
      better measured in hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) where the levels are&#xD;
      10-20 fold higher. Thus, the pilot study will be followed-up with a randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial of oral vitC in individuals with low-risk myeloid malignancies;&#xD;
      i.e., CCUS or low-risk MDS/CMML, to investigate if oral vitC can change the biology of these&#xD;
      disease entities and ultimately prevent progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators and collaborators have previously shown that cancer pts are vitC&#xD;
           deficient, and individuals with CCUS, which represents pre-MDS, might also be vitC&#xD;
           deficient. The hypothesis is that this may lead to reduced levels of 5-hmC/5-mC in vivo&#xD;
           in both cancer pts and individuals with CCUS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elevating serum vitC levels to the normal range in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts by&#xD;
           oral supplementation with vitC may&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  reduce the malignant clone,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  increase the 5-hmC/5-mC ratio,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  change the plasma cytokine profile towards a less inflammatory, less tumorigenic&#xD;
                profile,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  change gene expression&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if restoring vitC to the normal range in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts can:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. reduce the malignant clone,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increase the 5-hmC/5-mC ratio in CCUS and low-risk MDS/CMML pts&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. reduce accumulation of 5-mC at promoters/enhancers/long terminal repeats (LTRs), or at&#xD;
           other regulatory genomic regions of tumor suppressors/methylated driver genes/genes&#xD;
           involved in hematopoietic development,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. upregulate the expression of these genes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. change the plasma cytokine profile,&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. alter intestinal permeability (measured by concentration of bacterial DNA in peripheral&#xD;
           blood) and/or composition of gut microbiota,&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. entail any safety risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN A total of 100 patients is planned for enrolment. Individuals with CCUS,&#xD;
      low-risk MDS, or CMML-0 or -1 will be included from Rigshospitalet, Herlev University&#xD;
      Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Aalborg University Hospital or Keck Hospital of&#xD;
      University of Southern California between November 2017-December 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will enter block randomization with a ratio of 1:1; vitC 1000 mg/day p.o.&#xD;
      versus placebo for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 healthy elderly volunteers are planned for enrolment. Amount and type of bacterial&#xD;
      DNA in PB will be determined and serve as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND MEASUREMENTS PB: PB samples (45 mL) will be taken at study entry and every 3&#xD;
      months (or more if required according to physician's choice) during the first year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements include blood counts including differential count, levels of folic acid, vitamin&#xD;
      B12, vitamin D, iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, plasma vitC levels,&#xD;
      cytokines, and bacterial DNA content (referenced to bacterial DNA on patient's skin and in&#xD;
      feces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM: BM samples (18 mL) will be taken at study entry, after 3 months, and after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of vitC and various cytokines will be measured. Mutations in genes frequently involved&#xD;
      in myeloid cancer/clonal hematopoiesis, including epigenetic regulators, and variant allele&#xD;
      frequencies (VAF) will be investigated by targeted next generation sequencing in sorted BM&#xD;
      CD34+ cells (if available) or BM negative fraction of CD34+ sorting at study entry, after 3&#xD;
      months and after one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA sequencing and total 5-hmC/5-mC assessment will be performed on BM CD34+ hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feces: Feces samples (9 mL) will be collected from a subset of patients at study entry, after&#xD;
      3 months, and after one year. Bacterial DNA will be extracted and sequenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH BIOBANK A research biobank will be established at The Epi-/Genome Laboratory,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet / Biotech Research and Innovation Centre to store the biological samples from&#xD;
      the participants. The research biobank is approved by the Regional Science Ethics Committee&#xD;
      and the Danish Data Protection Agency in accordance with the Act on Processing of Personal&#xD;
      Data (license no. H-16022249 and 04864/RH-2016-259, respectively). Cryopreserved separated&#xD;
      MNCs from BM and PB will be stored in addition to granulocyte pellets and plasma. The date&#xD;
      for closing the research biobank is 31-12-2030.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For correlative studies, biological samples will be sent to Van Andel Research Institute,&#xD;
      Grand Rapids, US, and Imperial College, London, UK (external collaborators), for RNA&#xD;
      sequencing and analyses of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation, respectively. Biological&#xD;
      samples will also be sent to Life Science Faculty, University of Copenhagen, and The National&#xD;
      Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark (external collaborators) for&#xD;
      measurement of serum vitC concentrations and analyses of T cell responses, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS VitC measurement: Ascorbate and total vitC, i.e., ascorbate + dehydroascorbic acid&#xD;
      (the oxidized form of vitC; DHA), are quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography&#xD;
      (HPLC) with coulometric detection; DHA is assessed by subtraction of ascorbate from total&#xD;
      vitC. Uric acid is used as endogenous internal standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell sorting: Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS, using a EasySep device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total 5-hmC/5-mC measurement: Dot blot analysis of 5-hmC. 5-hmC/5-mC measurement by Mass&#xD;
      Spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locus specific 5-hmC/5-mC measurement: &quot;EPIC&quot; 850 K BeadChips. 5-hmC/5-mC at selected sites&#xD;
      will be measured by pyrosequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene expression: Total RNA sequencing and reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mutation detection: Targeted next generation sequencing of a panel of genes recurrently&#xD;
      mutated in myeloid cancer as described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND POWER CALCULATION This study is the first study to examine the&#xD;
      effects of vitC as monotherapy on 5-hmC/5-mC levels in hematopoietic stem cells in humans in&#xD;
      vivo. Therefore, it is not possible to perform a power calculation or a sample size&#xD;
      calculation. The number of participants (n=100) is set as an estimate of the number needed to&#xD;
      observe a potential significant difference between the groups (vitC vs. placebo) in the&#xD;
      primary endpoint; median change in VAF of somatic mutations from baseline to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy analyses are by intention-to-treat. Safety analyses include all participants who&#xD;
      receive at least one dose of protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The study has been approved by the Regional Science Ethics Committee&#xD;
      (H-16022249) and the Danish Data Protection Agency (04864/RH-2016-259).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants included in the project will be informed orally and in writing.&#xD;
      Participation will only be accepted after written consent. Participants will be informed that&#xD;
      they can at any time for any reason withdraw from the study without it affecting their&#xD;
      treatment in the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the targeted DNA sequencing approach described, there is a small risk of detecting a&#xD;
      germline mutation in the participants related to myeloid malignancy. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to state in the informed consent if they do not want to receive any further relevant&#xD;
      health-related information that may appear during the project analyses. Unless the&#xD;
      participant explicitly states that he or she does not want to be informed of any potential&#xD;
      health-related random findings in the study, the participant will be informed and offered&#xD;
      further investigations and genetic counseling at the local hospital in case of random&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient disadvantages, side effects, risks, and complications Blood sampling is associated&#xD;
      with brief discomfort and/or pain. No significant risks are associated with the blood&#xD;
      sampling. Local bleeding can occur, which in rare cases can cause discomfort and&#xD;
      discoloration for a few days. Rarely, a blood sampling can cause vasovagal reaction leading&#xD;
      to a brief loss of consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BM aspiration is associated with brief pain while the local anesthesia is given. Furthermore,&#xD;
      many individuals experience an uncomfortable feeling in the nates and leg while the BM is&#xD;
      aspirated. This lasts approximately 30 seconds. Finally, some tenderness can occur for a few&#xD;
      days after the procedure. Possible complications to undergoing a BM investigation include&#xD;
      bleeding and infection. However, the incidence of these complications is extremely low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations there is no evidence that intake of vitC&#xD;
      above 1000 mg/day are either carcinogenic or teratogenic. However, high intakes (&gt; 1000-2000&#xD;
      mg/day) may cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances and susceptible&#xD;
      individuals may experience kidney stone formation from increased oxalate formation. Since&#xD;
      vitC is only given at physiological doses, it is anticipated that the study is safe and will&#xD;
      provide no additional risk for the participants; an assumption that is supported by the&#xD;
      experience from the pilot study.&#xD;
