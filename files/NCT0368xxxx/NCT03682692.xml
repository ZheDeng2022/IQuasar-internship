      1. Study name: ACEI/CCB versus ACEI/DIU combination antihypertensive therapy in Chinese&#xD;
           hypertensive patients (ACvAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale:Most current hypertension guidelines recommend the combination therapy of an&#xD;
           angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)&#xD;
           with a calcium antagonists (CCB) or thiazide diuretics (DIU). However, whether the two&#xD;
           combination treatments have similar antihypertensive effects in Chinese hypertensive&#xD;
           patients is still lack of clinical evidence, especially randomized controlled trials&#xD;
           using ambulatory or home blood pressure measurement as the main evaluation method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design: This study is a multi-center, randomized and controlled clinical trial&#xD;
           with two equally sized treatment groups: ACEI/CCB group and ACEI/DIU group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study population: Men or women over 18 years (n=580) meeting the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Randomization and treatment: Potentially eligible patients should receive a 24-hour&#xD;
           ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurement before randomization. After&#xD;
           stratification by centers and whether receive antihypertensive treatment, eligible&#xD;
           patients will be randomly divided into two groups, taking benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine&#xD;
           besylate 5mg fixed-dose combination (1 tablet once a day) or benazepril 10&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed-dose combination (1 tablet once a day).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow up: All patients should sign an informed consent form before entering the study.&#xD;
           The follow-up period is 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Sample size estimation: a total of 580 patients should be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

      1. Study name: ACEI/CCB versus ACEI/DIU combination antihypertensive therapy in Chinese&#xD;
           hypertensive patients (ACvAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medicine: Benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine besylate 5 mg fixed-dose combination, benazepril&#xD;
           10 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed-dose combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rationale: A meta-analysis of 42 studies showed that the combination of two&#xD;
           antihypertensive drugs is better than monotherapy to control blood pressure. Most&#xD;
           patients with grade 2 or higher hypertension need two or more antihypertensive drugs to&#xD;
           control blood pressure. Antihypertensive therapy with fixed-dose combination can better&#xD;
           control blood pressure and improve patient compliance, as well as reduce adverse effect.&#xD;
           For untreated patients with high blood pressure level, the guidelines recommend that&#xD;
           combination therapy can be used initially. The fixed-dose combination can control blood&#xD;
           pressure to target, as well as improve patient compliance by reducing the number of&#xD;
           tablets. Most current hypertension guidelines, including the Chinese guidelines for the&#xD;
           management of hypertension, recommend the combination therapy of an&#xD;
           angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)&#xD;
           with a calcium antagonists (CCB) or thiazide diuretics (DIU). However, whether the two&#xD;
           combination treatments have similar antihypertensive effects in Chinese hypertensive&#xD;
           patients is still lack of clinical evidence, especially randomized controlled trials&#xD;
           using ambulatory or home blood pressure measurement as the main evaluation method. This&#xD;
           randomized controlled clinical trial will be carried out in 580 Chinese hypertensive&#xD;
           patients. By measuring office blood pressure, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and home&#xD;
           blood pressure, the blood pressure lowering effect of benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine&#xD;
           besylate 5 mg fixed-dose combination and benazepril 10 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg&#xD;
           fixed-dose combination will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objective: The primary objective is to evaluate the reduction of 24-hour ambulatory&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure in the ACEI/CCB group compared with the ACEI/DIU group after 6&#xD;
           months of antihypertensive treatment. The secondary objectives are to compare the&#xD;
           reduction of 24-hour, daytime, night-time, home and office systolic and diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure after 6 months of study medication treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study design: This study is a multi-center, randomized and controlled clinical trial&#xD;
           with two equally sized treatment groups: ACEI/CCB group and ACEI/DIU group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Study population: With the age over 18 years, newly diagnosed grade 1-2 hypertensive&#xD;
           patients or grade 1-2 hypertensive patients with monotherapy whose blood pressure not&#xD;
           controlled, having systolic blood pressure ranged from 140 to 179 mmHg or (and)&#xD;
           diastolic blood pressure ranged from 90 to 109 mmHg, can enter a 4-week run-in period&#xD;
           before randomization. During the run-in period, all patients take benazepril 10 mg&#xD;
           daily, and have an office visit every two weeks. After taking benazepril for 4 weeks&#xD;
           continually with no adverse effect, patients with the mean office blood pressure of the&#xD;
           last two visits between 140 and 179 mmHg in systolic or (and) between 90 and 109 mmHg in&#xD;
           diastolic are eligible for randomization. Eligible patients will switch to take study&#xD;
           medication after randomization. A one-week home blood pressure measurement should be&#xD;
           performed before randomization by using an automatic device. Exclusion criteria include:&#xD;
           suspected or confirmed secondary hypertension; history of coronary heart disease,&#xD;
           myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke or dementia; other drugs that might affect&#xD;
           blood pressure; serum levels of ALT, AST, TBL equal or higher than twice of the upper&#xD;
           limit; serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L); urine protein positive; serum potassium&#xD;
           &gt;5.5 mmol/L or &lt;3.5 mmol/L; history of gout or serum uric acid ≥420 μmol/L for male or&#xD;
           ≥360 μmol/L for female; elderly patients need caring; or patients who are participating&#xD;
           other clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomization and treatment: Potentially eligible patients should receive a 24-hour&#xD;
           ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measurement before randomization. After&#xD;
           stratification by centers and whether receive antihypertensive treatment, eligible&#xD;
           patients will be randomly divided into two groups, taking benazepril 10 mg/amlodipine&#xD;
           besylate 5 mg fixed-dose combination (1 tablet once a day) or benazepril 10&#xD;
           mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed-dose combination (1 tablet once a day). If the&#xD;
           systolic/diastolic blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg during follow-up visits, the&#xD;
           dosage can be increased to 2 tablets once a day. If the systolic/diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure still ≥140/90 mmHg, bisoprolol 5 mg (1 tablet once a day) or doxazosin&#xD;
           controlled-release tablets 4 mg (1 tablet once a day) or spironolactone 20 mg (1 tablet&#xD;
           once a day) can be added during the following follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up: All patients should sign an informed consent form before entering the study.&#xD;
           A validated Omron automatic device should be used to measure the sitting blood pressure&#xD;
           in the clinic. Patients will be followed up every month with sitting office blood&#xD;
           pressure measured and medical history recorded. Before each follow-up visit, a one-week&#xD;
           home blood pressure measurement should be performed using an automatic Omron device;&#xD;
           24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiogram, blood and urine&#xD;
           biochemical tests should be repeated at the end of the 6 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size estimation: The primary outcome is the reduction of 24-hour ambulatory&#xD;
           systolic blood pressure in the ACEI/CCB group compared with the ACEI/DIU group after 6&#xD;
           months of antihypertensive treatment. Assuming the difference between groups is 2.5 mmHg&#xD;
           and the standard deviation is 10 mmHg, α is 0.05, and the power is 80%, the sample size&#xD;
           of each group should be 252 patients. Accounting for 15% of add-up, each group needs 290&#xD;
           eligible patients. The total number of patietns is 580. The data will be analyzed by SAS&#xD;
           software, and the t-test will be used to compare the continuous variables of two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Timeline: Ethical review: November 2017; Enrollment: January 2018-June 2020; End of&#xD;
           follow-up: December 2020. At the same, abstract of the main results will be submitted to&#xD;
           domestic or international scientific conferences. The main results will be published in&#xD;
           an international medical journal.&#xD;
