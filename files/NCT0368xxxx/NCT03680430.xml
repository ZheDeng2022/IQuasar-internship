  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is generally treated by surgery, followed or preceded by&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Preoperative irradiation has been shown to be effective in a&#xD;
      randomized trial, and is often indicated in locally advanced Soft tissue sarcomas of the&#xD;
      limbs, in order to reach R0 resection, or in case of rapid tumor growth despite first&#xD;
      chemotherapy. For inoperable sarcomas, radiotherapy is an efficient palliative treatment,&#xD;
      increasing local control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptive radiotherapy is defined as the set of procedures leading to the modification of a&#xD;
      treatment plan based on the individual variations observed during irradiation. The place of&#xD;
      this technique is increasing since the development of image-guided-radiotherapy allowing the&#xD;
      visualization of daily variations in position, shape or volume of the tumor and organs at&#xD;
      risk. Its implementation in current practice however remains limited because of the&#xD;
      cumbersome processes involved (new delineation, new dose calculation, or even&#xD;
      re-optimization) and resources to commit, especially in human time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irradiation of soft tissue sarcomas always begins with a planning CT scan, where the&#xD;
      target-volumes and organ at risk are delineated, and dosimetric calculations are performed&#xD;
      prior to radiotherapy initiation. During the radiotherapy, the variations leading to a&#xD;
      mismatch between the planned dose and the dose delivered are multiple. These may be due to&#xD;
      positioning errors or morphological changes in the patient (weight loss), or in the tumor or&#xD;
      organs at risk (modifications in shape, size or position). The volume of soft tissue sarcomas&#xD;
      changes also during radiotherapy (response, progression or pseudo- progression of the tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to date, few data are available in the literature both on the volume variation of&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcomas during preoperative radiotherapy, and on the interest of adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the management of these tumors. It is therefore necessary to evaluate whether&#xD;
      modifications of growth or macroscopic tumor volume are observed during the treatment, and to&#xD;
      evaluate dosimetric impact on the target volume coverage that could impact the results of the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This a prospective multicentric phase II trial conducted to evaluate the interest of adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the preoperative or exclusive management of limb sarcomas Patients will be&#xD;
      treated by preoperative or definitive radiotherapy for a limb soft tissue sarcomas, using an&#xD;
      intensity-modulated conformal irradiation (with a static or dynamic technic), over 5 to 7&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. The total dose delivered will be of 50 Gray (preoperative radiation&#xD;
      therapy), or 60 to 70 Gray (exclusive radiation therapy). The delineation of growth or&#xD;
      macroscopic tumor volume,clinical target volume, and planning target volume, as well as&#xD;
      healthy surrounding tissues will be carried out in each of the centers, and under the&#xD;
      responsibility of the radiotherapist, on The simulation CT-scan, used for dosimetry, and 3 CT&#xD;
      scan performed on day 1 of radiotherapy (d1), at a dose of 30Gy (d30Gy) and 50Gy (d50GY). The&#xD;
      dosimetric re-planning according to the variations of the volume of the planning target&#xD;
      volume will be done in case of significant variation of the target volume according to de&#xD;
      definition mentionned in the main and secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the interest of adaptive radiotherapy in&#xD;
      the preoperative or exclusive management of limb sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first prospective trial focused on the evaluation of the volume variation of soft&#xD;
      tissue sarcomas during preoperative radiotherapy, and also on the interest of adaptive&#xD;
      radiotherapy in the management of these tumors, whereas indications of preoperative and/or&#xD;
      exclusive radiation therapy are very frequent.&#xD;
