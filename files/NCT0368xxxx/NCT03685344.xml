    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      Loncastuximab Tesirine (ADCT-402) and Durvalumab in participants with Advanced Diffuse Large&#xD;
      B-Cell Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, or Follicular Lymphoma&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-arm combination study with a dose escalation phase&#xD;
      (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 75&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for Part 1. The DLT period will be the 21&#xD;
      days after the first durvalumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will consist of up to 3 expansion cohorts, one for DLBCL, one for MCL, and one for FL.&#xD;
      Each cohort will be approximately 20 participants treated at the dose determined in Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of&#xD;
      3, 6, and 4 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 2&#xD;
      years after treatment discontinuation).&#xD;

    <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that occurred or worsened in the period extending from the first dose of study drugs to 30 days after the last dose of study drugs or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred earlier).&#xD;
Evaluation of TEAEs included the number of participants with at least one: TEAE, serious TEAE and grade ≥3 TEAE as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0&#xD;
CTCAE grading scale:&#xD;
Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.&#xD;
Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.&#xD;
Grade 5 = Death related to AE.&#xD;
Clinically significant changes from baseline for safety laboratory values, vital sign measurements and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded as TEAEs.</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as an adverse event (AE) that occurred or worsened in the period extending from the first dose of study drugs to 30 days after the last dose of study drugs or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy (whichever occurred earlier).&#xD;
Evaluation of TEAEs included the number of participants with at least one: TEAE, serious TEAE and grade ≥3 TEAE as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0&#xD;
CTCAE grading scale:&#xD;
Grade 3 = Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.&#xD;
Grade 4 = Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.&#xD;
Grade 5 = Death related to AE.&#xD;
Clinically significant changes from baseline for safety laboratory values, vital sign measurements and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded as TEAEs.</description>

          <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</title>
          <description>PFS was defined as the time between start of treatment and the first documentation of progression, or death.&#xD;
Disease progression was defined as progressive metabolic disease and one of the following:&#xD;
Target node progression.&#xD;
An individual extranodal lesion must be abnormal with length &gt; 1.5cm and/or increase of length &gt; 50%.&#xD;
New or clear progression of non-measured lesions.&#xD;
Regrowth of previously resolved lesions or new nodes &gt;1.5 cm in length.&#xD;
New or recurrent bone marrow involvement.</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis set - All participants who received at least one dose of study drug, had valid baseline disease assessment(s) and at least one valid post-baseline disease assessment. Participants who did not have a post-baseline assessment due to early clinical progression or death (after receiving study drug) were also included. The study was terminated prior to initiation of the dose expansion, so results are only presented for the dose escalation.</population>
