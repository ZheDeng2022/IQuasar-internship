  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic changes related to disease are the precursor to anatomical changes in tissues.&#xD;
      Currently the imaging methods routinely used in clinical practice look at the anatomical&#xD;
      changes. Whilst these methods are very helpful in making clinical decisions, they are far&#xD;
      from being perfect. Early disease can be missed because these methods are not sensitive&#xD;
      enough and it is not clear whether disease is present or not. Additionally, it is also&#xD;
      difficult to know whether disease it aggressive or non-aggressive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperpolarised MRI is a new imaging tool that may allow addressing these deficiencies in&#xD;
      current imaging technology. The process of hyperpolarisation allows the production of an&#xD;
      injectable solution that can produce signal on a standard MRI scanner inferring information&#xD;
      about the metabolism occurring at a particular location. This technology has only just become&#xD;
      available for clinical use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial stages of evaluation require the investigators to refine and develop the new&#xD;
      imaging protocols so that assessment can be made as to whether consistent results can be&#xD;
      achieved. Additionally, refining the imaging protocol could also aid in identifying where the&#xD;
      best potential future clinical use of this technology should be targeted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this application the investigators aim to try out hyperpolarised MRI in a number of&#xD;
      different cancers and also see whether it is useful to assess cardiac metabolism. The&#xD;
      investigators will be using 13C-labelled metabolites (for this study 13C- pyruvate) which&#xD;
      will allow interrogation of glucose metabolism. The derangement of glucose metabolism is&#xD;
      common to a number of disease processes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this work are to generate proof-of-concept first-in-human metabolic&#xD;
      imaging data using hyperpolarised MRI for patients with prostate cancer (n=15), renal (n=5),&#xD;
      breast cancer (n=5), lymphoma (n=5) and cardiac diseases (n=5). Each cohort will provide&#xD;
      sufficient value for high-impact publication and the essential preliminary data for&#xD;
      subsequent individual grant applications. The findings will be correlated with conventional&#xD;
      imaging and with clinical patient details and where applicable patient outcome. The study&#xD;
      will take 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main ethical, legal and management issues from the study are;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hyperpolarised Injectable The investigators will be using a product to inject into&#xD;
           patients that will be manufactured on site. This will be a GMP facility to ensure&#xD;
           sterility. The methodology to do this is new. The investigators will have established&#xD;
           safety through evaluation of the processes within the facility with institutional&#xD;
           approval prior to utilisation of the product in patients. In addition, any product that&#xD;
           is to be injected will be taken through a quality control module which will determine&#xD;
           its pH, temperature, concentration and provided these are within specified safe&#xD;
           parameters will allow the investigators to inject into the patient. The QC module itself&#xD;
           will be validated/qualified prior to its use. Finally, solution produced for injection&#xD;
           will go through a sterile filter and also be sent for culture. Patients will be&#xD;
           monitored throughout the study and will be followed up after examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MRI Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The investigators will be using new MRI coils that allows transmission of&#xD;
                radiofrequency signals into the body and collect them. A new coil is required&#xD;
                because the investigators need them to be tuned to the frequency of 13C (usually&#xD;
                MRI uses 1H).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The investigators will be using new MRI software that has been programmed in house&#xD;
                to generate the signals. This software has undergone in-house and institutional&#xD;
                approval processes to confirm that it is safe for human use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Recruitment An information leaflet be dispatched to the volunteer and subsequent contact&#xD;
           will be made to assess interest in participation and discuss arrangement for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      35 patients will be recruited in the first instance in one of the following ways: A. Through&#xD;
      identification at the relevant multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) B. Patients with&#xD;
      confirmed cancer or heart conditions who are attending for a clinical MRI scan (or from an&#xD;
      imaging list) as part of standard care at UCLH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Direct referral from clinical colleagues D. Cancer or cardiology in-patients who are well&#xD;
      enough and meet the recruitment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 25/35 patients will be injected with the hyperpolarised solution. The remaining 10/35&#xD;
      (prostate cancer patients) will allow the investigators to optimise the MRI clinical scan&#xD;
      technique and use of an endorectal MRI coil (to be inserted into the back passage). This&#xD;
      optimisation will ensure that when patients with prostate cancer are evaluated with the&#xD;
      hyperpolarised injectable, the best chance of detecting the hyperpolarised MR signal is&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Consent Patients will have had information &gt; 24hours in advance of consenting to study&#xD;
      and having the research MRI. Consent will be obtained by a member of the research team&#xD;
      trained in taking consent. Interpretation services will be made available if the patient is&#xD;
      not fluent in spoken or written English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (5) Data Management&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unexpected Findings: Any unexpected findings in participants with known cancer (e.g.&#xD;
           unknown metastatic disease) will be directly communicated to the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Confidentiality of Data: All data will be collated by the chief investigator and&#xD;
           research team. Electronic data and images will be held on password protected databases&#xD;
           and will be pseudo anonymised to avoid identification of patients. Adherence will be&#xD;
           made to the data protection act 1998. Patient data will never leave UCLH. This system is&#xD;
           compliant with UCLH data protection regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (6) Patient Burden/Benefit Patients will need to attend the hospital for the additional&#xD;
           scan required for this study. The total amount of time that they will spend within the&#xD;
           study is approx. 4 hours (including consent, preparation and monitoring). Patients will&#xD;
           reimbursed for transport costs to enable them to attend for their scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will where possible try to coincide the scan with a clinical&#xD;
           appointment to minimise repeated attendances to hospital. There will be no direct&#xD;
           benefit to patients of having undergone this scan. However, participants will contribute&#xD;
           towards potential societal benefit if the technique is successful. The investigators&#xD;
           will keep the doctors of the patients informed with the study results which can then be&#xD;
           communicated to participants.&#xD;

    <description>Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C MR is an advanced imaging technique that allows monitoring of dynamic metabolic processes non-invasively. Hyperpolarisation is a process that provides dramatic gains in sensitivity (&gt;10,000) of MRI signal collected from 13C-labelled substrates that can be injected into living systems, allowing in-vivo metabolism for the first time to be observed in real-time using imaging.</description>
