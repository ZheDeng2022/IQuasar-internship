  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many public health recommendations and policies aim to combat malnutrition in the elderly. It&#xD;
      must be noted that levels of malnutrition are high in the elderly with more than 70% of the&#xD;
      dependent population at home or in institutions and 30 to 70% of elderly people in hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospitals, the collective catering system and the &quot;medicalisation&quot; of meals (diets,&#xD;
      medicines, etc.) force patients to change their eating habits, and they are often faced with&#xD;
      a lack of choice and a less pleasurable experience. These organizational constraints are&#xD;
      particularly harmful for elderly patients who tend to be malnourished or at risk of&#xD;
      malnutrition and who are often polypathological and polymedicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If eating is one of the only pleasures sometimes left to this fragile population, breakfast&#xD;
      is one of the most appreciated meals of the day (after a fasting time &gt;10h). It tends to&#xD;
      follow the habits acquired at home and is mostly oriented towards sweet foods. However, it is&#xD;
      not known whether different and more varied choices could change dietary directions and&#xD;
      intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offering sweet and savoury foods can upset medical prescriptions, cultural habits and can go&#xD;
      against what remains a patient need: the pleasure of eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although some work in the medico-social field has been successfully carried out and has&#xD;
      reported changes in dietary behaviour in a choice situation (buffet type) at breakfast,&#xD;
      scientific studies have not yet been done in a retirement home environment. The objective of&#xD;
      this project is to emphasize the sensory pleasure and commensality of breakfast. During this&#xD;
      buffet meal, sweet and savoury foods will be offered. The idea is to detect if the variety&#xD;
      will naturally direct individual choices towards the savory and/or sweet flavours and if it&#xD;
      encourages an increase in caloric and protein intakes. Several studies have shown that&#xD;
      sensory changes in the elderly can lead to changes in behaviour and food preferences. The&#xD;
      decrease in the pleasure only accentuates the causes of malnutrition. Moreover, preconceived&#xD;
      ideas reinforce the association between the elderly and a preference for sweet foods.&#xD;
      However, no study has shown that the elderly find less pleasure in savory than sweet foods,&#xD;
      especially at breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be organized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: follow-up of breakfast consumption by food weighing. This is a prospective study&#xD;
      that will be carried out at Dijon University Hospital within the retirement home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consumption of each meal will be measured the day of the breakfast with savory and sweet&#xD;
      options, and then two days after in usual conditions in the individual's room. The&#xD;
      distribution, service and consumption methods will be consistent with the habits of the units&#xD;
      where the investigation is taking place.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each resident, food consumption will be recorded three times, at one month intervals over&#xD;
      2 non-consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: observations at breakfast time Pleasure evaluation - Feasibility - commensality -&#xD;
      conviviality A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted for each type of environment and meals offered. This analysis will be done using&#xD;
      established grids and semi-directive interviews with resource persons who are working in the&#xD;
      field (the professionals involved), and with research support units. The professionals will&#xD;
      be asked to complete various scales, of the Likert type, before and after the breakfasts&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;
