  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 works alone or in&#xD;
      combination with olaparib in treating participants with renal cell carcinoma, urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma, all pancreatic cancers, endometrial cancer, and other solid tumors excluding clear&#xD;
      cell ovarian cancer that have spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or other parts of the&#xD;
      body. ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 and olaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not known if giving ATR kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor AZD6738 with or without olaparib may work better in treating participants with&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess objective response rate (ORR) of ATR kinase inhibitor AZD6738 (AZD6738)&#xD;
      monotherapy and AZD6738 + olaparib by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)&#xD;
      1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the median duration of response (DOR) in each study arm. II. To determine the&#xD;
      median progression-free survival and progression-free survival rate at 6 and 12 months in&#xD;
      each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To further characterize the safety and tolerability profile of AZD6738 alone and in&#xD;
      combination with olaparib.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. The effects of AZD6738 and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because ATR and PARP inhibitors as well as other therapeutic drugs&#xD;
             used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use 2 highly effective forms of contraception prior to study entry&#xD;
             and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect&#xD;
             she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Male patients who are sexually active must be willing to use barrier&#xD;
                  contraception for the duration of the study and for 1 week after the last study&#xD;
                  drug administration, with all sexual partners. Male patients must use a condom&#xD;
                  during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) when&#xD;
                  having sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman or with a woman of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential. Female partners of male patients should also use a highly effective&#xD;
                  form of contraception for 6 months after the last dose of study drug(s) if they&#xD;
                  are of childbearing potential. True abstinence for either sex is an acceptable&#xD;
                  form of contraception and must be documented as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
                  test within 7 days prior to C1D1 treatment). Evidence of postmenopausal status or&#xD;
                  non-child bearing status must be documented. Postmenopausal is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least 12 months following&#xD;
                       cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Documentation of irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy,&#xD;

                       chemotherapy-induced menopause with &gt; 1 year interval since last menses&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Amenorrhoeic for 12 months and serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),&#xD;
                       luteinizing hormone (LH) and plasma oestradiol levels in the postmenopausal&#xD;
                       range for the institution for women under 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and able to&#xD;
                            comply with the protocol for the duration of the study including&#xD;
                            undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
