  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery for digestive cancers is managed according to quality standards, validated by the&#xD;
      scientific community. Despite the diffusion of these standards through the benchmarks of good&#xD;
      practice, the results of the surgery remain disparate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In many countries, this &quot;inequality of opportunity&quot; has justified the establishment of&#xD;
      quality assurance systems to measure the results of surgery for one or more localizations of&#xD;
      digestive cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These surgical audit experiments have shown a positive, rapid and cost-effective impact on&#xD;
      complication rates, recurrence rates and overall survival even in the absence of&#xD;
      interventional measures. The data collected also helped to improve the management of&#xD;
      subgroups of patients usually excluded from clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Morocco, the National Cancer Prevention and Control Plan provides for the establishment of&#xD;
      a quality assurance system with the introduction of a system for monitoring and evaluating&#xD;
      the care of patients. This pilot project is part of this framework, for the group of patients&#xD;
      who are candidates for surgery for digestive cancers.&#xD;
