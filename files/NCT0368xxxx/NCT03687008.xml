  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) (10 males and 10 females) with mild to&#xD;
      moderate cognitive impairment will participate in a total of 25 computer-based working memory&#xD;
      training sessions, each 30-40 minutes (5 days a week for 5 weeks) supervised by a trained&#xD;
      coach. Primary objective is to evaluate the impact of the Cogmed intervention on working&#xD;
      memory scores and the secondary objective to assess brain tissue changes with magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) techniques, measures of mean&#xD;
      diffusivity pre- and post-intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) show brain injuries in sites&#xD;
      (hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and frontal cortices) that are associated with&#xD;
      cognitive deficits, in particular working memory. A key component of cognition, and thus, an&#xD;
      important influence on academic performance, self-care ability, quality of life, and&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality, is working memory. However, it is unclear whether cognition, as well&#xD;
      as brain tissue integrity can be improved with cognition intervention. Among available&#xD;
      interventions, a possible intervention to improve working memory and brain status in SVHD is&#xD;
      Cogmed®, which is an interactive, computer-based intervention, specifically designed for&#xD;
      children and young adults, to improve attention and working memory with significant&#xD;
      effectiveness in other pediatric conditions associated with brain injury. A unique feature of&#xD;
      the Cogmed ® program is the in-home support of trained coaches for the duration of the&#xD;
      intervention (5 days/week for 5 weeks), which optimizes adherence and confirms completion of&#xD;
      the tasks. The investigators will use a one group pre- post-intervention design, 20 subjects&#xD;
      (10 males and 10 females), with inclusion criteria: 14-18 years of age, have undergone&#xD;
      surgical palliation, and score 25-10 (mild to moderate cognitive impairment) on the Montreal&#xD;
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) screener. Using non-invasive brain magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) procedures, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based mean diffusivity (MD), an MRI measure&#xD;
      of tissue integrity, can identify changes in the hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus,&#xD;
      and frontal cortices pre- and post- cognitive intervention. Therefore, the specific aims of&#xD;
      this proposal are to: 1) examine the impact of Cogmed® intervention on working memory&#xD;
      (working memory index [WMI] score from the WRAML2) in adolescents with SVHD (pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention); 2) assess the effect of Cogmed® on brain structural integrity (DTI-based&#xD;
      MD procedures) in sites that control memory (hippocampus, mammillary bodies, thalamus, and&#xD;
      frontal cortices) in adolescents with SVHD (pre- and post-intervention); and 3) examine if&#xD;
      there is an impact of the Cogmed® intervention on cognition and brain tissue integrity based&#xD;
      on sex in SVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, SVHD adolescents have significant cognitive deficits that are linked to brain&#xD;
      injury in regions, which control such functions. Intervention to improve cognition and brain&#xD;
      injury in SVHD is unclear, but a potential innovative treatment for such symptoms and brain&#xD;
      injury is Cogmed®. The information from this pilot study has the potential to revolutionize&#xD;
      the clinical treatment specific to cognitive deficits in SVHD and other types of congenital&#xD;
      heart defects. In addition, the clinical implications are considerable as improved working&#xD;
      memory skill has the potential to increase academic achievement, improve self-care, reduce&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity, and increase quality of life in this high risk, growing population.&#xD;
