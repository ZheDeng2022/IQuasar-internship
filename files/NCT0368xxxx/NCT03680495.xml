  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease caused by cigarette smoke that&#xD;
      affects millions of people. In the United States, COPD is the 3rd leading cause of death&#xD;
      making it one of our most important public health problems. Some people with COPD get disease&#xD;
      flares that are called acute exacerbations of COPD - or AECOPDs for short. When people get an&#xD;
      AECOPD they experience increased shortness of breath, wheezing and cough; symptoms that often&#xD;
      require urgent or emergent treatment by healthcare providers. In the most severe,&#xD;
      life-threatening situations, people with AECOPDs are put on a ventilator in the emergency&#xD;
      department and admitted to the intensive care unit. Most AECOPDs can be treated with low&#xD;
      doses of medications called steroids. This is good because high doses of steroids can cause&#xD;
      unwanted side effects. Unfortunately, recent studies suggest that the sickest people, those&#xD;
      admitted to the intensive care unit needing ventilator support, need higher doses of steroids&#xD;
      because they may have resistance to these important medications. The investigators are&#xD;
      studying steroid resistance during very severe AECOPDs so that we can eventually develop&#xD;
      better and safer therapies for these vulnerable people.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a cigarette smoke-induced disease of the&#xD;
      lungs that affects millions of people in the United States and worldwide. COPD is the 3rd&#xD;
      leading cause of death, making it one our most important public health problems. Perhaps most&#xD;
      importantly, COPD confines many people to their homes, tethers them to oxygen lines, and&#xD;
      destroys their independence. Like many diseases of chronic inflammation, the course of COPD&#xD;
      is marred by intermittent disease flares that need more intensive treatment. In COPD, disease&#xD;
      flares are called acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPDs). AECOPDs are characterized by&#xD;
      increased shortness of breath, wheezing or cough that leads to urgent, and sometimes&#xD;
      emergent, treatment with inhaled bronchodilators, antibiotics and steroids. AECOPDs can be&#xD;
      devastating to many because they worsen quality of life and lung function, frequently lead to&#xD;
      hospitalization, and increase the risk of death. For instance, the death rate can reach&#xD;
      25-30% when COPD patients are admitted to the intensive care unit with respiratory failure&#xD;
      (i.e. needing ventilator support). Accordingly, our research is focused on improving outcomes&#xD;
      in the sickest patients admitted to the hospital with an AECOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral or intravenous steroids (glucocorticoids) have been the mainstay of treatment for over&#xD;
      40 years, but virtually no research has been done to determine the optimal therapy for the&#xD;
      sickest patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit. Results from the few clinical&#xD;
      studies suggest that steroid resistance is increased in these critically-ill patients and&#xD;
      that many physicians under- or over-dose steroids. For example, patients hospitalized with an&#xD;
      AECOPD (without respiratory failure) are effectively treated with steroids (such as&#xD;
      prednisone) dosed as low as 40mg/day. In contrast, two recent clinical studies showed that&#xD;
      ~80mg/day of prednisone was ineffective for AECOPD patients hospitalized with respiratory&#xD;
      failure (those who require ventilatory support), while in a second study ~160mg/day of&#xD;
      methylprednisolone improved outcomes. The investigators recent epidemiologic study showed&#xD;
      that 66% of patients admitted with an AECOPD and respiratory failure between 2003-2008 were&#xD;
      treated with &gt;240mg/day of methylprednisolone, a dose that increases steroid-related side&#xD;
      effects. The investigators hypothesize that there is a stepwise increase in steroid&#xD;
      resistance with COPD&lt;AECOPD&lt;AECOPD with respiratory failure. A newly launched team of&#xD;
      investigators is focused on establishing the presence of steroid resistance, defining the&#xD;
      cause(s), devising new treatments to combat this problem and optimizing therapy for these&#xD;
      vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steroids suppress inflammation by inducing anti-inflammatory genes, such as the&#xD;
      dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family - including DUSP1. DUSP1 inhibits inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines by removing phosphates from p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated&#xD;
      protein kinases, which turns them off. Preliminary data show that DUSP1 is decreased in&#xD;
      alveolar macrophages from COPD patients, suggesting the central hypothesis that steroid&#xD;
      resistance is increased in AECOPDs with respiratory failure due to impaired&#xD;
      glucocorticoid-mediated induction of DUSP1. To address this hypothesis, the investigators&#xD;
      will inject 23 AECOPD patients with respiratory failure and 23 matched stable COPD subjects&#xD;
      with 60mg of methylprednisolone to: 1) determine the presence of corticosteroid resistance in&#xD;
      AECOPDs, 2) determine the role of DUSP1, and 3) examine alternative mechanisms driving&#xD;
      steroid resistance. The goal of The AECOPD Resistance Study is to identify targets associated&#xD;
      with steroid resistance in AECOPDs with respiratory failure to pave the way for new&#xD;
      treatments based upon novel mechanisms.&#xD;
