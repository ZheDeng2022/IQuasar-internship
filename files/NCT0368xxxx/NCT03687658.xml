      This study will evaluate the extent to which we can engage and manipulate putative targets&#xD;
      within the self-regulation domain within and outside of laboratory settings in samples of&#xD;
      smokers and overweight/obese individuals with binge eating disorder. This is the fourth phase&#xD;
      of a study that aims to identify putative mechanisms of behavior change to develop an&#xD;
      overarching &quot;ontology&quot; of self-regulatory processes.&#xD;

    <measure>Binge eating episodes [binge eating sample only]</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>[Binge eating sample only] Self-reported binge eating episodes is assessed four times daily (morning, early afternoon, late afternoon/evening, and night) over a 28-day period. A binge eating episode is defined as self-reported overeating and loss of control. Overeating is assessed by the question &quot;Since the last prompt, when you ate most recently, did you overeat?&quot; and is scored as 0 (no) or 1 (yes). Loss of control is assessed by the question &quot;When you ate most recently, did you lose control over your eating?&quot; and is scored as 1 (not at all) to 5 (totally), where a 4 or 5 is considered loss of control.</description>

    <description>[Smoking sample only] Self-reported smoking assessed four times daily (morning, early afternoon, late afternoon/evening, and night) over a 28-day period. A smoking episode is defined as self-reported smoking of more than zero cigarettes and is assessed by the question &quot;Since the last prompt, how many cigarettes have you smoked?&quot; Participants are asked to input a number into a number field.</description>

    <description>Laddr is an integrated, personalized, web-based self-regulation assessment and behavior change system. It integrates tools that have been shown to be effective for a wide array of behavioral phenomena ranging from substance use and abuse, mental health, risk-taking, chronic pain management, medication adherence, diet, exercise, diabetes and other chronic disease management, and smoking. The organizational structure, functionality and content within Laddr's system centrally embrace these fundamental aspects of behavior change; thus, the Laddr platform is not &quot;diagnosis-specific&quot; but rather enables integrated care for any combination of individuals' goals, needs, and preferences.</description>
