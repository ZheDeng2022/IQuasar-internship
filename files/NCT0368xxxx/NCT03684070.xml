  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of physical activity (PA) for healthy aging are well known; however &lt; 16% of&#xD;
      U.S. older adults meet the federal recommendations for moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Asian&#xD;
      Americans (AA) are a fast-growing segment of the older adult U.S. population and are likely&#xD;
      to have limited English proficiency, lower-incomes, and low PA levels. Older AA adults are&#xD;
      under represented in clinical trials and as a result, evidence-based PA programs remain&#xD;
      inaccessible. Similarly, while the number of PA interventions for older adults incorporating&#xD;
      technology to promote and sustain behavior change is increasing, the applicability and&#xD;
      efficacy of these approaches for AA is poorly understood. Thus, there is a critical need to&#xD;
      develop and test innovative PA interventions for this at-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a culturally and linguistically adapted&#xD;
      community-based walking program enhanced with a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered&#xD;
      via WeChat - a widely used Chinese social networking application - (enhanced walking)&#xD;
      improves physical activity compared with walking only. Secondary objectives are to identify&#xD;
      participant experiences in engaging in this platform to improve PA, and gain insights into&#xD;
      the scalability of the intervention for future pivotal trials. The proposed research is a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled trial that will recruit 60 community-dwelling Chinese older adults.&#xD;
      The primary outcomes are PA (measured by FitBit step counts over time, and proportion meeting&#xD;
      federal recommendations for moderate physical activity (MPA)). Secondary outcomes include&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, and patient-reported experience measures. We aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      acceptability of this enhanced program, and determine the feasibility of WeChat as a platform&#xD;
      for increasing PA. The primary outcome will be analyzed using mixed effects ANOVA, and latent&#xD;
      growth curve modeling. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using linear regression.&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants upon program completion to&#xD;
      identify contextual factors influencing application use, and thematic analysis will be used&#xD;
      to examine relationships between these key factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide information about the applicability of mobile technology&#xD;
      in supporting PA improvement among older Chinese, and valuable insight on contextual factors&#xD;
      influencing application effectiveness, which will inform the potential for adoption and&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

      Implementation will be conducted at a single site, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent&#xD;
      Association of New England (CCA)). All subjects will consent to participate prior to&#xD;
      continuing with study involvement as documented below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A convenience sample of a maximum of 60 participants (30 people per arm) will be recruited by&#xD;
      placing ads in local newspapers, flyers at CBOs, local businesses, WeChat, and word of mouth.&#xD;
      Interested individuals will call a dedicated voicemail box at Boston College and leave their&#xD;
      contact information. A trained, bilingual member of the research team will contact interested&#xD;
      individuals to obtain verbal consent for administration of the preliminary screening tool. If&#xD;
      preliminary inclusion criteria are met, participants will be invited to an in-person&#xD;
      secondary screening, where if deemed eligible to participate, signed informed consent for&#xD;
      overall study participation will be obtained by a trained member of the study team in the&#xD;
      participants' preferred language of communication (Mandarin or English). A $50 gift card will&#xD;
      be offered to all enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation: After the consenting and initial (baseline) survey administration, assignment&#xD;
      to the experimental or control group will be determined using a randomization list generated&#xD;
      by a random number generator in R software. Both groups will meet on separate days and times&#xD;
      to avoid contamination effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will attend an orientation session to provide hands-on training on using the&#xD;
      FitBit, and social networking platform (SNS) (as applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2-week tech calibration period with one-on-one training with study staff will allow&#xD;
      participants to acclimate to the FitBit, learn to use its features, and ask questions.&#xD;
      Baseline FitBit data will be collected and monitored via Fitabase (a widely used and secure,&#xD;
      research data management platform specific to FitBit data). This baseline data will allow the&#xD;
      PI to generate an individualized walking prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this instructional trial period, all participants will be instructed to use the&#xD;
      step-tracker's features to monitor their daily steps and progress towards meeting their&#xD;
      individualized walking goals. All participants will attend 8 weekly educational sessions at&#xD;
      the community center. Each day, those in the Enhanced Walking condition will receive 1-3&#xD;
      motivational messages related to physical activity and health; a monitoring protocol and&#xD;
      database to document SNS interactions will be established. The Walking Only condition will&#xD;
      not receive motivational messages through the SNS platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be administered at study completion (8 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). FitBit&#xD;
      data will be continually monitored throughout the study duration. A weekly adverse&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered by study staff in-person or via telephone when&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up outcomes: At the end of the study, participants from the experimental arm will be&#xD;
      asked to attend a post-participation session where they will participate in a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview to glean their experiences in using the SNS platform to promote physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured interview questions will be posed to all clients who volunteer to participate&#xD;
      in an interview session as part of the study. The interviews will be held at 4 weeks after&#xD;
      the end of the study period. Interview questions and prompts were developed through a&#xD;
      phenomenological lens to allow clients to elicit their own responses and experiences in the&#xD;
      study. The interview guide will frame this discussion, and participant responses may be&#xD;
      probed to gain further clarity or insight. The interviews will be audio recorded by study&#xD;
      staff. Study staff will also write field notes to document client responses and other&#xD;
      observations to supplement and provide context for the transcripts.&#xD;
