  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, two-arm randomized, blinded pivotal study to demonstrate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the LUM Imaging System (LUM015 imaging agent in conjunction with the LUM&#xD;
      Imaging Device and decision software), in identifying residual cancer in the lumpectomy bed&#xD;
      of female breast cancer patients undergoing breast surgery in order to assist surgeons in&#xD;
      reducing the rates of positive margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All enrolled subjects will be injected with LUM015 prior to surgery. Surgeons are blinded to&#xD;
      whether a participant will be randomized into the device arm until after the standard of care&#xD;
      lumpectomy is complete. Participants will then be randomized to receiving the device.&#xD;
      Therapeutic (Lumicell guided) shaves will be removed based on the guidance of the LUM Imaging&#xD;
      System. Patients will be followed until their first standard of care post-operative follow-up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will be injected with LUM015. The injection of the study drug will occur 2-6&#xD;
      hours prior to surgery at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. Surgeons will complete the standard of care&#xD;
      lumpectomy. Prior to removing any shaves as part of the standard of care, the surgeon will&#xD;
      use the Lum System to scan and image the cavity where shaves will be obtained. The system&#xD;
      will not provide guidance. The intent of the standard of care lumpectomy procedure is to&#xD;
      achieve negative margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization of whether the patient will receive the device will be revealed after the&#xD;
      completion of the standard of care lumpectomy. If the patient is randomized to the non-device&#xD;
      arm, than the surgeon will complete the surgery per their standard practice. If the patient&#xD;
      is randomized to the device arm, the surgeon will use the Lumicell device to scan inside the&#xD;
      lumpectomy cavity to indicate areas that may contain residual tumor. If the imaging system&#xD;
      identifies that there may be cancer cells remaining in the lumpectomy cavity, the surgeon&#xD;
      will remove an additional piece of tissue. This process will be continued until a negative&#xD;
      reading from the device is obtained or a maximum of 2 shaves of additional tissue has been&#xD;
      removed in each orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment ends when the surgery is completed. All patients will continue their&#xD;
      enrollment in the study until their first follow-up visit and they will continue to be&#xD;
      followed until the medical team determines no further surgical intervention is required.&#xD;
      Patients who have consented to completing Quality of Life Questionnaires will be in the study&#xD;
      until the schedule of questionnaires is complete. Patients with adverse events that are&#xD;
      determined to be possibly related to the LUM Imaging System will be followed until resolution&#xD;
      or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
