  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 12-week, randomized nutrition intervention for the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk&#xD;
      factors in a high-risk population in the southeastern United States. The primary objective of&#xD;
      this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a Mediterranean diet intervention (education +&#xD;
      extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) and mixed nut supplementation) versus that of an American Heart&#xD;
      Association (AHA) nutrition intervention (education) on serum blood lipid levels as markers&#xD;
      for cardiovascular disease risk. Researchers conducting this trial hypothesize that a greater&#xD;
      reduction will be seen in cardiovascular disease risk factors in the Mediterranean diet&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
