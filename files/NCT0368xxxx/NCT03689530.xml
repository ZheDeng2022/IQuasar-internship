  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 86 million adults in the United States have prediabetes, and low-income Latino&#xD;
      and African American adults have disproportionately high rates compared to non-Hispanic&#xD;
      adults. Structured lifestyle interventions can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in these&#xD;
      at-risk populations and now are widely offered at community organizations and health systems.&#xD;
      Yet, uptake of and engagement in available formal programs is very low. Low-income adults in&#xD;
      particular face multiple barriers to navigating, engaging in, and sustaining involvement in&#xD;
      available programs and lifestyle behaviors found to decrease progression to diabetes. It is&#xD;
      critically important to develop and evaluate innovative approaches to increase uptake,&#xD;
      engagement, and maintenance of gains in diabetes prevention activities. Peer support has been&#xD;
      shown in the investigators' and others' effectiveness trials to be a sustainable, effective&#xD;
      approach for positive behavior change and improved outcomes in adults with diabetes and other&#xD;
      chronic conditions. The study team's pilot work suggests such approaches are feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable among low-income Latino and African American patients with prediabetes to prevent&#xD;
      chronic disease and better navigate their health care systems to obtain healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      counseling and support. However, such peer support models among Latino, African American, and&#xD;
      other low-income adults with prediabetes have not yet been rigorously evaluated. Accordingly,&#xD;
      the study will conduct a parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial in primary care&#xD;
      centers in two different health systems that serve multi-ethnic communities with a high&#xD;
      concentration of Latinos and African Americans and diverse socio-economic backgrounds. The&#xD;
      study will compare enhanced usual care (providing referrals to diabetes prevention programs&#xD;
      and resources) with a model of a structured behavioral change intervention supplementing&#xD;
      enhanced referral to programs and resources with peer support to help link adults with&#xD;
      prediabetes to existing health system and community diabetes prevention programs, to support&#xD;
      their engagement in formal programs, maintain achieved gains, and support participants to&#xD;
      initiate and sustain healthy behaviors to prevent diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention seeks to address the need to test in routine primary care evidence-based&#xD;
      approaches to increase uptake, engagement, and maintenance of healthy behaviors necessary to&#xD;
      decrease progression to diabetes among primary care patients with prediabetes, especially&#xD;
      low-income and racial and ethnic minority adults with prediabetes. The study will conduct a&#xD;
      parallel, two-armed, randomized controlled pragmatic clinical trial including adults with&#xD;
      prediabetes at two primary care centers in two different health systems: Kaiser Permanente&#xD;
      Northern California and the University of Michigan Health System. The trial will evaluate&#xD;
      whether adding a 12-month predominantly telephone-based volunteer peer support program&#xD;
      (UPSTART) to health care provider counseling and referral to diabetes prevention programs&#xD;
      leads to greater improvements in A1c, the weight loss, and waist circumference than health&#xD;
      care provider counseling and referral alone (Aim 1). The study will also compare differences&#xD;
      in reported physical activity, diet, and enrollment and engagement in diabetes prevention&#xD;
      programs as potential mediators as well as autonomous motivation, behavior-specific&#xD;
      self-efficacy, patient activation, and perceived support; and moderators such as health&#xD;
      literacy (Aim 2). To enhance adoption of the intervention by the two study health systems and&#xD;
      dissemination to other health systems if effective, the study will evaluate costs and use an&#xD;
      integrated RE-AIM and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework to&#xD;
      evaluate processes of intervention implementation in the two primary care settings (Aim 3).&#xD;
      The study duration will be 5 years, to allow for peer supporter and patient recruitment,&#xD;
      completion of the 12-month program, and assessment of outcomes at 6 months and at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use mixed methods-i.e., the collection, analysis, and combining of both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data-to investigate elements important for implementation and&#xD;
      dissemination. The study will gather data on how peer supporters, primary care clinic staff,&#xD;
      and patients experience the intervention and how the experiences of participants together&#xD;
      with the trial's results suggest the study should modify the intervention. Using this&#xD;
      approach, the study aim to ensure that the intervention has the greatest possible likelihood&#xD;
      of adoption in both UMHS and KPNC health systems should the study find it has positive&#xD;
      effects on processes and outcomes of care. The UPSTART intervention is designed for peers to&#xD;
      interact and provide support in a way that is autonomy supportive with the goal of enhancing&#xD;
      autonomous motivation and self-efficacy for healthy behaviors. The study will hold periodic&#xD;
      initial trainings for new peer supporters over the study period. In addition, peer supporters&#xD;
      will receive: 1) routine, structured check-ins that will include monthly peer support group&#xD;
      meetings (with option to call in) to allow exchange; 2) back-up support: offering peer&#xD;
      supporters contact information for staff who they can call; and 3) continuing education and&#xD;
      booster training at the monthly group meetings to enrich their skill sets and knowledge.&#xD;
