      The term &quot;CHEMSEX&quot;, short for &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;sex&quot;, is used to define the consumption,&#xD;
      regardless of the route of administration, of drugs or substances for recreational use, in a&#xD;
      sexual context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of drugs and narcotics is not a novelty in sexual practice, however, there&#xD;
      is a change in behavior. Indeed, the advent of synthetic products such as cathinones, easily&#xD;
      obtained via the internet and at affordable prices has attracted a wider audience and has&#xD;
      allowed in less than ten years, the amplification of this worrying phenomenon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The described effects of cathinones are just as powerful as the classic drugs that were&#xD;
      quickly supplanted: intellectual stimulation, exacerbation of the senses, euphoria,&#xD;
      disinhibition, sexual arousal, relaxation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These initially ingested or inhaled products are quickly injected for a greater rapidity of&#xD;
      their hallucinogenic and psychostimulant effects. SLAM (&quot;slap&quot;), is the Anglo-Saxon term&#xD;
      commonly used to describe the intravenous use of drugs in the context of sexual practices.&#xD;
      The subjects are gradually led to modify and increase their consumption, for ever more&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consequences of this practice are multiple and serious: addiction with all the risks&#xD;
      incurred, psychiatric and infectious complications related to the sharing of contaminated&#xD;
      material (endocarditis, hepatitis ...) and unprotected sex ratios favoring the transmission&#xD;
      of STIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, all the studies on the subject concern men having sex with men, and more&#xD;
      particularly patients living with HIV. Indeed, the prevalence of HIV is 70 to 82% among these&#xD;
      practitioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      European studies, particularly in London gay festive environnement, show the increasing use&#xD;
      of these substances resulting in risky behavior. In recent years, STIs have been increasing&#xD;
      and more particularly in the men having sex with men population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No published data is currently available concerning this practice in Reunion Island. However,&#xD;
      an upsurge in cases of acute hepatitis C was observed at the end of 2016 (4 in 6 months) of&#xD;
      which 3 were related to the practice of chemsex (data CeGGID Réunion) and the recent years&#xD;
      have been marked by many cases related to drug trafficking and the arrival of substances&#xD;
      still unknown on the island.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rapid emergence of the phenomenon in metropolitan France and in the rest of the&#xD;
      world, serious consequences that are both psychological, addictological and infectious, to&#xD;
      take stock of this practice among MSM patients followed in Reunion Island seems essential. to&#xD;
