  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) afflicts nearly one-third of the adult population with all races&#xD;
      and ethnicities represented in CVD prevalence. Unfortunately, a disparity exists such that&#xD;
      the black population (BL) is disproportionately affected compared to other groups, including&#xD;
      the white population (WH). While the underlying cause of this disparity is multifactorial,&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction (i.e., impaired vasodilation and/or augmented vasoconstriction) is a key&#xD;
      contributor. As has been previously observed, BL exhibit a heightened vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      response to both pharmacological (e.g., alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists) and environmental&#xD;
      (e.g., cold pressor test) stimuli compared to their WH counterparts. Additionally, reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability may&#xD;
      partially mediate this response. Our laboratory has recently observed (UTA IRB 2016-0268)&#xD;
      that the small blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous microvasculature) in BL, but otherwise&#xD;
      healthy individuals, produce an impaired blood flow response to local heating when compared&#xD;
      to age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and gender-matched WH. However, pre-treatment of the&#xD;
      cutaneous microvasculature with various antioxidants abolishes this skin blood flow&#xD;
      difference. These antioxidant drugs inhibit possible sources of ROS, which, as mentioned,&#xD;
      maybe mediating the heightened vasoconstrictor response in BL. However, this has not been&#xD;
      investigated in this population and thus remains unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this&#xD;
      study proposal is to test the following hypotheses: 1) BL will have a greater reduction in&#xD;
      cutaneous blood flow in response to local administration of Norepinephrine (alpha1-adrenergic&#xD;
      and alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist) relative to WH. 2) This greater reduction in the BL&#xD;
      population will be related to elevated oxidative stress and subsequent reduction in&#xD;
      bioavailability of the potent vasodilator Nitric oxide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collectively, these studies will provide novel data and insight into the impact of heightened&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor responses in BL on vascular function. Interested participants will be asked&#xD;
      to come in the fasted state (a minimum of 3 hr since the last meal) and to have refrained&#xD;
      from alcohol, caffeine, and physical activity for 24 hr. We will first review the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and discuss the informed consent form including an oral&#xD;
      explanation of the study purpose, experimental procedures and measurements, and potential&#xD;
      risks and benefits associated with participation. Prior to any screening/testing, all&#xD;
      subjects will provide written, informed consent. A medical health history questionnaire will&#xD;
      then be completed by the subject and subsequently reviewed by the research team to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. For the qualified participants, to test the aforementioned hypotheses, we will&#xD;
      use laser Doppler to assess the skin blood flow response to local administration of the&#xD;
      sympathomimetic drug-norepinephrine which is an alpha-1 and alpha-2 -adrenergic receptor&#xD;
      agonist. Each participant will be instrumented with four cutaneous microdialysis fibers in&#xD;
      the skin of the non-dominant forearm. Each of the following conditions will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to an individual microdialysis site. Experimental sites will then be infused with&#xD;
      their respective vasoactive agents at a rate of 2 μl/min for a 30 min wash-in period. Site 1:&#xD;
      This site will serve as the control site and will receive lactated Ringer's (saline&#xD;
      solution). Site2: This site will receive 20 mM L-NAME (Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester&#xD;
      hydrochloride, Sigma Aldrich) to inhibit nitric oxide production by nitric oxide synthase.&#xD;
      This site will then be infused with no more than 10mM of norepinephrine to elicit&#xD;
      vasoconstriction. Site 3: This site will receive 10 mM Ascorbic Acid which serves as a&#xD;
      non-selective antioxidant. Ascorbic acid is commonly known as Vitamin C. This site will then&#xD;
      be infused with no more than 10mM of norepinephrine to elicit vasoconstriction. Site 4: This&#xD;
      site will receive a combination of 20mM L-NAME + 10 mM ascorbic acid. This site will then be&#xD;
      infused with incremental doses of 10-8M - 10-2M of norepinephrine to elicit vasoconstriction.&#xD;
      This dose and approach is commonly utilized in these types of studies. After the 30-min&#xD;
      wash-in period, 15-min of baseline data will be collected with local heaters set to&#xD;
      33°C(91.4°F). After 15 min of baseline data collection, the perfusate at each site will be&#xD;
      switched to various concentrations of norepinephrine combined with the respective vasoactive&#xD;
      agent for each site-incremental doses of 10-8M - 10-2M (no more than 10mM(10-2M) at a rate of&#xD;
      2 μl/min for a brief period (no more than 6-min each dose) to quantify the level of&#xD;
      vasoconstriction at each site. The order of the procedure will be as follows: 1.&#xD;
      Instrumentation with membranes. 2. Wash-in perfusion with vasoactive agent at respective site&#xD;
      (each site will receive its respective vasoactive agent simultaneously). Temperature set at&#xD;
      33°C(91.4°F). 3. Baseline data collection. Temperature set at 33 degree C(91.4°F). 4. Switch&#xD;
      to Norepinephrine + combined vasoactive agent (for each respective site) infusion.&#xD;
      Temperature set at 33 degree C(91.4°F). 5. Repeat step 4 for each concentration of&#xD;
      norepinephrine used. As commonly done in these types of studies there will not be any flushes&#xD;
      of Ringer's solution between doses of NE. In addition we will also measure blood flow in the&#xD;
      brachial artery using Doppler ultrasound during resting conditions as well as during a&#xD;
      standard flow mediated dilation (FMD) protocol. This includes inflating a blood pressure cuff&#xD;
      to suprasystolic pressures (pressure slightly above the participant's systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure) for 5 min and making continuous blood flow measures before and after release of the&#xD;
      cuff. This will be performed on the upper arm in the brachial artery. This is a standard&#xD;
      procedure used in numerous clinical investigations to estimate endothelial function with no&#xD;
      reports of injury or adverse events. Subject Participation: During the course of the study, a&#xD;
      subject may decide not to participate in a particular experimental measurement or procedure&#xD;
      and therefore, this portion of the protocol will not be completed. However, all other&#xD;
      measurements and procedures will be performed. This will not affect the scientific value of&#xD;
      the subject's participation as each experimental measurement and procedure provides important&#xD;
      and in most cases independent information.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals (ages 18-35, both genders) will be recruited from the greater Arlington&#xD;
             area to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must self-report both parents as either African American or Caucasian American.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have donated more than 550 ml of blood within the past 8 weeks will&#xD;
             not have blood drawn from them in this protocol. However, if they remain interested in&#xD;
             the study, and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, than we may still opt to proceed&#xD;
             with data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with cardiovascular, neurological, and/or metabolic illnesses will be&#xD;
             excluded from participating as well as individuals with a history of various diseases&#xD;
             of the microvasculature including Reynaud's disease, cold-induced urticaria,&#xD;
             cryoglobulinemia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently taking any prescription medications and individuals with a body&#xD;
             mass index about 30 kg/m2) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant subjects and children (i.e. younger than 18) will not be recruited for the&#xD;
             study. Eligible females will be scheduled for days 2-7 of their menstrual cycle to&#xD;
             account for hormonal effects on blood flow. A regular menstrual cycle is required to&#xD;
             identify and schedule the study for the low hormone period, therefore females who lack&#xD;
             a regular cycle will be excluded from the study. Females currently taking birth&#xD;
             control are eligible, as long as they can be scheduled during a low-hormone &quot;placebo&quot;&#xD;
             week. If their hormone do not contain a placebo week than these individuals will not&#xD;
             be eligible for data collection. Females who are breast-feeding will also be eligible&#xD;
             as there are no systemic or lasting effects of the proposed vasoactive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Given that smoking can affect the peripheral vasculature, current smokers and&#xD;
             individuals who regularly smoked (&gt;1 pack per two weeks) within the prior 2 years will&#xD;
             be excluded&#xD;
