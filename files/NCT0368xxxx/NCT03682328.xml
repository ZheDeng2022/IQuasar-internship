  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral body fractures are a major health care problem in all countries with incidence&#xD;
      1.4%. They are a common cause of severe debilitating pain, with consequent deteriorated&#xD;
      quality of life, physical function and psychosocial performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is indicated in patients with vertebral body fracture, and concurrent spinal&#xD;
      instability or neurologic deficit. The cornerstone of management for vertebral body fractures&#xD;
      without neurological impairment is medical therapy, which include analgesics, bed rest,&#xD;
      orthoses and rehabilitation. In the majority of patients such treatment modalities are&#xD;
      effective. However, conservative management measures are not indicated for every type of&#xD;
      fracture. For example, in older patients with vertebral fractures and cardio-respiratory&#xD;
      disease it is not possible to prescribe bedrest for long period. Moreover, sometimes&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs are poorly tolerated by older patients, and bed rest can lead to&#xD;
      further demineralization of the vertebrae, predisposing to future fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Percutaneous minimally invasive vertebral augmentation methods for cement application into&#xD;
      the vertebral body are a useful tool for the management of symptomatic fractures without&#xD;
      neurological impairment when conventional measures of treatment can not be adopted. Two&#xD;
      different percutaneous minimally invasive vertebral augmentation methods for cement&#xD;
      application into the vertebral body for the management of symptomatic vertebral body&#xD;
      fractures without neurological impairment have been developed, namely vertebroplasty and&#xD;
      kyphoplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty have gained wide acceptance worldwide to manage patients&#xD;
      without neurological impairment suffering from unmanageable pain caused by vertebral body&#xD;
      fractures. Both procedures depend on mechanical stabilization of the fracture produced by&#xD;
      cement injection into the fractured vertebral body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cement augmentation of the vertebral body by vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty was originally&#xD;
      introduced for osteoporotic compression fractures, but surgeons have now applied these&#xD;
      techniques as a method of enhancing anterior column support while avoiding the morbidity and&#xD;
      complications associated with anterior approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mainstay of the controversy between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty are height&#xD;
      restoration, whether or not this height restoration is clinically significant, and the risks&#xD;
      related to height restoration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Randomized interventional study to be done at neurosurgery department, Assiut&#xD;
      Universitu Hospital, Assiut university, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vertebroplasty To achieve a low complication rate, the most important factor which&#xD;
           influences the result of the vertebroplasty is the visualization of needle placement and&#xD;
           cement application. Vertebroplasty may be performed using both fluoroscopy, and CT&#xD;
           scanning to obtain an accurate visualization of needle position and cement distribution.&#xD;
           The monitoring of the distribution of the cement under direct fluoroscopic control is&#xD;
           another crucial aspect of the procedure, independently from the technique used for&#xD;
           needle placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vertebroplasty can be performed under local anaesthesia or a combination of conscious&#xD;
           sedation in most patients, and is therefore particularly useful in patients with risk&#xD;
           factors for general anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is required only in patients unable&#xD;
           to cooperate due to pain or in very agitated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The access path depends on the level of the vertebral segment to be injected. In the&#xD;
           lumbar spine, a transpedicular route is preferred. In the thoracic vertebrae, an&#xD;
           intercostovertebral access is recommended. In the cervical vertebrae, an anterolateral&#xD;
           approach is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The cement should be injected while in its tooth-paste like phase to minimize&#xD;
           complications from extravasation in the surrounding tissues, as the flow characteristics&#xD;
           of the cement change over the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cement injection may be stopped when the anterior two thirds of the vertebral body are&#xD;
           filled and the cement is homogenously distributed between both endplates. During cement&#xD;
           injection, continuous fluoroscopic monitoring is performed to immediately detect&#xD;
           extravasations of cement. In case of extravasation, the procedure must be interrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A direct correlation between the risk of extraosseous extravasation and the amount of&#xD;
           cement injection has been proposed, but, to date, no studies have addressed the specific&#xD;
           issue of the volume of cement needed during vertebroplasty. Normally, 2.5-4 mL of cement&#xD;
           should provide good filling of the vertebra and achieve both consolidation and pain&#xD;
           relief in patients with osteoporotic fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Kyphoplasty Kyphoplasty is normally performed under general anaesthesia in some patients&#xD;
           as proper placement of the balloons is mandatory, and several steps need to be taken&#xD;
           before cement can be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mono- or bilateral trans- or para-pedicular approach is used to insert a working cannula&#xD;
      into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. The procedure is performed under fluoroscopy&#xD;
      or CT scan control. With reaming tools, two working channels within the anterior aspect of&#xD;
      the vertebral body are produced, and the appropriate balloon is inserted. To reduce the&#xD;
      fractured vertebra and to produce a cavity, the balloon is inflated using visual volume and&#xD;
      pressure controls. The behaviour of the vertebral body is monitored under fluoroscopic&#xD;
      control. Inflation is stopped when a pressure above 250 psi is obtained, when the balloon&#xD;
      contacts the cortical surface of the vertebral body, or if the balloon expands beyond the&#xD;
      border of the vertebral body, and if the height of the vertebra is restored. Successively,&#xD;
      the balloons are retracted and cement polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is injected using a blunt&#xD;
      cannula under continuous fluoroscopic control.&#xD;
