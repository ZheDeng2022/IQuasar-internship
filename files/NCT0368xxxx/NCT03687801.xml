  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has proposed employing telehealth in hearing healthcare to improve clinical&#xD;
      care and increase access to hearing services. Several studies have shown that hearing support&#xD;
      can be carried out without in-person meetings and lead to significant benefits for hearing&#xD;
      aid users. Interventions for persons with hearing impairment improve communication and&#xD;
      improve outcomes more than hearing aid use alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first purpose of this study is needs-oriented and the second purpose is&#xD;
      research-oriented. The needs-oriented purpose of this project is to, via a national website&#xD;
      of health information and services for Sweden, provide needed online support to hearing aid&#xD;
      users. The research-oriented purpose of this project is to document the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      online support compared to traditional support that the Hearing Organization, provides&#xD;
      (&quot;standard care&quot;).&#xD;

      Aural rehabilitation The most common approach to hearing impairment is hearing aid fitting as&#xD;
      a part of aural rehabilitation (AR). In Sweden, approximately 50% of those who could benefit&#xD;
      from hearing aids are fitted with them, and nearly half of those use their hearing aids to a&#xD;
      considerable extent every day. Despite addressing the hearing impairment with hearing aids,&#xD;
      many hearing aid users experience substantial communication difficulties that can affect&#xD;
      their performance in daily life situations. This could cause patients to stop using their&#xD;
      hearing aids, which may negatively affect their interpersonal interactions and involvement in&#xD;
      community life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjusting to hearing impairment involves more than just hearing aid fitting, although hearing&#xD;
      aid fitting is a step in the right direction. Additional steps within AR, such as learning&#xD;
      about the condition and providing perceptual training and counseling, need to be included in&#xD;
      order to minimize the negative effects of a hearing impairment on social interactions and&#xD;
      quality of life. These additional steps can effectively be included variously throughout the&#xD;
      AR (separately or in combination, and individually or in groups), they may increase hearing&#xD;
      aid use and satisfaction, and can be performed as an adjunct to or a supplement for hearing&#xD;
      aid fitting. However, even though combining these additional steps with hearing aid use has&#xD;
      proven to be beneficial, most hearing aid users are unaware of and are not offered any other&#xD;
      rehabilitation measures than hearing aid fitting. This deficiency could be due to clinicians&#xD;
      experiencing lack of time and difficulties scheduling interventions in addition to hearing&#xD;
      aid fitting. It could also be due to the presumably increased costs of adding extra support&#xD;
      to hearing aid fitting. These aspects could hinder audiologist's in general clinical practice&#xD;
      from providing holistic care. Thus, the overall availability of comprehensive AR is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internet interventions Online interventions and healthcare information is cost-effective.&#xD;
      Online hearing healthcare has increased in recent years and is empowering for persons with&#xD;
      hearing impairment. Telehealth (i.e., telephone and internet) offers a more cost-effective&#xD;
      approach to hearing healthcare and increases the possibilities for the audiologist to reach&#xD;
      out to persons with hearing impairment. Previous research has proposed employing telehealth&#xD;
      in hearing healthcare to improve clinical care and increase access to hearing services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective internet interventions have four important interactive design features: 1) social&#xD;
      context and support, 2) contacts with intervention, 3) tailoring, and 4) self-management.&#xD;
      Patient participation is central for self-management to be successful. For example, a person&#xD;
      with hearing impairment can apply knowledge obtained in communication training to reduce&#xD;
      hearing-related problems. The role of the audiologist in delivering social contact and&#xD;
      support, and contacts with the intervention, seems to be of particular importance in online&#xD;
      audiology interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose With this project we want to provide online support to hearing aid users. Further on,&#xD;
      we want to document the effectiveness of the online support compared to traditional support&#xD;
      that the Hearing Organization, VGR, provides (&quot;standard care&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The needs-oriented purpose: The project is a part of a collaboration between 1177 Care-Guide&#xD;
      and region Vastra Gotaland (VGR). 1177 Care-Guide is a national website of health information&#xD;
      and services for Sweden. Every region customizes its 1177 Care-Guide. Regions use the 1177&#xD;
      Care-Guide platform to provide online services. The needs-oriented purpose of this project is&#xD;
      to, via 1177, provide needed online support to hearing aid users. The research-oriented&#xD;
      purpose of this project is to document the effectiveness of the online support compared to&#xD;
      traditional support that the Hearing Organization, VGR, provides (&quot;standard care&quot;).&#xD;
      Traditional support (&quot;standard care&quot;) in Sweden differs across and within counties, in&#xD;
      particular in terms of the number of visits and the content of comprehensive AR. The costs of&#xD;
      amplification for the person with hearing impairment may also vary across counties.&#xD;

    <description>The HHIE measures the experience of hearing loss in older people by focusing on the psychosocial and emotional effects of hearing loss. Higher score reflects a higher self-reported hearing problem. Minimum score for the total scale (reported) is 0 and maximum score is 100 points.</description>

    <description>CSS (from the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired) The CSS is designed to analyze participants' behavior in various communication situations via three subscales: maladaptive behaviors (9 questions that analyze behaviors that hinder communication) and verbal strategies and nonverbal strategies (16 items related to strategies that can enhance communication). The 1 to 5 scoring reflects how frequently a specific situation or behavior occurs.</description>
