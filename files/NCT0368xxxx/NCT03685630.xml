  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravenous (iv)&#xD;
      brivaracetam (BRV) as adjunctive therapy administered as a replacement for oral BRV at doses&#xD;
      ranging from BRV 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day in Japanese subjects &gt;=16 years of age with partial&#xD;
      seizures with or without secondary generalization and to evaluate the partial seizure&#xD;
      frequency after switching from oral administration to iv BRV.&#xD;

    <description>Partial Seizures can be classified into one of the following three groups: Simple Partial Seizures, Complex Partial Seizures, Partial Seizures evolving to Secondarily Generalized Seizures. The partial seizure frequency will be assessed using the seizure count information recorded on the daily record card (DRC). The written information will be discussed with the subject in order to ensure completeness and accuracy. As a result of the discussion, the Investigator will assess the seizures according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) codes and record the seizure types and frequency on the DRC.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has, in the opinion of the Investigator, adequate seizure control for&#xD;

             aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or &gt;ULN total bilirubin (&gt;=1.5x&#xD;
