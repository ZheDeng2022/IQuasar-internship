      Phase 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of Phase 1 of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the tinostamustine&#xD;
           conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of tinostamustine for use in the Phase 2&#xD;
           portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of Phase 1 of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tinostamustine.&#xD;

      Study Design (Methodology):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 2-part, international, multi-center, open-label study of salvage treatment with&#xD;
      tinostamustine conditioning followed by ASCT in participants with relapsed/ refractory&#xD;
      multiple myeloma (MM). (ASCT is defined as salvage if the participant had already received a&#xD;
      prior ASCT and undergoes a second ASCT after evidence of progressive disease [PD].) Phase 1&#xD;
      of the study employs a standard 3+3 dose escalation design with the objective of defining the&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the tinostamustine conditioning regimen and defining the&#xD;
      MTD and RP2D for use in the Phase 2 portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safety Review Committee can make a decision to stop dose escalation or explore&#xD;
      intermediary doses at any time. The total dose of tinostamustine will be administered on Day&#xD;
      -1. Phase 2 of the study employs a 2-step sequential design (Simon, 1989). In Stage 1 of&#xD;
      Phase 2, up to 31 participants initially will be enrolled. If lesser than or equal to (&lt;=) 25&#xD;
      participants of these initial 31 participants experience a response, then no additional&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled. However, if greater than (&gt;) 25 participants in Stage 1 of&#xD;
      Phase 2 experience a response, then enrollment in this cohort will continue, with up to 71&#xD;
      participants enrolled. In Phase 2 of the study, all participants will receive tinostamustine&#xD;
      at the RP2D administered in Phase 1 according to the same schedule. After provision of&#xD;
      written informed consent, participants will be screened for study eligibility within 28 days&#xD;
      before Day 1 (the day of ASCT). Participants who have a minimum of 2×106 CD34+ cells/kg&#xD;
      cryopreserved and are otherwise determined to be eligible, based on screening assessments,&#xD;
      will be enrolled and receive the tinostamustine conditioning regimen. The tinostamustine dose&#xD;
      will be administered 24 hours pre-ASCT (i.e., Day -1). On Day 1, ASCs will be administered&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) according to standard institutional practice. Participants will receive&#xD;
      supportive measures (including growth factor support post-ASCT, antimicrobial prophylaxis,&#xD;
      red blood cell and platelet transfusion, and treatment for neutropenic fever) according to&#xD;
      standard institutional practice.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants has Multiple Myeloma (MM) and:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Has received prior ASCT after standard first-line induction treatment. b. Has&#xD;
             evidence of progressive disease (PD), with progression-free interval greater than or&#xD;
             equal to (&gt;=) 6 months in Phase 1 &gt;= 18 months in Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression Free Interval is defined as the time from date of ASCT to PD. c.&#xD;
                  Received treatment with lesser than or equal to (&lt;=) 3 prior lines of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program.&#xD;
                  When participants have undergone sequential phases of treatment without&#xD;
                  intervening progression, such as induction, collection of peripheral blood stem&#xD;
                  cells (PBSCs), transplantation and consolidation/maintenance, this is considered&#xD;
                  to be 1 line of treatment. A new line of therapy is initiated as a result of PD&#xD;
                  or relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), or&#xD;
             minimal response (MR) to salvage chemotherapy, as determined by the International&#xD;
             Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is, in the Investigator's opinion, a candidate for consolidation therapy with&#xD;
             tinostamustine followed by ASCT. (Note that participants planned to receive tandem&#xD;
             ASCT are not eligible for the Phase 1 portion of the study.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has available autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) product with CD34 cell dose&#xD;
             &gt;= 2×106 cells/kg. The product could be from a collection prior to first ASCT or later&#xD;
             second collection. (Note that, although not required, in Phase 1, the Investigator&#xD;
             should consider enrolling participant with a large number of available PBSCs to permit&#xD;
             subsequent ASCT, as participants in Stage 1 may received a dose lower than that&#xD;
             determined to be effective.)&#xD;

             aminotransferase (AST) &lt;= 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 ×&#xD;
             ULN within 28 days before ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Potassium within the local laboratory's normal range. (Potassium supplementation is&#xD;
             permissible.)&#xD;

             24 months before registration and no evidence of active disease shall be documented&#xD;
             since then.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 3 centers in the United States between 15 October 2018 and 17 April 2019.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 6 participants were enrolled and received study drug in Phase 1. Study was early terminated during Phase 1 due to sponsor decision on 17 April 2019 (adverse events limited administration of higher doses required to achieve myeoblative conditioning necessary in this population). Hence, no participants were enrolled in Phase 2 and efficacy analysis were not performed in the both Phase 1 and 2.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>AUC0-12h was defined as area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 12 hours. Tinostamustine (EDO-S101) and its metabolites included M2-EDO-S101 and M8-EDO-S101.</description>

The study was early terminated on 17 April 2019, due to safety signals during Phase 1, participants were not enrolled in Phase 2. Here, number analyzed refers to the number of participants with available data for each specified category.</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Study was early terminated during Phase 1 due to sponsor decision on 17 April 2019 (adverse events limited administration of higher doses required to achieve myeloablative conditioning necessary in this population).
