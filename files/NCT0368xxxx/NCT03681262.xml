  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 100 million Americans suffer from chronic pain resulting in annual cost of roughly $635&#xD;
      billion. Limited treatments are available for this widespread disease. The data supporting&#xD;
      these treatments lack generalizability to patients with more serious medical and&#xD;
      psychological comorbidities who are often excluded from explanatory efficacy trials. This&#xD;
      study aims to integrate randomized comparative effectiveness research with patient care. The&#xD;
      investigators will randomize the patients and collect data using an open-source learning&#xD;
      healthcare system already in use in the department to monitor patients' progress:&#xD;
      Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry (CHOIR). CHOIR uses the National Institute&#xD;
      of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System item banks for comparative&#xD;
      metrics through computer adaptive testing. The investigators will leverage the advantage of&#xD;
      this novel system to compare effectiveness of high frequency and burst spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation in improving pain and function in patients with chronic back and/or leg pain.&#xD;
      Spinal cord stimulation is an effective treatment for chronic pain resulting in &gt;50% pain&#xD;
      relief in about half of the patients. Novel waveforms for spinal cord stimulation - high&#xD;
      frequency and burst - increased the efficacy of this treatment even further. However, there&#xD;
      is lack of data guiding decision making of the clinicians in choosing the best waveform in&#xD;
      treating the patients with chronic pain. The proposed study will provide the clinicians with&#xD;
      this evidence. Currently, data about safety and efficacy of these two novel waveforms is&#xD;
      available for up to 24 months. The proposed research will provide data about effectiveness of&#xD;
      these two modalities for at least 36 months. Moreover, this study will evaluate feasibility&#xD;
      of integrating randomized comparative effectiveness research with patient care in Stanford&#xD;
      Pain Management subspecialty clinic. CHOIR can then be applied for numerous future trials to&#xD;
      advance knowledge in perioperative and pain medicine.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing to compare the effectiveness of high frequency and burst&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic back and/or leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than one hundred million Americans suffer from chronic pain with estimated annual cost&#xD;
      of $635 billion.1 To better characterize these patients, Stanford Pain Management Center has&#xD;
      implemented a patient reported registry, Collaborative Health Outcomes Information Registry&#xD;
      (CHOIR), since 2012. CHOIR surveys include National Institute of Health (NIH) Patient&#xD;
      Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item banks, a body map, questions&#xD;
      about pain intensity, pain catastrophizing scale, and questions about patients' pain&#xD;
      experience and healthcare utilization. This learning healthcare system also has the&#xD;
      capability of point-of-care randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal cord stimulation is one of the most effective treatments for patients with intractable&#xD;
      trunk and limb pain. Traditional tonic spinal cord stimulation resulted in at least 50% pain&#xD;
      reduction in about half of the patients.2,3 Newer waveforms - high frequency and burst -&#xD;
      achieve 50% pain reduction in 60-75% of the patients in comparison.4-6 However, more studies&#xD;
      are needed to compare effectiveness of these two new waveforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing to use patient reported outcomes to conduct a pragmatic&#xD;
      clinical trial that integrates with patients' clinical care; thus, allowing faster&#xD;
      recruitment of a larger patient cohort. The patient's provider will use CHOIR point-of-care&#xD;
      randomization to randomly assign patients to either receive high frequency or burst spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation. The patients will then complete online CHOIR surveys sent out to them at&#xD;
      baseline and then 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after their device implant. These surveys&#xD;
      will include PROMIS item banks for pain interference, function, depression and anxiety;&#xD;
      questions about pain intensity; and questions about any potential side effects. The&#xD;
      investigators will include patients with chronic (pain for at least 6 months) back and/or leg&#xD;
      pain refractory to conventional management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Comparing effectiveness of high frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      in improving pain, function and pain interference in patients with chronic low back and/or&#xD;
      leg pain persistent more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that high frequency spinal cord stimulation is more effective&#xD;
      than burst spinal cord stimulation in decreasing chronic low back and/or leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' primary outcome is change from baseline in pain intensity at 12 months.&#xD;
      The investigators will also compare improvement in function and pain interreference at all&#xD;
      follow up time points. The investigators will plot the trend of all these measures and study&#xD;
      change from baseline at 12 months. The investigators will use repeated measure linear&#xD;
      regression to compare these measures between the groups at follow up time points with time as&#xD;
      the fixed effect and treatment as random effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Comparing effectiveness of high frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      in improving depression and anxiety in patients with chronic low back and/or leg pain&#xD;
      persistent more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that high frequency spinal cord stimulation is more effective&#xD;
      than burst spinal cord stimulation in decreasing stress and anxiety in patients with chronic&#xD;
      low back and/or leg pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burst stimulation modulates medial thalamic pathway, which attributes adverse emotions to&#xD;
      pain. The investigators will therefore compare emotional response to these waveforms. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare change from baseline of depression and anxiety at 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will also plot depression and anxiety trend at all follow up time points&#xD;
      between two groups using repeated measure linear regression. The investigators will then&#xD;
      perform a similar stratified analysis in responders (patients with 50% or more pain reduction&#xD;
      at 1 year) and non-responders to these treatments; this analysis is to asses if pain&#xD;
      reduction is an effect measure modifier in this relationship.&#xD;
