      1. Title Cardiopulmonary capacity past the age of 40 - adults with either a persistent or a&#xD;
           surgically repaired ventricular septal defect&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over the last decades, the treatment possibilities in pediatric cardiology and cardiac&#xD;
           surgery have improved markedly and accordingly, more than 90% of children born with a&#xD;
           congenital heart disease now reach adulthood [1,2]. As a result, the population of&#xD;
           adults is today greater than that of children with congenital cardiac defects [3] and&#xD;
           consequently, the focus has started to shift more towards the long-term outcome of the&#xD;
           growing adult population. Among the most common cardiac defects is the ventricular&#xD;
           septal defect (VSD), seen as a hole of varying position, size and significance in the&#xD;
           wall separating the two pumping chambers of the heart. The VSD occurs at a rate of 2-3&#xD;
           per 1000 life-births [4,5] and is at large diagnosed during childhood. In the first&#xD;
           decade of life, approximately 30% of the VSDs will close spontaneously[6], with a&#xD;
           declining number closing naturally with increasing age[7]. VSDs that do not close&#xD;
           spontaneously are considered to be of either hemodynamic importance or not. Patients&#xD;
           born with a hemodynamically significant and operable VSD will undergo surgical or&#xD;
           catheter-based closure, mostly at an early age, whereas the rest are considered too&#xD;
           small and insignificant to be of any hemodynamic importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Common for both the surgically closed and the small, unrepaired VSDs is that the&#xD;
           long-term outcome of these patients is thought to be excellent. Patients who have&#xD;
           undergone closure of their defect are considered to be &quot;cured&quot; and few years following&#xD;
           successful surgery, they are discharged from further follow-up visits in the health care&#xD;
           system. Similarly, patients with small, unrepaired VSDs are followed in their first&#xD;
           decades of life with follow-up visits, with the majority being discharged when they&#xD;
           reach adulthood. Therefore, very little is known on the possible consequences of a&#xD;
           congenital VSD on the physical functioning in later adulthood. Recently, researchers&#xD;
           from our institution assessed the physical capacity in both open and closed VSDs,&#xD;
           focusing on the early adulthood, and found a number of physical parameters affected in&#xD;
           patients when comparing them with their healthy peers. In patients in their early&#xD;
           twenties with an operated VSD, a 20% lower exercise capacity and an abnormal&#xD;
           contractility was found during physical activity compared with a group of healthy&#xD;
           controls [8,9]. Young adults, in their mid-twenties, with small, open VSDs exhibited a&#xD;
           similarly reduced exercise capacity as compared with healthy peers [10,11], and in both&#xD;
           open and closed patients, health-related quality of life was found to be affected with a&#xD;
           lower self-assessed physical functioning compared with healthy controls [9,10].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Young adults with open and closed VSDs also demonstrated a reduced ventilatory response&#xD;
           during exercise [10,12]. This led to further detailed examination of their pulmonary&#xD;
           function in a newly completed study on similarly aged patients with either open or&#xD;
           closed VSDs[13]. Both patient groups displayed a degree of limited pulmonary function,&#xD;
           especially in the dynamic measurements and most pronounced in the surgically corrected&#xD;
           patients. Other recent studies have also found degrees of limitations in these patients&#xD;
           [14-16]. However, common for all studies is that the patients investigated are usually&#xD;
           in their mid-twenties with no patient reaching the age of 40 years. Therefore, it is not&#xD;
           yet known whether any of these documented limitations will progress, decrease or stay&#xD;
           unchanged with increasing age. As the group of patients with congenital VSDs grows&#xD;
           older, age-related factors such as acquired hypertension, coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
           other cardiovascular problems will start emerging and perhaps accelerate any former&#xD;
           trivial symptoms related to their underlying cardiac anomaly. How this will further&#xD;
           affect the already found limitations in young adults is unknown. Therefore, we feel&#xD;
           there is an unmet need for a prospective, clinical study investigating how these&#xD;
           patients are doing past the age of 40 as compared with their peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study objectives and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.1 Objectives: The overall objective of this study is to investigate a group of adults,&#xD;
           age 40 or above, who are living with a small, unrepaired or a surgically corrected&#xD;
           ventricular septal defect. Outcomes will be illustrated through an extensive pulmonary&#xD;
           function study performed at rest, questionnaires, two different exercise studies and a&#xD;
           study on heart rate variability through Holter monitor. Results of the two patient&#xD;
           groups will be compared with those of healthy, age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Hypotheses: I. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or&#xD;
           surgically corrected VSDs will demonstrate a reduced pulmonary function at rest compared&#xD;
           with healthy, age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           II. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or surgically corrected&#xD;
           VSDs will experience a 20% reduced exercise capacity during bicycle exercise tests&#xD;
           compared with healthy, age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           III. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or surgically&#xD;
           corrected VSDs will experience reduced minute ventilation during bicycle exercise tests&#xD;
           compared with healthy, age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           IV. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or surgically corrected&#xD;
           VSDs will reach lower scores on health-related quality of life as compared with healthy,&#xD;
           age-matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
           V. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or surgically corrected&#xD;
           VSDs will reach a maximum of force frequency quicker than healthy, age-matched controls&#xD;
           when examined by echocardiography during exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
           VI. Adult patients, age 40 or above, with small, unrepaired VSDs or surgically corrected&#xD;
           VSDs will have an increased rate of arrhythmias and a reduced heart rate variability&#xD;
           compared with healthy controls&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study is peak oxygen uptake (ml O2/kg/min)&#xD;
           during exercise. Secondary endpoints include forced expiratory volume in one second at&#xD;
           rest, peak isovolumetric acceleration (cm/s2) during exercise, airway resistance&#xD;
           (R5-20), diffusion capacity (DLCO), alveolar volume, health-related quality of life and&#xD;
           heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1 Study population: The study population will consist of three groups; a group of&#xD;
           small unrepaired VSDs, a group of surgically corrected VSDs and a group of healthy,&#xD;
           age-matched controls. Each group is aimed at including 20 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1.1 Inclusion criteria: By searching the Electronic Patient Journal (EPJ), patients&#xD;
           born between 1938 and 1978 will be included if they are registered with DX Q21.0; the&#xD;
           International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for a ventricular septal defect, and&#xD;
           if the defect is unrepaired in accordance with criteria from the European Society of&#xD;
           Cardiology Guidelines [5] or is repaired as documented by the procedural code KFHB.&#xD;
           Recruitment of healthy control subjects will take place by means of adverts at the&#xD;
           website www.forsoegspersoner.dk. Control subjects will be matched by likewise&#xD;
           age-groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1.2 Exclusion criteria: Patients and control subjects will be excluded from the&#xD;
           project if they meet any one of the following: lack of medical record, serious&#xD;
           congenital cardiac abnormalities, lack of Danish language skills, severe lung or heart&#xD;
           disease, syndromes, such as Down's, mentally or physically incompetent to perform the&#xD;
           bicycle test. Participants will be informed of the exclusion criteria at the initial&#xD;
           information interview before inclusion in the study. Oral verification is considered&#xD;
           sufficient to verify the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.1.3 Enrolment: Patients who meet the abovementioned criteria, and control subjects,&#xD;
           who show interest will receive a letter. This will include written participation&#xD;
           information as well as the appendix &quot;Forsøgspersoners rettigheder i et&#xD;
           sundhedsvidenskabeligt forskningsprojekt&quot; and &quot;Før du beslutter dig&quot; composed by the&#xD;
           Danish Research Ethics Committee. Through our written information, we urge participants&#xD;
           to carefully read this appendix. In the written information the right to bring another&#xD;
           person to the meeting is also stated. A reply card and a prepaid envelop will also be&#xD;
           included in the letter, with which participants can accept or reject further information&#xD;
           of the project. Participants, who accept partaking in the project, will receive a date&#xD;
           by their preferred means of contact; telephone, e-mail or a letter. At this date they&#xD;
           will meet at the hospital in order to receive oral information on the project. One of&#xD;
           the project organisers will furthermore certify that the participant fulfil in- and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria. After this, they will be provided with the consent form. The oral&#xD;
           session will be allocated as much time as needed for a complete briefing and answering&#xD;
           questions and no interference will occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At all times, it will be possible to obtain further information by contacting the&#xD;
           project organiser, Marie Maagaard Sørensen or Filip C.A. Eckerström. Contact information&#xD;
           will be evident on all material received. Documented travel expenses in connection with&#xD;
           participation in the project will be economically reimbursed. Potential project&#xD;
           participants will be informed of this through the information material.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.2 Study-design: The study is designed as a prospective, long-term follow-up study and&#xD;
           will be conducted between September 2018 and June 2021. It consists of five elements;&#xD;
           pulmonary function tests performed at rest, a maximal exercise test measuring the peak&#xD;
           oxygen uptake of the participant, two questionnaires (one on health-related quality of&#xD;
           life, one on habitual physical activity), a supine bicycle test combined with&#xD;
           echocardiography for the assessment of cardiac contractility and wearing a Holter&#xD;
           monitor. All tests are performed once at the same location.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The timeframe for the tests are estimated at lasting three hours in total. The order of&#xD;
           tests will commence with the assessment of pulmonary function at rest which is estimated&#xD;
           at lasting half an hour. After this, the maximal bicycle test measuring oxygen uptake&#xD;
           will take place, lasting another half hour. This will be followed by an hour of resting&#xD;
           in order to ensure some physical restitution before the supine bicycle test, which is&#xD;
           likewise estimated at half an hour. In the hour between the two bicycle tests, the two&#xD;
           questionnaires are intended to be completed. Following the second bicycle test, the&#xD;
           participant will be equipped with a Holter monitor and will then have completed the full&#xD;
           list of examinations. Further details on each test will be mentioned under section 4.5&#xD;
           Data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.3 Power calculation: The number of participants needed to be included in order to&#xD;
           increase the probability of statistical significance is estimated based on the primary&#xD;
           endpoint from Hypothesis I; peak Oxygen uptake during exercise. This has been chosen as&#xD;
           a variable as it has previously been found to be statistically and clinically different&#xD;
           in young adults with either unrepaired VSDs [10] or surgically corrected VSDs [9]&#xD;
           compared with healthy peers. The results from Heiberg et al are chosen for the power&#xD;
           calculation, where a reduced peak Oxygen uptake in surgically corrected VSDs of&#xD;
           38.0±8.2) ml O2/kg/min was measured along with a mean value of 47.9‡6.5ml O2/kg/min in&#xD;
           healthy, age- and gender-matched controls. It is equally expected in this project that&#xD;
           the older patients, both small unrepaired and surgically corrected VSDs, will reach a&#xD;
           lower peak Oxygen uptake compared with a healthy group of controls during bicycle&#xD;
           exercise. A difference of 80% is likewise expected like that of the previously found&#xD;
           difference with the same standard deviations. A statistical power of 90% and a&#xD;
           signiﬁcance level of 5% are set, indicating that at least 19 participants are needed to&#xD;
           be included in each group. This is considered possible from an assessment of&#xD;
           participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria from a diagnosis-code-search in the&#xD;
           EPJ-system, where several hundred participants were readily identified. We aim at&#xD;
           including 20 participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.4 Data analyses and statistics All calculations will be carried out using the&#xD;
           statistical software Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). For all&#xD;
           graphical description, Graph Pad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) will be&#xD;
           used. Continuous, normally distributed data will be reported as means with ±standard&#xD;
           deviations (SD) or as medians with 95% confidence intervals or total range. For normally&#xD;
           distributed data, the unpaired Student's t-test will be used, and for normally&#xD;
           distributed data with unequal SD the unequal Student's t-test will be used. For&#xD;
           non-normally distributed data the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be chosen.&#xD;
           Regarding the assessment of reproducibility, which will be relevant when analysis data&#xD;
           from Hypothesis V - Contractility during exercise, the Intraclass Correlation Coefﬁcient&#xD;
           (ICC)17 will be chosen using a two-way mixed model for the differences between&#xD;
           measurements to estimate agreements of inter- and intraobservers. Correlation will be&#xD;
           checked using simple regression analyses. A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered&#xD;
           statistically significant for all results.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5 Data collection - test description 4.5.1 Hypothesis I - Pulmonary function at rest&#xD;
           In order to thoroughly evaluate the pulmonary function at rest, a number of tests will&#xD;
           be applied so the entire ventilatory system will be assessed. Below, each specific lung&#xD;
           function test will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1.1 Dynamic lung function The dynamic lung function will be evaluated using a&#xD;
           spirometry performed with the Jaeger MasterScreen Pneumo spirometer by Carefusion or the&#xD;
           Jager MasterScreen PFTpro diffusion system with bodybox by Intramedic. The tests will be&#xD;
           performed in accordance to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society&#xD;
           Guidelines [18]. The participants will exhale trough a mouthpiece and the equipment will&#xD;
           then be able to measure airway flow dynamics. The test will include forced expiratory&#xD;
           volume in one second, forced vital capacity, the ratio between the two volumes, and peak&#xD;
           expiratory flow. The values are automatically given by the trial equipment after testing&#xD;
           and they will be described as volumes and as percentage of expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1.2. Plethysmography (Static lung function) The plethysmography will be performed&#xD;
           with Intramedics Jaeger MasterScreen PFTpro difussionssystem and Bodybox from&#xD;
           CareFusion. The participant sits inside an airtight cabinet where they will ventilate&#xD;
           through a single mouthpiece. At the end of normal expiration, the mouthpiece will close&#xD;
           and the participant is then asked to make an inspiratory effort. The lungs expand,&#xD;
           decreasing pressure within the lungs, increasing lung volume. This in turn increases&#xD;
           pressure in the cabinet, and increases bodybox volume. The equipment can then determine&#xD;
           different lung parametres of which we will measure total lung capacity, residual volume,&#xD;
           functional residual capcity and specific airway resistance (sRAW, kPa/sec) [19].&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1.3 Lung Clearance Index (LCI) The LCI will be performed using the Ecomedics&#xD;
           Exhalyzer D with N2 option for washout, Multiple Breath Washout (MBW) and Single Breath&#xD;
           Washout (SBW), by Intramedic. A flowmeter and gas sampling port is fitted to a&#xD;
           mouthpiece and connected to a flow-past tube which supply tracer gas during wash-in and&#xD;
           remove at the start of washout. With MBW the participant breath trough a mouthpiece and&#xD;
           the equipment will trace the wash-out of the tracer gas. The tracer gas will be NO2&#xD;
           which is normally resident in the lungs and neither absorbed nor excreted by the body in&#xD;
           any significant degree. NO2 wash-out will be traced during normal tidal ventilation with&#xD;
           100% oxygen and with every breath there should be a gradual fall in peak concentration&#xD;
           of the tracer. Wash-out is deemed complete when the end-tidal tracer gas concentration&#xD;
           is 1/40th of starting concentration [20-22]. Hereby the equipment can analyse LCI 2,5&#xD;
           (LCI is defined as the cumulative expired volume (CEV) divided by the functional&#xD;
           residual capacity (FRC), Scond (ventilation heterogeneity generated in the conductive&#xD;
           lung zone) and Sacin (ventilation heterogeneity generated peripheral to the acinar&#xD;
           entrance). The values are automatically given by the trial equipment after testing. All&#xD;
           values are described as percentage of expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1.4 Diffusion Capacity: The diffusion capacity test will be performed on the same&#xD;
           equipment as the plethysmography. The test determines lung Carbon Monoxide diffusion&#xD;
           capacity (DLCO) and alveolar volume (VA) expressed as percentage of expected value. For&#xD;
           the DLCO, the participants will ventilate through the mouthpiece. First they will take a&#xD;
           deep breath in and exhale to residual volume. Afterwards they will inhale rapidly with a&#xD;
           gas mixture containing approximately 0.3% CO, 10% He, 21% O2 and balanced N2. They will&#xD;
           hold their breaths for 9 seconds and then exhale rapidly. VA is the volume of&#xD;
           distributed helium, expressed in body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS) units,&#xD;
           from a single-breath DLCO test [23]. The values are automatically given by the study&#xD;
           equipment after testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.1.5 Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) IOS will be performed using the Carefusion m Vyntus&#xD;
           Impulse oscillometer with SentrySuite software and Vyntus Spirometer. Participants will&#xD;
           perform normal tidal ventilation through the equipment mouthpiece while the loudspeaker&#xD;
           generates an impulse-shaped pressure signal into their respiratory system. They will&#xD;
           breath tidally for 30 seconds, as instructed by our trained personal. The equipment will&#xD;
           then be able to analyse resistance in of the respiratory system at 5 Hz (R5), and at 20&#xD;
           Hz (R20) and the difference between the two measured resistances (Diff 5-20) [24,25]. It&#xD;
           will be ascertained that each test results in at least three reproducible manoeuvres&#xD;
           without artifacts caused by coughing, swallowing, vocalization or breath holding. The&#xD;
           participants mean values will then be used for further trial analysis. The values are&#xD;
           automatically given by the trial equipment after testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.3 Hypothesis II and III - Exercise capacity Exercise capacity will be tested on a&#xD;
           Lode Corival ® ergometer cycle. With the Jaeger MaesterScreen CPX software system, we&#xD;
           will monitor pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange in a breath-by-breath measurement.&#xD;
           During test sessions, heart rate, blood pressure and electrocardiogram, will be measured&#xD;
           continuously. An individual workload protocol based on the subject's body-mass, gender&#xD;
           and exercise habits will be determined before the first test. Participants are initially&#xD;
           examined at rest while strapped on to the ergometer cycle pedals for 2 minutes.&#xD;
           Afterwards, they will perform continuous leg exercise with gradually incremented&#xD;
           workloads until complete exhaustion. The participants will be instructed to maintain a&#xD;
           cycling speed of 60 to 70 rounds/min, not to talk or stand up in the pedals during&#xD;
           testing, and to keep pedalling until complete exhaustion. Maximal exhaustion is defined&#xD;
           as a respiratory exchange ratio of 1.10 and a heart rate plateau or a plateau of oxygen&#xD;
           uptake [26]. Blood pressure will be measured with an arm cuff at every third minute.The&#xD;
           assumed test time is 8 to 12 minutes per test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.4 Hypothesis IV - Questionnaires Participants will be asked to fill out a&#xD;
           questionnaire in order to gather information of the weekly amount of physical activity.&#xD;
           This is reviewed with the purpose of illustrating if the patients are restricted in any&#xD;
           ways compared to the healthy controls in regards to their exercising habits, and for&#xD;
           this assessment, the standardized International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)&#xD;
           [27] will be chosen. Also, participants will be asked to fill out the health survey&#xD;
           Short-Form-36 (SF-36) with the aim of documenting Health-Related-Quality-of-Life&#xD;
           (HRQoL). The latter is chosen based on the need for a generalized quality of health&#xD;
           questionnaire, which is widely used and thus, provides data which is easily comparable&#xD;
           to other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.5 Hypothesis V - Contractility during exercise Each individual will undergo&#xD;
           echocardiographic scans in accordance with recommendations from Dansk Cardiologisk&#xD;
           Selskab [28]. Echocardiography will be performed with the participants in supine&#xD;
           position, while connected to a bicycle ergometer, in order to carry out an exercise&#xD;
           stress echocardiography. Participants will initially be scanned at rest and then start&#xD;
           pedalling at a steady pace of app. 60-70 rpm with scans being performed at predefined&#xD;
           times with a duration of app. 30 seconds. The test will end with either exhaustion&#xD;
           despite encouragement to continue or when a target heart rate of app 160-min is reached&#xD;
           (which is measured continuously throughout the test). This target heart rate is chosen&#xD;
           as echocardiographic recordings lose quality beyond this level due to heart movements&#xD;
           and lung interference [29]. The exercise stress echocardiography is performed in order&#xD;
           to gather information on the force-frequency relationship (FFR), which describes the&#xD;
           property of the cardiac muscle to change contractile force in accordance with heart&#xD;
           rate. Changes in the configuration of the myocardium may alter this ability and result&#xD;
           in a sloping of the FFR in patients with cardiac abnormalities compared to healthy&#xD;
           subjects [30]. An important measure of FFR is the isolvolumetric acceleration, measured&#xD;
           in cm/sec2, as this is not dependent on loading conditions of the pumping chambers, and&#xD;
           holds a high rate of reproducibility. It is especially stable in the face of a changing&#xD;
           afterload, as it is measured in the isovolumetric contraction period prior to semilunar&#xD;
           valve opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
           4.5.6 Hypothesis VI - Heart rate variability Following the second bicycle test,&#xD;
           participants will be equipped with a Holter monitor in order to assess their&#xD;
           heart-rate-variability and possible arrhythmias. ECG will be monitored with a 2-channel&#xD;
           Holter monitor (SPACELABS HEALTHCARE Lifecard CF Digital Holter Recorder). It will be&#xD;
           attached to the subject by the investigators, as instructed by a Holter-Nurse from the&#xD;
           Dept. of Cardiology, Aarhus University Hospital. Participants will be instructed in how&#xD;
           to handle the Holter monitors at home and provided with an information document on how&#xD;
           to handle the Holter monitor and how to return it. They will also be given an incident&#xD;
           journal, where they can register if they experience any symptoms they might relate to&#xD;
           their cardiopulmonary function, with time of incident. This will be used for the Holter&#xD;
           data analysis. Participants will be wearing the Holter monitor for a full 24 hours after&#xD;
           activation following the second bicycle test. They will receive a pre-paid addressed&#xD;
           return-box and instruction to mail the Holter monitor, memory card, wires, and leftover&#xD;
           electrodes back to our institution as soon as the Holter-recording is over. If the&#xD;
           Holter monitor is not returned within the first week, we hold the right to contact the&#xD;
           participant and remind them to return the Holter monitor until it is in our custody.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All data will be made anonymous and all included participant will receive a 4-digit&#xD;
           identification code which will be evident on all subject study data. The identification&#xD;
           list with participant personal data will be stored in REDCap, the legal base of the&#xD;
           university. Data for each participant will be stored in their REDcap file (marked with&#xD;
           study number). All digitalised data will be stored on two external harddrives that is&#xD;
           kept safe behind two locked doors. The study is conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
           Helsinki declaration and Danish law. The project will obtain permission from the Danish&#xD;
           Protection Agency and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics. Data will be&#xD;
           handled in agreement with the personal data handling law and the participants' safety is&#xD;
           always the number one priority during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All examinations throughout this project are free of any risks to the participants. The&#xD;
           momentary strain from participating in the tests is judged as being acceptable in the&#xD;
           light of the importance this project could have for patients with small, unrepaired or&#xD;
           surgically corrected VSDs. The participant safety is always the leading priority of the&#xD;
           investigations. Compensations to cover transport expenses will be provided, but not&#xD;
           reimbursement to cover lost earnings or any type of payment for participating. This&#xD;
           project holds no dependence - neither economically nor in ways of interest - to any&#xD;
           potential sponsors. Granted money from foundations will be transferred to a&#xD;
           foundation-account which is managed by the Foundation-administration at Aarhus&#xD;
           University-hospital, Skejby. Names on potential sponsors will be depicted in later&#xD;
           published material.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Resources:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is based from the department of Cardiothoracic Surgery on Aarhus University&#xD;
           Hospital, which has a longstanding tradition for clinical trials. All tests will be&#xD;
           performed by medical personnel who are trained in conduction of clinical studies.The&#xD;
           Project Coordinators Marie Maagaard Sørensen and Filip C. A. Eckerstöm have both&#xD;
           previously conducted and completed clinical studies at the department. Both are&#xD;
           instructed and educated in the trial investigations and will assist the participants&#xD;
           during the trial days. They will furthermore function as contacts for the trial.&#xD;
           Professor of cardiothoracic surgery Vibeke Elisabeth Hjortdal has vast experience of&#xD;
           both clinical and experimental cardiovascular research and will be the main supervisor&#xD;
           of the project. All necessary equipment and facilities required to carry out this study&#xD;
           are available or provided by the Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, the&#xD;
           Department of Paediatrics and the Department of Cardiology at Aarhus University&#xD;
           Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Prospective publication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project is planned to result in at least one scientific article on the exercise capacity,&#xD;
      cardiac contractility, heart rate variability and extended pulmonary function in adults, age&#xD;
      40 or above with a congenital VSD, published in an international journal. Positive as well as&#xD;
      negative and inconclusive results will be published.&#xD;
