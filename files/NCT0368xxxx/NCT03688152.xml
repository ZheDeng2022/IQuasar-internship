          -  Relapsed or refractory DLBCL, which has been histologically documented, defined as&#xD;
             having received at least 2 but no more than 5 prior systemic treatment regimens (eg,&#xD;
             an anti-CD20 antibody, an anti-CD20 antibody with or without chemotherapy, or&#xD;
             chemotherapy alone) and ineligible for further treatment with standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to undergo pretreatment and on-treatment incisional or excisional biopsy of&#xD;
             nontarget adenopathy or extranodal lesions. Provision of the most recent, available&#xD;

                  extranodal lesion (&gt; 1 cm in longest dimension) on CT scan or MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  ≥ 1 PET-avid lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2.&#xD;
