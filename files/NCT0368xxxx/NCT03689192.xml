      In this phase I first-in-humans-study a vaccine consisting of arginase-1 (ARG1) peptides and&#xD;
      the adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 will be tested in ten patients with metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with an ARG1 vaccine every third week for 45 weeks.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arginase-1 (ARG1) is an enzyme that converts the amino acid arginine into urea and ornithine.&#xD;
      ARG1 is mainly expressed in hepatocytes but different myeloid cells are also capable of&#xD;
      ARG1-expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ARG1-induced arginine depletion suppresses T cell function through the impairment of the T&#xD;
      cell receptor (TCR)-complex. A research group from the Center for Cancer Immune Therapy&#xD;
      (CCIT) have identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against ARG1 peptides in peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients and healthy donors. The theoretic background for&#xD;
      an ARG1 peptide vaccine is to activate ARG1-specific T cells to infiltrate the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment and eliminate ARG1-expressing immunosuppressive cells. The aim is to treat&#xD;
      10 patients with progressive solid tumors following treatment with standard of care agents.&#xD;
      Patients will receive ARG1 vaccinations administered subcutaneously every third week for 45&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to evaluate safety and toxicity. Immune responses will be assessed&#xD;
      using blood- and tumor tissue samples and clinical responses are evaluated using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
