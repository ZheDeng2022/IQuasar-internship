  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is important because there is no gold standard to rely on regarding the&#xD;
      effect of the extraction of primary canines as an interceptive treatment for children with&#xD;
      mesioangular displaced canines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further investigations are needed to assess the impact of extractions of primary canines&#xD;
      approach on the eruption rate or change in position of mesioangular displaced canines by&#xD;
      comparing to non-extraction control group in an attempt to overcome the deficiencies in study&#xD;
      designs of previously published studies.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effect of interceptive extraction of the primary canine on success of eruption&#xD;
      of the permanent canine or the change in the position of displaced canine radiographically in&#xD;
      children with mesioangular displaced canine when compared to non-extraction control group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the patient satisfaction and pain experience during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effect of interceptive extraction of the primary canine on the condition&#xD;
           of the roots of neighboring teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effect of stage of root development on the level of correction of&#xD;
           permanent canine position radiographically over time when comparing unilateral&#xD;
           mesioangular displaced canine subgroup with its contralateral control&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To identify the effect of independent variables on the outcome of interceptive treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial following CONSORT guidelines. Patients to&#xD;
      be allocated equally to one of the three groups: Two treatment groups and one control group&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Extraction of primary maxillary canine only group (EG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Control group - no extraction (CG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subgroup of unilateral mesioangular displaced canine vs. contralateral canine as the&#xD;
           control group Patients' recruitment will take place in Pediatric Dentistry Speciality&#xD;
           Clinic at King Abdulaziz Faculty of Dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to use a randomized block design, with blocks of varying lengths. The&#xD;
      block size will be 6 or 9; the lengths will be randomly chosen, with equal probability, and&#xD;
      the length of any given block will be unknown to investigators and clinic personnel. This&#xD;
      block design assures balanced allocation into the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Based on previously published data (Naoumova et al., 2015); which&#xD;
      found 30% difference of displaced canine eruption rates between extraction of canine group&#xD;
      (69%) and non-extraction (39%). Based on the alpha significance level of 0.05 and a beta of&#xD;
      0.20 to achieve 80 percent power to detect a 30% differences between groups, two-sided&#xD;
      Pearson's chi-square test with normal approximation indicates that 43 patients with&#xD;
      unilateral mesioangular displacement were needed in each group for this group comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the study design with two groups with equal sample size across groups, hence there will&#xD;
      be a total of 43x2=86 patients with unilateral needed in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tooth rather than the patient will be used as the unit of analysis. Inclusion of&#xD;
      bilateral mesioangular displaced canines will reduce the number of patients needed; however,&#xD;
      one patient with bilateral mesioangular displaced canines cannot be simply counted as two&#xD;
      study units in analysis due to high collection within the teeth from the same patient.&#xD;
      Adjusting for clustering within patient of bilateral mesioangular displaced canines using the&#xD;
      correction by Donner et al. assuming intra patient correlation of 0.5, one bilateral&#xD;
      mesioangular displaced canines will be counted as 1.3 study units (2/(1+(2-1)*0.5) (Donner et&#xD;
      al., 1981). Naoumova's study had about one third of the patients recruited having bilateral&#xD;
      palatally displaced canines, so it is estimated that about 30 patients recruited in this&#xD;
      study will have bilateral mesioangular displaced canines, and the contribution of these 30&#xD;
      patients with bilateral mesioangular displaced canines will be equivalent to about 40&#xD;
      patients with unilateral mesioangular displaced canines. These extra (10 study units)&#xD;
      contributions from the patients with bilateral mesioangular displaced canines will compensate&#xD;
      for possible 10% dropouts during the 12 month study period. Hence, a total of 86 patients&#xD;
      (regardless of unilateral or bilateral mesioangular displaced canines will be recruited).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Process and Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (T0), the first CBCT scan will take place and the mesioangular displaced canine&#xD;
      position will be precisely localized in three planes. The extraction of the primary canines&#xD;
      will be carried out on the same day for the extraction groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six months later the (T1) patients of both groups will undergo a simple clinical examination.&#xD;
      At the 12-month follow-up period (T2), a new CBCT scan will be taken if the canine has not&#xD;
      yet emerged through the gingival tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unerupted canines with no improvement in position will be referred to the&#xD;
      orthodontic department for combined surgical and orthodontic treatment to be carried out.&#xD;
      However, if the position of the canine has improved radiographically, the patient will be&#xD;
      clinically followed up until the canine erupts into the oral cavity with a total observation&#xD;
      period of 18 months. No further radiographs will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alginate impressions for study cast construction will be taken at baseline (T0) prior to&#xD;
      extraction, at 6 months (T1), and at 12 months (T2). Space analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      Moyers prediction values .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The root development of each mesioangular displaced canine will be assessed by the method&#xD;
      developed by Nolla (Nolla, 1960).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, root development stage of unilateral mesioangular displaced canines subgroup will&#xD;
      be measured and compared to normally developing contralateral canine that is considered as&#xD;
      its control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The condition of the roots of neighbouring teeth will be assessed according to the following&#xD;
      classification by Ericson and Kurol. Grade 1 no resorption and an intact root surface; Grade&#xD;
      2 slight resorption of up to half of the dentine thickness; Grade 3 is moderate resorption&#xD;
      midway to the pulp or more; Grade 4 severe resorption, with the pulp being exposed through&#xD;
      the resorption site (Ericson and Kurol, 2000)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain experience in extraction groups will be recorded at baseline (T0) after extraction&#xD;
      procedure and at 1 week follow up using a questionnaire that will be given to patients about&#xD;
      their overall pain experience and discomfort .The questionnaire has been used previously and&#xD;
      had acceptable validity and reliability (Feldmann et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will also be evaluated at the end of the study by asking the parents to&#xD;
      fill patient satisfaction questionnaire. Validation of parent satisfaction questionnaire was&#xD;
      done by (Bennett et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both questionnaires will be translated to Arabic and the validity and reliability will be&#xD;
      tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent demographic variables include family history and gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Independent clinical variables include presence or absence of crowding, malocclusion&#xD;
           classification, presence of peg-shaped/missing laterals, disturbance of eruption&#xD;
           sequence , stage of root development and presence of unilateral vs. bilateral&#xD;
           mesioangular displaced canine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome variables include measurements on CBCT in different views following previously&#xD;
      published study which compared the following measurements against measurements on dry skull&#xD;
      and concluded that the linear and angular measurements are accurate on CBCT images and are&#xD;
      considered valid diagnostic variables (Naoumova et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be done using CS 3D imaging Software Carestream Company. The following&#xD;
      measurements will be recorded for each CBCT scan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linear measurements (mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Axial view: canine cusp tip- dental arch plane and canine root apex- dental arch plane .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dental arch plane is a line that is drawn in the center of the dental arch bisecting&#xD;
           teeth present in the arch.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Coronal view: Canine cusp tip- midline&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sagittal view: The vertical height from canine tip to occlusal line . Occlusal line is a&#xD;
           line that will be drawn between the incisal edges of upper and lower incisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angular measurements (°)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Frontal (coronal) view: measurement of the mesioangular angle relative to the reference&#xD;
           line (fixed line that will be drawn through the hard palate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sagittal view: measurement of sagittal angle relative to the reference line Blinding Two&#xD;
           examiners unaware of the group to which the patients belong will carry out all the&#xD;
           measurements on CBCT scan. One examiner will crop the view of the extraction site to&#xD;
           ensure blinding of the other examiner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability on CBCT scan measurements Two independent examiners will carry out all the linear&#xD;
      and angular measurements on CBCT scans. Both examiners will undergo CBCT software use&#xD;
      training by oral radiologist. Both examiners will undergo a calibration exercise of the&#xD;
      measuring technique before starting the trial to ensure inter-examiner reliability. Kappa&#xD;
      statistics will be used to calculate inter-examiner reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification of the use of CBCT in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the principle of &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA); CBCT is justified to be&#xD;
      used to detect canine displacement if the field of view (FOV) is small and restricted to the&#xD;
      area of interest. The American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology supports the safe&#xD;
      use of CBCT for diagnosis of anomalies in dental position prior and during treatment if the&#xD;
      FOV is small (AAOMR, 2013). When the effective dose (µSv) was measured on a 10-year old&#xD;
      phantom, it was found that 6x16 maxillary imaging resulted in significantly lower doses than&#xD;
      other fields. The effective dose on the maxilla with FOV 6x16 cm ranged from 4.7-38.7 µSv&#xD;
      (Ludlow and Walker, 2013). This wide range of exposure profile depends not only on machine&#xD;
      type but also on different technical parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, investigators are going to do their best effort to minimize the radiation exposure&#xD;
      of the patient by controlling every measure in imaging protocols to reduce the radiation&#xD;
      dose. This can be achieved by choosing a small field of view 6x16 (cm), by selecting bigger&#xD;
      pixels size to get lower resolution,0.4 voxels will be selected for the resolution. QuickScan&#xD;
      scanning protocol (seconds) with an acquisition time of 4.8 seconds will be selected . Tube&#xD;
      energy (kV) will be 120 KVP and the tube current will be 10 mAs. The total effective dose&#xD;
      will be around 22 µSv which is in the range of taking one lateral cephalometric radiograph&#xD;
      and one panoramic radiograph combined together (Ludlow et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For primary objectives that assess successful eruption rate: Chi-square or Fisher exact&#xD;
           tests will be used to detect differences in rates among groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For primary objectives that assess change in position of PDC, one-way ANOVA or t-test&#xD;
           will be used (continuous outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The analyses of secondary objectives will be conducted in the same way. If categorical&#xD;
           outcome has more than two levels, logistic regression will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All data analyses will be conducted with the SAS statistical package.&#xD;
