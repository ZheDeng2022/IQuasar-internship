    <textblock>
      Non-selective beta blockers are commonly used drugs for primary prevention and secondary&#xD;
      prevention in patients with cirrhotic decompensated esophageal varices bleedingï¼Œthe basic&#xD;
      heart rate, blood pressure and condition of different patients have individual&#xD;
      differences.This paper mainly discusses the compliance of patients taking NSBB under&#xD;
      different follow-up methods and analyze the factors affecting patient compliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is a common complication of decompensated liver cirrhosis&#xD;
      and the rate of rebleeding after hemostasis is high.Effective secondary prevention reduces&#xD;
      the risk of rebleeding.Non-selective beta blockers are commonly used drugs for secondary&#xD;
      prevention.Clinically, there is a great difference in the compliance of patients taking&#xD;
      non-selective beta receptor blockers.In this study, the enrolled patients were divided into&#xD;
      three groups: the traditional follow-up group (face-to-face interview);Non-traditional&#xD;
      follow-up (WeChat, telephone, etc.);Traditional and non-traditional methods of follow-up were&#xD;
      combined in the group.The investigators collected the basic data before the patients were&#xD;
      enrolled, adjusted the medication dosage according to the patients' condition during the&#xD;
      follow-up period, and recorded the treatment during the follow-up period, and analyzed the&#xD;
      factors influencing the patients' compliance.&#xD;

    <measure>Heart rate compliance ratio after treatment with NSBBs</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>In this single-center study, 83 patients were included, including 9 cases lost to follow-up, 1 case died, and 1 case was excluded from liver cancer. a total of 72 cases were included, with an average follow-up time of 185.3 days.Among the 72 patients who were not lost to follow-up, 40 NSBBs patients had good medication compliance, and 34 patients achieved heart rate response (34/40,85.0%).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Different follow-up methods were used to guide non-hospitalized patients to take medication in NSBBs, and the compliance of patients with NSBBs and its influencing factors were analyzed</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Three follow-up methods guided secondary prevention of NSBBs, and the compliance of patients in the remote platform follow-up group and the outpatient clinic combined with the remote platform follow-up group was higher than that in the outpatient follow-up group (P &lt; 0.05).There was no statistically significant difference in patient compliance between the remote platform follow-up group and the outpatient combined remote platform follow-up group.In outpatient follow-up, there was a statistically significant difference between the subgroup of NSBBs with good compliance and poor compliance, and the local resident patients had better compliance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The compliance of gastroscopy and bleeding of esophageal and gastric varices during the follow-up period were analyzed</measure>
    <time_frame>10 months</time_frame>
    <description>The compliance of the subgroup of NSBBs with good medication compliance was 30/40 (75.0%) during the follow-up period of gastroscopy, and 14/30 (46.7%) after gastroscopy was followed up for sequential endoscopic treatment.Poor compliance of NSBBs subgroup during the follow-up period, the compliance of gastroscopy was 7/32 (21.9%), and 3/7 (42.9%) after gastroscopy, sequential treatment under endoscopy.During the follow-up period, the subgroup with good medication compliance of NSBBs had higher compliance with gastroscopy than the subgroup with poor medication compliance (P=0.000).</description>
