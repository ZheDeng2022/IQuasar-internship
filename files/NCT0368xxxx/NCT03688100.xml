  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this study to help patients, caregivers, and providers make decisions about how&#xD;
      best to manage depressive symptoms in advanced heart failure. There are two evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment approaches to treating depression in patients with advanced heart failure,&#xD;
      behavioral action psychotherapy and treatment with anti-depressant medications. In this study&#xD;
      we want to compare the effectiveness of these two treatment options to learn which treatment&#xD;
      works better.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of BA vs. MEDS, for depressed AHF patients. Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
      Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, patients receiving BA will have&#xD;
      significantly greater improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptom severity as&#xD;
      measured with the PHQ-9 at 6-month follow-up. Significantly greater improvements will also be&#xD;
      detected in the secondary outcomes of general physical and mental HRQoL (SF-12v2), heart&#xD;
      failure-specific HRQoL (KCCQ), and caregiver burden (CBQ-HF) at 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the impact of BA vs. MEDS on disadvantageous outcomes of Morbidity (as&#xD;
      evidenced by ED visits, hospital readmissions, total days in the hospital), and Mortality&#xD;
      among depressed AHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Compared to depressed AHF patients who receive MEDS, those receiving BA will&#xD;
      have significantly less Morbidity (as evidenced by less frequent ED visits, lower readmission&#xD;
      rates, fewer total days in the hospital), and reduced Mortality at the data collection points&#xD;
      of 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in depression, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale results at 6 months follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months from baseline enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-9 is used to measure depressive symptoms severity. The PHQ-9 is a self-report instrument that corresponds with the validated Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders PRIME-MD clinician-administered instrument. The PHQ-9 measures all nine dimensions of depression assessed in the DSM criteria for MDD on a 0-3 scale.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes (SF-12v2) scale results</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month, 6 month, and 12 months from baseline enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12v2 is a 12-item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the patient's perspective.The SF-12v2 assess general physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL), including the impact of any and all illnesses on a broad range of functional domains.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ )scale results.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month, 6 month, and 12 months from baseline enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The KCCQ is a 23-item, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and HRQoL.Scores are transformed to a range of 0-100, in which higher scores reflect better health status. We will measure the Heart failure-specific quality of life as measured by the KCCQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Caregiver burden questionnaire-Heart Failure (CBQ-HF) scale results.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month, 6 month, and 12 months from baseline enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Burden Questionnaire - Heart Failure Version 3.0 (CBQ-HF) is a quantitative survey of 26 questions covering the past four weeks of the caregiver's experience is evaluated as caregiver burden. uses a 5-point Likert severity scale assessing 4 domains of physical, emotional/psychological, social and lifestyle burdens.</description>

    <description>BA is an evidence-based psychotherapy with more than 25 randomized trials showing effectiveness in depression. The therapy group will consist of an introductory in person 50-minute treatment session, followed by 12 weekly telephone 50-minute outpatient treatment sessions, then 3 monthly telephone 50-minute outpatient maintenance sessions. A typical BA session will last 50 minutes and include a review of the previous session and completed daily monitoring record forms, an in-depth discussion of life areas and value, and verbal reinforcement of activity engagement.</description>
