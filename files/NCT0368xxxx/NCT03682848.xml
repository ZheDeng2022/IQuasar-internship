  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First-line antiretroviral regimens are highly efficacious and generally well tolerated.&#xD;
      However, as these regimens need to be taken life-long, there is growing concern about&#xD;
      long-term toxicities associated with these regimens. Thus, there is great interest from&#xD;
      participants and clinicians in unique regimens that might avoid such toxicities by minimizing&#xD;
      the number of antiretrovirals without sacrificing long-term antiviral efficacy. DTG plus 3TC&#xD;
      is a novel, well-tolerated first-line regimen for HIV-infected treatment- naive participants,&#xD;
      limiting the risk of many common adverse reactions associated with other antiretroviral&#xD;
      drugs. Thus, this study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DTG/3TC as a FDC,&#xD;
      in ART-naive HIV-1-infected adolescents, who weigh at least 25 kilograms (kg). The study will&#xD;
      consists of Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of drug) followed by&#xD;
      Treatment Phase (up to 48 weeks). Participants who successfully complete 48 weeks of therapy&#xD;
      and who continue to receive benefit from DTG/3TC FDC may enter a 96 weeks study Extension&#xD;
      Phase. Study participants who have successfully completed both the Treatment Phase through 48&#xD;
      weeks and the Extension Phase through 144 weeks and continue to receive benefit from this&#xD;
      two-drug regimen will continue to receive DTG/3TC FDC in a Continuation Phase (after Week&#xD;
      144) until: DTG and 3TC are both locally approved for use as part of a dual regimen and the&#xD;
      single entities of DTG and 3TC are available to participants (e.g. through public health&#xD;
      services), or the DTG/3TC FDC tablet, if required by local regulations, is locally approved&#xD;
      and available (e.g. commercially or through public health services), or the participant no&#xD;
      longer derives clinical benefit or the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for&#xD;
      discontinuation. All participants will receive the FDC of DTG/3TC (50/300 milligrams) for&#xD;
      once daily. Approximately 30 participants will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infected adolescents &gt;=12 to &lt;18 years of age at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weight &gt;=25 kg at the time of signing the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening plasma HIV-1 RNA between 1,000 and &lt;=500,000 c/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiretroviral-naive (defined as no prior therapy with any antiretroviral agent for&#xD;
             the treatment of HIV following a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection). Participants who&#xD;
             received ART for prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in the first 3&#xD;
             months of life are allowed. Participants who received HIV post-exposure prophylaxis&#xD;
             (PEP) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in the past are allowed as long as the last&#xD;
             PEP/PrEP dose was &gt;6 months from HIV diagnosis or there is documented HIV&#xD;
             seronegativity at least 2 months after the last prophylactic dose and prior to the&#xD;
             date of HIV diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants will be included. A female participant is eligible to&#xD;
             participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a negative serum human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotrophin [hCG] test at Screening and negative urine hCG test before Enrollment)&#xD;
             and not lactating. Female participants who are of child bearing potential and who are&#xD;
             engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, must agree to use one of the&#xD;
             birth control method from 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication, and&#xD;
             until 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication (and completion of the follow-up&#xD;
             visit). Condoms are recommended in addition, because their appropriate use is the only&#xD;
             contraception method effective for preventing HIV-1 transmission. The investigator is&#xD;
             responsible for ensuring that participants understand how to properly use these&#xD;
             methods of contraception. All participants participating in the study should also be&#xD;
             counselled on safer sexual practices, including the use and benefit/risk of effective&#xD;
             barrier methods (example given [e.g.] male condom), and on the risk of HIV&#xD;
             transmission to an uninfected partner.&#xD;
&#xD;

             counts less than 200 cells per cubic millimeter (cells/mm^3) or CD4 percent &lt;15&#xD;
             percent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as determined by Child-Pugh&#xD;

             Screening for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core antibody (anti-HBc), HBV surface&#xD;
             antibody (anti-HBs or HBsAb), and HBV Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as follows:&#xD;
             participants positive for HBsAg are excluded; participants negative for anti-HBs but&#xD;
             positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for HBV DNA are excluded.&#xD;
             Participant's positive for anti-HBc (negative HBsAg status) and positive for anti-HBs&#xD;
             (past and/or current evidence) are immune to HBV and are not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated need for any HCV therapy during the first 48 weeks of the study and for&#xD;
             HCV therapy based on interferon or any drugs that have a potential for adverse drug:&#xD;

             resected, non-invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or cervical, anal or penile&#xD;
             intraepithelial neoplasia; other localized malignancies require agreement between the&#xD;
             investigator and the Study Medical Monitor for inclusion of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who in the investigator's judgment, poses a significant suicidality risk.&#xD;
             Recent history of suicidal behavior and/or suicidal ideation may be considered as&#xD;
             evidence of serious suicide risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with an HIV-1 immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any of the following agents within 28 days of Screening, radiation&#xD;
             therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, any systemic immune suppressant.&#xD;

             half-lives of the test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             test agent, whichever is longer, prior to the first dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any evidence of pre-existing viral resistance based on the presence of any major&#xD;
             resistance-associated mutation in the Screening result or, if known, in any historical&#xD;
             resistance test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality. A single repeat test is allowed during&#xD;
             the Screening period to verify a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute laboratory abnormality at Screening, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would preclude the participant's participation in the study of an&#xD;
             investigational compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT &gt;=5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALT &gt;=3 times ULN and bilirubin &gt;=1.5&#xD;
             times ULN (with &gt;35 percent direct bilirubin).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance of &lt;50 milliliters per minute per 1.73 square meter (mL/min/1.73&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Children who are wards of the state or government.&#xD;
