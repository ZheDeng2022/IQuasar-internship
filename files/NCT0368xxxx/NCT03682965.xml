      TX-SMILE is an investigator-initiated, multi-center, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-group, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability&#xD;
      of an alternative injection site and associated adjustments to dosing and treatment regimen&#xD;
      for allergen immunotherapy with a commercially-available, FDA-approved allergenic extract for&#xD;
      the immunotherapy treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis due to pollen from the&#xD;
      conifer Mountain Cedar (Juniperus ashei).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a three-dose treatment series of&#xD;
      ultrasonography-guided, intra-lymphatic immunotherapy injections over a two-month period&#xD;
      prior to the start of the 2018-2019 Mountain Cedar allergy season in central Texas. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated for safety and tolerability during the treatment period and for efficacy&#xD;
      during the 2018-2019 Texas Mountain Cedar pollen season.&#xD;

    <measure>Average Daily Total Combined Score (TCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TCS is the preferred endpoint for rhinoconjunctivitis as recommended by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Scoring of the TCS is from 0 to 38 on each day that it is assessed. The TCS is the sum of the symptom scores for &quot;runny nose&quot;, &quot;stuff nose&quot;, &quot;sneezing&quot;, &quot;itchy nose&quot;, &quot;gritty/itchy eyes&quot;, and &quot;watery eyes&quot; rated from no symptoms = 0 to severe symptoms = 3 plus the score for use of rescue medications for allergy symptoms 6 points for oral antihistamine, 6 points for eye drops, and 8 points for a nasal corticosteroid. Thus, a lower score represents fewer symptoms and associated need for allergy medication, while a higher score reflects more severe symptoms and the use of medication to treat symptoms. The TCS will be measured during the 2018-2019 Mountain Cedar pollen se</description>

    <measure>Number of Peak Pollen Season Days With a Lower Group Average Total Combined Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed up to 4 months, number of actual peak pollen season days was 27</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated during the 2018-2019 Texas Mountain Cedar allergy season. The number of days with a lower group average Total Combined Score, comparatively, in each Arm/Group are reported. Scoring of the TCS is from 0 to 38 on each day that it is assessed.The TCS is the sum of the symptom scores for &quot;runny nose&quot;, &quot;stuff nose&quot;, &quot;sneezing&quot;, &quot;itchy nose&quot;, &quot;gritty/itchy eyes&quot;, and &quot;watery eyes&quot; rated from no symptoms = 0 to severe symptoms = 3 plus the score for use of rescue medications for allergy symptoms 6 points for oral antihistamine, 6 points for eye drops, and 8 points for a nasal corticosteroid. Thus, a lower score represents fewer symptoms and associated need for allergy medication, while a higher score reflects more severe symptoms and the use of medication to treat symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Pain or Discomfort Following Intra-lymphatic Injections</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the ILIT procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported pain will be measured immediately after ILIT procedure using the Numeric Rating Scale 11 (NRS-11 rating scale). The NRS-11 asks patients to rate their pain on a scale from 0 (no pain or discomfort) to 11 (worst possible pain).</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Safety Score (TSS) for Active and Placebo Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The total safety score is a is based on World Allergy Organization grading for allergic reactions. Following allergen or placebo exposure via intra-lymphatic injection, patients are monitored for local and systemic allergic reactions for up to 60 minutes post-procedure. At each exposure, a score is rated on a scale from none = 0, local reactions only = 1, mild systemic reactions (WAO Grade 1/2) = 2, moderate systemic reaction (WAO Grade 3) = 3, and severe systemic reaction (WAO grade 4) = 4. The total safety score for each group is the sum of the individual scores of each patient across all three treatments (exposures). Thus, the subject may have a score from 0 to 12 with 0 reflecting no allergic reaction to the allergen and 12 reflecting severe allergic reactions, and the TSS for a group is the sum for all patients in the group. The TSS is used to elicit and grade adverse events of interest rather than for statistical analysis.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the safety of ILIT for Mountain Cedar pollinosis relative to placebo control based on the proportion of subjects receiving allergenic extract versus the proportion of subjects receiving placebo that:&#xD;
experience anaphylaxis, or&#xD;
are treated with epinephrine, or&#xD;
experience any other treatment-emergent, serious adverse event (SAE) within 60 minutes of any of the three planned ILIT procedures.</description>

        <description>The TCS is the preferred endpoint for rhinoconjunctivitis as recommended by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Scoring of the TCS is from 0 to 38 on each day that it is assessed. The TCS is the sum of the symptom scores for &quot;runny nose&quot;, &quot;stuff nose&quot;, &quot;sneezing&quot;, &quot;itchy nose&quot;, &quot;gritty/itchy eyes&quot;, and &quot;watery eyes&quot; rated from no symptoms = 0 to severe symptoms = 3 plus the score for use of rescue medications for allergy symptoms 6 points for oral antihistamine, 6 points for eye drops, and 8 points for a nasal corticosteroid. Thus, a lower score represents fewer symptoms and associated need for allergy medication, while a higher score reflects more severe symptoms and the use of medication to treat symptoms. The TCS will be measured during the 2018-2019 Mountain Cedar pollen se</description>

Intra-lymphatic allergenic extract: Mountain Cedar pollen allergenic extract is an FDA-approved, commercially available product for diagnosis and hypo-sensitization treatment of allergies. The labeled use is deep subcutaneous or percutaneous injection. Hyposensitization treatment is typically a series of 30 - 70 injections over 3 - 5 years into the upper aspect of the arm. This investigation is a proof-of-concept study to evaluate an alternative hyposensitization regimen of 3 injections directly into an inguinal lymph node.</description>

        <title>Total Safety Score (TSS) for Active and Placebo Treatment Groups</title>
        <description>The total safety score is a is based on World Allergy Organization grading for allergic reactions. Following allergen or placebo exposure via intra-lymphatic injection, patients are monitored for local and systemic allergic reactions for up to 60 minutes post-procedure. At each exposure, a score is rated on a scale from none = 0, local reactions only = 1, mild systemic reactions (WAO Grade 1/2) = 2, moderate systemic reaction (WAO Grade 3) = 3, and severe systemic reaction (WAO grade 4) = 4. The total safety score for each group is the sum of the individual scores of each patient across all three treatments (exposures). Thus, the subject may have a score from 0 to 12 with 0 reflecting no allergic reaction to the allergen and 12 reflecting severe allergic reactions, and the TSS for a group is the sum for all patients in the group. The TSS is used to elicit and grade adverse events of interest rather than for statistical analysis.</description>

          <title>Intra-lymphatic Allergenic Extract</title>
          <description>A series of three injections of 0.1 mL (about 2 drops) of the allergenic extract of Mountain Cedar Pollen given every four weeks into a superficial inguinal lymph node through guidance via ultrasonography using a 1-mL hypodermic syringe with a 25-gauge or smaller needle.&#xD;
Intra-lymphatic allergenic extract: Mountain Cedar pollen allergenic extract is an FDA-approved, commercially available product for diagnosis and hypo-sensitization treatment of allergies. The labeled use is deep subcutaneous or percutaneous injection. Hyposensitization treatment is typically a series of 30 - 70 injections over 3 - 5 years into the upper aspect of the arm. This investigation is a proof-of-concept study to evaluate an alternative hyposensitization regimen of 3 injections directly into an inguinal lymph node.</description>
