    <textblock>
      Part 1: The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of natalizumab extended interval&#xD;
      dosing (EID) in participants who have previously been treated with natalizumab standard&#xD;
      interval dosing (SID) for at least 12 months, in relation to continued SID treatment. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives is to evaluate relapse-based clinical efficacy measures, disability&#xD;
      worsening, additional Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-lesion efficacy measures and safety of&#xD;
      EID in participants who have previously been treated with natalizumab SID for at least 12&#xD;
      months, in relation to continued SID treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The primary objective is to evaluate participant preference for subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      versus intravenous (IV) route of natalizumab administration. The secondary objectives is to&#xD;
      evaluate treatment satisfaction, drug preparation and administration time, safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity, efficacy and characterize pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) drug&#xD;
      preparation and administration time of SC versus IV routes of natalizumab administration.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in 2 parts. At the end of part 1, participants who provide&#xD;
      consent and are eligible, and newly enrolled participants, will enter part 2, an Open Label&#xD;
      Extension comprising a crossover analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those participants who completed part 1 and cannot participate, or elect not to participate,&#xD;
      in Part 2 (Open label extension) will enter a 12-week follow-up.&#xD;
