  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess whether intake of baked and then chilled potatoes&#xD;
      over a 24-h period, compared to intake of isocaloric, carbohydrate (CHO)-matched foods low in&#xD;
      fiber and resistant starch (RS), will increase insulin sensitivity, breath hydrogen and&#xD;
      satiety, and decrease hunger and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in overweight or obese men and&#xD;
      women at risk for metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus.&#xD;

      This randomized, two-period crossover study will include one screening/baseline visit (visit&#xD;
      1) and two 24-h treatment periods (treatment period 1: visits 2 and 3 and treatment period 2:&#xD;
      visits 4 and 5). A minimum 7-d washout will occur between the treatment periods.&#xD;
