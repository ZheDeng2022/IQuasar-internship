  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping medications, called hypnotics, are often prescribed for insomnia and are associated&#xD;
      with adverse health outcomes in older adults. Response rates to hypnotic discontinuation&#xD;
      programs are often inadequate, and many patients eventually resume use of hypnotics,&#xD;
      suggesting that other mechanisms need to be targeted to achieve and sustain high rates of&#xD;
      non-use. Current programs focus on the tapering of hypnotics and/or the treatment of insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms. These programs employ strategies such as supervised gradual taper, cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy targeting hypnotic withdrawal, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy for&#xD;
      insomnia. Evidence suggests that another mechanism involving &quot;placebo&quot; effects may be a&#xD;
      viable target for achieving and sustaining higher discontinuation rates. Cognitive&#xD;
      expectancies play a key role in producing placebo effects, which are characterized as real&#xD;
      improvements in sleep arising from psychosocial aspects of treatment rather than drug effects&#xD;
      alone. In this study, investigators are comparing two programs for discontinuing hypnotic&#xD;
      medications-a program that addresses placebo effects associated with hypnotic use and a&#xD;
      program that does not address these effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will complete a 5-year randomized trial, recruiting participants from two&#xD;
      healthcare systems using a three-step screening process that minimizes time and travel burden&#xD;
      to participants. Step 1 (identification of participants): Investigators will identify&#xD;
      participants aged &gt;= 55 years who have current prescriptions for lorazepam, temazepam,&#xD;
      alprazolam, and/or zolpidem for &gt;= 3 months. Investigators will use three sources to identify&#xD;
      these patients: medication lists from electronic health records/administrative data, consults&#xD;
      to insomnia clinic, and referrals from providers. The research team will mail a recruitment&#xD;
      letter (with opt-out card) to patients identified from these sources. Step 2 (phone screening&#xD;
      for current or prior insomnia and current hypnotic use); Patients who endorse a history of&#xD;
      insomnia symptoms and current hypnotic use will be invited for an in-person screening. Step 3&#xD;
      (in-person screening for remaining eligibility criteria (and baseline assessments): After&#xD;
      written consent, the in-person screening visit consists of a comprehensive sleep, mental&#xD;
      health, and brief physical health assessment. Individuals who meet study criteria and agree&#xD;
      to continue will be randomized to receive either the Program A (N=94) or Program B (N=94).&#xD;
      The interventions are approximately 2 months. Following intention-to-treat principles, all&#xD;
      randomized participants will complete an assessment immediately after the intervention ends&#xD;
      and 6 months after completing treatment. Participants will be compensated monetarily for&#xD;
      assessment visits. Investigators will measure hypnotic expectancies, hypnotic&#xD;
      discontinuation, and insomnia severity post-treatment and at 6-months follow-up.&#xD;
