      The purpose of the study will to test the hypothesis that combining early out-of-bed&#xD;
      mobilization within 72 hours of stroke onset with treated by intravenous recombinant&#xD;
      tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) or endovascular thrombectomy (ET) would result in&#xD;
      a greater benefit than standard early rehabilitation within 72 hours of stroke onset with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatments for acute ischemic stroke have evolved rapidly in recent years including&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) thrombolysis using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) and&#xD;
      endovascular thrombectomy (ET). Those new interventions constitute a landmark change in&#xD;
      stroke treatment. Since early mobilizing patients after stroke as early as possible might&#xD;
      prevent immobility-related complications and promote brain recovery, previous studies&#xD;
      supported that early mobilization should commence at some point within 72 hours of stroke.&#xD;
      However, increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemia-reperfusion&#xD;
      injury underlies concerns early mobilization of patients treated with rtPA or ET. Bedside, a&#xD;
      limited amount of research has investigated what specific timing for starting early&#xD;
      mobilization after intravenous IV rtPA or ET would optimize recovery potential during the&#xD;
      acute period after cerebral infarction. Further research is needed to understand whether the&#xD;
      outcomes resulting from starting mobilization within 72 hours of onset for a stroke treated&#xD;
      with rtPA or ET is better than that of starting mobilization later. Therefore, the purpose of&#xD;
      the study will to test the hypothesis that combining early out-of-bed mobilization within 72&#xD;
      hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET would result in a greater benefit than&#xD;
      standard early rehabilitation within 72 hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET.&#xD;

    <description>The Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS): The PASS contains 12 four-level items of varying difficulty for assessing a patient's ability to maintain or change a given lying, sitting, or standing posture. Its total score ranges from 0 to 36. Higher values represent a better outcome and all subscales are summed as a total score.</description>
