      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical response of ST266 treated subjects&#xD;
      with persistent corneal epithelial defects during 28 days of therapy. The secondary endpoint&#xD;
      is the response rate within 14 days of treatment. Failures are subjects that do not&#xD;
      completely heal during 28 days of therapy. The epithelial defect can be of any size as long&#xD;
      as it is measurable by slit lamp. The longest measurement and the measurement perpendicular&#xD;
      to that will be determined and the area calculated. The change in area and perimeter of&#xD;
      epithelial defect from baseline through Day 15 (14 days of treatment) and Day 29 (28 days of&#xD;
      treatment) will be calculated for each subject. The time to complete re-epithelialization is&#xD;
      defined as the time from the start of therapy (Baseline Visit/Day 1) to the Day when no&#xD;
      defect is observed. The number and percent of responders and failures will be summarized at&#xD;
      each visit. Graphical representation of percent of responders and failures will be provided.&#xD;
      The change in area and perimeter of epithelial defect from baseline through Day 15 (14 days&#xD;
      of treatment) and Day 29 (28 days of treatment) will be summarized. Visualization of mean&#xD;
      (Standard Deviation) of the change in area and perimeter will be provided at each time point.&#xD;
      The time to complete re-epithelialization will be summarized and listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject demographics, baseline characteristics and relevant medical history will be&#xD;
      summarized and listed. Data for ST266 administration and concomitant therapies will be&#xD;
      listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number and percent of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events and ST266 related&#xD;
      adverse events will be tabulated by system organ class and preferred terms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects aged 18 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a PED present for at least seven (7) days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The defect may be of any size and must be measurable by slit lamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the Investigator's opinion, the defect is persistent i.e., the defect has not shown&#xD;
             improvement despite conventional treatment such as tear supplements and bandage&#xD;
             contact lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The original defect to the cornea must be the result of any injury, infection, disease&#xD;
             or surgery to the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently being treated with cenegermin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require treatment with autologous serum eyedrops throughout the duration&#xD;
             of the trial. If, in the opinion of the investigator, autologous serum eyedrop&#xD;
             treatment can be safely stopped, the subject may be included in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require treatment with other amnion products throughout the duration of&#xD;
             the trial. If, in the opinion of the investigator, the amniotic product treatment can&#xD;
             be safely stopped, the subject may be included in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject who requires treatment with amniotic membrane throughout the duration of the&#xD;
             trial. If the amniotic membrane can be safely stopped, the subject may be included in&#xD;
             the clinical trial. Note: The amniotic membrane must be removed at least one (1) day&#xD;
             prior to the baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who require treatment with bandage contact lens that cannot be removed at&#xD;
             least 24 hours prior to screening. If the bandage contact lens can be safely removed,&#xD;
             the subject may be included in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject with an uncontrolled lid or ocular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of alkali burns of the cornea.&#xD;

             of the circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with severe lid abnormalities contributory to the persistence of the PED such&#xD;
             as the inability to close the lids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of AIDS or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt;10 mg/day of prednisone) or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive (including Plaquenil) or chemotherapeutic agents within 7 days prior&#xD;
             to Day 1, or likely to receive one of these therapies during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have more than one distinct PED in the study eye prior to screening&#xD;
             visits. Subjects who develop PEDs after the screening visit will remain in the study;&#xD;
             however, only the original study PED will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with bullous keratopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with corneal perforation or impending corneal perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with bilateral PEDs, only the eye with the larger PED should be entered&#xD;
             in to the study. The non-study eye will receive standard of care treatment and will be&#xD;
             observed throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Female subjects who are neither&#xD;
             postmenopausal nor surgically sterile require a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1&#xD;
             visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Epithelial defect was classified as a progressive corneal melt caused by an&#xD;
             immunological process such as rheumatoid melt or Mooren's ulceration.&#xD;
