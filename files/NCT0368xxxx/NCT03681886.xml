  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate visual and refractive outcomes with the use of the&#xD;
      HARMONI™ Modular Intraocular Lens (HMIOL) System implantation, assembly, and optic exchange&#xD;
      in subjects undergoing cataract surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects were implanted with the HARMONI™ Modular Intraocular Lens (HMIOL) System in the&#xD;
      right eye, left eye, or both eyes based on the best interest of the subject and the clinical&#xD;
      judgment the Investigator (Day 0, primary implantation) (Cohort 1). At Month 1 post primary&#xD;
      implantation, subjects were given the option to undergo an optic exchange procedure. Subjects&#xD;
      who underwent the optic exchange (Cohort 2) (Day 0, optic exchange) were followed for an&#xD;
      additional month. Subjects who did not undergo an optic exchange were exited from the study,&#xD;
      except at 1 site, which followed subjects up to Month 12.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UCDVA) by Visit - Cohort 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 post primary implantation, Week 1 post primary implantation, Month 1 post primary implantation, Month 3 post primary implantation, Month 6 post primary implantation, Month 12 post primary implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity of the eye was tested while reading charts at 20-foot equivalent distance from the participant with an optical infinity adjustment of +0.25 diopter (D). UCDVA was recorded in Snellen, with 20/20 considered to be 'normal' vision. A visual acuity of 20/40 means the participant is able to read a certain size letter 20 feet away that a person with 'normal' vision would be able to read from 40 feet away. A larger denominator, therefore, indicates a lower visual acuity. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -90 to Day 0 preoperative), Week 1 post primary implantation, Month 1 post primary implantation, Month 3 post primary implantation, Month 6 post primary implantation, Month 12 post primary implantation</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. The subject was manually refracted to his/her best correction. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was measured in diopters (D) and calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder. A less negative value indicates a more accurate IOL power calculation. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Eyes With Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UCDVA) by Visit - Cohort 1</title>
        <description>Visual acuity of the eye was tested while reading charts at 20-foot equivalent distance from the participant with an optical infinity adjustment of +0.25 diopter (D). UCDVA was recorded in Snellen, with 20/20 considered to be 'normal' vision. A visual acuity of 20/40 means the participant is able to read a certain size letter 20 feet away that a person with 'normal' vision would be able to read from 40 feet away. A larger denominator, therefore, indicates a lower visual acuity. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>

        <title>Mean Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) by Visit - Cohort 2</title>
        <description>A manifest refraction (manual vision test) was conducted using letter charts and a phoropter. The subject was manually refracted to his/her best correction. The manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) was measured in diopters (D) and calculated as follows: sphere + 1/2 cylinder. A less negative value indicates a more accurate IOL power calculation. No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned.</description>
