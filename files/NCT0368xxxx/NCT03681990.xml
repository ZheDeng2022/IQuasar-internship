    <measure>Assessment of consistent efficacy of a preoperative skin preparation applied within a defined coverage area based on log reduction of skin flora relative to pre-treatment (baseline) in each of 3 sampling sites at a defined post-treatment sampling time.</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment sampling randomized as 10-minute or 13-minute post-product application</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of efficacy is measured as greater than or equal to a 2 Log10/cm2 reduction of skin flora in each of the 3 sampling sites, relative to pre-treatment (baseline) log10/cm2, at defined post-treatment sampling time.</description>
