    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some women who had depression in the perimenopause may have mood symptoms again if they stop&#xD;
      estrogen therapy. Estrogen acts in the brain and other tissues by binding to at least three&#xD;
      types of estrogen receptors. One of these receptors, estrogen receptor beta may affect&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. The drug LY500307 acts only on this receptor. In this study,&#xD;
      researchers will initially give you estrogen and then suddenly stop estrogen after three&#xD;
      weeks. Then they will study how LY500307 affects mood symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how withdrawing estradiol affects mood. To test the safety and side effects of&#xD;
      LY500307.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women ages 45-65 who had depression related to perimenopause in recent years and&#xD;
      whose mood systems got better with estradiol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants able to get pregnant must use effective barrier birth control throughout&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first 3 weeks, participants will wear an estrogen patch. It is 1x2 inches and&#xD;
           will be replaced every 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the next 3 weeks, participants will take 3 study capsules every morning. They will&#xD;
           not know if they get the study drug or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will also take a progesterone-like drug for 1 week at the end of the&#xD;
           medication phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 9 one-hour study visits. They will have blood samples and vital&#xD;
           signs taken. They will answer questions about mood and behavior symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will keep a daily log of these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 transvaginal ultrasounds. A probe is temporarily placed 2-3&#xD;
           inches into the vaginal canal and sound waves are used to create pictures of the lining&#xD;
           of the uturus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a final visit 4 weeks after stopping the study drug. They will&#xD;
           answer questions about mood and side effects.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the perimenopause, the incidence of depression increases 1-5 and predicts increased&#xD;
      all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. A role of estradiol withdrawal in the onset of mood&#xD;
      disorders in some perimenopausal women has been suggested indirectly by estradiol s&#xD;
      antidepressant efficacy and safety in perimenopausal depression. Moreover, observational&#xD;
      studies report the emergence of depressive symptoms after the discontinuation of menopausal&#xD;
      hormone therapy (HT) in 5-10% of women. The coincidence of declining ovarian function with&#xD;
      the onset of depression led to the inference that withdrawal from physiologic estradiol&#xD;
      levels underpinned depression during the perimenopause. To test this inference, we undertook&#xD;
      a study to examine the role of estradiol withdrawal in perimenopausal depression. We&#xD;
      evaluated the effects of the acute withdrawal of estradiol therapy in postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with and those without a past perimenopausal depression. Results demonstrated that estradiol&#xD;
      withdrawal induces depressive symptoms in women with a past perimenopausal depression, but&#xD;
      not in those without such a history. This study was the first to provide direct evidence that&#xD;
      estradiol withdrawal is the relevant physiologic trigger for depressive symptoms in women&#xD;
      with this condition. In women with past perimenopausal depression, the recurrence of&#xD;
      depressive symptoms during blinded hormone withdrawal suggests that normal changes in ovarian&#xD;
      estradiol secretion can trigger an abnormal behavioral state in these susceptible women.&#xD;
      These data also suggest that the effects of estradiol withdrawal are processed differently in&#xD;
      some women, presumably by altering the brain network composition or activity that underlies&#xD;
      affective state. In this next protocol, we will examine a possible mechanism mediating the&#xD;
      effects of estradiol- withdrawal on mood symptoms in asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a&#xD;
      past perimenopausal depression. We propose to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a selective&#xD;
      estrogen receptor (ER) beta agonist (Lilly Compound LY500307) to prevent estradiol&#xD;
      withdrawal-induced mood symptoms. The effects of estradiol primarily occur through activation&#xD;
      of two receptor subtypes, often with opposing outcomes: estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, and ER&#xD;
      beta. We focus on ER beta because the beta estrogen receptor is reported to mediate the&#xD;
      effects of estradiol on the serotonergic system and mediate the antidepressant-like effects&#xD;
      of estradiol in the forced-swim test. Moreover, selective agonists of estrogen receptor beta&#xD;
      have been demonstrated to attenuate the behavioral and hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA)&#xD;
      axis response to stress in animal studies. We propose to employ the selective estrogen&#xD;
      receptor agonist LY500307 under double-blind, placebo controlled conditions to examine the&#xD;
      specific role of estrogen receptor beta in the effects of estrogen withdrawal in women with a&#xD;
      past perimenopause-related depression. Depressive symptoms will be measured with standardized&#xD;
      ratings scales (i.e., Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and 17-item&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD)). Results of this study will determine the role of&#xD;
      ER beta in estradiol withdrawal-induced mood symptoms and can provide preliminary data to&#xD;
      support the efficacy and safety of this compound as a treatment for depression during the&#xD;
      perimenopausal transition.&#xD;
