      This is a randomized clinical trial to compare outcomes between the Restorelle® Y mesh and&#xD;
      Vertessa® lite Y mesh for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Vertessa® lite Y mesh is not inferior to Restorelle® Y mesh for the treatment of&#xD;
      vaginal vault prolapse&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-blind, non-inferiorty trial. Abdominal sacrocolpopexy is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard for vault prolapse, and has demonstrated superior anatomic&#xD;
      outcomes compared to transvaginal suspension procedures. Sacrocolpopexy involves suspension&#xD;
      of the vagina to the anterior longitudinal ligament of the sacrum at the level of S1 using a&#xD;
      bridging graft which can be made of biologic or synthetic materials. The graft is sutured to&#xD;
      the anterior as well as the posterior vagina and then attached to the anterior longitudinal&#xD;
      ligament of the sacrum. ). Both the Restorelle® Smartmesh (Coloplast, Inc., Minneapolis, MN,&#xD;
      USA) and the Vertessa® lite mesh (Caldera Medical. Inc., Agoura Hills, CA, USA) are&#xD;
      ultra-light macroporous polypropylene mesh grafts that are intended for pelvic floor&#xD;
      reconstruction, both types of grafts are used to perform sacrocolpopexy. Currently no&#xD;
      prospective data exists on the Vertessa® lite mesh for sacrocolpopexy. It is used by many&#xD;
      surgeons, but there are no data showing that it is as efficacious in treating prolapse and&#xD;
      avoiding mesh erosion in those patients undergoing sacrocolpopexy. Therefore, the primary&#xD;
      objective of the proposed study is to compare outcomes between the Restorelle® Y mesh and&#xD;
      Vertessa® lite Y mesh at the time of laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited from patients that present to the Center for Urogynecology &amp;&#xD;
      Pelvic Reconstructive Surgery in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic Main campus, Hillcrest Hospital and Fairview Hospital, and their surgeries will be&#xD;
      performed at either one of these sites. All subjects will be predetermined by their surgeon&#xD;
      to undergo either a laparoscopic or robotic assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy depending&#xD;
      upon their clinical evaluation. The subjects will then we randomized to either Restorelle® or&#xD;
      Vertessa® Y sacrocolpopexy according to a computer-generated randomization schedule with&#xD;
      random block sizes with the use of the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Cary,&#xD;
      NC). All patients will be blinded to their assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be seen at a preoperative visit, then again at 6, 12 and 24 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. During each visit. a vaginal exam and a complete Pelvic Organ Prolapse&#xD;
      Quantification (POP-Q) exam will be performed. In addition, patients will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20), Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) and&#xD;
      Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) questionnaires at&#xD;
      the preoperative visit as well as the 6, 12, and 24 month postoperative visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy will be performed using four ports: an umbilical port for the&#xD;
      laparoscope, two ports (either 5 or 10/12 mm) in the bilateral lower quadrants, and one 5-mm&#xD;
      port placed at the level of the umbilicus, lateral to the rectus muscle on either side for&#xD;
      retraction. The robotic-assisted hysterectomy will be performed using the da Vinci Surgical&#xD;
      System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) using five ports: a 12mm umbilical port&#xD;
      for the laparoscopic, two 8 mm robotic ports placed 2cm inferior and 9-10cm lateral to the&#xD;
      umbilicus bilaterally, an 8mm robotic port placed in the left axillary line at the level of&#xD;
      the umbilicus, and a 8mm or 10/12mm accessory port either in the right upper quadrant&#xD;
      approximately 3cm distal from the costal margin, or in the right lower quadrant, 2cm above&#xD;
      and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a supracervical hysterectomy is to be performed, it will be done in a standard fashion. A&#xD;
      uterine manipulator will be placed inside of the uterus. The round ligaments will be&#xD;
      transected using cautery. The fallopian tubes and ovaries will be left in situ or removed at&#xD;
      the time of hysterectomy depending upon the preoperative decision made between the surgeon&#xD;
      and patient. The uterine arteries and cardinal ligaments will be cauterized laparoscopically.&#xD;
      The uterus will be amputated at the level of the internal cervical os and the endocervical&#xD;
      canal will be cauterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sacrocolpopexy will also be performed and in a standard fashion. An end-to-end&#xD;
      anastomosis (EEA) sizer will be placed in the vagina for manipulation of the apex as well as&#xD;
      in the rectum for delineation of the rectovaginal septum. First, the presacral dissection&#xD;
      will be performed with a longitudinal peritoneal incision over the sacral promontory and&#xD;
      there is identification of the anterior longitudinal ligament. Dissection is then done&#xD;
      caudally through the peritoneum and subperitoneal fat down to the level of the posterior&#xD;
      cul-de-sac. The vagina is elevated cephalad using the EEA sizer and the peritoneum overlying&#xD;
      the anterior vaginal apex is incised transversely, and the bladder is dissected off the&#xD;
      anterior vagina using sharp dissection, creating a 4 to 5 cm pocket. If this plane is&#xD;
      difficult to establish, the bladder will be filled in a retrograde fashion to find the&#xD;
      correct dissection plane. Similarly, the peritoneum overlying the posterior vagina is&#xD;
      incised, and dissection is then done overlying the vagina and extending into the posterior&#xD;
      cul-de-sac, creating a 4 to 5 cm pocket. Once dissection is complete, the mesh graft is&#xD;
      prepared. Subjects will have been randomized to either one of two mesh grafts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Y mesh is introduced into the pelvis through one of the ports. First, either then&#xD;
      anterior or the posterior arm is fixed to the anterior or posterior vaginal wall using 6&#xD;
      delayed- absorbable (PDS) No. 2-0 sutures in an interrupted fashion, 1 to 2 cm apart from&#xD;
      each other. The opposing arm of the graft is then attached to either the anterior or&#xD;
      posterior vaginal wall, depending on which arm was placed first, in a similar fashion using 6&#xD;
      delayed- absorbable (PDS) No. 2-0 sutures in an interrupted fashion, 1 to 2 cm apart from&#xD;
      each other. The stem portion of the graft is then brought to the sacral promontory and&#xD;
      sutured to the anterior longitudinal ligament using 2 permanent (prolene) No. 0 sutures. The&#xD;
      excess mesh is then trimmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peritoneum is then closed over the exposed graft with absorbable suture. Routine&#xD;
      cystoscopy will also be performed in order to assess for lower urinary tract injury. A&#xD;
      vaginal exam is performed, and an anterior and/or posterior colporrhaphy and perineorrhaphy&#xD;
      are performed if needed. Anti-incontinence procedures may also be performed if needed.&#xD;

      Protection of each subject's personal health information will be a priority in this study.&#xD;
      One master excel file containing subject personal information including name and medical&#xD;
      record number will be kept in a password-protected file, on a designated protected research&#xD;
      drive on a password-protected computer in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. In that&#xD;
      file, each subject will be assigned a subject identification number that will be used for the&#xD;
      purposes of data collection in order to de-identify subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper forms used for data collection will be kept in a research cabinet dedicated to this&#xD;
      project which will be locked at all times, in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. All&#xD;
      forms will contain de-identified information - identification numbers will correspond to the&#xD;
      subjects listed in the master excel file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be transferred and managed electronically using REDCap (Research&#xD;
      Electronic Data Capture). Each subject will be entered into REDCap using the assigned&#xD;
      identification number from the master excel file. REDCap is a secure, web-based application&#xD;
      designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-friendly web-based case&#xD;
      report forms, real-time data entry validation, audit trials, and a de-identified data export&#xD;
      mechanism to common statistical packages. They system was developed by a multi-institutional&#xD;
      consortium which was initiated at Vanderbilt University and includes the Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
      The database is hosted at the Cleveland Clinic Research Datacenter in the JJN basement and is&#xD;
      managed by the Quantitative Health Sciences Department. The system is protected by a login&#xD;
      and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) encryption. Data collection is customized for each study as&#xD;
      based on a study-specific data dictionary defined by the research team with guidance from the&#xD;
      REDCap administrator in Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic.&#xD;
