      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate effect of 52-week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in the extension of survival&#xD;
      and improvement of cardiomyopathy measured by Left Ventricular Mass Index in Chinese patients&#xD;
      with infantile-onset Pompe Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the improvement of physical growth, motor and cognitive development of&#xD;
           52-week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in infantile-onset Pompe Disease from the&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To observe the efficacy on survival free of invasive ventilation, use of any ventilation&#xD;
           support of 52- week treatment with Alglucosidase Alfa in Chinese patients with&#xD;
           infantile-onset Pompe Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Alglucosidase Alfa in Chinese patients with&#xD;
           infantile-onset Pompe Disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total of 56 weeks in the study period, including an up to 28-day screening period and 52-week&#xD;
      treatment period, followed by 30-day post-treatment observation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of 52-week treatment, patients' guardians could choose to participate in a&#xD;
      patient assistance program (PAP) sponsored by Sanofi and launched before first patient out&#xD;
      (FPO) or reimbursement from social insurance for continued treatment.&#xD;
