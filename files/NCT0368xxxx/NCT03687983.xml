      A Prospective, Multi-center, Single-Arm Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the GodenFlow Peripheral Stent System manufactured by Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co.,&#xD;
      LTD. for lower limb artery stenosis or occlusion diseases. A total of 90 cases of patients,&#xD;
      who are suitable to be treated with Peripheral Stent will be screened and enrolled according&#xD;
      to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the lesion will be treated with GodenFlow&#xD;
      Peripheral Stent System under the guidance of Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). Clinical&#xD;
      and imaging follow-up was conducted 3 months and 6 months after surgery, The follow-ups&#xD;
      mainly included clinical symptoms and signs, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and colour Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound, Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA), etc., for the sake of verifying the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of the device in treating patients with lower limb artery stenosis or&#xD;
      occlusion.&#xD;
