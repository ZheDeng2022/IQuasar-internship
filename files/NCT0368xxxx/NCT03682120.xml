    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant&#xD;
      females, 18-64 years of age. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic 2017 monovalent inactivated influenza&#xD;
      A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2017 H7N9 IIV) manufactured by Seqirus Inc (Seqirus) administered at&#xD;
      different dosages (3.75 microgram mcg, 7.5 mcg and 15 mcg of hemagglutinin (HA) per dose)&#xD;
      given with MF59(R) adjuvant manufactured by Seqirus Inc., or without adjuvant (15 mcg of HA&#xD;
      per dose). Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) diluent manufactured by Patheon Manufacturing&#xD;
      Services LLC will be used to achieve certain targeted doses. Approximately 371 subjects who&#xD;
      are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized into one of 4 study&#xD;
      groups. The study will be conducted at up to 7 Vaccine and Treatment Unit (VTEU) sites and&#xD;
      will last approximately 17 months, with subject participation duration of approximately 13&#xD;
      months. The Primary Objectives of the study are: 1) To assess the safety and reactogenicity&#xD;
      following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly (IM) at&#xD;
      different dosages approximately 21 days apart given with or without MF59(R) adjuvant; 2) To&#xD;
      assess the serum hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses&#xD;
      approximately 21 days following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM at&#xD;
      different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without MF59(R) adjuvant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for&#xD;
             all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 18-64 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are in good health*. *As determined by physical examination and medical history to&#xD;
             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined&#xD;
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the&#xD;
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.&#xD;
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no&#xD;
             hospitalizations, Emergency Room, or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms&#xD;
             that need medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This&#xD;
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result&#xD;
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,&#xD;
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same&#xD;
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as&#xD;
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will&#xD;
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic&#xD;
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator&#xD;
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or&#xD;
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of&#xD;
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment&#xD;
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the&#xD;
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there&#xD;
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses&#xD;
             to study vaccination. [Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the exception of&#xD;
             inhaled corticosteroids), herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted].&#xD;
&#xD;

             vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy,&#xD;
             hysterectomy, or successful Essure(R) placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal&#xD;
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after&#xD;
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal.&#xD;

             **Includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
             male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been&#xD;

Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result.

        <description>Blood was collected for Neutralizing assay which was conducted with the 2017 H7N9 vaccine virus as the antigen. Each sample was tested at least twice per the laboratory's standard operating procedure, and the geometric mean of the replicate results was calculated as that sample's result. The geometric mean titer was calculated for each study arm from the available results at 7 days post first vaccination (Day 8).</description>

          <description>Adverse events were defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product regardless of its causal relationship to the study treatment. Non-serious AEs were collected from participants at follow up visits through 21 days after each vaccination. The site investigator determined vaccine related as &quot;a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the AE.&quot; Adverse events were MedDRA coded and are summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC).</description>
          <population>The Safety Analysis population includes all participants who received at least one dose of study vaccine. Participants who received Vaccination 2 were included for this outcome measure.</population>
