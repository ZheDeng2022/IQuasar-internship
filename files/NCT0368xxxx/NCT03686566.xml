  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore metabolic phenotypes of children with extra-cranial solid tumors and compare these&#xD;
      with their histopathological and genetic alterations to discover potential novel biomarkers&#xD;
      and therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in children with high risk disease.&#xD;

      The principal objective of this study is the metabolic characterization of pediatric solid&#xD;
      tumors, with a particular focus on neuroblastoma (NBL) and fusion positive sarcoma (FPS),&#xD;
      which will allow the detection of tumor specific metabolic alterations that can be exploited&#xD;
      with the aim of developing novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular metabolism studies provide insight, in a complementary way to genomics, into&#xD;
      processes acting downstream from oncogenes and oncogenic fusion proteins, and such insight&#xD;
      may point toward previously unrecognized therapeutic targets or onco-metabolites that are&#xD;
      traceable as robust biomarkers for response. The investigator's new approach to use an&#xD;
      in-vivo comprehensive analysis of metabolic reprograming in FPS/NBL has never been performed&#xD;
      in childhood FPS/NBL and will complement genomics studies for these cancers. For this study,&#xD;
      the investigators plan to obtain tumor samples at time of surgical biopsy/resection and study&#xD;
      their metabolic signatures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare tumor metabolism at different points in therapy (diagnosis, metastasis, recurrence) if the family consents to further studies as their child's condition progresses.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Compare tumor metabolism at different points in therapy (before vs after chemotherapy is given) if the family consents to further studies as their child's condition progresses. For example, tumor sample at time of neuroblastoma biopsy to resection a few months later prior to bone marrow transplantation.</description>
