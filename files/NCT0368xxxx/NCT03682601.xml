  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of topical 5 or 10% sinecatechins, a botanical drug derived&#xD;
      from green tea for the alleviation of sexual pain in the area around the vaginal opening (the&#xD;
      vulvar vestibule), that is a main source of pain during sexual contact or dyspareunia, in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women, with vulvovaginal atrophy. Women may or may not be using estrogens.&#xD;
      Half of the women will receive the study drug, 5 or 10% sinecatechins and half will receive&#xD;
      placebo. In addition to the reduction or elimination of pain upon penetration, women may also&#xD;
      experience increase in lubrication, arousal and intensity of orgasm&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical Veregen (15% sinecatechins) is an FDA approved botanical drug derived from green tea&#xD;
      and is approved to be used as multiple doses, three times a day to treat all visible external&#xD;
      genital warts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical green tea ointment has been shown to alleviate pain and improve wound healing in the&#xD;
      vulvar vestibule for women who have had a recent episiotomy in the medical literature. In&#xD;
      private clinical practice, dilute Veregen, sinecatechins ointment, has been effective in&#xD;
      alleviating , sexual pain, vulvar vestibular pain, dyspareunia, in postmenopausal women as&#xD;
      well as improving overall sexual satisfaction,( increasing lubrication, arousal and quality&#xD;
      of orgasm). In this study, dilute Veregen, (5 or 10% sinecatechins) or placebo is being&#xD;
      applied, as a single dose, topically, three times/week up to once a day, to alleviate pain in&#xD;
      the vulvar vestibule, penetration pain, upon sexual contact or other manipulation of this&#xD;
      area in postmenopausal women. Women are eligible whether or not they are currently using any&#xD;
      form of estrogen or other hormonal treatments (eg. DHEA). Please note that women not using&#xD;
      estrogen or who maybe taking aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, SERMS, are also eligible to be&#xD;
      included.&#xD;

             menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For naturally postmenopausal women, be 40-70 years of age and at least 1 year post&#xD;

             vaginal introital genital manipulation whether through masturbation or partner sex,&#xD;
             whether using digits, oral sexual contact, sex toys, and/or penile penetration present&#xD;
             at regular intervals each month during the 4-week pre-treatment and the 4- week active&#xD;

                  meaningful loss in your desire for sex?&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Since experiencing vulvar pain, do you feel you have experienced a significant&#xD;
                  decrease in your sexual activity?&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Women can enter the trial if they are taking estrogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Women can enter the trial if they are taking DHEA.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have any physical limitations or sexual trauma that would interfere with normal sexual&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have used within the last 12 weeks any of the following medications/preparations that&#xD;
             may interfere with the study purpose: systemic corticosteroids (acute use for fewer&#xD;
             than 7 days is accepted), SSRI's, tricyclic antidepressants, anti-androgens,&#xD;
             spironolactone, PDE5 inhibitors (Viagra ®).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Be experiencing any chronic or acute life stress relating to any major life change,&#xD;
             such as recent loss of income or the death of a close family member, that may, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Investigator, significantly interfere with sexual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have significant psychiatric disorder, a significant alcohol or drug dependency and/or&#xD;
             be receiving pharmacologic treatment for such illness or disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have evidence of clinically significant organic disorder on the history and/or&#xD;
             physical examination that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, put the patient&#xD;
             at risk, present the patient from completing the study, or otherwise affect the&#xD;
             outcome of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a history of genital herpes because of the episodic nature of genital herpes and&#xD;
             of the known possibility of occurrence of herpetic pain without visible dermatologic&#xD;
             manifestations of herpes. Genital herpes and its accompanying genital pain may obscure&#xD;
             the source of the genital pain experienced and confound the ability to determine the&#xD;
             efficacy of treatment/placebo on endpoint of alleviation of pain in women with&#xD;
             secondary provoked vulvar vestibular pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any infection of the genitalia&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have lichen sclerosis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, psoriasis or any&#xD;
             inflammatory condition or abrasions of the vulva&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have an episiotomy scar in the area where pain is perceived as it may confound the&#xD;
             etiology of the perceived pain&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have diabetes.&#xD;
