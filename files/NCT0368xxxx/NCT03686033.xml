    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Photoparoxysmal Response (PPR) Range in the Most Sensitive Eye Condition at 8 Hours Postdose on Day 1 of Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (30 minutes-2 hours) and at 8 hours postdose on Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>PPR was an electroencephalogram (EEG) trait of spike and spike-wave discharges in response to photic stimulation. Intermittent photic stimulation (IPS)-EEG assessments determine the range of frequencies of IPS that elicited an epileptiform EEG response. Each IPS-EEG assessment was conducted in all 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open) at ascending and then descending photo stimulation administered at 14 standard frequencies: 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 hertz (Hz). The lower and upper limit of photosensitivity to IPS threshold frequency were determined for each eye condition. From this range, standard photosensitivity response (SPR) was derived. SPR is an integer score that ranges from 0 to 14, with lower scores representing better outcomes. Most sensitive eye condition was defined as one that yielded the largest SPR before dosing.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (30 minutes-2 hours) up to 8 hours postdose on Day 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Time to onset of mean photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) was determined from mean and mean change from baseline SPR data across participants. The onset of mean suppression was defined as the first time point at which the mean Response of standardized photosensitivity response (SPR) across participants (not for each participant) was at least 3 units below the mean SPR at baseline. Photosensitivity response were essentially intermittent photosensitivity (intermittent photic stimulation [IPS]) assessments, is a form of visual stimulation, when the participants are flashed with light on their eyes intermittently at different hertz.</description>

    <description>Maximum change from baseline of photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) were reported. PPR was an EEG trait of spike and spike-wave discharges in response to photic stimulation. IPS-EEG assessments determine the range of frequencies of IPS that elicited an epileptiform EEG response.

    <description>Duration of mean photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) was determined from mean and mean change from baseline SPR data across participants. Duration of mean suppression was defined as the difference in hours between the onset of mean suppression and the end of mean suppression of photosensitivity across participants. The onset of mean suppression was defined as the first time point at which the mean SPR across participants was at least 3 units below the mean SPR at baseline. The end of mean suppression was defined as the last time (second time) with two successive reductions in mean SPR across participants of at least 3 units lower than the mean SPR at baseline. Photosensitivity response were essentially IPS assessments, is a form of visual stimulation, when the participants are flashed with light on their eyes intermittently at different hertz.</description>

    <description>Complete suppression, reduction (partial response), and no change (no response) of PPR will be measured. Complete suppression was defined as a SPR reduction to 0 over at least 1 time point for all three eye conditions. Partial response was defined as a reduction in SPR of at least 3 units from baseline for at least 3 time points, and no time points with at least 3 units of increase, in the most sensitive eye condition; without meeting the complete suppression definition. No response was defined as not meeting complete suppression or partial suppression definitions.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (30 minutes-2 hours) and at 1,2,4,6 and 8 hours post-dose in each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>BL-VAS system was used to assess the extent of damage to the extrapyramidal system and the motor functions that it controls. The BL-VAS monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three subscales: a.) Anxiety, b.) Dysphoria, c.) sedation with each item ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicated better condition.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Photoparoxysmal Response (PPR) Range in the Most Sensitive Eye Condition at 8 Hours Postdose on Day 1 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PPR was an electroencephalogram (EEG) trait of spike and spike-wave discharges in response to photic stimulation. Intermittent photic stimulation (IPS)-EEG assessments determine the range of frequencies of IPS that elicited an epileptiform EEG response. Each IPS-EEG assessment was conducted in all 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open) at ascending and then descending photo stimulation administered at 14 standard frequencies: 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 hertz (Hz). The lower and upper limit of photosensitivity to IPS threshold frequency were determined for each eye condition. From this range, standard photosensitivity response (SPR) was derived. SPR is an integer score that ranges from 0 to 14, with lower scores representing better outcomes. Most sensitive eye condition was defined as one that yielded the largest SPR before dosing.</description>

Each IPS-EEG assessment was conducted in all 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open) at ascending and then descending photo stimulation administered at 14 standard frequencies: 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 Hz. The lower and upper limit of photosensitivity to IPS threshold frequency were determined for each eye condition. From this range, SPR was derived. SPR is an integer score that ranges from 0 to 14, with lower scores representing better outcomes.</description>

        <description>Time to onset of mean photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) was determined from mean and mean change from baseline SPR data across participants. The onset of mean suppression was defined as the first time point at which the mean Response of standardized photosensitivity response (SPR) across participants (not for each participant) was at least 3 units below the mean SPR at baseline. Photosensitivity response were essentially intermittent photosensitivity (intermittent photic stimulation [IPS]) assessments, is a form of visual stimulation, when the participants are flashed with light on their eyes intermittently at different hertz.</description>

        <description>Maximum change from baseline of photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) were reported. PPR was an EEG trait of spike and spike-wave discharges in response to photic stimulation. IPS-EEG assessments determine the range of frequencies of IPS that elicited an epileptiform EEG response. Each IPS-EEG assessment was conducted in all 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open) at ascending and then descending photo stimulation administered at 14 standard frequencies: 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 30, 40, 50, and 60 Hz. The lower and upper limit of photosensitivity to IPS threshold frequency were determined for each eye condition. From this range, SPR was derived. SPR is an integer score that ranges from 0 to 14, with lower scores representing better outcomes.</description>

        <title>Duration of Mean Photosensitivity Response in Each of the 3 Eye Conditions (Eye Closure, Eyes Closed, and Eyes Open Condition) up to 8 Hours Postdose on Day 1 of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Duration of mean photosensitivity response in each of the 3 eye conditions (eye closure, eyes closed, and eyes open condition) was determined from mean and mean change from baseline SPR data across participants. Duration of mean suppression was defined as the difference in hours between the onset of mean suppression and the end of mean suppression of photosensitivity across participants. The onset of mean suppression was defined as the first time point at which the mean SPR across participants was at least 3 units below the mean SPR at baseline. The end of mean suppression was defined as the last time (second time) with two successive reductions in mean SPR across participants of at least 3 units lower than the mean SPR at baseline. Photosensitivity response were essentially IPS assessments, is a form of visual stimulation, when the participants are flashed with light on their eyes intermittently at different hertz.</description>

        <description>BL-VAS system was used to assess the extent of damage to the extrapyramidal system and the motor functions that it controls. The BL-VAS monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three subscales: a.) Anxiety, b.) Dysphoria, c.) sedation with each item ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicated better condition.</description>

          <description>BL-VAS system was used to assess the extent of damage to the extrapyramidal system and the motor functions that it controls. The BL-VAS monitored the subjective mood of each participant on 16 mood scales. Participants were asked to indicate on the VAS scale ranging from 0 to 100 millimeter (mm) about how they felt at the moment the scale was administered (example, alert/drowsy; calm/excited; content/tensed). The individual responses from the 16 mood scales were then combined to make three subscales: a.) Anxiety, b.) Dysphoria, c.) sedation with each item ranges from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicated better condition.</description>
          <population>The PD analysis set was the group of randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have sufficient PD data to derive at least 1 PD parameter.</population>
