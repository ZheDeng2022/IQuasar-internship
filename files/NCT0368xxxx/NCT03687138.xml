      Objective: To search for potential biomarkers obtained by non-invasive methods (24-hour urine&#xD;
      collection) that distinguish between patients diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus&#xD;
      with or without renal involvement, patients with non-autoimmune renal disease and healthy&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus nephritis is one of the most common and severe complications of systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus, causing from asymptomatic mild proteinuria to rapidly progressive&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis with kidney failure. To date, kidney biopsy (an invasive medical procedure&#xD;
      with associated risks and complications) is essential for making a definitive diagnosis,&#xD;
      assessing the severity of the damage and deciding on the best treatment. In relation to this,&#xD;
      the identification of biomarkers using a non-invasive biological sample could help to&#xD;
      classify population groups, and this would be a great step forward in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project, we propose to conduct a case and control study. For this, we will&#xD;
      first carefully classify the study groups, using clinical data on patients and by testing a&#xD;
      pool of peptides described in the scientific literature in each of the sample groups, using&#xD;
      solid phase extraction combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#xD;
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Subsequently, we will carry out multivariate principal&#xD;
      component analysis on the data collected, and calculate corresponding receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curves, to enable us to identify the masses corresponding to peptides with&#xD;
      potential as biomarkers. We will then use classification algorithms to select sets of masses&#xD;
      that would allow us to distinguish the population groups, and generate statistical&#xD;
      classifiers for assessing the level of confidence in the model and its subsequent validation.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND STATUS QUO IN THE FIELD&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic, chronic autoimmune disease, affecting&#xD;
      connective tissue, and is considered a rare disease by the Spanish Foundation for Rare&#xD;
      Diseases (FEDER). Its clinical manifestations are varied, being able to affect most types of&#xD;
      tissue and organs especially the skin, joints, blood-forming organs, heart, lung, kidney and&#xD;
      nervous system (Galindo, 2008). A complex disease, it has a variable clinical course and&#xD;
      prognosis, characterised by alternating periods of remission and exacerbation (flares). For&#xD;
      this reason, it is important to establish the prognosis of each patient, as well as develop&#xD;
      and validate measures of disease activity and accumulated damage (Irastorza et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Galindo, 2008; Cervera, 1993).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology of SLE is still unknown. As well as a variable production of autoantibodies,&#xD;
      genetic and environmental factors may be involved in its pathogenesis. Indeed, it is likely&#xD;
      that the involvement of various different pathogenic and aetiological agents explains the&#xD;
      biological and clinical heterogeneity observed in patients with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of SLE varies with age, sex and ethnic group, and other characteristics of the&#xD;
      population under study. In Europe, recent data suggest an incidence of 1.5 cases/100,000 and&#xD;
      a prevalence of 122 cases/100,000), while specifically in Spain, the EPISER study found a&#xD;
      prevalence of 9 cases/100,000. The disease is known to be more common in Afro-Americans,&#xD;
      Hispanics and Asians, and moreover, is more severe in these groups, probably due to a mixture&#xD;
      of genetic, economic and cultural factors. The female-to-male sex ratio is around 10:1,&#xD;
      though the proportion of cases in females is lower among those with onset occurring during&#xD;
      childhood or after 65 years of age. In most patients, signs and symptoms of SLE develop&#xD;
      between 15 and 40 years of age, with a mean age of disease onset of 29 to 32 years old&#xD;
      (Galindo, 2008; Ruiz-Irastorza et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 30 and 50% of patients with SLE develop kidney disease, this being one of the first&#xD;
      manifestations in 10% of patients. The most common clinical manifestations include&#xD;
      proteinuria, micro-haematuria, urinary casts, kidney failure, and high blood pressure. This&#xD;
      condition is associated with higher risks of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 5 to 10 years&#xD;
      after diagnosis and of death (Galindo, 2008; Aran et al., 2008; Ruiz-Irastorza et al., 2012;&#xD;
      Sanz, 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus nephritis (LN), a common complication of SLE, may vary in severity from asymptomatic&#xD;
      mild proteinuria to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with kidney failure. It is&#xD;
      classified on the basis of pathological findings in the glomerulus, the WHO classification&#xD;
      and updates thereof, being the most widely used in both clinical trials and daily practice.&#xD;
      The WHO system identifies six different classes of LN, classes III and IV corresponding to&#xD;
      the proliferative forms of the disease. This pathology-based classification, based on renal&#xD;
      biopsy, is of great important for assessing the intensity of treatment required to prevent&#xD;
      progression to ESRD (Silva-Fernández et al., 2008; Sanz, 2014). On the other hand, renal&#xD;
      biopsy is an invasive medical procedure, which requires highly-qualified personnel and is not&#xD;
      free of risks and complications. Currently, this test is essential for making a definitive&#xD;
      diagnosis, assessing the severity of the damage (&quot;staging&quot;) and deciding on the best&#xD;
      treatment (Carpio, 2003; Ruiz-Irastorza et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, by the time patients are diagnosed, they may already be at an advanced stage of the&#xD;
      disease, making it more difficult to treat and manage. For this reason, methods for assessing&#xD;
      whether individuals are at risk of developing this condition at an earlier stage, enabling&#xD;
      them to be treated promptly, would increase the likelihood of treatments being successful and&#xD;
      thereby patient quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteomics provides key tools for obtaining data to improve diagnosis and/or prognosis, and&#xD;
      as such is one of the foundations of translational research. The proteome is a dynamic&#xD;
      entity, which is constantly changing in response to processes affecting cells, such as&#xD;
      stress, illness and medical treatments. Analysis of differences in protein and/or peptide&#xD;
      expression in samples from healthy individuals and patients with a given illness provides&#xD;
      very valuable information on the molecular and physiological basis of the illness (Pando &amp;&#xD;
      Ferreira, 2007; Ali et al., 2005; Arrollo, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers are molecules associated with in vivo biological processes that significantly&#xD;
      change with physiological conditions. They may be used in clinical practice for screening, to&#xD;
      establish a diagnosis, monitor disease activity, estimate prognosis with a given treatment,&#xD;
      or detect disease recurrence. In relation to this, proteomic analysis based on solid phase&#xD;
      extraction (SPE) in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization&#xD;
      (MALDI)-time-of-flight (TOF) profiling allows inexpensive and rapid screening of peptides and&#xD;
      small proteins present in biological fluids. In our case, the fluid to analyse would be&#xD;
      urine, and this would enable sampling to be non-invasive, avoiding the risks associated with&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine is likely to be the best body fluid for obtaining biomarkers for a kidney disease for&#xD;
      two reasons: 1. It is produced by the kidney, and hence any biomarkers identified may&#xD;
      directly reflect kidney function (Tianfu W. et al., 2013). 2. Samples can be obtained easily&#xD;
      and non-invasively&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the assessment of LN using SPE combined with laser desorption/ionization-TOF mass&#xD;
      spectrometry, studies have been published by Suzuki et al. (2007) on childhood nephritis, and&#xD;
      by Mosley et al. (2006), investigating the use of urine profiles to distinguish patients with&#xD;
      active and inactive disease. Both of these groups used surface-enhanced laser&#xD;
      desorption/ionization, techniques that are mainly being replaced by SPE combined with&#xD;
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Callensen, Proteomics review), which has a higher resolving&#xD;
      power, provides more accurate mass measurements and is more sensitive. In relation to this,&#xD;
      several studies have been performed including those of Gonzáles et al. (2012) in tears, to&#xD;
      differentiate between individuals; Iloro et al. (2013) in urine, to monitor the toxicity of a&#xD;
      drug. The combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with the selective ability of SPE&#xD;
      techniques using, for example, reverse-phase resins (C18) and/or ion exchange (weak cation or&#xD;
      anion exchange) would make it possible to obtain better results than those of the&#xD;
      aforementioned studies. One of the strengths of this type of profiling analysis is that, as&#xD;
      well as being rapid and inexpensive, it is based on the intensity of a panel of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this sense, several groups have described some proteomic biomarkers potentially associated&#xD;
      with susceptibility to LN and the underlying pathogenesis (Li et al, 2013; Wu et al., 2013;&#xD;
      Masanori et al., 2013; Zhu X et al., 2012; Nakatani et al., 2012). Already, there are some&#xD;
      studies that have contributed in the health field, example is using proteomics studies in&#xD;
      kidney biopsies, which have helped the reclassification of membranoproliferative&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis (MPGN) (Caster et al., 2015 ; Stoskar et al, 2012).. Alaiya and&#xD;
      collaborator (2014) conducted a study using proteomics kidney biopsy in which they determined&#xD;
      that there is no strong evidence to differentiate the two subcategories of class IV lupus&#xD;
      nephritis. Bruschi et al (2014) observed with typical proteomics antibodies in kidney NL also&#xD;
      found in serum. Yajuan Li, et al (2013).; Tianfu et al, (2013).; Masanori H. et al, (2013).;&#xD;
      Xuejing Zhu et al, (2012).; Nakatani et al., (2012), perform a description of possible&#xD;
      proteomic biomarkers associated with susceptibility to and pathogenesis of NL. These studies&#xD;
      demonstrate the potential for information to both clinicians and scientists in prognosis and&#xD;
      diagnosis of pathology in improving treatments, and in terms related to the etiology,&#xD;
      pathogenesis and disease activity (Caster et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a first pilot study performed in OSI BILBAO BASURTO patients diagnosed with SLE with and&#xD;
      without NL, a differential protein pattern was observed between the two groups of patients&#xD;
      and also among patients with mild and significant renal involvement, by analyzing the ANOVA&#xD;
      (162 proteins p &lt;0.01) (Rivera et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context and in order to delve into the molecular and physiological basis of disease,&#xD;
      it will seek to differentiate populations of patients diagnosed with SLE patients without NL&#xD;
      with no autoimmune nephropathy and healthy donors. The sample used is the 24-hour urine. Once&#xD;
      obtained and processed biological samples, analyzing them by MALDI TOF SPE in the Autoflex&#xD;
      III (bioGUNE) will be held.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research project, we propose to conduct a case and control study. For this, we will&#xD;
      first carefully classify the study groups, using clinical data on patients. The Department of&#xD;
      Rheumatology at Basurto University Hospital provides consultations for autoimmune diseases,&#xD;
      mainly focusing on SLE, and these will be the source of the majority of patients with SLE and&#xD;
      LN and for comparison groups, as well as sample donors who are healthy or diagnosed with&#xD;
      non-immune diseases. Patients diagnosed with non-autoimmune lupus nephritis will be recruited&#xD;
      by the Nephrology Unit of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, we will carry out a descriptive analysis of the variables and assess whether they are&#xD;
      associated with LN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, we will determine whether the biomarkers tested are present in the study and&#xD;
      comparison populations, and then assess whether there are significant differences between the&#xD;
      study and comparison groups, for each of the candidate markers. Further, we will perform&#xD;
      multivariate analysis, and for this, as is common in profiling studies, we will use principal&#xD;
      component analysis. We will routinely calculate the receiver operating characteristic curves&#xD;
      as these will enable us to select masses corresponding to peptides with potential as&#xD;
      biomarkers. Finally, we will use classification algorithms (genetic algorithms and/or&#xD;
      supervised neural networks) to select sets of masses that would enable us to distinguish the&#xD;
      population groups, and generate statistical classifiers for assessing the level of confidence&#xD;
      in the model and its subsequent validation (Cellesen et al., 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proteins are very labile and are prone to change under the influence of physical factors,&#xD;
      contact with plastic materials, among others. For this reason, to reduce potential noise in&#xD;
      the data associated with the plastic 24-hour urine collection containers to be used,&#xD;
      participants will each be provided with a container from the same batch. All samples will be&#xD;
      handed in to the research office of Basurto Hospital, standardising the way samples are&#xD;
      handled. Moreover, we will use protein LoBind tubes, plates, etc., to minimise binding of the&#xD;
      proteins to the plastic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      Copies of the Declaration and its amendments will be provided on request or can be found on&#xD;
      the website of the World Medical Association at http://wma.net/&#xD;
      en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is to be carried out according to the protocol and standard operating procedures&#xD;
      and this will ensure adherence to good practice guidelines, as described in the 1996&#xD;
      tripartite harmonised International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline on Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice.&#xD;
