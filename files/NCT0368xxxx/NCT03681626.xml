  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about the procedure of extubation of patients admitted in Intensive Care&#xD;
      Units (ICU). In particular, effects of tracheal suction during extubation have never been&#xD;
      evaluated. Tracheal suction induces alveolar derecruitment in sedated patients under&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and is a major source of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of tracheal suction during the extubation&#xD;
      procedure of critically ill patients on the end-expiratory lung volume.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, monocentric study, conducted in the surgical ICU of the university&#xD;
      hospital of Rouen, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty patients were expected to be randomized before extubation into two groups (ratio of&#xD;
      1:1) with different extubation protocols depending on whether tracheal suction was performed&#xD;
      or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After oral information and collection of the non opposition of the patient to participate in&#xD;
      the study, eligible patients were randomized (raio 1:1) in two groups: &quot;tracheal suction&quot;&#xD;
      group or &quot;no tracheal suction&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation concealment was assured by enclosing assignments in sequentially numbered,&#xD;
      opaque, sealed envelopes. Envelopes were opened after enrolment of each patient by the&#xD;
      medical doctor in charged. Each envelope contained a number by a random allocation process&#xD;
      using a computer-generated random block design (the randomization list was established by the&#xD;
      local biostatistics unit before the beginning of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juste after inclusion, the 30 minutes standardized extubation protocol started and consisted&#xD;
      of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial blood gas analysis before the extubation (if there wasn't one dating less than&#xD;
           6 hours),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adjustment of the backrest of the bed in tilt to + 45 °,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tracheal suction 30 minutes before extubation (using a 14 french catheter, a vacuum of&#xD;
           -200 mmHg systematically measured by a manometer XX),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the ventilator was then set on pressure support ventilation with pressure support level&#xD;
           of 8 cmH2O and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O (FiO2 was adjusted for&#xD;
           oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry between 95 and 98%) for 30 minutes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  installation of electrode belt for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitoring&#xD;
           (Pulmovista 500, Dräger®) and calibration of the system,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions immediately before extubation with an oral&#xD;
           cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for &quot;tracheal suction&quot; group, extubation occured 30 minutes after inclusion. A tracheal&#xD;
           suction (using a 14 french catheter, a vacuum of -200 mmHg) was performed at the same&#xD;
           time as removal of the tracheal tube, after disconnection of the ventilator and after&#xD;
           deflating the balloon of the tracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for &quot;no tracheal suction&quot; group, extubation occured 30 minutes after inclusion and was&#xD;
           performed after deflation of the balloon (and without further maneuver).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  all patients underwent chest physical therapy between the 15th and 60th minutes&#xD;
           following extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No calculation of the number of subjects needed was possible (no data available concerning&#xD;
      ΔEELI at extubation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were described in the whole population and for each group (&quot;tracheal suction&quot; and &quot;no&#xD;
      tracheal suction&quot;) using the usual descriptive parameters: frequency for qualitative&#xD;
      variables, median and interquartile range (IQR) for quantitative variables. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis consisted of a nonparametric Mann and Whitney test for the quantitative variables&#xD;
      and an exact Fisher test for the qualitative variables (using Statistical Analysis System&#xD;
      software, version 9.4, Statistical Analysis System Institute; Cary, NC). The significance of&#xD;
      the tests was retained for an α risk of 5%.&#xD;
