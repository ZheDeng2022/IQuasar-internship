  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine possible mechanisms of heightened vasoconstriction in&#xD;
      Black/African American men and women as possible links to the elevated prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The main targets in this study are sources of&#xD;
      oxidative stress.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) afflicts nearly one-third of the adult population with all races&#xD;
      and ethnicities represented in CVD prevalence. Unfortunately, a disparity exists such that&#xD;
      the black population (BL) is disproportionately affected compared to other groups, including&#xD;
      the white population (WH). While the underlying cause of this disparity is multifactorial,&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction (i.e., impaired vasodilation and/or augmented vasoconstriction) is a key&#xD;
      contributor. As has been previously observed, BL exhibit a heightened vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      response to both pharmacological (e.g., alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists) and environmental&#xD;
      (e.g., cold pressor test) stimuli compared to their WH counterparts. Additionally, reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability may&#xD;
      partially mediate this response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the small blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous microvasculature) in BL, but&#xD;
      otherwise healthy individuals, produce an impaired blood flow response to local heating when&#xD;
      compared to age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and gender-matched WH. However, pre-treatment of&#xD;
      the cutaneous microvasculature with either allopurinol or apocynin (xanthine oxidase&#xD;
      inhibitor and NADPH oxidase inhibitor, respectively) abolishes this skin blood flow&#xD;
      difference. These drugs inhibit possible sources of ROS, which, as mentioned, may be&#xD;
      mediating the heightened vasoconstrictor response in BL. Accordingly, apocynin administration&#xD;
      in previous research using an animal model ameliorates alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated&#xD;
      vasoconstriction, possibly due to a reduction in ROS. The role of xanthine/NADPH oxidase and&#xD;
      the production of ROS on alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in humans&#xD;
      remains unknown.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>Determine to what degree superoxide, either generally available or produced through xanthine/NADPH oxidases, contributes to heightened phenylephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Following local coninfusions of phenylephrine with apocynin, allopurinol, or tempol, the changes in blood flux will be quantified using laser Doppler fluxmetry.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals (ages 18-35, both genders) will be recruited from the greater Arlington&#xD;
             area to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must self-report both parents as either African American or Caucasian American.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have donated more than 550 ml of blood within the past 8 weeks will&#xD;
             not have blood drawn from them in this protocol. However, if they remain interested in&#xD;
             the study, and otherwise meet the inclusion criteria, than we may still opt to proceed&#xD;
             with data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with cardiovascular, neurological, and/or metabolic illnesses will be&#xD;
             excluded from participating as well as individuals with a history of various diseases&#xD;
             of the microvasculature including Reynaud's disease, cold-induced urticaria,&#xD;
             cryoglobulinemia, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently taking any prescription medications and individuals with a body&#xD;
             mass index about 30 kg/m2) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant subjects and children (i.e. younger than 18) will not be recruited for the&#xD;
             study. Eligible females will be scheduled for days 2-7 of their menstrual cycle to&#xD;
             account for hormonal effects on blood flow. A regular menstrual cycle is required to&#xD;
             identify and schedule the study for the low hormone period, therefore females who lack&#xD;
             a regular cycle will be excluded from the study. Females currently taking birth&#xD;
             control are eligible, as long as they can be scheduled during a low-hormone &quot;placebo&quot;&#xD;
             week. If their hormone do not contain a placebo week than these individuals will not&#xD;
             be eligible for data collection. Females who are breast-feeding will also be eligible&#xD;
             as there are no systemic or lasting effects of the proposed vasoactive agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Given that smoking can affect the peripheral vasculature, current smokers and&#xD;
             individuals who regularly smoked (&gt;1 pack per two weeks) within the prior 2 years will&#xD;
             be excluded&#xD;
