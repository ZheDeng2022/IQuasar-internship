  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence that supports using certain concentration of trisodium citrate as a locking solution&#xD;
      for hemodialysis catheters has not yet been established. Higher concentrations of trisodium&#xD;
      citrate are more effective in preventing thrombosis, formation of blood clots, preventing&#xD;
      infections and biofilm formation, but due to potential side effects, their use is limited.&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the impact of two different concentrations of tri-sodium&#xD;
      citrate solution (30% and 4%) on the formation of biofilms in hemodialysis single-volume&#xD;
      jugular hemodialysis catheters and to determine the effectiveness of prevention of&#xD;
      dysfunction of hemodialysis catheters.&#xD;

      AIM OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the impact of two different concentrations of trisodium&#xD;
      citrate solution (30% and 4%) on the formation of biofilms in hemodialysis single-volume&#xD;
      jugular hemodialysis catheters and to determine the effectiveness of prevention of&#xD;
      dysfunction of hemodialysis catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare the influence of two different concentrations of trisodium citrate&#xD;
      solutions as a locking solutions for hemodialysis catheters on the formation of intraluminal&#xD;
      biofilm, the growth of microorganisms in the lumen of the hemodialysis catheter, and the&#xD;
      occurrence of dysfunction of hemodialysis catheters in the same patient at the same time,&#xD;
      under the same conditions as the same length and volume of hemodialysis catheters, catheter&#xD;
      insertion time, duration of dialysis procedures, sex, age, co-morbidity, therapy and the&#xD;
      presence of an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of patients this study will include are the ones who are being treated or are&#xD;
      supposed to start the hemodialysis treatment at the Center for Acute and Complicated&#xD;
      Dialysis, Department for Nephrology, UKC Ljubljana and for vascular approach have newly&#xD;
      inserted or for any reason newly replaced two single-hemodialysis catheter to the left or&#xD;
      right inner jugular vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients this study will include are the patients on chronic replacement therapy with&#xD;
      hemodialysis, patients with acute renal failure who are on transient replacement therapy with&#xD;
      hemodialysis and patients with renal failure starting with substitution treatment with&#xD;
      chronic hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the eligibility for inclusion in our study, the investigators will acquire&#xD;
      the written consent from the patient. Patients that will be included in the study will have&#xD;
      simultaneously inserted two jugular catheters. In the inter-dialysis period, catheters will&#xD;
      always be filled with one catheter with 30% trisodium citrate solution, another catheter with&#xD;
      4% tri-sodium citrate solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a prospective interventional clinical trial. After dialysis,&#xD;
      the patients' catheters will always be filled by the same protocol (one catheter with 30%&#xD;
      trisodium citrate solution, the second catheter with 4% trisodium citrate solution). Patients&#xD;
      will be allocated alternately between protocols 1 and 2. There are 2 protocols for filling&#xD;
      dialysis catheters: Protocol 1: the upper (artery) catheter will be filled with 4% and lower&#xD;
      (vein) with 30% trisodium citrate solution, Protocol 2: upper (artery) catheter will be&#xD;
      filled with 30% and the lower (vein) with a 4% trisodium citrate solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the patients included, investigators will compare the pressure in the extracorporeal&#xD;
      system and blood flow through dialysis catheter, time to dysfunction of hemodialysis&#xD;
      catheters, eventual infections associated with catheter: bacteremia or sepsis, infection of&#xD;
      the exit of dialysis catheters using different concentrations of trisodium citrate as a&#xD;
      locking solution in the inter-dialysis period. Among the patients included, investigators&#xD;
      will also monitor the duration of dialysis treatment, the duration of the dialysis procedure&#xD;
      in one week, the presence of infection, age, co-morbidity, concomitant therapy (treatment&#xD;
      with anticoagulation and anti-aggregation drugs, the presence of immunosuppression,&#xD;
      antibiotics). In approximately 5 patients we will simultaneously remove the dialysis catheter&#xD;
      due to any medical indication and then via an electronic microscope and stereomicroscope&#xD;
      evaluate morphological characteristics of biofilm. Investigators will also evaluate the&#xD;
      microbiological characteristics of biofilms using microbiological methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the occurrence of dysfunction or the number of catheter days in the same&#xD;
      patients using different concentrations of trisodium citrate solutions in inter-dialysis&#xD;
      period will be statistically different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the morphological parameters of biofilm will be statistically different&#xD;
      using different concentration solution of trisodium citrate (30%, 4%). It is also expected&#xD;
      that the microbiological characteristics of biofilm will differ according to the used&#xD;
      concentration of the trisodium citrate solution in the inter-dialysis period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data investigators will receive can help to understand the adverse events occurring with&#xD;
      the use of hemodialysis catheters, filling with different concentrations of trisodium citrate&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;
