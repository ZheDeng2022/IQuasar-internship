    <textblock>
      The current study will test the ability and likelihood of successfully implementing&#xD;
      individualized combination treatment recommendations for adult patients with&#xD;
      surgically-resectable recurrent glioblastoma in a timely fashion. Collected tumor tissue and&#xD;
      blood will be examined using a new diagnostic testing called University of California, San&#xD;
      Francisco (UCSF) 500 Cancer Gene Panel which is done at the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics&#xD;
      Laboratory. The UCSF 500 Cancer Gene Panel will help identify genetic changes in the DNA of a&#xD;
      patient's cancer, which helps oncologists improve treatment by identifying targeted&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, non-randomized open-label study to assess feasibility of implementing&#xD;
      an individualized treatment regimen in patients with surgical recurrent GBM. Patients are not&#xD;
      stratified according to demographic or treatment-related parameters. Patients must have&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma treated with appropriate tumor treatment including radiation therapy&#xD;
      at initial diagnosis. Surgery must be clinically indicated and patients must be candidates&#xD;
      for tumor resection at UCSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to build upon prior results by confirming the feasibility of&#xD;
      actually implementing patient-specific drug regimens in a rapid, clinically-relevant&#xD;
      timetable. The investigators will also assess for efficacy, safety, and response outcomes of&#xD;
      these patient-specific regimens, to generate preliminary data that would support a larger&#xD;
      trial assessing efficacy of such an approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resected tumor tissue and blood will be examined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) UCSF&#xD;
      500 Cancer Gene Panel at the UCSF Clinical Cancer Genomics Laboratory and Whole genome and&#xD;
      RNA sequencing. The clinical report generated from the NGS UCSF 500 panel will be provided to&#xD;
      a study-specific Tumor Board who will generate an individualized treatment recommendation&#xD;
      based on the report. The individualized treatment regimen potentially will include up to 4&#xD;
      re-purposed, off-the-shelf, FDA-approved targeted agents. The Board will identify the&#xD;
      expected/anticipated drug-drug interactions and anticipated additional toxicities of the&#xD;
      combination of therapies. The treating physician is given the report, discusses the suggested&#xD;
      treatment options with the patient, and initiates treatment, ideally within 28 calendar days&#xD;
      (and no later than 35 calendar days) after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue treatment until tumor progression, intolerable side effects, or&#xD;
      patient/physician choice to discontinue.&#xD;

    <description>Study treatment for a given patient will consist of a regimen chosen from agents implicated in critical molecular signaling pathways and/or from signature-based predictions of drug efficacy. All agents are listed in the current pharmacopoeia for human use, but will differ amongst individual subjects. The study treatment will consist of up to 4 FDA approved drugs that have known dosing. This study is not only looking at 4 drugs. It is selecting up to 4 drugs per patient but the drugs chosen can be any FDA-approved drug. Therefore, it is not possible to pre-specify the medications.</description>

    <description>For a given proposed individualized combination of drugs the first priority to establish doses will be to identify the same combination of drugs in a peer-reviewed journal article or presented as a reviewed abstract.&#xD;
When a proposed individualized combination of drugs has not previously been reported, the process to establish doses will be to then identify individual members of the proposed combination that have been used in combination with other cytotoxic agents similar to those being considered for combination therapy.&#xD;
When a proposed individualized combination of drugs has no available combination data, dosing guidelines will start with the FDA-approved package insert recommended dose.</description>

             prior therapies, but must have received appropriate prior therapy for GBM at time of&#xD;
             initial diagnosis, including radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient must have adequate bone marrow function, renal function, and hepatic function&#xD;
             as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,500/μL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelets &gt;= 100,000/μL&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Must be able to undergo MRI scans for tumor evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum)&#xD;
             within 7 days prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The effects of study drugs, either individually or their combination on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men&#xD;
             must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry and for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation and for 3 months after completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
             The use of adequate contraception may be longer than 3 months depending on the drugs&#xD;
             used and the FDA-approved labeling in cases of recommendation for contraception.&#xD;
             Adequate contraception may include hormonal contraception, barrier method (condom,&#xD;
             contraceptive sponge, diaphragm or ring), intrauterine device (IUD), tubal ligation,&#xD;
             vasectomy and abstinence. Should a woman become pregnant (or suspect that she is&#xD;
             pregnant) while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform&#xD;
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 3 months after completion of study drug administration. Patient&#xD;
             must not be a woman who is currently pregnant, due to the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects of study drugs, either alone or in combination. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with study drugs, lactating women who are breastfeeding should&#xD;
             discontinue breastfeeding if the mother is treated with any study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must not have New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater&#xD;
             congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients must not have history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 12&#xD;
             months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient who has been treated with any chemotherapy or radiotherapy ≤4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             date of study registration. Exceptions to this include: must be ≥ 23 days from last&#xD;
             dose of temozolomide (TMZ), must be ≥ 6 weeks from last dose of nitrosurea.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who has not recovered to grade 1 or baseline from the adverse effects of prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy or chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient who is &lt; 12 weeks from initial course of radiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with multifocal tumor, primarily infratentorial or posterior fossa tumor, or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal dissemination of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient with any other active malignancy besides GBM, excluding non-melanomatous skin&#xD;
             cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix, prostate, or breast, unless patient has&#xD;
             been disease-free/in remission for &gt;=2 years prior to date of study enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients known to be HIV-positive. HIV testing is not required for study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including psychiatric illness, or situations that&#xD;
             would limit compliance with the study requirements or the ability to willingly give&#xD;
             written informed consent.&#xD;
