  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 9th most common cancer in Australia, the 10th most common&#xD;
      cancer in Western populations.~75% of kidney cancers are clear-cell renal cell carcinomas&#xD;
      (ccRCC). Many patients present with advanced or unresectable disease at diagnosis and a&#xD;
      number of treatments are now available for metastatic ccRCC included vascular endothelial&#xD;
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR TKIs), mTOR inhibitors, and&#xD;
      cytokines. More recently first line use of immunotherapy demonstrated improved survival with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors. While many patients benefit from first-line treatment, progression is&#xD;
      inevitable and these treatments remain on the whole palliative. Second-line VEGFR TKIs, mTOR&#xD;
      inhibitors and immunotherapy have some benefit but in a smaller increment than first-line&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While ~75% of kidney cancers are the clear-cell variant, ~25% of kidney cancers are non-clear&#xD;
      cell histology (nccRCC) and include papillary, chromophobe, sarcomatoid, collecting duct&#xD;
      carcinoma, Xp11 translocation carcinoma and unclassified. Patients with non-ccRCC have&#xD;
      significantly lower response rates and poorer median progression-free survival and overall&#xD;
      survival than those with ccRCC. Non clear cell histologies have largely been excluded from&#xD;
      large phase III randomised clinical trials and therefore the optimal treatment and sequencing&#xD;
      of therapies for these patients remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite recent unprecedented advances in treatment, there continues to be an unmet need to&#xD;
      improve outcomes for patients with previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma. This is particularly relevant in non-clear cell RCC. Because it is a rarer&#xD;
      subtype of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, it is more challenging to study, and treatment&#xD;
      efficacy data is sparse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project is testing a new treatment for participants with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic non-clear cell kidney cancer. The new treatment involves a drug called&#xD;
      Cabozantinib (also known as Cabometyx). This drug has been used previously in many cancers,&#xD;
      including clear cell kidney cancer and thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of Cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is a anti-cancer drug that works by blocking&#xD;
      cancer cell growth. It blocks particular proteins called protein kinases on cancer cells.&#xD;
      Protein kinases encourage the cancer to grow. Cabozantinib is called a multi kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      because it blocks a number of these proteins. How well cabozantinib works in cancer of the&#xD;
      kidney will be tested by measuring the change in size of your tumours that are seen on CT&#xD;
      scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cabozantinib is approved to treat clear cell kidney cancer and thyroid cancer in Australia.&#xD;
      It has not been tested in people with non-clear cell kidney cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 48 participants with non-clear cell kidney cancer are expected to participate in this&#xD;
      study, from Australia. Even though this study may be suitable for you, it is possible that&#xD;
      you may not be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study has been initiated by Dr. David Pook, is being conducted in collaboration&#xD;
      with the Centre for Biostatistics and Clinical Trials (BaCT) and sponsored in Australia by&#xD;
      the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate (ANZUP) Cancer Trials Group Pty Ltd.&#xD;
