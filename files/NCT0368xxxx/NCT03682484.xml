  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human (FiH) study consists of 2 parts: single ascending dose (SAD) with&#xD;
      evaluation of food effect (Part 1) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single&#xD;
      ascending oral doses in Part 1 (SAD Including Evaluation of Food Effect) and multiple&#xD;
      ascending oral doses in Part 2 (MAD) of MA-0211 in healthy adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single&#xD;
      ascending and multiple ascending oral doses of MA-0211 in healthy adult participants. In&#xD;
      addition, this study will evaluate the effect of a single oral dose of MA-0211 on the QT&#xD;
      interval using Fridericia's Correction (QTcF); determine the effect of food on the PK of a&#xD;
      single oral dose of MA-0211 as well as evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of MA-0211&#xD;
      on the QTcF.&#xD;

      After a screening period of up to 29 days prior to study drug administration, eligible&#xD;
      participants will be residential for a single period of 6 days/5 nights in Part 1 and 19&#xD;
      days/18 nights in Part 2 . Participants will be admitted to the clinical unit on day 2.&#xD;
