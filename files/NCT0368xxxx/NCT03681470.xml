  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease characterized by inflammatory papules, pustules, and&#xD;
      comedones that is prevalent in men and women of color. Research has demonstrated that Aczone&#xD;
      ® (dapsone) gel, 7.5% used once daily is effective, safe, and well-tolerated for the&#xD;
      treatment of acne in both men and women; however, limited data is available regarding its&#xD;
      efficacy and safety in skin of color (SOC). The current study aims to investigate the&#xD;
      therapeutic impact of Aczone gel 7.5% in SOC males and females ages 18 and older with acne&#xD;
      vulgaris. The study will also evaluate the impact of Aczone ® gel on hyperpigmentation and&#xD;
      PIH of the face.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease characterized by inflammatory papules, pustules, and&#xD;
      comedones that is prevalent in men and women of color. In fact, acne is the most common&#xD;
      dermatologic diagnosis made in SOC populations. Although individuals of all skin types can&#xD;
      develop acne vulgaris, there are important differences in darker skin types that are&#xD;
      important to consider when choosing an optimal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications from acne are of great concern in this population, as keloids, hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) are more common in skin of color. PIH&#xD;
      may last for weeks to months and, in many cases, is more troublesome to patients than the&#xD;
      acne itself. Overall, facial acne and its sequelae have a greater impact on perception of&#xD;
      appearance, negative emotions, and social functioning in women of color than white women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dapsone is a sulfone compound with anti-inflammatory properties that has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in the treatment of acne vulgaris in SOC. Aczone ® (dapsone) gel, 5% administered&#xD;
      twice daily has been associated with significant improvement in overall acne severity, acne&#xD;
      signs, and impact on quality of life in women of color. Two phase III trials of a newer&#xD;
      formulation of Aczone ® (dapsone) gel, 7.5% used once daily demonstrated that this product is&#xD;
      effective, safe, and well-tolerated for the treatment of acne in both men and women; however,&#xD;
      limited data is available regarding its efficacy and safety in SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, some investigators of the phase IV study on the safety and efficacy of dapsone gel&#xD;
      5% in SOC anecdotally reported improvement in hyperpigmentation over 12 weeks, although this&#xD;
      was not a planned efficacy outcome. Further research is needed on the potential effects of&#xD;
      dapsone gel on hyperpigmentation and PIH in SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will investigate the therapeutic impact of Aczone gel 7.5% in SOC males and&#xD;
      females ages 18 and older with acne vulgaris. The study will also evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      Aczone gel on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation using the Postacne Hyperpigmentation Index&#xD;
      (PAHPI) and mexameter-measured melanin index (MI).&#xD;
