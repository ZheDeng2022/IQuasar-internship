    <textblock>
      By performing a randomized, blinded placebo controlled exploratory trial we speculate that&#xD;
      replacement of perioperative, bleeding-induced iron losses with ferric carboxymaltose&#xD;
      immediately after the surgical procedure can replenish iron with increased hemoglobin levels&#xD;
      and reduce the amount of pRBCs transfused in the postoperative period (30 days post surgery).&#xD;

      In the last few years, state of the art Patient Blood Management (PBM programs have been&#xD;
      gaining worldwide attention. This may be attributed to the significant improvements in&#xD;
      patient outcomes that follow adequate preoperative preparation and intraoperative&#xD;
      optimization of the circulating red cell mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first pillar of PBM (pre-, intra-, and postoperative optimization of red cell mass by&#xD;
      means other than red cell transfusions including intravenous iron and erythropoietin&#xD;
      stimulating agents) can meet significant barriers and might be difficult to implement. In&#xD;
      daily clinical practice, timely identification and treatment of preoperative anemia is&#xD;
      difficult to organize due to structural and behavioral constraints. Therefore, today, there&#xD;
      are still a striking number of patients who are admitted for surgery without adequate&#xD;
      preoperative treatment of anemia regardless of its causes. Notably, even for this patient&#xD;
      population, it has been demonstrated by experimental and larger observational data that&#xD;
      postoperative application of intravenous iron could help to reduce perioperative transfusions&#xD;
      by restoring red cell mass. The complete potential of perioperative intravenous iron therapy&#xD;
      has yet to identified, including improvements such as early mobility and other improved&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients are not included in preoperative red&#xD;
      cell mass optimization, since the preoperative hemoglobin concentration is either high enough&#xD;
      in terms of the thresholds of the World Health Organization (♂ 13 g/dl and ♀ 12 g/dl), or&#xD;
      borderline (mild) anemia is diagnosed and no treatment is offered. These patients may be&#xD;
      prone to substantial intraoperative blood losses, and as a consequence might suffer from&#xD;
      postoperative iron restricted anemia. In fact, there are a remarkable number of patients that&#xD;
      have adequate hemoglobin concentrations preoperatively, but ultimately develop anemia with&#xD;
      iron deficiency postoperatively due to significant intraoperative bleeding. Data from ICU&#xD;
      patients' with postoperative iron deficiency has significant impact on outcome including&#xD;
      postoperative fatigue, and consequently a prolonged healing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this problem is common, current PBM strategies are in need of validation of one of&#xD;
      the PBM guidelines: postoperative replacement of blood loss with resultant iron losses in&#xD;
      patients without preoperative anemia thus avoiding exposure to allogeneic transfusions in&#xD;
      this population. The untested hypothesis is that this approach could improve postoperative&#xD;
      outcomes including mobilization. Based on a recent publication one might surmise that it is&#xD;
      not (only) postoperative anemia, but rather untreated iron deficiency, that is responsible&#xD;
      for a delay in postoperative mobilization and recovery. It is therefore the aim of the&#xD;
      proposal presented to describe an additional approach, in which perioperative, surgical blood&#xD;
      loss iron losses are replaced immediately following the surgical procedure in patients that&#xD;
      did not receive iron preoperatively due to normal or minor reduction in hemoglobin&#xD;
      concentrations (red cell mass). This replacement may take place in either the postoperative&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit or in the ICU, Although preoperative treatment of iron deficiency anemia&#xD;
      is widely considered the most important domain of perioperative iron therapy, the additional&#xD;
      post-operative replacement is as useful as preoperative preparation and seems to be more&#xD;
      convenient to implement.&#xD;
