  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an frequent chronic and itchy inflammatory dermatitis which concern&#xD;
      about 20% of pediatric population with a revelation usually toward 3-6 months of live.&#xD;
      However, there are very few data about the prevalence of pruritus of young infants and about&#xD;
      the discomfort linked with it. While the skin and the nervous system of young infants (Under&#xD;
      6 month) are competent in pruritus experiment, the acquisition of conscious and deliberate&#xD;
      motor ability allowing specific scratching of the body parts which are affected is possible&#xD;
      only from 6 month. Thus, the diagnosis of AD intensity and the assesment of the potential&#xD;
      associated discomfort are hard. At the present time, the diagnosis and the assesment of&#xD;
      pruritus of children are based on a hetero-assesment via scales which are not applicable for&#xD;
      infants under 6 month. The visual scale &quot;Numeric Rating Scale&quot; validated in adult population&#xD;
      seems to be the most specific to assess AD severity. In pediatric population, the use of&#xD;
      &quot;Eppendorf Itch Questionnaire&quot; and the american version of &quot;Childhood Atopic Dermatitis&#xD;
      Impact Scale&quot; are recommended. Alternatives to clinic and subjective scoring of pruritus&#xD;
      severity are described via actigraphy. Thus, a strong statistic correlation have been&#xD;
      demonstrated between a nocturne measure of motor activity of wrist, as a reflect of the&#xD;
      intensity of pruritus, and infra-red video analysis. But, once again, the technic is not&#xD;
      adapted to young infants because of the absence of conscious and oriented motor ability and&#xD;
      as a result of less organised sleep/wake cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve young infants' (Under 6 month) care, the analysis of their behaviours&#xD;
      with AD seems to be necessary to better identify a discomfort of these patients.&#xD;
