  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost all patients with refractory cardiac arrest, who are primarily stabilized under&#xD;
      ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation by transcutaneous implantation of a venoarterial&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system (va-ECMO for eCPR) develop post-cardiac arrest&#xD;
      syndrome (PCAS). PCAS is characterised by cytokine storm resulting in vasodilation and&#xD;
      membrane leakage, which is poorly controlled and often fatal. Case reports and data from the&#xD;
      investigators' single-center registry indicate that cytokine adsorption with the CytoSorb&#xD;
      removal column can be safely added to va-ECMO, but its efficacy and safety have not been&#xD;
      examined systematically. This pilot study will assign all comers undergoing eCPR to va-ECMO&#xD;
      with or without cytokine adsorber in a 1:1 fashion. This will ensure comparability and allow&#xD;
      analysing clinical endpoints, but is limited by sample size (according to their experience&#xD;
      the investigators expect approximately 20 cases per year). The investigators will however be&#xD;
      able to generate important data about safety, secondary endpoints such as&#xD;
      Interleukin-6-removal or vasopressor use and low-power data about efficacy concerning the&#xD;
      primary endpoint 30-day survival.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) as well as intra-hospital cardiac arrest&#xD;
      (IHCA) is poor and remains on low levels over the past decades. Introduction of eCPR has&#xD;
      promised to improve survival, however, so far there is no supporting data for this claim. In&#xD;
      a recent registry study at the investigators' hospital they determined survival rates of 8.5%&#xD;
      (OHCA) and 18.9% (IHCA), respectively. Almost all patients with refractory cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      who are primarily stabilized under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation by transcutaneous&#xD;
      implantation of a veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system (va-ECMO for eCPR)&#xD;
      develop post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS). PCAS is characterised by cytokine storm&#xD;
      resulting in vasodilation and membrane leakage, which is poorly controlled and often fatal.&#xD;
      Case reports and data from the investigators' single-center registry indicate that cytokine&#xD;
      adsorption with the CytoSorb removal column can be safely added to va-ECMO, but its efficacy&#xD;
      and safety have not been examined systematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators aim to assess the influence of treatment with the CytoSorb removal&#xD;
      column over 72 hours after cardiac arrest and resuscitation using eCPR on 30-day-survival. As&#xD;
      secondary endpoints, the investigators will assess the efficacy of Interleukin-6-removal,&#xD;
      vasopressor-use and fluid-substitution, the latter two as a subsidiary of the degree of PCAS.&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators will asses the safety of the use of the CytoSorb column in&#xD;
      eCPR/va-ECMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of the CytoSorb column in eCPR/va-ECMO is a safe&#xD;
      and efficient means to manage the consequences of PCAS and thus reduce 30-day mortality after&#xD;
      eCPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to the investigators' hospital after successful CPR and implantation of&#xD;
      va-ECMO/ ECLS (extracorporeal life support, eCPR) will be included in the trial. In a 1:1&#xD;
      manner participants will be assigned to the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to standard treatment in patients undergoing eCPR in the intervention group the&#xD;
      CytoSorb removal column will be added to the ECLS-system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the control group will receive standard treatment established for eCPR patients&#xD;
      on our ICU. This standard treatment includes, among others, targeted temperature management&#xD;
      (TTM) for the first 72 hours. For the use of ECLS as well as TTM we are following well&#xD;
      established standard operating procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of intervention per patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the intervention will be 72 hours. Each CytoSorb removal column can be used&#xD;
      for 24 hours, so all patients in the intervention group will receive 3 subsequent filters&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up per patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period for each patient in the trial will be 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients admitted to our ICU after successful CPR undergoing eCPR will be included in the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The single exclusion criteria for the trial is, if decision has been made before admission to&#xD;
      our ICU to terminate treatment within the next 24 hours.&#xD;
