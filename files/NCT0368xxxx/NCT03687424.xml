  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is omnipresent problem in everyday anesthesiology practice associated with low level&#xD;
      of blood oxygen (hypoxemia) during analgo-sedation. Overweight outpatients are often&#xD;
      scheduled for colonoscopy usually undergo analgo-sedation. In obese patients, intravenous&#xD;
      analgo-sedation often diminish respiratory drive causing hypoxemia. To avoid hypoxemia,&#xD;
      low-flow nasal oxygenation (LFNO) of 2-6 L/min is applied via standard nasal catheter to&#xD;
      provide maximum 40 % of inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2). LFNO comprises applying cold and&#xD;
      dry oxygen which causes discomfort to nasal mucosa of patient. LFNO is often insufficient to&#xD;
      provide satisfying oxygenation. Insufficient oxygenation adds to circulatory instability -&#xD;
      heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other side, high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) brings 20 to 70 L/min of heated and&#xD;
      humidified of O2/air mixture up to 100% FiO2 via specially designed nasal cannula. Heated and&#xD;
      humidified O2/air mixture is much more agreeable to patient. HFNO brings noninvasive support&#xD;
      to patients' spontaneous breathing by producing continuous positive pressure of 3-7 cmH2O in&#xD;
      upper airways consequently enhancing oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators intend to analyze effect of HFNO vs. LFNO on oxygen saturation during&#xD;
      procedural analgo-sedation for colonoscopy in obese adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that obese patients with preserved spontaneous breathing, oxygenized by&#xD;
      HFNO vs. LFNO, will be less prone to hypoxemia thus more respiratory and circulatory stable&#xD;
      during procedural analgo-sedation for colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obese patients with applied HFNO should longer preserve: normal oxygen saturation, normal&#xD;
      level of CO2 and O2, reflecting better respiratory stability. Investigators expect obese&#xD;
      participnts to have more stable HR and BP, reflecting improved circulatory stability. There&#xD;
      will be less interruption of breathing pattern of obese patients and less necessity for&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist to intervene.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients are often scheduled for colonoscopy under analgo-sedation. Analgo-sedation is&#xD;
      characterized by deep conscious sedation and preserved spontaneous breathing. Continuous&#xD;
      intravenous application of sedatives favors patients' circulatory stability and application&#xD;
      of oxygenation contributes to maintaining adequate patients' oxygenation. Typically, low-flow&#xD;
      nasal oxygenation (LFNO) of 2-6 L/min is applied via standard nasal catheter to provide&#xD;
      maximum 40% of inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) before (preoxygenation), during (procedural&#xD;
      oxygenation) and after (postprocedural oxygenation) until patient regains consciousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During analgo-sedation obese patients are prone to intervals of bradypnea and&#xD;
      hypoventilation. Transitory apnea in obese patients could lead to hypoxemia, hypoxia,&#xD;
      hypercapnia and hemodynamic insufficiency despite LFNO application. Fatal outcome may occur,&#xD;
      especially at higher risk overweight patients (ASA III class). Respiratory and hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability of morbidly obese outpatients during analgo-sedation for endoscopic procedures&#xD;
      represent challenge to anesthesiologists. There is no generally accepted protocol of&#xD;
      preoxygenation and intraoperative ventilatory management for obese patients. Obese (30&lt;BMI&lt;40&#xD;
      kg/m2, BMI= body mass index) and morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) are classified to&#xD;
      higher anesthesia risk groups, even if obese patients may not have other comorbidities&#xD;
      (30&lt;BMI&lt;40 kg/m2 = ASA II, BMI ≥40 kg/m2 = ASA III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Partial relaxation of pharyngeal muscles characteristic for analgo-sedation in overweight&#xD;
      patients causes prolapse of fatty tissue that partially obstructs pharynx and can cause&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Although OSA is not related to obesity, OSA can accompany&#xD;
      obesity. Besides perioperatively, hypoxia and bradypnoea episodes occur postoperatively in&#xD;
      obese patients, which makes additional observation of obese patients necessary. More frequent&#xD;
      hypoxia and bradypnoea during awakening require additional respiratory effort. Ventilation&#xD;
      strategies in obese patients are necessary to optimize gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics&#xD;
      in order to reduce pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) brings 20 to 70 L/min heated and humidified O2/air mixture&#xD;
      up to 100% FiO2 via specially designed, soft nasal cannula. HFNO brings non-invasive support&#xD;
      to patients' inspiratory effort by developing 3-7 cmH2O of continuous pressure in upper&#xD;
      airway, decreasing it's resistance and dead space. Also, heated and humidified oxygen/air&#xD;
      mixture with possibility to bring higher FiO2 adds to better patients' oxygenation&#xD;
      preservation and improved patients' comfort during procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM of this study is to compare effect of HFNO vs. LFNO during standardized procedure of&#xD;
      intravenous analgo-sedation on periprocedural oxygenation maintenance in patients of&#xD;
      different weight groups: 18&lt;BMI&lt;30 kg/m2, 30&lt;BMI&lt;40 kg/m2 and BMI ≥40 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that application of HFNO compared to LFNO, in obese patients with&#xD;
      preserved spontaneous breathing during procedural analgo-sedation, contributes to maintaining&#xD;
      adequate oxygenation, consequently adding to greater peri-procedural circulatory and&#xD;
      respiratory stability of obese patients. Investigators expect that HFNO will ensure reduced&#xD;
      bradypnoea intervals (frequency of breathing, FoB 1/min), longer maintenance of adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation, shorter intervals of desaturation (SpO2 ≤ 92%), reducing hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 6&#xD;
      kPa) and less airway - opening maneuvers performed by attending anesthesiologist (Aom). These&#xD;
      will prevent partial respiratory insufficiency detected by low SpO2 or low PaO2 ≤ 11 kPa&#xD;
      accompanied by normal or low PaCO2 ≤ 6 kPa, and global respiratory insufficiency detected by&#xD;
      decreased SpO2 ≤ 92% and PaO2 ≤ 11 kPa with increased PaCO2 ≥ 6 kPa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Trial will be managed according to principles of Declaration of Helsinki for&#xD;
      scientific clinical research and will be planned and guided according to CONSORT guidelines&#xD;
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). The trial has been approved by hospital's Ethic&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source of information are going to be 126 adult patients scheduled for colonoscopy under&#xD;
      analgo-sedation in the setting of daily outpatient gastroenterology ambulance. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed and examined ambulatory by anesthesiologist together with&#xD;
      evaluation of ASA status, difficulty of airway management and BMI. After initial examination&#xD;
      inclusive and exclusive criteria will be distinguished. Eligible participants who give&#xD;
      written consent of participation will be included in this trial. After that, participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to equal normal weight (18&lt;BMI&lt;30 kg/m2), obese (30&lt;BMI&lt;40 kg/m2) or&#xD;
      morbidly obese (BMI ≥40 kg/m2) group. Each group will be randomized to intervention (HFNO)&#xD;
      and control (LFNO) subgroup by random numbers generator. Randomization will be used until&#xD;
      adequate number of participants in every group is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: intervention subgroups participants will be oxygenated via nasal cannula using&#xD;
      high flow (40 L/min) of humidified and heated oxygen in air mixture (FiO2 40%). HFNO will be&#xD;
      applied by oxygenator (AirVO™2, Fisher and Paykell, New Zealand, Technomedika Croatia d.o.o.)&#xD;
      during procedural analgo-sedation for colonoscopy with maintained spontaneous breathing. In&#xD;
      control subgroups, oxygenation will be applied via nasal catheter (Bauerfeind d.o.o, Zagreb,&#xD;
      Croatia) using standard low flow oxygen (5 L/min, FiO2 40%) LFNO. In both groups&#xD;
      concentration of oxygen delivered depends on oxygen flow which is regulated by standard&#xD;
      flow-regulator (flowmeter). Oxygen is delivered through pipelines from central hospital gas&#xD;
      supply or from portable cylinder gas supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia procedure will be uniformed for all participants. Integrated noninvasive&#xD;
      monitoring of vital functions will be set: EKG - (heart rate/min), SpO2 (%), blood pressure&#xD;
      (mmHg), indirect respiration (number of breaths/min) (Compact 7; Medical Econet GmbH,&#xD;
      Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have established intravenous infusion of 250 ml NaCl 0.9% through&#xD;
      intravenous cannula regulated by continuous flow (Extension set/CONTROL-A-FLO Regulator 19&quot;&#xD;
      Male Luer Lock Adapter, Baxter/Agmar d.o.o. United States of America/Croatia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial cannula (REF30401, 20 G - 1,10 mm x 45 mm 49 ml, atraumatic needle tip, Medbar LTD,&#xD;
      Izmir, Turkey) will be placed in radial artery in a previously anesthetized area with local&#xD;
      anesthetic (EMLA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygenation (HFNO or LFNO) will be administrated in continuity until patients' awakening.&#xD;
      Oxygenation will be started 3 minutes before starting analgo-sedation (preoxygenation),&#xD;
      continued during analgo-sedation and procedure of colonoscopy (perioperative oxygenation) and&#xD;
      up to five minutes after colonoscopy and until patient is awaken (postprocedural&#xD;
      oxygenation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous analgo-sedation will be started through continuous infusions of propofol and&#xD;
      fentanyl. Induction of sedation will be guided by TCI (Target control Infusion) (B. Braun&#xD;
      Melsungen, Germany) with initial target propofol concentration of 6 micrograms/minute.&#xD;
      Expected time of induction with this concentration is 60-120 seconds. This target&#xD;
      concentration allows hemodynamic and respiratory stability. Required analgesia will be&#xD;
      simultaneously applied through slow continuous infusion in dose of 0.05 mcg/kg/min in order&#xD;
      to preserve spontaneous breathing. Slow infusion will be applied through perfusor (B.Braun,&#xD;
      Melsungen, Germany). Analgo-sedation will be discontinued immediately after end of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of nasopharyngeal airway passage during procedure is achieved by using oropharyngeal&#xD;
      airway, if necessary. Oropharyngeal airway (Airway; Vigon-Medicpro d.o.o.) will be inserted&#xD;
      after achieving moderate sedation, and only if base of tongue is closing airway by dropping&#xD;
      on posterior pharyngeal wall. Every manipulation of patients' airway by anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      be documented (insertion of airway, jaw thrust maneuver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: one milliliter of arterial blood will be collected as three consecutive samples&#xD;
      from arterial cannula before, during and after analgo-sedation. Sample of arterial blood will&#xD;
      be drawn from left radial or cubital artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: measurement of oxygenation will be done using two methods: indirect&#xD;
      (noninvasive) method using pulse oxymeter (Compact 7, Medical ECONET GmbH, Germany) and&#xD;
      direct (invasive) method from obtained arterial blood sample. Measurement of SpO2 and drawing&#xD;
      arterial blood sample will be done simultaneously. Direct measurements of SpO2 and PaO2 will&#xD;
      be taken in intervals of time. SpO2 will be measured on the left-hand index finger. Data will&#xD;
      be uniformly collected through indirect - noninvasive (SpO2, heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
      respiratory rate) and direct - invasive (arterial blood gas analysis - pH, PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2)&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible biases and confounding variables could be caused by hypothermia of participant, by&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer cuff pressure on the same arm where blood samples are drawn and by prolonged&#xD;
      time of arterial blood analysis. These difficulties can be bypassed by: adjustment of room&#xD;
      temperature where analgo-sedation is performed, blood pressure measuring on opposite arm from&#xD;
      where samples of blood are taken and by arterial blood gas analysis without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic data analyses will be performed by statistician. Sample size is determined by statistic&#xD;
      computing web program: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize used statistic test&#xD;
      Inference for Proportions: Comparing Two Independent Samples. Assessment of sample size is&#xD;
      computed for two independent samples with assumption of clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      patients' oxygenation: ≤11 and ≥14.4 kPa with delta 4.4. Statistical significance of&#xD;
      difference will be inferred with 5% α-error, 50% β-error and study power 0.80. Calculated&#xD;
      size of sample is: 21 participant pro subgroup (total of 126 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect no changes to methods after trial commencement. All potential unwanted&#xD;
      events which may happen during analgo-sedation and colonoscopy that could cause deviation&#xD;
      from this trial's protocol will be reason for exclusion of participant from this trial. If&#xD;
      circumstances change, anesthesiologist responsible for application of anesthesia will carry&#xD;
      out procedure in way which is in patients' best interest.&#xD;
