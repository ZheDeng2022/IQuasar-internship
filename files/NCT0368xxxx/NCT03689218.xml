    <textblock>
      The World Food Programme (WFP) has signed MoU with Planning and Development Department of&#xD;
      Balochistan in collaboration with Nutrition Cell and National Programme for Family Planning&#xD;
      and Primary Health Care, Balochistan for the prevention of stunting. The project will utilize&#xD;
      the window of opportunity (1000 days from conception to 2 years) for addressing stunting in&#xD;
      children under-two years. Therefore project will recruit pregnant women during first&#xD;
      trimester and newborns who delivered from recruited pregnant women will be followed until the&#xD;
      age of 2 years. Children 6-12 months of age will be enrolled and followed until the age of&#xD;
      two years. The interventions included nutritional supplements during pregnancy, lactation and&#xD;
      for children during 6-24 months of age. The project will be implemented in Lady Health&#xD;
      Workers (LHWs) covered areas of districts Pishin and Quetta, Balochistan.&#xD;

      The World Food Programme (WFP) has signed MoU with Planning and Development Department of&#xD;
      Balochistan in collaboration with Nutrition Cell and National Programme for Family Planning&#xD;
      and Primary Health Care, Balochistan for the prevention of stunting. The Stunting Prevention&#xD;
      interventions will contribute to revert the trends of chronic malnutrition among children&#xD;
      less than 5 years of age. The intervention is coupled with plans to document the impact&#xD;
      through credible evidence generation in collaboration with academic institute/s through a&#xD;
      research based study in Pishin and Quetta Districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balochistan is the most underdeveloped areas of Pakistan with a very poor health and&#xD;
      nutrition situation. According to the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 2011, the prevalence of&#xD;
      stunting in Balochistan is 52% amongst the highest rates in the country. The prevalence of&#xD;
      wasting in Balochistan is 16%, indicating a public health emergency. Women and children also&#xD;
      suffer from some of the world's highest levels of vitamin and mineral deficiencies with&#xD;
      maternal anaemia at 47% in Balochistan and Vitamin A deficiency in children at 74% in&#xD;
      Balochistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a number of nutrition approaches and actions have been implemented in Pakistan at&#xD;
      various times, there hasn't been a comprehensive approach to prevent under nutrition in&#xD;
      general, and stunting specifically. WFP &amp; MOH will be implementing the nutrition&#xD;
      interventions, and this proposal is widely implemented/evaluated in Pakistan, so the project&#xD;
      aims to contribute towards to fill the evidence gap for the prevention of stunting through&#xD;
      multisectoral approaches coupled with appropriate complementary practices in Balochistan. The&#xD;
      evidence base for undernutrition and stunting prevention globally is actually quite well&#xD;
      established. There is existent evidence that points to the need to intervene during gestation&#xD;
      and the first two years of life (1000 days) to prevent child undernutrition and its&#xD;
      consequences. It suggests that investments in interventions during this window of opportunity&#xD;
      are likely to have the greatest benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the project will be measured in terms of the impact of the proposed&#xD;
      interventions on the stunting and nutritional outcomes in the target group (children and&#xD;
      PLW). Given the conditions of project implementation, a mixed-methods study design including&#xD;
      formative research, cross-sectional baseline &amp; endline surveys, cluster randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) and process evaluation would be appropriate to assess the impact of the&#xD;
      intervention. The control clusters will receive routine public and private health services&#xD;
      available in the area. The RCT will utilize the window of opportunity (1000 days from&#xD;
      conception to 2 years) for addressing stunting in children under-two years. A cohort of&#xD;
      children between the age of 6-12 month will also be enrolled in the study and will be&#xD;
      followed up to the age of 24 months.&#xD;
