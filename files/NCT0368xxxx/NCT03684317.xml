  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abuse of analgesics represents an important part of prescription drug abuse. The consequences&#xD;
      in terms of morbidity and mortality at the population level could reach worryingly high&#xD;
      levels, as illustrated by the US context. This issue should not focus only on opioid&#xD;
      analgesics, but must also account for some antiepileptics or antidepressants with abuse&#xD;
      potential (for example, pregabalin or gabapentin). In France, reports related to tramadol&#xD;
      abuse are increasing, in particular since dextropropoxyphene withdrawal. Trends of growing&#xD;
      abuse are also reported for other analgesics. Patients with no history of primary dependence&#xD;
      constituted a significant proportion of those developing a tramadol abuse. There is therefore&#xD;
      a need for early identification of these patients and to raise awareness of health&#xD;
      professionals on this issue, in particular in primary care. Given the extensive use of&#xD;
      analgesic drugs in France, the problem of primary dependence should not be neglected. Since&#xD;
      it will affect people who have no history of drug abuse, strategies for identification and&#xD;
      prevention are differing from a population already using psychotropic products for example.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, prescription drug abuse has been considered in terms of the secondary or tertiary&#xD;
      prevention, and primary prevention remains poorly explored. By reconstructing the entire&#xD;
      trajectories of patients having developed primary drug dependence, from the genesis of first&#xD;
      drug exposures, investigators will identify patients' profiles and early changes in drug use&#xD;
      that could accurately predict future complications. Pharmacoepidemiological methods are&#xD;
      particularly relevant in the field of abuse and drug dependence. By definition, specialized&#xD;
      care seeking can only be achieved after emergence and identification of the problem.&#xD;
      Outpatients data obtained through medico-administrative database are then the only source of&#xD;
      evidence that could enable to ascertain accurately history of past drug consumption&#xD;
