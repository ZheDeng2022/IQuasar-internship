  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 20 million Americans report use of cannabis in the past month, and heavy cannabis use&#xD;
      has increased by nearly 60% in the U.S. since 2007. Heavy cannabis use is associated with&#xD;
      lower educational attainment, reduced physical activity, and increased rates of addiction,&#xD;
      unemployment, and neuropsychological deficits. Studies by the lab and others suggest that&#xD;
      cannabis use is also associated with increased mental health symptoms and suicidal and&#xD;
      nonsuicidal self-injury. In addition, cannabis is the illicit drug most strongly associated&#xD;
      with drugged driving and traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. There is evidence that&#xD;
      sustained abstinence from cannabis can lead to improvements in the functional outcomes of&#xD;
      former users. However, he degree to which reductions in cannabis use might be associated with&#xD;
      positive changes in functional outcomes is currently unknown. The overall objective of the&#xD;
      present research is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a real-time, naturalistic&#xD;
      data collection method, to study the impact of reduced cannabis use on functional outcomes in&#xD;
      heavy cannabis users. Contingency management (CM) will be used to promote reductions in&#xD;
      frequency and quantity of cannabis use. CM is an intensive behavioral therapy that is highly&#xD;
      effective at producing short-term reductions in illicit drug use. The investigators novel&#xD;
      approach includes mobile technology to make CM more portable and feasible. The present&#xD;
      research will use this technology in conjunction with state-of-the-art EMA methods to study&#xD;
      the impact of reduced cannabis use on key functional outcomes. The investigators central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that reductions in frequency and quantity of cannabis use will lead to positive&#xD;
      changes in cannabis users' mental health, physical activity, working memory, health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, and driving behavior.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Nearly 20 million Americans report use of cannabis in the past month, and heavy cannabis use&#xD;
      has increased by nearly 60% in the U.S. since 2007. Heavy cannabis use is associated with&#xD;
      lower educational attainment, reduced physical activity, and increased rates of addiction,&#xD;
      unemployment, and neuropsychological deficits. Studies by the lab and others suggest that&#xD;
      cannabis use is also associated with increased mental health symptoms and suicidal and&#xD;
      nonsuicidal self-injury. In addition, cannabis is the illicit drug most strongly associated&#xD;
      with drugged driving and traffic accidents, including fatal accidents. While there is&#xD;
      evidence that sustained abstinence can lead to improvements in the functional outcomes of&#xD;
      former users, the degree to which reductions in cannabis use alone (i.e., in the absence of&#xD;
      sustained abstinence) might be associated with positive changes in functional outcomes is&#xD;
      currently unknown. This is a critical gap in the literature, as many clinical interventions&#xD;
      for cannabis and other drugs are associated with decreases in frequency and quantity of use,&#xD;
      but fail to achieve an effect on overall abstinence rates. The overall objective of the&#xD;
      present research is to use ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a real-time, naturalistic&#xD;
      data collection method, to prospectively study the impact of reduced cannabis use on&#xD;
      functional outcomes in heavy cannabis users. EMA addresses several limitations of traditional&#xD;
      assessment techniques by enhancing ecological validity, minimizing memory bias, and enabling&#xD;
      examination of the impact of context on participants' behavior. Contingency management (CM)&#xD;
      will be used to promote reductions in frequency and quantity of cannabis use. CM is an&#xD;
      intensive behavioral therapy that is highly effective at producing short-term reductions in&#xD;
      illicit drug use. Moreover, the investigators have recently developed a novel approach that&#xD;
      leverages mobile technology and recent developments in cannabis testing to make CM for&#xD;
      cannabis more portable and feasible. The investigators have pilot-tested this approach with&#xD;
      heavy cannabis users and found that it is an acceptable and feasible method to reduce their&#xD;
      cannabis use. The present research will use this technology in conjunction with&#xD;
      state-of-the-art EMA methods to study the impact of reduced cannabis use on key functional&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators central hypothesis is that reductions in frequency and quantity&#xD;
      of cannabis use will lead to positive changes in cannabis users' mental health, physical&#xD;
      activity, working memory, health-related quality of life, and driving behavior. The rationale&#xD;
      for this research is that it will provide the first and only real-time data concerning the&#xD;
      potential impact of reductions in cannabis use on functional outcomes. As such, the findings&#xD;
      from the present research will directly inform ongoing efforts to include reductions in&#xD;
      illicit drug use as a valid, clinically-meaningful outcome measure in clinical trials of&#xD;
      pharmacotherapies for the treatment of substance use disorders.&#xD;
