  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ideal interventions for the older aged population would be those that are easily accessible&#xD;
      and associated with minimal burden on family members, the healthcare system and the&#xD;
      individuals themselves. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) therapy and Transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) are two interventions that may be effective in targeting&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in individuals with anxiety, depression, and/or cognitive complaints. MBSR&#xD;
      has been shown to decrease symptoms of depression and improve cognition and tDCS has been&#xD;
      shown to improve cognition in the older aged population. The effectiveness of these two&#xD;
      interventions combined to elicit changes in cognition has yet to be demonstrated. Therefore,&#xD;
      the overall aim of the current research is to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of MBSR&#xD;
      and tDCS to improve cognitive function in individuals with cognitive complaints and symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized pilot study. Sixteen individuals (separated into 2 groups of 8)&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive a combination MBSR + active tDCS or MBSR + sham tDCS over 8&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will visit the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) once per&#xD;
      week for in-class group sessions and will complete the intervention daily at home for the&#xD;
      duration of the study. Participants will be aged 60 and older with cognitive complaints, with&#xD;
      symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Participants will be trained to self-administer tDCS&#xD;
      and given guidelines for the completion of daily MBSR activities at home. It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the combination of active tDCS + MBSR will enhance cognition compared to the combination&#xD;
      of sham tDCS + MBSR.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive difficulties are a common problem in the older adult population. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown memory complaints are higher in older adults with depression or anxiety&#xD;
      versus those without these diagnoses. This suggests that mood symptoms, or a diagnosis of a&#xD;
      mood disorder, may represent significant predictors of cognitive impairment. If left&#xD;
      untreated, symptoms of depression and memory complaints may lead to greater cognitive&#xD;
      impairment i.e. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and diagnosis of dementia . Therefore, early&#xD;
      interventions are urgently needed to prevent decline in memory and cognitive function in&#xD;
      individuals with MCI, depression, and/or anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized study design. Uo to 24 individuals (n=8 per group) will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive a combination of 8-weeks of in-class group MBSR + active or sham tDCS&#xD;
      and daily at-home MBSR + tDCS (active or sham). Each individual must be: (1) 60 or above; (2)&#xD;
      present with cognitive complaints but not frank cognitive impairment (at a level of mild&#xD;
      dementia or greater); and (3) present with a diagnosis or symptoms of depressed mood and/or&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptoms related to cognition, memory, and mood symptoms will be assessed at baseline (T0),&#xD;
      throughout the study, as described in the MBSR protocol, and upon completion of the 8-week&#xD;
      treatment course (Tx). Each study participant will have a clinical assessment at both T0 and&#xD;
      Tx. Clinicians, participants and assessors will be blinded to the tDCS condition. These&#xD;
      assessments will confirm any diagnoses and monitor clinical stability, including possible&#xD;
      progression of participants to a diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder(s) or dementia.&#xD;
      Any participant that progresses into a clinical diagnosis of dementia will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study and referred to an appropriate level of care based on the severity of their&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To train participants on the tDCS intervention, each individual will attend one-week of&#xD;
      in-class training sessions prior to initiating the 8-week study. Participants will come to&#xD;
      the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) for 5 days leading up to the initiation of&#xD;
      the MBSR treatment for tDCS self-administration training. On the final day of tDCS training,&#xD;
      participants will attend a 2.5 hour in-class MBSR orientation session. Following this, the&#xD;
      8-week course of daily MBSR + tDCS will begin with an initial orientation session. The&#xD;
      remaining 8 weeks of the at-home MBSR + tDCS intervention will be self-conducted at each&#xD;
      participant's place of residence, with the exception of the weekly MBSR class each&#xD;
      participant will be required to attend at CAMH. The study coordinator will be available by&#xD;
      phone to the participants throughout the study.&#xD;
