    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study evaluating safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of PF-06952229 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multi center, multiple dose, dose escalation and expansion,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics study of PF 06952229 in previously treated&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic cancers that may have high TGFbeta signatures and EMT&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes Parts 1A and 1B, which are dose-escalation for monotherapy and combination&#xD;
      therapy with enzalutamide, respectively, and Parts 2A and 2B, which are dose expansion for&#xD;
      monotherapy and combination therapy with enzalutamide, respectively.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For Part 1A: Histological or cytological diagnosis of a solid tumor that is&#xD;
             advanced/metastatic, patients are intolerant to standard treatment, resistant to&#xD;
             standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available for the following tumor&#xD;
             types:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Breast cancer; Prostate cancer (mCRPC testosterone less than 50 ng/dL); Squamous cell&#xD;
             cancer of the head and neck; Melanoma; Mesothelioma; Pancreatic cancer; Colorectal&#xD;
             cancer; Renal cell carcinoma; Hepatocellular cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For Part 1B:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  histological or cytological diagnosis of mCRPC 3 Part 2A and Part 2B:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma metastatic&#xD;
                  disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Effective castration with serum testosterone levels 0.5 ng/mL (1.7 nmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having received 3 or more cycles of prior docetaxel therapy (before or after&#xD;
                  abiraterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Having PD while receiving abiraterone acetate within 12 months of abiraterone&#xD;
                  treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progressive disease (PD) by:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Progression in measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patient with&#xD;
                       measurable disease must have at least 1 lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
                       measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each&#xD;
                       lesion must be at least 10 mm when measured by computed tomography (CT) (CT&#xD;
                       scan thickness no greater than 5 mm) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
                       Lymph nodes should be greater than or equal to 15 mm in short axis. As&#xD;
                       defined by PCWG2, if lymph node metastasis is the only evidence of&#xD;
                       metastasis, it must be greater than or equal to 20 mm in diameter when&#xD;
                       measured by spiral CT or MRI. Previously irradiated lesions, primary&#xD;
                       prostate lesion, and bone lesions will be considered non-measurable disease,&#xD;
                       or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Appearance of 2 or more new bone lesions (PCWG2). They must be confirmed by&#xD;
                       other imaging modalities (CT; MRI) if ambiguous results, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Rising PSA defined (PCWG2) as at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA to be&#xD;
                       documented over a reference value (measure 1) taken at least 1 week apart. •&#xD;
                       Prior abiraterone acetate must be stopped at least 2 weeks before study&#xD;
                       treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients must have recently obtained archival tumor tissue available for submission to&#xD;
        the sponsor (except for Part 2A - monotherapy dose expansion). Patients enrolled in Part 1&#xD;
        and Part 2 should have access to their archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material,&#xD;
        collected within 6 months of screening, containing tumor that is of diagnostic quality and&#xD;
        representative of their diagnosed malignancy or whenever possible, consent to undergo a&#xD;
        biopsy during screening. The sponsor should be contacted if obtaining a new biopsy is not&#xD;
        medically feasible for approval to enroll, prior to initiating screening activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patients entering the study in the subgroup(s) requiring mandatory pre- and on treatment&#xD;
