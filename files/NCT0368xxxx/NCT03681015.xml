  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate disease progression in persons with early Parkinson&#xD;
      disease, as assessed by digital and electronic sensor data collection to be correlated with&#xD;
      typical clinical assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be evaluated via both in-clinic and at-home assessments. The in-clinic&#xD;
      assessments are designed to compare the ability of current Parkinson disease clinical trial&#xD;
      measures with the ability of mobile and wearable devices to detect disease progression in the&#xD;
      early stage of disease. The at-home assessments are designed to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      motor and non-motor assessments of disease progression using a commercially available&#xD;
      wearable device/mobile application platform and to determine how this data compares with&#xD;
      traditional clinical measures.&#xD;
