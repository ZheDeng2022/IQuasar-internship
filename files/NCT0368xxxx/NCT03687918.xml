  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate combines T2-weighted&#xD;
      imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Correlation with&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy specimens has demonstrated that mpMRI has excellent sensitivity in&#xD;
      detecting prostate cancers (PCa) with a Gleason score ≥7 and cancers with a Gleason 6 and a&#xD;
      volume ≥0.5 cc. Nevertheless, its specificity is poor and there is large overlapping between&#xD;
      the appearances of benign and malignant prostate lesions. As a result, the use of a 5-point&#xD;
      subjective score has been widely encouraged to describe the level of suspicion of prostate&#xD;
      lesions. This so-called 'Likert score' is a highly significant predictor of the malignant&#xD;
      nature of prostate focal lesions. However, because there are no descriptions of specific&#xD;
      criteria to be used in the scoring process, the Likert score relies heavily on the reader's&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to standardize mpMRI interpretation, the European Society of Urogenital&#xD;
      Radiology and the American College of Radiology recently endorsed the so-called Prostate&#xD;
      Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) score. The second version of this scoring system&#xD;
      (PI-RADS v2 score) gave good results in characterizing prostate focal lesions. However,&#xD;
      Inter-reader agreement remains moderate at best, even after training, and there is still a&#xD;
      high-rate of false positives. These results have led some authors to suggest that there might&#xD;
      be structural limits to the ability of any score based on MR imaging to allow detection of&#xD;
      prostate cancer with high specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) image features to characterize prostate lesions&#xD;
      seen on mpMRI could improve interpretation standardization, and recently, several&#xD;
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems combining various image features have shown promising&#xD;
      results in characterizing prostate tissues. However, most CAD systems have been trained and&#xD;
      evaluated on images from the same MR scanner. Unfortunately, quantification in MR imaging is&#xD;
      limited by substantial inter-manufacturer variability in the calculation of quantitative&#xD;
      image parameters. The quantitative thresholds defined for one manufacturer may therefore not&#xD;
      be valid for another manufacturer. Of the many reported CAD systems, only few have shown&#xD;
      robust results at cross-validation in datasets from different manufacturers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed in Lyon a mpMRI CAD system for discriminating Gleason ≥7 cancers in the&#xD;
      peripheral zone (PZ). That CAD system was trained using mpMRI from patients treated by&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy. It combines the 10th percentile of the apparent diffusion coefficient&#xD;
      (ADC_10th) and the time to the peak of enhancement (TTP) at dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)&#xD;
      imaging. It provided good results when cross-validated in two datasets from two different&#xD;
      manufacturers (General Electric and Philips). We then tested the CAD on a cohort of 130&#xD;
      patients who underwent mpMRI (General Electric or Philips MR unit) before prostate biopsy.&#xD;
      Each MR lesion targeted at biopsy had prospectively received a Likert score of likelihood of&#xD;
      malignancy at the time of the biopsy. Retrospective analysis of these MR lesions with the CAD&#xD;
      showed that the stand-alone CAD outperformed the Likert score in predicting the presence of&#xD;
      Gleason ≥7 cancer at biopsy (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC):&#xD;
      0.94 (95% confidence interval (95CI): 0.90-0.98 versus 0.81 (95CI: 0.75-0.88), p&lt;0.0002)).&#xD;
      These good results encourage us to perform an external validation of the CAD testing its&#xD;
      performance on mpMRI from another manufacturer (Siemens) and another institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the DIJON-CAD study is to evaluate the performances of the QCAD&#xD;
      developed in Lyon (QCAD/Lyon) in a cohort of consecutive patients treated by prostatectomy&#xD;
      and who underwent preoperative mpMRI on a Siemens 3 Tesla MR imager at the Dijon University&#xD;
      Hospital center or at the Dijon Cancer Center (both institutions share the same MR unit).&#xD;
      This study is the first step of the external validation of the QCAD/Lyon system. It is only&#xD;
      aimed at verifying that the diagnostic performance of the system is not very poor on external&#xD;
      mpMRI (which is a substantial risk). If the results are good, a proper multicentric&#xD;
      prospective validation study will be planned.&#xD;
