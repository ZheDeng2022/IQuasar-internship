      The goal of the current study is to objectively measure intraoperative the initial thumb&#xD;
      stability after trapezium removal when performing trapeziectomy, alone or in combination with&#xD;
      suspension and tendon interposition and to evaluate if there are differences in the stability&#xD;
      between the patients and with the different surgical steps. Additionally, the subjective&#xD;
      stability rating of the surgeon will be compared with the objective measures and if there is&#xD;
      a correlation between clinical/patient-related parameters and the measured intraoperative&#xD;
      stability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint (CMC I OA) treatment strategies typically&#xD;
      focus on pain relief and restoring motion and function. Besides different other treatment&#xD;
      modalities, such as trapeziectomy (removal of the trapezium bone) alone, the&#xD;
      resection-suspension-interposition arthroplasty (after trapezium resection additional&#xD;
      stabilisation with a tendon strip) (LRTI) are the most popular interventions. When performing&#xD;
      trapeziectomy, alone or in combination with suspension and tendon interposition, the surgeon&#xD;
      perceives individual differences in joint stability. However, there are no quantitative data&#xD;
      available on the stability of the CMC I joint after trapeziectomy. Furthermore, the relative&#xD;
      contribution of the different surgical steps to the stability of the joint is unknown. The&#xD;
      goal of the current study is to objectively measure intraoperative thumb stability and&#xD;
      evaluate if there are differences in the stability between the patients and with the&#xD;
      different surgical steps. Additionally, the subjective stability rating of the surgeon will&#xD;
      be compared with the objective measures. Additionally, the subjective stability rating of the&#xD;
      surgeon will be compared with the objective measures and if there is a correlation between&#xD;
      clinical/patient-related parameters and the measured intraoperative stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 1: Patient enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preoperative consultation, the surgeon identifies patients which meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Before any study specific examinations are performed, the patient has to&#xD;
      give written informed consent to participate in the study according to the clinical&#xD;
      investigation protocol. Patients will have enough time to decide for or against participation&#xD;
      until before the surgery (usually one-six weeks after the consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion in the study, documented by patient informed consent, the following data will&#xD;
      be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Z-deformity will be measured with a goniometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grip strength of the affected hand will be measured with the help of a Jamar dynamometer&#xD;
           and key pinch will be measured using a pinch gauge. Both measurements are performed&#xD;
           three times. For each of these, the average of the three measurements is taken. The&#xD;
           standardized testing position as recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists&#xD;
           will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability to oppose the thumb will be quantified using the Kapandji index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint laxity will be quantified using the Beighton Hypermobility Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  X-rays will be rated for the stage of OA according to the criteria described by Eaton &amp;&#xD;
           Littler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the participant answers questions about his/her hand usage in daily life, pain&#xD;
      and completes the brief Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure 2: Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After trapeziectomy according to the standard surgical procedure, the surgeon subjectively&#xD;
      rates the CMC I joint stability (stable, somewhat stable and instable) by displacing the&#xD;
      thumb proximally. The objective stability measurement is performed after the subjective&#xD;
      assessment: The hand is standardized positioned in a pinch grip position. A standard&#xD;
      reposition forceps is attached to the base of the first metacarpal bone. Next, the reposition&#xD;
      forceps is connected to the force sensor and the thumb ray displaced by 10 mm towards the&#xD;
      scaphoid with a guide. While the counteracting forces are measured with a force sensor. This&#xD;
      procedure is applied by the surgeon after every step of the LRTI surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Trapeziectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Suspension&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interposition&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Closing of the joint capsule&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement is repeated three times for every step. A high value indicates high&#xD;
      stability. For blinding purposes, the surgeon will not see the measurement results.&#xD;

        The study population consists of patients with CMC I joint osteoarthritis and an indication&#xD;
        for LRTI. In the Schulthess Klinik, around 150 interventions of resection of the trapezium&#xD;
        with LRTI are performed per year. Therefore many patients are available.&#xD;
