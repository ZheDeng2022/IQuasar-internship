  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nuclear lamina (LN) consists of a network of proteins interposed between the chromatin&#xD;
      and the internal nucleic membrane, to which it is closely associated. LN consists essentially&#xD;
      of lamins encoded by the LMNA (Lamines A / C), LMNB1 and LMNB2 genes (BI, B2, B3 lamins).&#xD;
      Malfunctions of the A / C-type laminates causing the production of a toxic isoform called&#xD;
      progerin are directly responsible for various serious pathologies such as Progeria&#xD;
      Hutchingson-Gilford. This rare disease is characterized by accelerated pathological aging.&#xD;
      Moreover, it is known that progerin is produced in the absence of any mutation of the gene&#xD;
      LMNA is involved in the physiological aging of tissus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ovarian reserve of a woman is a parameter that changes with age. Although this&#xD;
      progressive loss is inevitable in the course of life, the kinetics of this ovarian exhaustion&#xD;
      appear variable according to the women, sometimes leading to an accelerated loss causing a&#xD;
      discordance between the female age and the ovarian age. But ovarian age becomes a major&#xD;
      prognostic parameter to be taken into account during any attempt at medical assistance to&#xD;
      procreation (AMP) and is often incriminated in the failures of MPAs. There are currently few&#xD;
      markers to predict the quality of ovarian response of women to ovarian stimulation, let alone&#xD;
      the quality of the oocytes retrieved. However, their quality directly influences their&#xD;
      ability to give an evolving embryo and therefore a pregnancy Our team has previously shown&#xD;
      that type B laminates are involved in human spermiogenesis, and highlighted the human B3&#xD;
      isoform. These very encouraging results obtained on human spermatogenesis, have prompted us&#xD;
      to also look at the potential interest of the exploration of the nuclear lamina within the&#xD;
      human ovary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is therefore to continue the exploration of the nuclear lamina and&#xD;
      its potential role on the quality of human gametes, by studying the follicular ovarian cells&#xD;
      surrounding the oocyte. These cells express A / C type lamins and sometime progerin&#xD;
      Investigators want to conduct a prospective pilot study in a cohort of 40 women in MPA, aged&#xD;
      between 20 and 42 years. The main objective is to compare the levels of expression of the A /&#xD;
      C, B and progerin laminae in the follicular cells of 2 groups of women: a group of infertile&#xD;
      patients managed to induce ovulation in order to Intraconjugal AMP and a group of women&#xD;
      managed to induce ovulation to give their oocytes. For this purpose, investigators will&#xD;
      analyze the expression of the A / C and B lamins in RT-PCR, the localization of the lamins&#xD;
      and progerin in immunofluorescence, and will look for quantitative variations in the&#xD;
      production of A / C and / or progerin lamins by western- blot, depending on the age of the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will allow investigators to characterize for the first time the LN of human&#xD;
      follicular cells. They should highlight variations in the expression and / or localization of&#xD;
      lamins and possibly progerin in patients tested according to their age and / or ovarian&#xD;
      reserve. The team preliminary results showed that this track deserves to be explored. This is&#xD;
      an excellent opportunity to bring new insights into the understanding of the mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible for alteration of ovarian reserve in women and the prognosis of MPA attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this approach could serve as a basis for a larger, multicenter study. These markers&#xD;
      could represent new diagnostic markers to be taken into account to evaluate the chances of&#xD;
      pregnancy of each woman in AMP.&#xD;
