  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare nicotine uptake and product use behavior during and&#xD;
      following use of two moist snuff products in generally healthy, adult moist snuff users.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an single-blind, multi-center, randomized, two-way crossover study, conducted in&#xD;
      generally healthy, adult moist snuff users who will be randomly assigned to the order in&#xD;
      which they will use two moist snuff study products (comparator product, test product). The&#xD;
      study will evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) measures for two moist snuff products in a 7-day&#xD;
      confinement setting.&#xD;
