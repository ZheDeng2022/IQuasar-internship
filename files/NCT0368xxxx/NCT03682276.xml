      The PRIME-HCC trial will assess the effects of combination treatment with nivolumab (OPDIVO)&#xD;
      and ipilimumab (YERVOY) pre-operatively in hepatocellular carcinoma patients for whom liver&#xD;
      resection is planned. The trial will be conducted at a small number of National Health&#xD;
      Service hospitals in the UK. Participants will receive two doses of nivolumab and a single&#xD;
      dose of ipilimumab in the weeks before their planned surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label study to be conducted in 32 patients at a small number of UK&#xD;
      hospitals. The study is in 2 parts: Part 1 will confirm, in a small number of patients, that&#xD;
      the treatment regimen is safe and doesn't result in unacceptable delay to liver resection.&#xD;
      Part 2 will expand the number of patients studied, and provide the opportunity to assess&#xD;
      survival over about 2 years after liver resection. The decision to proceed to Part 2 will be&#xD;
      taken with advice from an independent, expert committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with early-stage HCC will first undergo screening procedures during a 28-day time&#xD;
      window between giving consent and starting drug treatment. Screening procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour imaging by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour imaging by CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting the protocol-specified criteria will be enrolled and on Day 1 will have the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous dose of ipilimumab ('YERVOY') 1 milligram per kilogram body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 22 the participants will have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous dose of nivolumab ('OPDIVO') 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 43 the participants will have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour imaging by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample (optional)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who remain eligible for liver resection will likely undergo surgery within a few&#xD;
      days of the Day 43 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 127 the participants will have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical interview, and physical exam (if required)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumour imaging by MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 months thereafter until 2 years later, or until starting another anti-cancer&#xD;
      treatment, participants will have tumour imaging by MRI.&#xD;
