  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) are among the most common types of head and neck&#xD;
      cancers and are a major cause of significant morbidity. It was reported that 16- 62% of OSCCs&#xD;
      develop from premalignant lesions, which often presents clinically as white or red mucosal&#xD;
      patches known as leukoplakia and erythroplakia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of miRNA in cancer has been established by many studies that have shown that miRNA&#xD;
      signatures (i.e., mRNA expression profiles) can be useful for classifying human cancers.&#xD;
      These studies have identified &quot;cancer related miRNAs through investigating expression&#xD;
      profiles in matched normal and tumor tissues, as well as in body fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin, one of most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents, has recently received&#xD;
      increased attention because of its potential anti-tumorigenic effects that are thought to be&#xD;
      independent of its hypoglycemic effects. Evans et al. first found an association between&#xD;
      metformin use and decreased cancer incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will reveal whether Systemic Metformin hydrochloride treatment given to patients&#xD;
      with oral potentially malignant lesions improve the prognosis and prevent or at least reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of malignant transformation?&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The idea of identifying oral lesions with a precancerous nature, that is, in the sense of&#xD;
      pertaining to a pathologic process with an increased risk for future malignant development,&#xD;
      of course, is to prevent frank malignancy to occur in the affected area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2005, WHO categorized any lesion or condition that may increase the risk of malignant&#xD;
      transformation as an 'oral potentially malignant disorder' (OPMD). Early detection of cancer&#xD;
      development from oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) plays an important role in successful&#xD;
      therapy. The management of OPMDs varies according to the type of lesion and often differs&#xD;
      between treatment centers. However, it remains unclear if excision of&#xD;
      leukoplakia/erythroplakia protects patients against the development of OSCC and no randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials have been performed to address this issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various treatment modalities, such as systemic therapies and surgical removal, have been&#xD;
      suggested. The systemic therapies tested so far include retinoids, extracts of green tea,&#xD;
      inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and of epidermal growth factor, and peroxisome&#xD;
      proliferator-activated receptor-c agonists, but there is no generally approved standard&#xD;
      systemic therapy regimen so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local removal includes photodynamic therapy, laser therapy, cryotherapy and conventional&#xD;
      removal by scalpel, but no treatment has so far gained universal approval, no treatment has&#xD;
      so far been subjected to a randomized clinical trial (RCT), and no treatment has been shown&#xD;
      to prevent recurrence or significantly reduce malignant development in long-term follow-up&#xD;
      studies. It is well established that no treatment results in malignant development at an&#xD;
      annual rate of 2-3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall purpose of treatment therefore is to reduce this percentage. However, the&#xD;
      situation is to take responsibility for the welfare of the patients still is, as it has been&#xD;
      so far: despite treatment, in some types of lesions cancers do occur, so the important&#xD;
      question is whether the harm to patients by not treating or by treating them? Lack of&#xD;
      randomized clinical trials accounts for this persistent question, and while waiting for such&#xD;
      studies to be reported, it is necessary to reflect on the existing scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Field cancerization To explain why surgery may not always be beneficial, it has been&#xD;
      mentioned that the visible lesions may be surrounded by genetically altered, cancer&#xD;
      stigmatized epithelial cells unrevealed by routine clinical inspection and histological&#xD;
      examination. A possible outcome of such characteristics is obviously lacking resection of all&#xD;
      affected tissue with recurrence and development of carcinoma from residual genetically&#xD;
      altered cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction to MicroRNA MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding regulatory RNA molecules of 19-25&#xD;
      nucleotides in length. miRNAs play a major role in maintaining tissue homeostasis by&#xD;
      regulating many processes such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration,&#xD;
      apoptosis, survival and morphogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that the human genome may harbor up to 1,000 miRNAs. Although miRNAs are not&#xD;
      directly involved in encoding proteins, they are believed to control the expression of more&#xD;
      than one third of all protein coding genes present within the human genome. Historically,&#xD;
      miRNAs have been viewed as negative regulators of gene expression. Recent work by Vasudevan&#xD;
      et al., has, however, shown that a small subset of miRNAs within the human genome can also&#xD;
      enhance gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Role of miRNAs in cancer The role of miRNA in cancer has been reiterated and established by&#xD;
      many studies that have shown that miRNA signatures (i.e., mRNA expression profiles) can be&#xD;
      useful for classifying human cancers. These studies have identified &quot;cancer related miRNAs&quot;&#xD;
      through investigating expression profiles in matched normal and tumor tissues, as well as in&#xD;
      body fluids. In addition, a vast number of studies have shown that miRNAs can play a role in&#xD;
      regulating the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, whereas others have shown&#xD;
      that miRNA gene deletion or mutation can lead cancer initiation, progression and metastasis.&#xD;
      Calin et al., were the first to demonstrate that a differential expression of miRNAs may&#xD;
      provide useful tools in the diagnosis and prognosis of human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs as diagnostic tools Many miRNAs are uniquely and differentially expressed in&#xD;
      certain tissues as compared with normal adjacent tissues. These small RNA molecules can have&#xD;
      diagnostic or prognostic value, as miRNA expression profiles reflect tumor origin, stage, and&#xD;
      other pathological factors. For example, the expression of miRNA let-7 is downregulated in&#xD;
      lung cancer but not in other cancers, such as breast or colon cancer. These observations&#xD;
      suggest that miRNAs can be used as biomarkers and diagnostic tools for cancer detection.&#xD;
      Moreover, miRNAs can function as accurate molecular markers also because they are relatively&#xD;
      stable and resistant to RNase degradation-probably due to their small size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      miR-21 and miR-200 seem to be particularly relevant to OSCC. Inhibition of miR-21 in tongue&#xD;
      cancer cells in vitro reduces survival and anchorage-independent growth. miR-21 increases&#xD;
      proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth of HNSCC cells in vitro and in&#xD;
      mouse models, thereby augmenting the oncogenic potential of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of miRNAs in body fluids With the advances of molecular biological techniques and&#xD;
      the increasing knowledge of tumor pathogenesis, bio-markers are now considered as an&#xD;
      effective supplement, in conjunction to histological examination, for facilitating clinical&#xD;
      decision making. Extracellular miRNAs in serum, plasma, saliva and urine have recently been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with various pathological conditions, including cancer. Most of the&#xD;
      circulating miRNAs are included in lipid or lipoprotein complexes, such as apoptotic bodies,&#xD;
      micro vesicles or exosomes, rendering them inaccessible to degradation by RNAses. Lawrie and&#xD;
      colleagues were the first to observe elevated levels of miRNA-21 in serum samples collected&#xD;
      from large B-cell lymphoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explanation for choice of comparators:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control/comparator : Patients receiving the standard of care together with PLACEBO starch&#xD;
      tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management strategies for patients with OPLs fall into three categories: close observation,&#xD;
      surgical removal and ablation, and medical therapies. The mainstay of therapy is observation&#xD;
      using frequent clinical examinations. The frequency of examinations should be tailored to&#xD;
      individual patient factors such as the clinical appearance and stage of lesion; presence of&#xD;
      dysplasia; continued use of tobacco, alcohol, or Areca quid; reliability; and access to&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
