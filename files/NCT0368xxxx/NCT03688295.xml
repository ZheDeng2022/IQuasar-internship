  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around 30% of appendectomies are performed for complicated acute appendicitis (CAA, i.e.&#xD;
      cases with perforated appendicitis, extraluminal fecaliths, abscesses, or local or&#xD;
      generalized peritonitis). The treatment of these complicated forms involves the following&#xD;
      steps: initiation of antibiotic treatment at the time of the diagnosis, appendectomy and&#xD;
      post-operative antibiotic therapy that continues for 3 days for localized forms of CAA and&#xD;
      for 5 days for generalized peritonitis (according to the guidelines issued by the French&#xD;
      Society for Anaesthesia and Critical Care Medicine (SFAR)). The results of a Cochrane&#xD;
      meta-analysis published in 2005 suggested that the post-operative infection rate was lower in&#xD;
      patients having receiving antibiotic therapy after surgery for AA. When only cases of CAA&#xD;
      were considered, the difference was no longer significant. However, it should be noted that&#xD;
      the studies included in the meta-analysis are now rather old (published before 1995, with&#xD;
      open procedures) and no longer provide valid data for answering this question because most&#xD;
      appendectomies (80%) are now performed using laparoscopy. Furthermore, a recent cohort study&#xD;
      compared a short (3-day) course of antibiotics with a long course (at least 5 days) in&#xD;
      patients with CAA having undergone laparoscopic or open appendectomy. There was no&#xD;
      significant intergroup difference in the post-operative complication rate. One can thus&#xD;
      legitimately question whether post-operative antibiotic therapy is required after&#xD;
      laparoscopic appendectomy for CAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the impact of the absence of post-operative&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy on the organ space surgical site infection (SSI) rate in patients&#xD;
      presenting with CAA (other than cases of generalized peritonitis) by comparing a group of&#xD;
      patients having undergone a conventional strategy of post-operative antibiotic therapy for&#xD;
      three days after appendectomy for CAA (the control group) with a group of patients having&#xD;
      received a post-operative placebo for three days after appendectomy for CAA (the experimental&#xD;
      group). The primary endpoint will be evaluated at one month after randomization.&#xD;

    <description>primary outcome is the proportion of patients with deep SSIs by POD30. Deep SSIs are officially defined by the CDCcentre of disease control and prevention (CDC) as infections that occur within 30 days of surgery AND appear to be related to the surgery AND affect the organ or the cavity around the surgical site (i.e. any anatomical structure - other than the incision - that is opened or handled during surgery) AND for which at least one of the following signs is observed: pus coming from a drain placed in the organ or cavity; germs isolated from a liquid or tissue sample collected aseptically from the organ or cavity; an abscess or another obvious sign of infection of the organ or cavity found by macroscopic examination during subsequent surgery or in a radiological or histopathological examination.</description>
