  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperbilirubinemia is a common neonatal problem. bilirubin is potentially toxic to central&#xD;
      nervous system and can cause serious permanent complication called kernicterus, in which&#xD;
      brain stem nuclei and basal ganglia are damaged,resulting in cerebral palsy.In&#xD;
      Hyperbiliubinemia,rapid reduction of serum bilirubin level is of utmost importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two commonly used mode of therapy are phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Phototherapy has&#xD;
      some side effects such as diarrhea, skin rash, dehydration, overheating, mother-baby bonding&#xD;
      disruption.On the other hand, complication of exchange transfusion include infections,&#xD;
      emboli,anemia,apnea and hypocalcemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      while IV fluid supplementationis postulated to decrease bilirubin concentration directly&#xD;
      through a reduction of haemoconcentration, increasing enteral feed volume is proposed to&#xD;
      decrease bilirubin concentration through reduced enterohepatic circulation via an increased&#xD;
      gut peristalsis.&#xD;

      Bilirubin encephalopathy or kernicterus Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid soluble and therefore&#xD;
      can cross the blood brain barrier .There it can deposit in areas of the brain, with a&#xD;
      predilection for deposition in the basal ganglia, auditory pathways, and oculomotor nucleus.&#xD;
      This deposition and accompanying damage result in the classical symptoms associated with&#xD;
      kernicterus. Hypoxia, acidosis, prematurity, and genetic predispositions all increase the&#xD;
      risk for kernicterus.In well term babies risk for kernicterus increases after bilirubin&#xD;
      levels cross (20 mg/dL) and it is very high above (30 mg/dL). In preterm babies the threshold&#xD;
      for damage from bilirubin could be as low as(20mg/dl). The risk increases with increasing&#xD;
      serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute bilirubin encephalopathy presents as lethargy, high pitched cry, poor feeding, abnormal&#xD;
      tone, opisthotonus, upgaze palsy and seizures. Aggressive treatment at this stage can reduce&#xD;
      the damage caused. Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy leads to conditions like choreoathetoid&#xD;
      cerebral palsy, high frequency hearing loss, dental dysplasias and oculomotor palsies.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will be divided into two equal groups Study group and control group by randomization. The study group will be given IV fluid supplementation with 0.5% normal saline in dextrose 5%for period of 24hours . The volume of supplementation included a presumed deficit of 50 ml/kg (equivalent to mild dehydration), half of daily maintenance fluid for 24 hours in accordance to standard norms and extra 20 ml/kg per day as a phototherapy allowance. In addition, they will continue breastfeeding. The control group will be continued on breast feeding , before the randomization procedure. All the infants will get phototherapy by standard method. Phototherapy will be discontinued when the bilirubin level will be &lt;15 mg/dl.</description>
