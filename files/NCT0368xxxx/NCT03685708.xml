      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) tend to&#xD;
      get infections more easily. This is because their immune systems are weakened. Hepatitis B is&#xD;
      a virus that can be transmitted when body fluids from an infected person enter the body of an&#xD;
      uninfected person. This virus can be dangerous for people with leukemia and lymphoma.&#xD;
      HEPLISAV-B is a new hepatitis B vaccine. Researchers want to see if it can protect people&#xD;
      with CLL/SLL from getting hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn how HEPLISAV-B works in people who have CLL or SLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18 years and older with CLL (or SLL). They must be getting no treatment for their CLL,&#xD;
      or getting ibrutinib or acalabrutinib for it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study lasts 6 months from the date of first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get blood drawn and the study vaccine. It will be given as an injection. If&#xD;
      they get any symptoms within 7 days of the vaccine, they will write them in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months, participants will come back to the NIH to get another blood draw and the&#xD;
      second vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return 3 months after the second vaccine dose was given. They will have&#xD;
      blood drawn.&#xD;

      This study aims to determine the HEPLISAV-B hepatitis B vaccine efficacy in chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) lymphocytic patients that are&#xD;
      treatment naive or receiving Bruton s-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTK-I) therapy. (Note: Since&#xD;
      CLL and SLL are considered the same disease, CLL/SLL will be referred to as CLL hereafter,&#xD;
      unless otherwise specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Diagnosis of CLL&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 1: Treatment naive CLL or SLL patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 2: Subjects must be receiving ibrutinib monotherapy for at least 6 months prior&#xD;
           to administration of the first vaccine dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cohort 3: Subjects must be receiving acalabrutinib monotherapy for at least 6 months&#xD;
           prior to administration of the first vaccine dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. No known active or past hepatitis B infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. No history of prior hepatitis B virus vaccination (approved or investigational)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Age greater greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. ECOG performance status of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLL will enroll on the study for the purpose of determining the HEPLISAV-B&#xD;
      vaccine efficacy in patients who are treatment naive ore receiving BTK-I therapy. A series of&#xD;
      2 doses of HEPLISAV-B will be given on a 0- and 3- month schedule by intramuscular injection.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed at regular intervals and receive serologic response assessment&#xD;
      following completion of the HEPLISAV-B vaccine series (6 months after the first vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
      administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Determine the rate of hepatitis B seroprotective titer achievement (anti-HBs greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 10mIU/mL) following completion of the HEPLISAV-B 2-dose vaccine series (6 months&#xD;
      after the first vaccine administration) in the following populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients who are treatment naive (n=54)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with ibrutinib (n=27)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CLL patients receiving treatment with acalabrutinib (n=27)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) Determine the safety and tolerability of the HEPLISAV-B vaccine among CLL patients who are&#xD;
      treatment naive or receiving BTK-Is (ibrutinib or acalabrutinib).&#xD;
