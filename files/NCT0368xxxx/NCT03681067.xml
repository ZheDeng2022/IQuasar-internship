  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to investigate the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of humanised&#xD;
      antibody GSK1070806 delivered via intravenous infusion in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. 30-36 patients will be enrolled into the trial, with two&#xD;
      thirds of the patients receiving active drug and one third receiving placebo. After 30&#xD;
      patients have been recruited into the study the sample size will be reassessed and up to an&#xD;
      additional 6 patients could be recruited (i.e. up to 36 patients).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of single intravenous infusion (one dose on Day 1) of GSK1070806 or placebo,&#xD;
      in patients with active, moderate to severe CD. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose IV administration of GSK1070806. A&#xD;
      secondary objective will be to evaluate the effect of GSK1070806 in change of CDAI over time.&#xD;
      Further secondary endpoints will include assessment of endoscopic response in patients at&#xD;
      week 12. (Other secondary endpoints are detailed in Section 2.3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients will be recruited with randomisation of 2:1 active drug to placebo in multiple&#xD;
      centres in the UK. After 30 patients have been recruited into the study the sample size will&#xD;
      be reassessed and up to an additional 6 patients could be recruited (i.e. up to 36 patients).&#xD;
      These additional patients will also be recruited with randomisation of 2:1 active drug to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial screening shall take place to identify patients diagnosed with CD for at least 3&#xD;
      months prior to screening, active disease based on CDAI score of 220-450 points and&#xD;
      colonoscopic confirmation of active mucosal inflammation (SES-CD excluding narrowed component&#xD;
      ≥6; or in patients with isolated ileal disease ≥4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not have colonoscopically demonstrated mucosal inflammation will be excluded&#xD;
      even if they have MRI evidence of Crohn's disease more proximally in the small intestine. For&#xD;
      inclusion, CDAI criteria have to be fulfilled within 7 days prior to dosing and colonoscopic&#xD;
      SES-CD criteria has to be fulfilled with 28 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The induction of clinical activity will be assessed at week 12 by CDAI score, average&#xD;
      clinical SF and/or AP scores as well as by colonoscopic assessment of baseline video images&#xD;
      and week 12 video images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 5 patients randomised into the trial will be dosed at least 3 days apart. At the&#xD;
      interim analysis time point, a safety decision will be taken on the subsequent recruitment&#xD;
      and patient spacing out strategy.&#xD;

        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent prior to any of the screening procedures including&#xD;
             discontinuation of prohibited medications. (see Section 7.11 for additional&#xD;
             information)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients that have been diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease for at least&#xD;
             3 months prior to Screening Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;

             Baseline defined by endoscopic appearance: SES-CD excluding the narrowed component of&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. AST and ALT ≤ 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin&#xD;
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male or female participants aged ≥16 years (up to 80 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A male participant must agree to use contraception as detailed in Appendix 5 of this&#xD;
             protocol for at least 180 days post-dose of study medication and refrain from donating&#xD;
             sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If the patient is breastfeeding, she must agree to stop breastfeeding once randomised&#xD;
             into the trial.*&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A patient is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is eligible only if she meets at least one&#xD;
             of the following conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one&#xD;
             of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue&#xD;
             their HRT during the trial. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation&#xD;
             of postmenopausal status before trial enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. Agrees to follow the contraceptive guidance in Appendix 5 for at least 180 days&#xD;
             post-dose of trial medication. If a hormonal method of birth control is selected from&#xD;
             the list in Appendix 5 then patients must have been using these methods at least 1&#xD;
             month prior to GSK1070806 administration, or be abstinent, or utilise a condom as a&#xD;
             method of contraception until the selected hormonal method has been in place for the&#xD;
             28 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A woman who is not of childbearing potential is eligible only if she meets at least&#xD;

             documented bilateral salpingectomy or oophorectomy iii. Postmenopausal female defined&#xD;
             as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
             * A female patient who is breastfeeding may be screened. If randomised into the trial,&#xD;
             this patient must agree to stop breastfeeding. Patients who are screened but&#xD;
             ineligible can continue breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement&#xD;
        is insufficient.&#xD;
