      A phase 2, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of tezepelumab on airway inflammation in adults with inadequately&#xD;
      controlled moderate-to-severe asthma, taking inhaled corticosteroids and at least one&#xD;
      additional asthma controller. Approximately 110 subjects will be randomized globally.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive tezepelumab, or placebo, administered via subcutaneous injection at the&#xD;
      study site, over a 28-week treatment period. Although, due to the Covid-19 pandemic this may&#xD;
      be an extended time frame for some subject visits. The study also includes a post-treatment&#xD;
      follow-up period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
