    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the project is to develop a feasible, effective and sustainable&#xD;
      school-based program to manage anxiety in elementary and middle school students with Autism&#xD;
      Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other special learning needs. There are two phases to this&#xD;
      Department of Health and Human Services/Health Resources and Services Administration-funded&#xD;
      research. In the first phase, there will be engagement of community partners in the process&#xD;
      of developing the adapted intervention for implementation in schools. The first phase is&#xD;
      ongoing until approximately fall of 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is the second phase of this program of research and is focused on piloting and&#xD;
      implementing the school-based intervention within 3 local school districts in a systematic&#xD;
      and sustainable way - through a &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; model. Primary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to prepare cross-disciplinary teams of School - Based Trainers to conduct three pilot&#xD;
           student groups of Facing Your Fears - School Based (FYF-SB) within their own district,&#xD;
           with the goal of later training others in their districts to deliver FYF-SB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. at the start of the following academic year (2019-2020), within each of the three&#xD;
           participating districts, 10 schools will be randomized to one of two conditions for the&#xD;
           fall semester: a) FYF-SB or b) Usual Care; and assess implementation and treatment&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are at high risk for developing clinically&#xD;
      significant anxiety. Anxiety markedly interferes with peer relationships, family functioning&#xD;
      and participation in academic programming. Youth with ASD demonstrate significant reductions&#xD;
      in anxiety following participation in treatments rooted in evidence-based practice (EBP) such&#xD;
      as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The treatment program, Facing Your Fears (FYF), is one&#xD;
      such EBP. However, substantial disparities in access to psychiatric services exist,&#xD;
      particularly for youth from minority and/or low income families. Schools may be the ideal&#xD;
      location to access these services because they represent one of the only consistent resources&#xD;
      available to many low resourced families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal is innovative for several reasons: (1) There are very few published&#xD;
      studies examining the effectiveness of treatments for children with ASD and anxiety in&#xD;
      schools, and none that have focused on under-resourced communities; (2) There are no known&#xD;
      studies that have identified students for an intervention program according to special&#xD;
      education eligibility criteria, combined with other inclusion criteria, an approach which&#xD;
      will likely serve more students, and in turn, potentially increase the feasibility of FYF-SB;&#xD;
      (3) a &quot;train the trainer&quot; model will result in increased capacity for low resourced schools&#xD;
      to serve underserved youth; and (4) Finally, the current study is one of the first to examine&#xD;
      organizational constructs that are potentially associated with adoption of FYF-SB, the&#xD;
      results of which would help determine critical next steps in implementation research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Facing Your Fears (FYF): The clinical version of FYF is a 14-week, family-focused&#xD;
      CBT group intervention (1 Â½ hours each session) aimed toward managing anxiety in children&#xD;
      ages 8-14 with high-functioning ASD. FYF is composed of three books (e.g., facilitators,&#xD;
      parents and children) and a digital versatile disc (DVD). The 14 weeks are divided into two,&#xD;
      seven-session intervention blocks: (1) an introduction to anxiety symptoms with an emphasis&#xD;
      on the individual expression of anxiety symptoms, as well as an introduction to common CBT&#xD;
      strategies, and (2) a focus on using specific tools and strategies (i.e. deep breathing,&#xD;
      positive coping statements and graded exposure--facing fears a little at a time) to improve&#xD;
      emotion regulation and manage anxiety symptoms. Although FYF was originally developed for&#xD;
      youth with ASD, there is no mention of ASD in the curriculum, as the focus is exclusively on&#xD;
      management of anxiety. Importantly, careful attention was paid to the delivery of core&#xD;
      concepts, given the social, communicative and cognitive challenges of youth with ASD (Moree &amp;&#xD;
      Davis, 2010). The use of written worksheets, multiple choice lists, emphasis on creative and&#xD;
      varied outlets for expression, use of video modeling and a focus on strengths and talents&#xD;
      make FYF ideal for students with special learning needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facing Your Fears: School-Based (FYF-SB): FYF-SB will be very similar to FYF, but will be&#xD;
      modified for delivery in school settings. Phase 1 study, currently in completion, will enable&#xD;
      input to be obtained from school personnel, district leaders and parents as a way to&#xD;
      determine the best ways to adapt the intervention for schools. Thus the logistical details of&#xD;
      how the intervention will be offered to students within each participating school district&#xD;
      has been discussed in detail with each of the 3 participating districts' leaders and key&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Implement FYF-SB in school settings and assess effectiveness Train teams of&#xD;
      School-Based Trainers to deliver FYF-SB to students and then train other professionals.&#xD;
      Cross-disciplinary school providers will be selected by district administrators to serve as&#xD;
      School-Based Trainers (&quot;Trainers&quot;). The Trainers (10 per district will be recruited to&#xD;
      account for attrition) will be trained to deliver FYF-SB to small groups of 2-4 students with&#xD;
      ASD or special learning needs and anxiety during the initial pilot study of the intervention.&#xD;
      These school-based professionals will become the &quot;trainers&quot; for their own individual&#xD;
      districts, once they have completed their own training activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Becoming a School-Based Trainer for the project will involve: (1) Attending a two day&#xD;
      interactive workshop, focused on the principles of CBT and core components of FYF-SB. The&#xD;
      training will take place during non-academic periods. The workshop will be interactive and&#xD;
      dynamic (per Becker &amp; Stirman, 2011), including group discussion, experiential exercises,&#xD;
      small group activities and videotaped examples. (2) Participating in ongoing consultation and&#xD;
      technical assistance throughout at least one academic year with the research team; (3)&#xD;
      Meeting expectations for fidelity on the intervention (average fidelity score &gt;80%, based on&#xD;
      a minimum of 3 observations). School-Based Trainers who do not meet the fidelity requirements&#xD;
      will be asked to participate in additional training in order to continue in that role.&#xD;
      School-Based Trainers can always decide to become School-Based Providers (delivering the&#xD;
      intervention to students, but not train others) instead and/or can always decide to&#xD;
      participate in the project or not, as their participation is purely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Randomize schools across three districts to either FYF-SB or Usual Care (UC) and&#xD;
      assess outcomes. The second part of the implementation phase is to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of FY-SB; thus, a small randomized controlled trial will be conducted across school&#xD;
      districts. Trainers will participate in &quot;train the trainer&quot; activities to prepare them for&#xD;
      training their own school teams in the delivery of FYF-SB. Ten schools across each district&#xD;
      will be randomized to either FYF-SB or Usual Care. The five schools (and their School-Based&#xD;
      Trainers and School Providers) that are randomized to FYF-SB, will receive training and&#xD;
      consultation from the Trainers, and school providers will deliver FYF-SB to a cohort of&#xD;
      target students. Schools that are randomized to Usual Care will identify students who meet&#xD;
      inclusion criteria for the study, and will take pre- and post-wait assessment data. The UC&#xD;
      Sites will have the opportunity to deliver FYF-SB the next semester if they so choose.&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate 60 providers will be trained across the districts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FYF-SB will be delivered in elementary and middle schools across three main districts: Cherry&#xD;
      Creek School District (CCSD), Denver Public Schools (DPS) and Littleton Public Schools (LPS).&#xD;
      All three districts have economically and ethnically diverse student bodies. DPS is the&#xD;
      largest district of the three, with 93 elementary schools. The student population in DPS is&#xD;
      more than 56% Hispanic and 14% African American. CCSD has 42 elementary schools and LPS has&#xD;
      13 elementary schools; all three districts also have racially and ethnically diverse schools,&#xD;
      as well as low-income populations. All of the districts have large populations of students&#xD;
      with ASD. The districts have all expressed strong interest in this project, and have been&#xD;
      actively involved in Phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide information about the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      implementing a school-based cognitive behavioral intervention aimed at reducing the impact of&#xD;
      anxiety on school functioning for students with ASD. If this method of treatment delivery&#xD;
      proves to be feasible and potentially effective, it has the potential to improve access to&#xD;
      mental health support for youth who do not have ready access to specialists in the medical&#xD;
      community and for whom mental health supports are provided primarily in educational settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successful completion of this study will result in a sustainable school based treatment&#xD;
      program to manage anxiety in students with ASD or other special learning needs. Successful&#xD;
      implementation and treatment outcomes will result in improved internal capacity of schools to&#xD;
      treat the significant and interfering anxious symptoms of underserved students with ASD or&#xD;
      other special learning needs. Reductions in interfering anxiety symptoms for high risk,&#xD;
      underserved students with ASD or other special learning needs, can lead to marked&#xD;
      improvements in school functioning. The results of this study will also help to identify&#xD;
      factors that may influence the implementation of FYF-SB (e.g., organizational constructs,&#xD;
      principal leadership), which may help determine critical next steps in implementation&#xD;
      research in school settings.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the present study, we will use the measure entitled Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM; Glasgow, 2013) as a framework for planning and implementing FYF-SB in the school environment. The translation of research from controlled research settings to natural environments is often an exceptionally slow process, perhaps because of the emphasis on efficacy. A pragmatic framework such as RE-AIM can hasten the portability of evidenced based intervention to &quot;real-world&quot; practice by focusing on stakeholder feedback and environmental context, in conjunction with intervention development and content.&#xD;
We plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial of the FYF-SB intervention across 30 schools within 3 districts. The intervention conditions occur for 1 semester within an academic year. Data will be collected in a pre-post design (before and after the condition of either Facing Your Fears - School Based or Usual Care).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Social Responsiveness Scale (Constantino &amp; Gruber, 2012) is a parent - reported 65 - item questionnaire that uses a 4 - point Likert scale to assess behaviors associated with ASD. It included five subscales: awareness, cognition, communication, motivation, and autistic mannerisms. Higher scores suggest greater impairment. The SRS is commonly used in autism research, has good reliability, and is valid across cultures (Bolte et al., 2008).&#xD;
