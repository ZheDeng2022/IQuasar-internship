    <textblock>
      This trial is testing the effectiveness of a single oral dose of sildenafil (50 mg) taken 1&#xD;
      hour before a provocative event on the subsequent development of swimming-induced pulmonary&#xD;
      edema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immersion pulmonary edema (also known as swimming-induced pulmonary edema, SIPE) is a&#xD;
      condition in which the lungs fill with fluid (pulmonary edema) during a dive or vigorous&#xD;
      swim, causing cough with bloody sputum, shortness of breath and reduced blood oxygen levels.&#xD;
      In the Navy this usually occurs in young, healthy individuals such as SEAL and Special&#xD;
      Warfare Combatant-Craft trainees. SIPE generally resolves spontaneously within 24 hours but&#xD;
      it can be fatal. It is believed that SIPE is responsible for some deaths in civilians during&#xD;
      triathlons. This proposal aims to test a drug to prevent SIPE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending upon severity, the prevalence of SIPE is reported in up to 60% during 2.4-3.6 km&#xD;
      open sea swimming trials in the Israel Defense Force. In SEAL training in the US&#xD;
      approximately 40 cases per year (around 3%) have been reported, more commonly during winter,&#xD;
      when it is observed in up to 5% of trainees. Return to duty time can be up to 7 days. SIPE&#xD;
      also affects other groups of highly fit individuals such as triathletes. In susceptible&#xD;
      individuals it tends to recur, thus a preventive medicine would be useful for both Navy SEALs&#xD;
      and civilians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to provide the Navy an FDA-approved drug that can be used to&#xD;
      prevent SIPE. The investigators hypothesize that sildenafil administration to&#xD;
      SIPE-susceptible individuals one hour before a swim in cold water will reduce or eliminate&#xD;
      the risk of SIPE. The method to be used to test this hypothesis will be a 40-minute period of&#xD;
      exercise immersed to the neck in 20Â°C water, a test that results in SIPE symptoms in the&#xD;
      majority of susceptible individuals. The investigators plan to study 20 individuals who have&#xD;
      previously experienced SIPE. Each volunteer will be tested twice. Either sildenafil or an&#xD;
      inactive drug (placebo) administered in random order will be given prior to each exercise.&#xD;
      For each participant exercise periods will be performed at least 7 days apart. The identity&#xD;
      of the drug and placebo will be concealed from the investigators and the volunteers until the&#xD;
      end of the study. The number of instances in which SIPE manifestations after sildenafil and&#xD;
      placebo will then be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Availability of a drug that can prevent SIPE would provide the Navy with a useful tool that&#xD;
      could be administered to SEALs who have experienced SIPE prior to critical missions. It would&#xD;
      also be useful for civilians who have experienced SIPE but wish to continue with the&#xD;
      precipitating exercise such as swimming or competing in triathlons, and also for patients&#xD;
      with heart failure for whom swimming induces shortness of breath or pulmonary edema.&#xD;
