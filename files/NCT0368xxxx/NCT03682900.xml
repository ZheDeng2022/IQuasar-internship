  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the proposed Phase II research is to demonstrate the short-term&#xD;
      effectiveness of the modification of an existing, effective, computer-based, tobacco&#xD;
      prevention program, Click CityÂ®: Tobacco, to prevent the initiation of e-cig use among youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary goal is to modify the program to increase marketability by expanding the range of&#xD;
      devices on which the program can be delivered (e.g., tablets to desk tops), simplifying the&#xD;
      student user interface, and providing more robust teacher/administrator functionality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous research study the investigators developed and tested an effective tobacco&#xD;
      prevention program to be used in 5th and 6th grade classrooms as tobacco prevention&#xD;
      curriculum. The prevalence of e-cigarette (e-cig) use has recently increased dramatically,&#xD;
      greatly exceeding that of cigarette use. Considering the health effects of e-cigs, and the&#xD;
      increased probability that adolescents will become addicted to nicotine through the use of&#xD;
      e-cigs a crucial need was recognized for the incorporation of e-cigs into the original&#xD;
      tobacco prevention program. In Phase I the investigators were able to create two new&#xD;
      activities that changed specific risk factors predictive of e-cig use. Two existing&#xD;
      activities were modified to target not only risk factors related to smoking but also to&#xD;
      e-cigarette use. Phase II will develop additional content targeting e-cigs and modify&#xD;
      graphics and language throughout the program to include e-cigs. The finished program will&#xD;
      contain 10 lessons to be used in fifth grade classrooms and a booster containing 6 activities&#xD;
      to be used in sixth grade classrooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project, which targets 5th graders with a booster in 6th grade, aims to prevent the&#xD;
      initiation of the use of tobacco products including e-cigs, later in adolescence. This&#xD;
      school-based, internet delivered program targets established risk factors predictive of&#xD;
      youth's behavioral intentions and willingness to use tobacco products, both predictors of&#xD;
      subsequent use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase II project proposes to complete development of the product by creating and&#xD;
      integrating content that specifically targets risk factors/mechanisms predictive of e-cig use&#xD;
      into all existing activities that previously targeted only conventional tobacco use. These&#xD;
      modified activities will be integrated into a 10-lesson program and will be based on insights&#xD;
      gathering during Phase I. The student user interface and teacher and administrative portals&#xD;
      will be modified to increase ease of use. The entire program will be updated to contemporary&#xD;
      web standards (e.g. HTML5/CSS/JavaScript) to allow for better integration into a broad range&#xD;
      of school environments representing diverse hardware and software platforms. The resulting&#xD;
      program will be assessed on both the effectiveness of decreasing youth's intentions and&#xD;
      willingness to use both e-cigs and conventional cigarettes&#xD;
