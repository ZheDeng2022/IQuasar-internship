    <textblock>
      A population baseline longitudinal study in a major residual malaria hotspot in Brazil to: 1.&#xD;
      identify risk factors for residual malaria infection and disease at individual and household&#xD;
      level, 2. identify and quantify population changes in P. vivax and P. falciparum to detect&#xD;
      reintroductions and to estimate parasite population complexity at baseline and after&#xD;
      interventions and 3. describe changing dynamics of malaria incidence and parasitemia&#xD;
      prevalence over time, and to assess potential effects of combinations of interventions on&#xD;
      malaria control and elimination using mathematical models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be developed in Mâncio Lima, a residual malaria hotspot in northwestern&#xD;
      Brazil. The population of study is approximately 2,000 subjects aged 3 months and up, who&#xD;
      correspond to all the residents of 20% of the households of the urban area of Mâncio Lima.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be made Active (ACD) and Passive Case Detection (PCD) every 6 months, over 5 years.&#xD;
      (symptom based surveying; microscopy-based diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will include interview, physical examination and collection of 100 μL of blood&#xD;
      (finger prick) to malaria diagnosis by smear, RDT and qPCR. If the subject will be positive&#xD;
      by smear or RDT (rapid diagnostic test for malaria), despite of presence of symptoms, ≥ 20 mL&#xD;
      of venous blood will be draw of them to immunology and parasite genetics study and the&#xD;
      immediate treatment per MOH(Ministry of Health) guidelines will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with smear or RDT negative, will be followed for symptoms over the next 6 months. If&#xD;
      it is subsequently found to be smear/RDT-positive by PCD, the treatment will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of malaria, genetic characteristics of the&#xD;
      population of Plasmodium and changing dynamics of malaria transmission will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional surveys will be carried out in order to identify risk factors for residual&#xD;
      malaria infection and disease at both the individual and household level, to supply parasite&#xD;
      samples for detailed population-level molecular analyses and to supply epidemiological data&#xD;
      for parameterization of new mathematical models of malaria transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: Longitudinally determine malaria dynamics in a major residual malaria hotspot in&#xD;
           Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: Identify and quantify population changes in P. vivax and P. falciparum to detect&#xD;
           reintroductions, and to estimate parasite population complexity at baseline and&#xD;
           potentially after interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: Develop and apply mathematical models to describe changing dynamics of malaria&#xD;
           incidence and parasitemia prevalence over time, and to assess potential effects of&#xD;
           combinations of interventions on malaria control and elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The study will be developed in the urban area of Mâncio Lima, northwestern of&#xD;
                Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A census performed by our field team between Nov 2015 and Apr 2016 identified ~ 10,000&#xD;
      inhabitants in the urban area of Mâncio Lima. At the site preparation phase, a random sample&#xD;
      of 20% of the households enumerated during our census will be visited by our field teams and&#xD;
      all dwellers aged 3 months or up (or their parents/guardians) will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to enroll ~ 2,000 subjects who will participate in 10 cross-sectional surveys&#xD;
      (every six months) over five years (total of 20,000 observations), and contribute 120,000&#xD;
      person-months of follow-up. Because of the open-cohort design of this study, subjects who are&#xD;
      lost for follow-up are replaced with newcomers, without affecting significantly the number of&#xD;
      person-months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the subjects will be interviewed and 100ul of blood will be collected to&#xD;
      Active (ACD) and Passive Case Detection (PCD) (symptom based surveying; microscopy-based&#xD;
      diagnosis). Each visit will include an interview, physical examination and collection of 100&#xD;
      μL of blood (finger prick) to malaria diagnosis by smear, RDT and qPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the subjects are positive by smear or RDT (rapid diagnostic test for malaria), despite&#xD;
      of presence of symptoms, ≥ 20 mL of venous blood will be draw of them to immunology and&#xD;
      parasite genetics study and the immediate treatment per Ministry of Health of Brazil&#xD;
      guidelines will be performed.&#xD;

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any subject aged 3 or more months old living in the study sites and providing written&#xD;
             informed consent, or with parental written informed consent and assent when&#xD;
             age-appropriate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plans to remain in the study site for the next five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults and children will both contribute to the data and study goals. Adults and children&#xD;
        will both contribute to the data and study goals. Children less than three months of age&#xD;
        will be excluded from the study because the heel or finger prick procedures to draw blood&#xD;
        may be perceived by the parents as inappropriate for this age group. Children aged three&#xD;
        months or more are eligible as long as they are members of the randomly chosen households&#xD;
        and their parents/guardians provide informed consent. Inclusion of children is essential&#xD;
        for the study goals, since different age groups may differ in acquired immunity and&#xD;
        therefore in the risk of having symptoms when carrying malaria parasites&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  any chronic or acute condition that, in the opinion of the field clinician or nurse,&#xD;
             may affect the results of the study or the ability of providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less then 3 months old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not have permanent residence in the study area&#xD;
