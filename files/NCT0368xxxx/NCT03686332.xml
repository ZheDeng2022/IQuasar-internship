  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced penile cancer have a poor prognosis (21% 2-year overall survival from&#xD;
      moment of diagnosis) and high morbidity due to progressive locoregional disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational studies show high rates of infiltrating immune cells and PD-L1 positivity,&#xD;
      suggesting that immunotherapy may be beneficial in this disease. Atezolizumab, targeting&#xD;
      PD-L1, is active in several cancer types and is generally well-tolerated. This study will&#xD;
      investigate whether atezolizumab can be combined with radiotherapy to control locoregional&#xD;
      lymph node disease. Furthermore, the activity of atezolizumab in advanced penile cancer&#xD;
      patients will be investigated.&#xD;

      Rationale Patients with advanced penile cancer have a poor prognosis (21% 2-year overall&#xD;
      survival from moment of diagnosis) and high morbidity due to progressive locoregional&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translational studies show high rates of infiltrating immune cells and PD-L1 positivity,&#xD;
      suggesting that immunotherapy may be beneficial in this disease. Atezolizumab, targeting&#xD;
      PD-L1, is active in several cancer types and is generally well-tolerated. This study will&#xD;
      investigate whether atezolizumab can be combined with radiotherapy to control locoregional&#xD;
      lymph node disease. Furthermore, the activity of atezolizumab in advanced penile cancer&#xD;
      patients will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy of atezolizumab in advanced penile cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feasibility of a protracted schedule of radiotherapy on locoregional disease in&#xD;
           combination with immunotherapy for advanced penile cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-center, nonrandomized, Phase 2 study with 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men, ≥18 years of age, with advanced inoperable penile cancer, N=32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive atezolizumab, 1200 mg, every 3 weeks, by IV infusion. Patients in&#xD;
      group A will additionally receive 33 fractions of 1.5 (locoregional affected lymph nodes) and&#xD;
      1.8 Gy (tumor+margin) irradiation, concurrently with atezolizumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression-free survival at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main secondary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-year overall survival rate of the complete study population. Percentage of patients who&#xD;
      complete the full course of radiotherapy in the radiotherapy/atezolizumab arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients will be treated every 3 weeks with atezolizumab for one year or until&#xD;
      loss of clinical benefit. Atezolizumab is generally well tolerated although immune-related&#xD;
      toxicity does occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity of combining atezolizumab with a long course of radiotherapy is unknown and may&#xD;
      result in increased toxicity. It is unknown whether atezolizumab will induce responses in&#xD;
      patients with advanced penile cancer.&#xD;

Arm A: Patients with locoregional lymph node disease who have not received extensive inguinal or pelvic irradiation on the involved area before. Patients in this group will concurrently be treated with locoregional radiotherapy and atezolizumab.&#xD;
Arm B: Patients who are not expected to derive benefit from radiotherapeutic treatment. This group will mainly consist of patients with distant metastases or previously treated locoregional disease and will only be treated with atezolizumab.</intervention_model_description>
