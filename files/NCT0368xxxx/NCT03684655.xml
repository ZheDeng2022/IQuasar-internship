  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center exploratory imaging study involving one intravenous microdose of&#xD;
      [18F]F-AraG followed by whole-body positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance (PET-MR)&#xD;
      imaging in HIV infected individuals to determine the anatomical distribution of the PET&#xD;
      tracer. Participants will be enrolled if they were treated during early or late HIV&#xD;
      infection. In addition, individuals not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or with HIV-1 plasma&#xD;
      RNA levels &gt;5,000 copies/mL will be enrolled.&#xD;

      The PET radiofluorinated imaging agent, [18F]F-AraG&#xD;
      (2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-9-β-D-arabinofuranosylguanine; trade name VisAcT) localizes to sites of&#xD;
      immune activation and is predominantly accumulated in proliferative T cells. As a result,&#xD;
      there is interest in imaging residual immune activation in the setting of both treated and&#xD;
      untreated HIV-1 infection, a disease in which chronic immune activation and inflammation may&#xD;
      lead to significant morbidity, despite the use of otherwise suppressive ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to determine the anatomical distribution of [18F]F-AraG in&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals taking or not taking antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to determine if [18F]F-AraG PET-MRI is able to detect differences in&#xD;
      T cell activation between patients with early versus late treated HIV infection and to&#xD;
      determine if [18F]F-AraG uptake correlates with direct blood and tissue measures of HIV&#xD;
      reservoir size and activity in the above cohorts/studies.&#xD;

             team will strongly recommend that all HIV+ participants initiate ART who not done so&#xD;
