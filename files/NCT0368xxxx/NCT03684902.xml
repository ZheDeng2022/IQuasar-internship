    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in 250 patients who underwent midline Laparotomy at Kasr Al-Ainy&#xD;
      emergency department, Cairo University from August 2017 until March 2018. Factors such as age&#xD;
      ,sex, body mass index, substance abuse, previous laparotomy, malignancy, diabetes mellitus ,&#xD;
      ascites, albumin, renal functions, bilirubin, hemoglobin, intra-abdominal pathology, suture&#xD;
      material, creation of stoma, post-operative chest infection, , post-operative paralytic&#xD;
      ileus, leakage and wound infection were observed and analyzed with odds ratio and P value&#xD;

      General Anaesthesia can be appropriate for patients undergoing abdominal surgery. In common&#xD;
      practice with rapid sequence induction with inhalational anesthetics (sevoflourane or&#xD;
      isoflourane), opioids (fentanyl 1-2 mic/kg with induction &amp; morphine 0.1 mg/kg) and&#xD;
      neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine 0.5 mg/kg or roucroinium 0.9 mg/kg) are used in&#xD;
      general anesthesia for abdominal surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an adequate level of anesthesia has been reached, the initial incision into the skin may&#xD;
      be made. A scalpel is first used to cut into the superficial layers of the skin.with the&#xD;
      diathermy The incision is then continued through the subcutaneous fat, the abdominal muscles,&#xD;
      and finally, the peritoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the patients, closure of midline laparotomy wound was en-mass closure done with&#xD;
      non-absorbable No. 1 (Polypropylene) or slowly absorbable (PDS) (double loop). sutures in&#xD;
      continuous single layer fashion with 1 cm interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operative details were recorded with special consideration to the operative diagnosis,&#xD;
      presence and types of adhesions, duration of surgery, the need for diversion and stoma&#xD;
      formation, the use of intraperitoneal drain and the suture material to close the rectus&#xD;
      sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the postoperative period, VAS assessment of postoperative pain at 1 , and 24 hours,&#xD;
      time of ambulation, time of oral feeding, hospital stay, and postoperative hemoglobin were&#xD;
      recorded.Any postoperative complication especially chest infection, wound infection,&#xD;
      postoperative leakage and postoperative paralytic ileus were reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of all cases was done weekly after discharge for 4 weeks. Examination of wound&#xD;
      included inspection for any redness, edema or presence of discharge like pus or&#xD;
      serosanguinous fluid. Special attention was given to maintain asepsis. Broad spectrum&#xD;
      intravenous antibiotics The antibiotic therapy for the treatment of intra-abdominal&#xD;
      infections greatly varies according to the infection severity. It is, in fact, possible to&#xD;
      distinguish the intra-abdominal infections in three different categories. Mild infections&#xD;
      should be treated promptly with surgical drainage and a short term therapy with a wide range&#xD;
      antibiotic including anaerobes (ampicillin/sulbactam, cefoxitin). Mild-moderate infections&#xD;
      which are largely the most frequent in the clinical practice should be also treated with a&#xD;
      single drug which include anaerobes in its spectrum. Finally severe infections require a more&#xD;
      aggressive therapeutic approach with a combination treatment covering anaerobes (clyndamicin,&#xD;
      metronidazole), Gram negative rods (ciprofloxacin, aminoglycosides) and Gram positive cocci&#xD;
      (penicillins, cephalosporins) including MRSA (glycopetides) and/or VRE (linezolid). with&#xD;
      anaerobic coverage was started for all cases and later changed according to culture and&#xD;
      sensitivity report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow up duration, the participants were assigned to one of two groups. Group I&#xD;
      involved patients developed burst abdomen whether partial (bowel not eviscerated) or complete&#xD;
      (bowl not eviscerated) and group II involved those who didn't develop it. Half of Sutures&#xD;
      were removed after 10 days , all the sutures removed after 14 days.&#xD;
