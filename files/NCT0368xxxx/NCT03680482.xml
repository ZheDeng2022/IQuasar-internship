      ABSTRACT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction: There is no current data about the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS)&#xD;
      about important factors, such as the energy intake, appetite and its relationship in people&#xD;
      with diabetes when tasting sweet. It is highly relevant to compare the effects of NNS intake,&#xD;
      such as, stevia (steviol glycosides) and sucralose, previous to a mixed food on glycemic&#xD;
      response, insulin and plasmatic concentrations of Glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP-1) and&#xD;
      ghrelin in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the effects of non-nutritive sweeteners intake: stevia (steviol&#xD;
      glyco-sides) and sucralose previous to mixed food on appetite, glycemia, insulin,&#xD;
      ghrelin,incretin plasmatic concentrations GLP-1 in people with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Seventeen subjects with T2DM were studied in 3 different moments and they received 3&#xD;
      treatments: pre-load of water or sucralose or stevia and then offered to consume mixed food&#xD;
      as a test, which provided 332 Kcal and 75 grams of available carbohydrates. Blood samples&#xD;
      were obtained to measure the dependent variables, glycemic and insulin at times -10, 0, 30,&#xD;
      60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes and GLP-1 with ghrelin, at times -10, 0, 30, 90, and 180&#xD;
      minutes. The analogue visual scale questionnaires (VAS) was conducted every 30 minutes in&#xD;
      order to obtain the results of the depend variables: appetite and wish of specific type of&#xD;
      food in a subjective way; appetite, satiety, relax, wish to eat any food, craving for&#xD;
      something sweet, craving for something salty, something tasty, something fatty. Through food&#xD;
      provided ad libi-tum (objective appetite), were obtained the results of: energy,&#xD;
      carbohydrates, proteins and lipid intakes. The statistical analysis applied included the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk's Normality test, repeated measures ANOVA to assess differences among&#xD;
      treatments, Friedman's test followed by Wilcoxon test corrected by Bonferroni as needed. The&#xD;
      degree of association between variables was conducted using the Pearson's or Spearman's&#xD;
      correlation coefficient tests, as requested. A probability value p &lt;0.05 was considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;

      Protocol The experimental design was developed 3 times. Each intervention was performed&#xD;
      separately for a minimum period of 7 days out and a maximum of 14 days, depending on the&#xD;
      availability of the experimental subjects. Cross treatment design (crossover) each subject&#xD;
      serves as its own control The first intervention corresponded to the control group, in order&#xD;
      to maintain the ignorance of the type of sweetener they were receiving, between day 7 or&#xD;
      maximum 14 days post-intervention the order of the test of the NNS was reversed. Therefore,&#xD;
      during the second or third intervention they were given to drink water with sucralose or&#xD;
      stevia respectively. For each intervention a check list was followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were asked to maintain their normal diet between study days and abstain from&#xD;
      strenuous exercise and alcohol intake for 24 hours before each evaluation. The subjects&#xD;
      attended with an 8-hour fast, without having ingested metformin or other medication, to the&#xD;
      sampling room of the Department of Nutrition (Faculty of Medicine, University of Chile). The&#xD;
      study was only begun if they had a capillary glycemia &lt;140%, measured through a glucometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, they were asked to answer the analogue visual scale (VAS) questionnaire and an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter was installed in the antecubital vein to take the blood samples at &quot;time&#xD;
      -10&quot;. Immediately, they were given to drink 60 ml of water or 60 ml of water with 48 mg of&#xD;
      sucralose or an equivalent volume with 96 mg of stevia (steviol glycosides), which they had&#xD;
      to consume in less than 2 minutes, and then answer to a question about the &quot;sensation&quot; that&#xD;
      came with drinking this preparation, to make an estimate of your predisposition to the taste&#xD;
      of the sweetener: sweet, bitter, metallic or other flavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 minutes, at &quot;time 0&quot; immediately after the second blood sample, the individuals&#xD;
      consumed a mixed test meal consisting of a cup of tea with three teaspoons of sugar, plus 126&#xD;
      grams of a homemade bread. , without fat, using the bread maker, brand; program 3,&#xD;
      traditional bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following blood samples were taken at times 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after&#xD;
      &quot;time 0&quot;. In total, 42 ml of blood was extracted, in each time the glycemia and insulin were&#xD;
      determined (4 ml was taken at a time). Furthermore, only at time -10, 0, 30, 90 and 180&#xD;
      minutes, the value of GLP-1 and ghrelin was determined (at this time, 2 ml extra was&#xD;
      extracted at a time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, VAS questionnaires were applied every 30 minutes, from &quot;time -10&quot; to 180 minutes&#xD;
      for appetite determinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the extraction of blood samples at 180 minutes and removing the intravenous&#xD;
      catheter, the subjects were offered a meal for 30 minutes, which consisted of a variety of&#xD;
      foods of high acceptability, previously weighed and fractionated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis The normal distribution of the variables was determined by the&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The natural logarithm was applied to the parameters without normal&#xD;
      distribution. The variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median plus&#xD;
      interquartile interval (Q1-Q3). The statistical significance between the differences in&#xD;
      plasma glucose concentrations, area under the curve (AUC) of glycaemia, energy intake and&#xD;
      macronutrients by treatment (preload water, sucralose and stevia), was evaluated through&#xD;
      Anova of repeated samples . To analyze the differences between plasma concentrations and AUC&#xD;
      of insulin and GLP-1 per treatment (preload water, sucralose and stevia), Friedman's test was&#xD;
      used, followed by Wilcoxon and adjusted by Bonferroni.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify differences between the perception of sweet, bitter, and metallic taste by&#xD;
      treatment (preload water, sucralose and stevia) Friedman test was used, followed by Wilcoxon&#xD;
      and adjusted by Bonferroni.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the relationships between glycemic responses and intake of food at will (energy&#xD;
      intake and macronutrients by treatment, preload water, sucralose and stevia), the Pearson&#xD;
      correlation factor was used, in contrast to insulinemic response, incretin GLP-1 and the&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) and food intake at will per treatment Spearman's correlation&#xD;
      factor was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS 20.0 computer program (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago Illinois). A p &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the analyzes.&#xD;
