  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      eMOM is a randomized, controlled trial to compare the effects of two different dietary&#xD;
      interventions during pregnancy. The comparison is based on tissue glucose content (using&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring system) in pregnant women and on neonate body composition. The&#xD;
      recruited women (n=60) have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus, and are of&#xD;
      Caucasian origin. Of the study diets, one is moderately carbohydrate restricted and the other&#xD;
      one is high on plant-based protein with an emphasis on healthy Nordic foods. The study has&#xD;
      two two-week study periods that are carried out on approximately gestational weeks 24-28&#xD;
      (period I) and 34-36 (period II). Continuous glucose monitoring and other measurements&#xD;
      (accelerometer, 3-day food record, gut microbiota, serum lipids, metabolomics, epigenetics&#xD;
      etc.) are done during these study periods. At the beginning of the study, before study period&#xD;
      I, the participants are randomized to either one of the intervention diets. The first study&#xD;
      period consists of a crossover phase in which the participants receive three days' worth of&#xD;
      food according to one of the intervention diets (according to the randomization) after which&#xD;
      there is a three-day wash-out period. After the wash-out period, the participants receive&#xD;
      three days' worth of food according to the other diet. After the first study period, a&#xD;
      nutritionist advises the lastly followed intervention diet to the participant and the diet is&#xD;
      followed until delivery. To ensure the diet is followed, the participants gets at least three&#xD;
      personal face-to-face counseling sessions, phone calls, mobile reminders, recipes and food&#xD;
      items. After delivery, the infant's body composition, epigenetic markers of cord blood and&#xD;
      placenta, gut microbiome and urine metabolomics are measured.&#xD;
