  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is designed for two parts, a perspective, multi-center, historial control study and a&#xD;
      randomized controlled study of acute ischemic stroke patients. For achieving the target of&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment KPI (Key performance indicator) of AIS patients and improving the&#xD;
      defects of the traditional working mode, our center developed the medical records data&#xD;
      acquisition and KPI statistics system based on computer scan. This method guarantees the&#xD;
      authenticity of the data, It computes the KPI of the corresponding medical institutions in&#xD;
      the corresponding period and gives feedback on a regular basis. Based on the KPI feedback&#xD;
      system, a multifaceted quality improvement intervention is conducted in the intervention&#xD;
      group hospitals. This study aims to explore whether this new working mode can continuously&#xD;
      improve the overall KPI in Zhejiang province, and thus reflect the improvement of quality and&#xD;
      standardization of medical service in AIS patients.&#xD;

      Study population:patients with acute ischemic stroke who were admitted to the hospital within&#xD;
      7 days after the initial symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are multifaceted quality improvement interventions including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implementation of standardized templates of medical record, evidence-based clinical&#xD;
           pathway, and written care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feedback system of performance measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Expert online consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:increase of diagnosis and treatment key performance indicator for acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke patients; Secondary outcome: the occurrence of ischemic stroke, total&#xD;
      mortality, disability, and new clinical vascular events.&#xD;

    <description>Standardized templates of medical record, evidence-based clinical pathway, and written care protocols are applied in all hospitals.The KPI of the AIS patients who were admitted to a single hospital continuously at the time of hospitalization were studied. Feedback system of performance measures: the hospital included in the study upload the medical records of all AIS patients by medical records scanning system since that month into the group. Quality control platform of Cerebral apoplexy in Zhejiang province extracts and analyze the data through the computer and calculates the corresponding monthly KPI. The hospitals will receive their own monthly KPI and the monthly highest KPI of all hospitals included in the study. Expert online consultation: based on the compare of the monthly KPI of all hospitals, Quality control platform will give corresponding suggestions to all hospitals for the improve of next month.</description>
