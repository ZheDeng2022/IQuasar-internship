  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of access to clinical and&#xD;
      research resources for families of children affected with a phosphatase and tensin homology&#xD;
      (PTEN) mutation. Ultimately, the researchers hope to be able to use this information to&#xD;
      develop a standard of care for affected individuals and their family members. Family&#xD;
      members/legal guardians of an individual with a PTEN mutation enrolled in the Rare Diseases&#xD;
      Clinical Research Network (RDCRN) Contact Registry will be invited via email to participate&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate access to clinical care and clinical research for&#xD;
      patients with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome. This research will entail an anonymous online&#xD;
      survey sent to families/caretakers of affected children. The survey will inquire: (1) basic&#xD;
      clinical information about the child, such as diagnoses (both genetic and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental), level of functioning (estimated IQ) (2) clinical specialists that the&#xD;
      child sees or needs to see (3) how families learn about clinical trials/research relevant to&#xD;
      their child (4) basic demographics about the parent/caretaker completing the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this survey will collect information pertaining to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of affected children in household&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PTEN mutation type of affected children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age and gender of affected children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, neurodevelopmental disorders, medical problems, IQ, and access to clinical care&#xD;
           (specialists currently being seen, specialists not able to see and why) of most affected&#xD;
           child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research methods and mediums for disorder-specific treatment options for affected&#xD;
           children&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons behind not participating in clinical research options&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facts (gender, age, if PTEN mutation carrier, work status, relationship to affected&#xD;
           children, days per week of caregiving responsibilities, education level) about&#xD;
           participant completing survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, the survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete.&#xD;
