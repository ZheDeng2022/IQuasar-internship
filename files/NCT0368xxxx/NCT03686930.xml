  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose&#xD;
      (MAD), study to evaluate the safety/tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of FP-045&#xD;
      administered to normal health volunteers (NHVs). 3 cohorts of NHVs will be enrolled. Subjects&#xD;
      in each cohort will be randomized to orally receive either FP-045 (6 subjects) or placebo (2&#xD;
      subjects). Subjects will receive 7 daily doses of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 21 days before Day 1 and will have&#xD;
      been admitted to the CRU on Day -1 to confirm eligibility and to undergo baseline&#xD;
      assessments. Subjects will remain in the CRU for observation until completion of all&#xD;
      assessments on Day 10. Subjects will return to the CRU on Day 11 for an additional PK sample,&#xD;
      and again for an end of study (EOS) Visit on Day 14 (±2 days) for safety evaluations and&#xD;
      collection of PK samples.&#xD;
