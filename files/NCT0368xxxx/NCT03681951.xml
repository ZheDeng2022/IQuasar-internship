  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an unbiased CRISPR screen, RIPK1 was identified as a top gene contributing to&#xD;
      immunotherapy resistance. In addition, RIPK1 has been reported to drive pancreatic&#xD;
      oncogenesis. In murine models, inhibition of RIPK1 kinase activity in the pancreatic tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment leads to the replacement of tumor-permissive myeloid infiltrates with innate&#xD;
      cells that promote an effective antitumor response by adaptive cells. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that inhibition of RIPK1 in human pancreatic cancer subjects will modulate the&#xD;
      immune infiltrate to sensitize tumors to checkpoint blockade.&#xD;

      Study 205013 is a Phase 1 FTIH study of GSK3145095 alone and in combination with other&#xD;
      anticancer agents including pembrolizumab in subjects with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (PDAC) and other selected tumors. The study includes up to 4 parts: Part 1 dose escalation&#xD;
      will be conducted in approximately 30 adult subjects with advanced or metastatic PDAC using&#xD;
      escalating doses of GSK3145095 as monotherapy only. Part 2 will combine escalating doses of&#xD;
      GSK3145095 with 200 milligram (mg) pembrolizumab. Dose escalation of GSK3145095 will begin at&#xD;
      least one level below the highest dose shown to have an acceptable toxicity profile in at&#xD;
      least 3 subjects in Part 1. Part 2 may be conducted in a broader population of selected solid&#xD;
      tumors using a combination of escalating doses of GSK3145095 and 200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 3&#xD;
      will enroll subjects treated with one or more dose levels of GSK3145095 in combination with&#xD;
      200 mg pembrolizumab. Part 4 will investigate the combination of additional anticancer agents&#xD;
      with one or more doses of GSK3145095 identified as safe in Part 1. Up to approximately 220&#xD;
      subjects will be treated in the study. Parts 1 and 2 will each treat up to approximately 30&#xD;
      subjects. Parts 3 and 4 will treat up to approximately 160 subjects (up to 80 subjects in&#xD;
      each Part). The total duration of the study is expected to last up to 2 years.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must provide signed, written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects, age &gt;=18 years (at the time consent is obtained). a) Male&#xD;
             subjects are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the study&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment: Refrain from donating sperm, be abstinent from&#xD;
             heterosexual or homosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent or must&#xD;
             agree to use contraception/barrier: male condom and female partner to use an&#xD;
             additional highly effective contraceptive method with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per&#xD;
             year. b) female subjects are eligible to participate if they are not either pregnant&#xD;
             or breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: is not a woman&#xD;
             of childbearing potential (WOCBP), is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is&#xD;
             highly effective (with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent per year), with low user&#xD;
             dependency during the study treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120&#xD;
             days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment and agrees not to donate eggs&#xD;
             (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during this period. The investigator&#xD;
             should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to&#xD;
             interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive&#xD;
             method. Therefore, a barrier method is also required for subjects using a hormonal&#xD;
             option (including hormonal intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive pills/ patch/&#xD;
             vaginal inserts, and hormonal implants) and both highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 15 days&#xD;
             (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the last dose of study treatment.If a highly&#xD;
             effective non-hormonal method is used, then only one method of contraception is&#xD;
             required (by a female participant or partner of a male participant; in either&#xD;
             situation the male partner must still use a male condom in addition) during the&#xD;
             treatment period and for at least 15 days (Part 1) and 120 days (Parts 2-4) after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment. A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy&#xD;
             test (urine or serum) as required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention. If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative&#xD;
             (e.g., an ambiguous result), a serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the&#xD;
             subject must be excluded from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.&#xD;
             If the subject hasn't been on an acceptable method of contraception for at least 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to start of therapy, pregnancy testing must be done weekly for the first&#xD;
             month of treatment. Additional requirements for pregnancy testing during and after&#xD;
             study treatment. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history,&#xD;
             menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a&#xD;
             woman with an early undetected pregnancy.&#xD;

             for which standard therapy has proven to be ineffective, intolerable, or is considered&#xD;
             inappropriate. Subjects should have received at least one, but not more than 2 prior&#xD;
             lines of therapy for advanced disease including both standards of care and&#xD;
             investigational therapies. Subjects whose cancers harbor molecular alterations for&#xD;
             which targeted therapy is standard of care should have received health&#xD;
             authority-approved appropriate targeted therapy for their tumor types before&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects in Parts 1 and 2 must consent to provide a fresh biopsy during screening&#xD;

The overall response rate (ORR)-CR and PR was to be determined by the investigator assessment of the participants computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using RECIST version 1.1 criteria for target lesions. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed CR or PR at any time as per disease-specific criteria. PR is when there is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. Complete Response is when there is disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 millimeters (mm).</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response or Partial Response Based on RECIST 1.1 Criteria-Part 4</title>
          <description>A participant's disease status and determination of disease progression at post Baseline visits was to be evaluated by the local investigator's assessments by RECIST version 1.1. The overall response rate (complete response and partial response) was to be determined by the investigator assessment of the participants CT or MRI using RECIST version 1.1 criteria for target lesions. ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall confirmed CR or PR at any time as per disease-specific criteria. Partial Response is when there is at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest diameter of the target lesions. Complete Response is when there is disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph nodes reduced to &lt;10 mm.</description>
