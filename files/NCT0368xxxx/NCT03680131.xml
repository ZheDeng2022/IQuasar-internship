        INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years old, inclusive, at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. For women of childbearing potential involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead&#xD;
             to pregnancy: the subject must agree to use an effective contraceptive method from at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks before Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product&#xD;
             application. Effective contraceptive methods include hormonal contraceptives (combined&#xD;
             oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring, injectable, or implant), intrauterine devices&#xD;
             or intrauterine systems, vasectomized partner(s), tubal ligation, or a barrier method&#xD;
             of contraception (male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge) in conjunction with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects must have been on a stable dose of hormonal contraceptives for at least&#xD;
             4 weeks before Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: The above list of contraceptive methods does not apply to subjects who are&#xD;
             abstinent for at least 4 weeks before Day 1 and will continue to be abstinent from&#xD;
             penile-vaginal intercourse throughout the study. The reliability of sexual abstinence&#xD;
             needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: A woman of nonchildbearing potential is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Woman who has had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
                  or bilateral salpingectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Woman who has had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months without an&#xD;
                  alternative medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test&#xD;
                  confirming nonchildbearing potential (refer to laboratory reference ranges for&#xD;
                  confirmatory levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For men involved in any sexual intercourse that could lead to pregnancy, subject must&#xD;
             agree to use one of the effective contraceptive methods listed in Inclusion Criterion&#xD;
             #2 from Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product application. If the&#xD;
             female partner of a male subject use any of the hormonal contraceptive methods listed&#xD;
             above, this contraceptive method must be used by the female partner from at least 4&#xD;
             weeks before Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after the last study product application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Female of childbearing potential has had a negative pregnancy test at screening visit&#xD;
             .&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is willing to participate and is capable of giving informed consent. Note:&#xD;
             Consent must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be willing to comply with all study procedures and must be available for&#xD;
             the duration of the study.&#xD;

        1. Subject is in good general health, according to the investigator's judgment based on&#xD;
        medical history and physical examination/laboratory/ECG/vital signs assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with allergic contact dermatitis only:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has at least 3-month history of allergic contact dermatitis (information&#xD;
             obtained from medical chart or subject's physician, or directly from the subject).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has moderate to severe chronic allergic contact dermatitis at Day 1, defined&#xD;
             by either one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CDSI score ≥ 7&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  CDSI score of severe (3) in ≥ 2 of the 5 assessed symptoms (Fissures, Scaling&#xD;
                  Redness, Pruritus, Dryness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has allergic contact dermatitis covering between 0.5% to 10% of the total BSA&#xD;
             at Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has an ISGA ≥ 3 at Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has had a positive patch test (&quot;+&quot;, &quot;++&quot; or &quot;+++&quot; reaction) to an allergen&#xD;
             that is suspected to be involved in the current allergic contact dermatitis in the&#xD;
             past 5 years (obtain written documentation of patch test result if possible).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Alternatively, the Subject agrees to undergo patch testing during the screening period&#xD;
             (patch testing needs to be initiated but not completed prior to Day 1). Guidelines for&#xD;
             patch test interpretation are provided in Appendix 2. The measure of the degree of the&#xD;
             reaction will be determined on the basis of the reading 2 and 3-4 days post&#xD;
             application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject agrees to only apply personal care products (i.e. makeup and eyeshadow) that&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Subject agrees not to apply any personal care products on allergic contact dermatitis&#xD;
             lesions prior to site visits.&#xD;
