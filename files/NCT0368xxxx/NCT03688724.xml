      It is a prospective observational study of a cohort of patients who underwent brachial plexus&#xD;
      blockage above the clavicle, and in which diaphragmatic function is observed in both&#xD;
      hemidiaphragms by ultrasound (using Diaphragm Thickening Fraction), which allows to obtain&#xD;
      the real incidence of Hemidiaphragm palsy in these patients, and estimate the perioperative&#xD;
      evolution of both hemidiaphragms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemidiaphragm palsy after brachial plexus block above the clavicle (BPBAC) is frequent, but&#xD;
      few patients develop postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC). Little attention has been&#xD;
      paid to the contralateral hemidiaphragm as part of the global diaphragmatic function. After&#xD;
      BPBAC, global diaphragm function reduces due to ipsilateral hemidiaphragm reduction, but less&#xD;
      than expected due to the increase in the contralateral hemidiaphragm function. As a part of&#xD;
      the diaphragm function, the contralateral hemidiaphragm function plays a relevant role in the&#xD;
      appearance of PPC.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Shoulder surgery is known to be a particularly painful stimulus. Perioperative&#xD;
      analgesia using brachial plexus block by injection above the clavicle (BPBAC) for shoulder&#xD;
      surgery is the standard of care 1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to date, ipsilateral diaphragmatic paresis after BPBAC is still very frequent, but few&#xD;
      patients develop postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC), and most of them are mild8.&#xD;
      There is much concern in avoiding ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paralysis to reduce PPC.&#xD;
      Little attention has been paid to the contralateral diaphragm and the global diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function formed by both hemidiaphragms (the ipsilateral and the contralateral to the BPBAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A meticulous study of perioperative diaphragm evolution is needed to answer why some patients&#xD;
      after BPBAC develop PPC and others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES The primary objective was to examine the evolution of perioperative hemidiaphragm&#xD;
      function with ultrasound (ipsilateral and contralateral) when using BPBAC following shoulder&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the hypothesis is that despite frequent acute ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis after&#xD;
      BPBAC, the contralateral hemidiaphragm function increases and preserves global diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function in most patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS A prospective observational cohort study evaluating perioperative (preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative) diaphragm point-of-care ultrasound (D-POCUS) at an academic tertiary hospital&#xD;
      in Spain. Adults undergoing shoulder surgery with planned BPBAC (ISB or SCB) will be eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion. Patients planned for not receive BPBAC for any reason will be exclude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thickening diaphragm fraction (TF) and diaphragm excursion (DE) were measured in both&#xD;
      hemidiaphragms before BPBAC (at the preoperative time) and within 30 min after surgery (at&#xD;
      the postoperative time, at least 1 hour after BPBAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All measures will be repeated three times in each patient and by the same member of the&#xD;
      research team to reduce intra-observer and inter-observer variability. In addition, he will&#xD;
      be blinded to the side on which the BPBAC will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TF was calculated using the following formula: TF = (Tdi-Tde)/Tde x100 (%). TF ipsilateral&#xD;
      was the TF measured in the hemidiaphragm ipsilateral to the BPBAC. TF contralateral was the&#xD;
      TF measured in the hemidiaphragm contralateral to the BPBAC. TFglobal was the sum of both&#xD;
      hemidiaphragm TF to reflect the global diaphragm function. It was calculated using the&#xD;
      following formula: (TF Global = (TF ipsilateral + TF contralateral). DE was measured in mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics of participants were collected, including age, gender,&#xD;
      comorbidities, respiratory rate (RR), basal SpO2 (Oxygen saturation measured by pulse&#xD;
      oximeter), respiratory symptoms, and ARISCAT scale . also data were collect during&#xD;
      perioperative, related to BPBAC (loco-regional technique, local anesthetic, concentration,&#xD;
      volume of injection); related to intraoperative management (hypnotics, morphic and blocking&#xD;
      neuromuscular agents used); and related to postoperative (Train-Of-Four(TOF) scale, visual&#xD;
      analog scale (VAS) Pain, RR, SpO2, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), SpO2/FiO2, existence&#xD;
      of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) ). PPC is defined as the occurrence of&#xD;
      dyspnea, tachypnea (RR &gt;20% of preoperative RR), SpO2 &lt;90%, or SpO2/FiO2 &lt;315.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Continuous variables will be reported as medians with their&#xD;
      interquartile range [IQR] or means with standard deviations (SD) where applicable, and&#xD;
      categorical variables as counts and percentages. Group comparisons of continuous variables&#xD;
      will be made using the Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, or Wilcoxon rank-sum test as&#xD;
      appropriate. Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis test will be used where&#xD;
      appropriate for categorical variables. Analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics&#xD;
      for Windows, Version 24.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated using Gpower 3.1. An effect size of 0.48 was calculated based&#xD;
      on the difference between two dependent means (matched pairs) obtained on previous pilot&#xD;
      study data. The occurrence of TFcontralateral variation before and after BPBAC was 12Â±30. A&#xD;
      sample size of 59 patients was required to detect a 20% of TFcontralateral variation with 95%&#xD;
      power and a two-sided alpha of 0.05. an increase of 10% on sample size was applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOTAL n= 65 patients.&#xD;
