  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total participants in the &quot;Functionality and Accuracy of the smART System in Real-Life ICU&#xD;
      Settings&quot; are 10 participants - in the current Sheba study site there were 2 participants and&#xD;
      in the Jefferson study site (identifier NCT03198988) there were 8 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted in order to validate the functionality and accuracy of the smART™&#xD;
      System in a real-life ICU setting. The smART™ Feeding Tube System is a novel system with&#xD;
      nasogastric tube developed by ART Medical (Healthcare) Ltd, based on sensor-lined tubes that&#xD;
      transmit real-time information to an external console. The smART™ feeding tube is equipped&#xD;
      with reflux sensors which alert when gastric contents regurgitating into the esophagus. In&#xD;
      addition, the smART™ feeding tube is equipped with sensors designed to provide information&#xD;
      about the location of the tube thus assisting in reducing the incident of misplacement during&#xD;
      first positioning. The smART™ feeding tube is also automatically and in real-time stops&#xD;
      feeding if the feeding tube moves out of position during ongoing use or detect gastric&#xD;
      content in esophagus. Furthermore, smART™ Feeding Tube System can guide operator to correctly&#xD;
      re-position the tube. Lastly the smART™ Feeding Tube System is equipped with an anti-reflux&#xD;
      mechanism and automatic Gastric Residual Volume (GRV).&#xD;
