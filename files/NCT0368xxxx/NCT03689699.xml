  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MAGIC-8 is a two-arm, multicenter, phase 1b/2 study to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy&#xD;
      with either Nivolumab (anti-PD-1) or Nivolumab plus BMS-986253 combined with ADT using&#xD;
      Degarelix (LHRH antagonist) for men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and a rising&#xD;
      prostate-sepcific antigen (PSA). The purpose of this study is to see whether immunotherapy&#xD;
      with either Nivolumab alone or Nivolumab plus BMS-986253 combined with Degarelix, which&#xD;
      suppresses testosterone, is safe and can decrease the chance that the cancer will come back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to 1) determine the rate of PSA recurrence defined as a PSA&#xD;
      &gt;0.2ng/ml for radical prostatectomy patients or PSA &gt;2.0ng/ml for patients who received&#xD;
      primary radiation therapy at a time point of 10 months after start of therapy; and 2)&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of either nivolumab or nivolumab plus BMS-986253 in&#xD;
      combination with degarelix in men with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives include determining relapse-free survival (RFS) and % change in PSA to&#xD;
      immunotherapy alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is common and remains a major cause of death in men. Following local therapy&#xD;
      with surgery or radiation, a significant number of men recur either with a rising PSA only&#xD;
      (biochemical recurrence (BCR)) or clear metastatic disease on imaging. Although androgen&#xD;
      deprivation therapy (ADT) is a frequently used and effective treatment for prostate cancer,&#xD;
      it is associated with significant side effects including fatigue, hot flashes, decreased&#xD;
      libido and bone loss. Therefore, new approaches to decrease the time on ADT are crucial to&#xD;
      improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once initiated, ADT can be given either continuously or intermittently. However, even with an&#xD;
      intermittent approach the ADT-free interval typically decreases with each cycle and most men&#xD;
      eventually develop castration resistance. Therefore new treatment strategies are needed to&#xD;
      improve disease control while minimizing ADT exposure for men with early prostate cancer.&#xD;
