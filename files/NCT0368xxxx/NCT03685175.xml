  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anthracycline doxorubicin, first introduced in the 1960's, continues to be an effectively&#xD;
      utilized antineoplastic drug. Even at relatively low cumulative doses there is risk of&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity. However, the incidence of subclinical cardiotoxicity is not known, carrying a&#xD;
      potential risk for late effects in cancer survivors. Doxorubicin has systemic toxicity that&#xD;
      may contribute to cardiac metabolic stress, but the main cardiotoxic mechanism involves&#xD;
      cardiac mitochondria. The goal of this study is to detect early changes in the mitochondrial&#xD;
      metabolism in situ as a marker for subclinical doxorubicin induced cardiotoxicity.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, single-center study in women and men with breast cancer requiring&#xD;
      cardiotoxic anticancer therapy. The study will be conducted in parallel to the standard&#xD;
      clinical care, at dedicated visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study patients will undergo a cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) signal detection after&#xD;
      injection of hyperpolarized carbon-13 pyruvate. The study will be performed before the course&#xD;
      of cardiotoxic anticancer therapy, and after completing the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened prior to enrollment based on study specific inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and MRI safety criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the metabolic cardiac MR scan an IV line will be inserted and the participant&#xD;
      will receive a bolus of oral glucose. The ingestion of glucose will be required to prepare&#xD;
      the state of the heart for metabolic imaging. Following this preparation the participant will&#xD;
      undergo a cardiac MR study of about 45 minutes, including carbon-13 dedicated sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate dedicated cardiac MRI session may be completed in certain participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part I 10 patients will be administered at two visits 1) after completion of cardiotoxic&#xD;
      therapy and 2) 1 to 6 months after the first time point following medical therapy (SOC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part II up to 100 patients will be administered at two visits: 1) baseline MRI before&#xD;
      administration of cardiotoxic therapy and 2) after completion of cardiotoxic therapy&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female or male with breast cancer tissue diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Plan for treatment as cardiotoxic therapy. Patients for the feasibility study must be&#xD;
             post cardiotoxic therapy, and patients for the formal study should not have started&#xD;
             the cardiotoxic therapy yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
