      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide in comparison to&#xD;
      once weekly injection of dulaglutide on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) change in participants&#xD;
      with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the superiority of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide with once&#xD;
           weekly injection of dulaglutide on glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To demonstrate the superiority of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide with once&#xD;
           weekly injection of dulaglutide on body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of once weekly injection of efpeglenatide and once weekly&#xD;
           injection of dulaglutide.&#xD;

    <description>Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of &lt;54 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (&lt;3.0 mmol/L).

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 45 active sites in 4 countries. A total of 1608 participants were screened between 26 September 2018 and 17 December 2019, out of which 700 were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to inclusion criteria not met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 908 participants were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to either efpeglenatide 4 milligram (mg), efpeglenatide 6 mg, or dulaglutide 1.5 mg treatment arms, stratified by screening glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values (less than [&lt;]8%, greater than or equal to [&gt;=]8 percent [%]) and by body mass index (BMI) (&lt;30 kg/m^2 and &gt;=30 kg/m^2) on Day 1.</pre_assignment_details>
