      TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody)&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by allowing the immune system to attack the cancer. This&#xD;
      phase II trial is studying how well TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042&#xD;
      (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody) work in combination in treating patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic liver cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) as determined by RECIST v1.1 of advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patients treated with TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody)&#xD;
      and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1 binding antibody).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the ORR as determined by the immune related Response Criteria (irRC),&#xD;
      duration of response (DOR), time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response of study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety profile of treated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive TSR-022 (cobolimab, TIM-3 binding antibody) and TSR-042 (dostarlimab, PD-1&#xD;
      binding antibody) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed every 9 weeks.&#xD;
