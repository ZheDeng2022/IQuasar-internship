      The objective of the Pediatric Gastroparesis Registry is to create a national prospective&#xD;
      registry of children and adolescents with gastroparesis and gastroparesis-like syndrome&#xD;
      (symptoms of gastroparesis but normal gastric emptying).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Pediatric Gastroparesis Registry (PGpR), we will collect detailed epidemiological,&#xD;
      clinical, psychological, and patient outcome data with the goal of classifying patients with&#xD;
      gastroparesis and gastroparesis-like syndromes into pathophysiologically defined phenotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective is to create a national prospective registry of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with gastroparesis and gastroparesis-like syndrome (symptoms of gastroparesis but&#xD;
      normal gastric emptying) to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic, clinical, psychological, nutritional characteristics, physiological&#xD;
           measures, and serial assessments of symptoms over 3 years while receiving clinical care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Establish a Biorepository of plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),&#xD;
           GI mucosal biopsies (in those undergoing upper GI endoscopy), urine and stool collected&#xD;
           from the children and adolescents in this registry which will allow for future analyses&#xD;
           such as cytokines, bacterial DNA and microbiome to investigate the etiology and&#xD;
           pathogenesis of gastroparesis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine what factors, if any, play a role in the outcomes of children who do not&#xD;
           improve within two years of diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the spectrum of symptom severity of the cardinal gastroparesis symptoms:&#xD;
           nausea, vomiting, early satiety, postprandial fullness (and upper abdominal pain, if&#xD;
           present) in children with gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess several areas of gastric motility in pediatric patients with symptoms of&#xD;
           gastroparesis (e.g., intragastric meal distribution, global gastric emptying)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To capture the clinical symptomatic course (outcome) of pediatric patients followed in&#xD;
           the registry&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine whether gastroparesis symptoms are correlated with gastric emptying in a&#xD;
           pediatric population&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To characterize abdominal pain in patients with gastroparesis and gastroparesis-like&#xD;
           syndrome by using questionnaires, water load satiety testing and quantitative sensory&#xD;
           testing (QST)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Determine the prevalence of hypermobility spectrum disorders in pediatric patients with&#xD;
           gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To determine if the volume of water consumed during the water load satiety test is an&#xD;
           indirect measure of gastric accommodation&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To determine if the water load satiety test is associated with an increased severity of&#xD;
           gastroparesis symptoms (fullness, bloating, abdominal pain, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To compare the intragastric meal distribution during scintigraphy to symptoms of early&#xD;
           satiety, postprandial fullness in patients with symptoms of gastroparesis&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Define immune cell profiles, cytokine induction and epigenetic changes in diabetic and&#xD;
           idiopathic gastroparesis&#xD;

    <description>The Water Load Satiety Test involves the participant drinking refrigerated spring water (4 degrees C) from a 1-liter container over a period of 5 minutes until feeling completely full. The total volume of water consumed (mL) over 5 minutes is the unit of measure, and the outcome is assessed by calculating the change in volume consumed (24 weeks - baseline).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedQL) Generic Core Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic Core Scale is completed by the child, and is composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions: Physical Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Social Functioning, and School Functioning. Each item is answered using a 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes), 4 (A lot). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating lower problems. The Total Score is calculated as the sum of all the items over the number of items answered on all the scales. The outcome is assessed by calculating the change in Total Score (48 weeks - baseline).</description>

    <measure>Change in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedQL) Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pediatric Quality of Life (PedQL) Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scale is completed by the child, and is composed of 58 items comprising 10 dimensions: Stomach Pain and Hurt, Stomach Discomfort When Eating, Food and Drink Limits, Trouble Swallowing, Heart Burn and Reflux, Nausea and Vomiting, Gas and Bloating, Constipation, Blood in Poop, and Diarrhea. Each item is answered using a 3-point scale: 0 (Not at all), 2 (Sometimes), 4 (A lot). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating lower problems. The Symptom Total Scales Score is calculated as the sum of the items answered in the 10 dimensions. The outcome is assessed by calculating the change in Total Score (48 weeks - baseline).</description>
