      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is often painful, and is caused by&#xD;
      neurotoxic chemotherapy including vincristine. It is a cause of significant impairment in&#xD;
      quality of life in patients surviving to a solid cancer or malignant lymphoma. The only&#xD;
      recognized prevention is based on pre-existing neuropathy and early detection of neuropathic&#xD;
      signs and symptoms in individuals subjected to neurotoxic chemotherapy, justifying sometimes&#xD;
      a change in the therapeutic strategy when other molecules are available. It seems obvious&#xD;
      that to identify early markers of CIPN and to develop preventive therapeutic strategies, are&#xD;
      priorities for improving patients' quality of life and enable them to follow optimal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe in patients treated for non-Hodgkin's type B malignant lymphoma with multidrug&#xD;
      therapy containing vincristine, the impact of candesartan on the occurrence of neuropathy&#xD;
      measured by the variation of TNSc (Total Neuropathy Score clinical version, evaluating&#xD;
      clinical signs of neuropathy)&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint in this clinical study is the V1 - V4 variation of the TNSc score TNSc is the Total Neuropathy Score Clinical version scale&#xD;
Validated 7-item TNSc quantifies subjective sensory and motor symptoms, vibration sensation, strength, and reflexes.Items are rated using a 0 to 4 scale and summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores reflect more severe neuropathy.&#xD;
The evaluation of the TNSc will be performed by a blinded evaluator of the randomization group</description>

    <description>Variation oh the VAS score between V1 - V3 and between V1- V4 The visual analogue scale (VAS) is commonly used as the outcome measure to characterize the intensity of pain . It is presented as a 100-mm horizontal line on which the patient's pain intensity is represented by a point between the extremes of &quot;no pain at all&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot;&#xD;
Higher scores reflect more severe pain.</description>
