  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, breast cancer is the most common cancer and the main cause of deaths due to cancer.&#xD;
      This is attributed to changes in reproductive habits as well as an increasingly sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle, with low physical activity and diets rich in saturated fats but low in fiber.&#xD;
      While the main focus in many Asian countries is to improve survival from breast cancer by&#xD;
      encouraging early detection of the disease and improving access to cancer treatment, it does&#xD;
      not reduce the number of women who will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the years to come.&#xD;
      Currently, there is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to prevent breast cancer&#xD;
      in Asia and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soy may be an important dietary strategy for breast cancer prevention. Compared to women in&#xD;
      the West, Asian women consume up to 10-fold more soy in their diet, which may, in part,&#xD;
      explain their lower risk of breast cancer. Soybeans are rich in isoflavones, which can mimic&#xD;
      estrogenic activity. In the body, it competes with estrogen and binds to estrogen receptor&#xD;
      sites, thereby reducing the effect of estrogen and possibly lowering breast cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistently, research has shown that Asian postmenopausal women who have high soy diets are&#xD;
      less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer. However, researchers have not been able to&#xD;
      show that postmenopausal women can reduce their breast cancer risk by increasing soy intake&#xD;
      as part of their diets. There are several reasons why these studies have failed to see an&#xD;
      effect despite the body of evidence indicating that soy may be protective. Firstly, these are&#xD;
      studies of Caucasian women who may have never been exposed to soy, particularly in&#xD;
      adolescence, where soy may have the greatest impact. Also, these studies have used soy&#xD;
      isoflavone supplements, rather than traditional soy foods made from whole soybeans, which may&#xD;
      affect how soy is metabolized in the body. Lastly, the way in which mammographic density&#xD;
      measurements were obtained previously could have negatively influenced the study results,&#xD;
      such as the use of digitized images of mammogram films rather than raw digital images and the&#xD;
      use of semi-automated methods that may be subject to human error and reader variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a well-designed intervention study among Asian women living in Asia, using&#xD;
      suitable mammographic density measures as a surrogate marker of breast cancer risk, will best&#xD;
      answer these remaining gaps in our knowledge about the soy-breast cancer relationship.&#xD;
