      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of RO5126766 at different doses to find out&#xD;
      what effects, if any, it has on people with advanced lung cancer who have previously received&#xD;
      treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor.&#xD;

    <description>The study will begin with a standard 3+3 design. The study will enroll 3 patients at the previously identified MTD15 (4mg two times per week on days 1 and 4). The period of evaluation for dose limiting toxicity will be through completion of cycle 1. If ≤1 of the 3 initial patients at the proposed dose experience a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled for a total of 6 planned patients at that dose level. Otherwise, 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level -1. If ≤ 1 of these patients experience a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. If more than 1 patient experiences a DLT in dose level -1, the study will be terminated.</description>
