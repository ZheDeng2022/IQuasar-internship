  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to do this initial pilot study as an observational prospective cohort&#xD;
      study, evaluating elderly patients who have capacity in National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      rehabilitation and community hospitals. The patients will each be recorded doing simple&#xD;
      activities of daily living in two 2 hour sessions using a discrete wireless device. This will&#xD;
      generate anonymous data set that can be used to train and refine our machine learning&#xD;
      algorithm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 - Creation The creation of a databank of measurements during stereotypical actions of&#xD;
      daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population recruited (P1 recruits) Patients to complete a demographic questionnaire based on&#xD;
      historical falls risk data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited patients allocated to a mobility/independence subgroup based on the information&#xD;
      obtained from the demographic questionnaire completed at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be reclassified to different subgroups to redistribute them according to other&#xD;
      factors including frailty, exercise tolerance, balance etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients given a structured scripted set of simple activities to carry out (such as walking,&#xD;
      sitting and picking something off the floor etc.) to cover as many activities of daily of&#xD;
      living as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their actions will be monitored with inertia measurement units (IMU) 1-3 per patient (Each&#xD;
      will be off the shelf European Conformity (CE) approved products no bigger than a modern&#xD;
      smart phone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is transmitted from the IMUs wirelessly to the investigators' laptop, patients will not&#xD;
      be attached or anchored to any secondary devices or cables. The IMUs are attached to the&#xD;
      patients with a comfortable lightweight belt design and or non-invasive leg bands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These scripted sessions will be repeated 5 to 10 times per subject to create an anonymous&#xD;
      databank (D1). This will form a reference range per subgroup of &quot;truth&quot; data for the&#xD;
      algorithm to search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identifiable data will be limited to the study questionnaires which will be stored&#xD;
      securely at the corresponding study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 - Validation The validation of the databank while observing previously recorded and&#xD;
      not previously recorded subjects in an unscripted session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population patients included All patients from phase 1, new patients recruited (P2 recruits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly recruited patients (P2) to complete a demographic questionnaire based on historical&#xD;
      falls risk data. These patients will not be immediately allocated to a mobility/independence&#xD;
      subgroup, but labelled as unknown (x).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients observed individually during daily activities in an unscripted session. Patient&#xD;
      to wear single IMU sensor which captures mobility data (D2). The activities the subject&#xD;
      undertakes during D2 are manually entered onto timesheet by observer for later cross&#xD;
      referencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Patients (P2) who are previously unrecorded and who are unallocated to a&#xD;
      mobility/independence subgroup have their unscripted data (D2) analysed by the motion&#xD;
      algorithm which stratifies them to a mobility/independence subgroup based on the likeness of&#xD;
      their data to that stored in the databank (D1). They are then allocated to a&#xD;
      mobility/independence subgroup based on their questionnaire data and the two outcomes are&#xD;
      compared to see if they match or differ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Can algorithm predict &quot;truth&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Patients (P1) who have previously been recorded in phase 1 and who are allocated to a&#xD;
      mobility/independence subgroup based on their questionnaire data have their unscripted data&#xD;
      (D2) from phase 2 analysed by the motion algorithm. This then stratifies them again to a&#xD;
      mobility/independence subgroup based on the likeness of their new data (D2) to that stored in&#xD;
      the databank (D1). To see if their outcome remains the same or differs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Can algorithm confirm &quot;truth&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      (See Appendix B. for diagrammatically representation of phase 1 and phase 2.) During the&#xD;
      unscripted session (D2) any falls or patient reported loss of balance that occurs will be&#xD;
      recorded and time stamped by the observer. These data sets will be labelled as &quot;Falls truth&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;Balance truth&quot; data respectively and added to the anonymous databank for cross-reference.&#xD;
