    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this 5-year Mentored Research Scientist Development K01-Award is to&#xD;
      support Henna Budhwani, PhD, MPH to become an independent implementation science investigator&#xD;
      in the field of HIV prevention. The proposed project seeks to address the HIV crisis in&#xD;
      Alabama, where rates of undiagnosed HIV in black young men who have sex with men (YMSM, 18-29&#xD;
      years) exceed 20%. This project will adapt and test a behavioral intervention to promote HIV&#xD;
      rapid testing in the community, deliver culturally appropriate prevention education, offer&#xD;
      sociostructural support, and refer eligible participants for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).&#xD;
      Four training objectives are proposed that are in lockstep with three specific aims.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was developed in the spirit of the K01 mechanism, thoughtfully linking training to&#xD;
      research. The research study proposed in this K01-application includes the conduct of three&#xD;
      specific aims that are aligned with four training objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1 outlines an intensive training and mentoring plan on social theory including&#xD;
      theories of intersectionality and emerging masculinities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2 provides in-depth training on qualitative research methods including how to&#xD;
      conduct focus groups, in-depth interviews, and qualitative data analysis. Aim 1, which will&#xD;
      be conducted after Objective 2, is to elucidate experiences, beliefs, and predictors related&#xD;
      to delivery and utilization of HIV testing and prevention services for black YMSM using&#xD;
      qualitative research methods, namely in-depth interviews with HIV prevention and outreach&#xD;
      staff, focus groups with black YMSM, and in-depth interviews with other members of key&#xD;
      population sub-groups such as transgender women and black YMSM who are no longer on PrEP, to&#xD;
      inform the adaptation of BSB. Aim 1 will include 6 focus groups with black YMSM to explore&#xD;
      perceptions and experiences with testing, prevention services, and PrEP as these relate to&#xD;
      the adaptation of the intervention (estimated N=36-48). Aim 1 will include in-depth&#xD;
      interviews with transgender women, black YMSM who have not taken an HIV-test in the past&#xD;
      6-months, black YMSM who are on PrEP, and black YMSM who were on PrEP but are no longer on&#xD;
      PrEP (estimated N=16-24). This first aim will also include in-depth interviews with HIV&#xD;
      prevention and outreach staff to document inner and outer contexts of community-based testing&#xD;
      and clinical settings (estimated N=10). Thematic coding and analysis methods will be used to&#xD;
      elucidate ways in which the intervention will need to be modernized and revised to be&#xD;
      culturally acceptable to the target population and to address locally relevant structural&#xD;
      barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3 provides robust training on how to scientifically and iteratively adapt HIV&#xD;
      behavioral interventions using validated frameworks, such as intervention mapping. Aim 2 is&#xD;
      to adapt the Brothers Saving Brothers (BSB) intervention to include two HIV prevention tools&#xD;
      (rapid testing and PrEP), to address structural barriers, and to be acceptable to black YMSM&#xD;
      in Alabama. In Aim 2, I will use intervention mapping, informed by Aim 1 data, to iteratively&#xD;
      adapt BSB to include the aforementioned updates. Since BSB will require extensive revisions,&#xD;
      I have selected an intervention development framework (rather than an adaptation model) to&#xD;
      guide the scientific adaptation process. After each cycle, the adapted intervention will be&#xD;
      shared with CBO outreach staff and black YMSM to solicit their feedback. I anticipate 2-4&#xD;
      iterations (adaptations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 4 offers methodical training and mentoring in the field of implementation science.&#xD;
      Aim 3, which concludes the proposed research study and K01 project, is to conduct a hybrid&#xD;
      type 1 effectiveness-implementation pilot study of the adapted intervention in which the&#xD;
      investigators will a) assess acceptability and feasibility of the adapted BSB (aBSB); b)&#xD;
      preliminarily estimate effects on HIV prevention outcomes; and c) collect data on real-world&#xD;
      implementation. I will pilot-test aBSB with black YMSM in Alabama (N=60); half will be&#xD;
      randomized to the control condition; half will receive aBSB. I will collect effectiveness&#xD;
      data (including acceptability and feasibility) pre-intervention/control, immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention/control, 3-months after initial contact, and 6-months after initial&#xD;
      contact. Toward the end of the study-period, I will collect implementation data from staff&#xD;
      interviewed in Aim 1 (N=10) and from study participants to assess how aBSB was experienced&#xD;
      and internalized (N=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This rigorous project includes intensive training at UAB and from other prominent&#xD;
      institutions that offer very specific training not found at UAB; comprehensive mentoring from&#xD;
      senior HIV researchers with expertise in minority, youth, and MSM health; and a thoughtful&#xD;
      research strategy that addresses a significant threat -- high rates of undiagnosed HIV and&#xD;
      the lack of HIV prevention, including PrEP uptake -- in black YMSM in Alabama. The&#xD;
      combination of the proposed mentoring and training with study findings will culminate in the&#xD;
      candidates attainment of independence and the development of a full-scale R01 implementation&#xD;
      science proposal to test the adapted intervention.&#xD;
