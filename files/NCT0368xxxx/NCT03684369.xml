  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical trial is to quantify the capacity of a translatable protocol of&#xD;
      electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to improve walking performance and self-reported&#xD;
      disabilities of persons with MS. The hypothesis is that activation of sensory nerve fibers&#xD;
      with augmented TENS promotes recovery of sensorimotor function and improves the disability&#xD;
      status of individuals with MS. The rationale for the proposed clinical trial is that the&#xD;
      approach provides a low-cost therapeutic strategy for persons with MS to manage walking&#xD;
      limitations and fatigue.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Randomization will be&#xD;
      accomplished by recruiting two individuals with a similar level of disability at a time and&#xD;
      flipping a coin (two persons present) to determine the group assignment (A or B) of the&#xD;
      person who contacted the investigators first. The participants and outcome assessors will be&#xD;
      blinded to group assignment. Both groups will receive the treatment (real or sham) during the&#xD;
      first 4 weeks (3 sessions/week)and then there will be an 8-week follow-up period.&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
