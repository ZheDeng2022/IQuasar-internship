  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is characterized by irreversible vision loss through the progressive death of optic&#xD;
      nerve fibers unless timely diagnosis and adequate treatment are provided. Medical therapy is&#xD;
      aimed at lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) below a clinically determined target level in&#xD;
      order to prevent or slow glaucoma progression. IOP is known to vary with the time of day as&#xD;
      well as with daily activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current way of assessing nycthemeral IOP fluctuation is to perform repeated discrete&#xD;
      tonometry measurements, allowing only snapshot and non-continuous measurements once per hour&#xD;
      in the best cases. The procedure is cumbersome, expensive, inconvenient (disturbed sleep&#xD;
      cycle as patient is awoken for nocturnal/sleep period measurements) and may not detect&#xD;
      crucial IOP values in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensimed AG has developed a new contact lens (CL)-based device intended to continuously&#xD;
      measure IOP over 24 hours. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of device&#xD;
      for 24-hour IOP monitoring in healthy subjects and glaucoma patients.&#xD;
