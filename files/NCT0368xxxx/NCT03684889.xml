  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia or lymphoma are often refractory to further&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In this study, the investigators will attempt to use T cells obtained directly&#xD;
      from the patient, which can be genetically engineered to express a fully human chimeric&#xD;
      antigen receptor (CAR). The CAR used in this study can recognize CD19, a protein expressed on&#xD;
      the surface of leukemia and lymphoma cells. The fully human CAR used in this study may help&#xD;
      protect against rejection of the CAR T cells, which in turn could lead to lasting protection&#xD;
      against return of the leukemia or lymphoma. The phase 1 part of this study will determine the&#xD;
      safety of these CAR T cells, and the phase 2 part of the study will determine how effective&#xD;
      this CAR T cell therapy is. Both patients who have never had prior CAR T cell therapy and&#xD;
      those who have had prior CAR T cell therapy may be eligible to participate in this study.&#xD;
