  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analgo-sedation is standard procedure in anesthesiology practice and is often given for&#xD;
      colonoscopy in the setting of daily hospital. Ideally, patients should be sedated with&#xD;
      preserved spontaneous breathing and adequate blood O2 saturation. To maintain adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation, low-flow O2 (2-6 L/min) is usually delivered through standard nasal catheter&#xD;
      which can provide inspired fraction (FiO2) of 40% (low-flow nasal oxygenation - LFNO).&#xD;
      Coldness and dryness of LFNO applied may be uncomfortable to patient. Standardly applied&#xD;
      intravenous anesthetics can lead to transient ceasing of breathing and O2 desaturation&#xD;
      despite LFNO. Respiratory instability can also potentiate circulatory instability -&#xD;
      undesirable changes in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP). Unlike LFNO, high-flow heated&#xD;
      and humidified nasal oxygenation (HFNO) is characterized by the oxygen-air mixture flow of 20&#xD;
      to 70 L/min up to 100% FiO2. Warm and humidified O2, delivered via soft, specially designed&#xD;
      nasal cannula, is pleasant to patient. HFNO develops continuous positive pressure of 3 to 7&#xD;
      cmH2O in upper airway which enables noninvasive support to patient's spontaneous breathing&#xD;
      thus prolonging time of adequate O2 saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to compare effect of HFNO and LFNO on oxygenation maintenance before,&#xD;
      during and after standardized procedure of intravenous analgo-sedation in normal weight&#xD;
      patients of ASA risk I, II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesize that application of HFNO compared to LFNO, in patients with&#xD;
      preserved spontaneous breathing during procedural analgo-sedation, will contribute to&#xD;
      maintaining of adequate oxygenation, consequentially adding to greater circulatory and&#xD;
      respiratory patients' stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that patients who receive HFNO will better maintain adequate oxygenation&#xD;
      regarding improved spontaneous breathing. Also patients will have shorter intervals of blood&#xD;
      oxygen desaturation, less pronounced rise in blood CO2 level and lesser fall of blood O2&#xD;
      level, less change in HR and BP. Investigators will have to exactly estimate partial and&#xD;
      global respiratory insufficiency (blood CO2 and O2 levels) associated with LFNO and HFNO,&#xD;
      which will be done by blood-gas analysis of 3 arterial blood samples collected before, during&#xD;
      and after analgo - sedation via previously, in local anesthesia, placed arterial cannula.&#xD;
      Possible complications will be explained in written uniformed consent and by&#xD;
      anesthesiologist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Analgo-sedation is standard procedure in anesthesiology practice and is often given for&#xD;
      diagnostic and procedural intervention in the setting of daily hospital. Institution of&#xD;
      sedation and maintaining spontaneous breathing are main characteristics of analgo-sedation.&#xD;
      Preservation of adequate patient oxygenation is set up by continuous administration of&#xD;
      sedative anesthetic infusion which contributes to hemodynamic stability and by administration&#xD;
      of oxygen. Patient oxygenation is implemented prior to analgo-sedation (preoxygenation),&#xD;
      during analgo-sedation (periprocedural oxygenation) and during awakening from analgo-sedation&#xD;
      (postprocedural oxygenation) usually via nasal cannula with application of low-flow (2-6&#xD;
      L/min) up to 40% of inspired fraction of oxygen (LFNO: low-flow nasal oxygenation, FiO2:&#xD;
      inspiratory fraction of oxygen). Despite oxygenation administered, intravenously applied&#xD;
      analgo-sedation yields to risk of transitory apnea accompanied by hypoxemia, hypoxia,&#xD;
      hypercapnia and hemodynamic insufficiency. Anesthesia risk is classified as ASA&#xD;
      classification by American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status Classification System:&#xD;
      ASA I includes healthy patients without systemic disease, ASA II patients who have mild&#xD;
      systemic disease without functional organ limitations and ASA III patients with one or more&#xD;
      organ function insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-flow heated and humidified oxygenation (HFNO) delivered via soft, specially designed,&#xD;
      nasal cannula is successfully used for preoxygenation of patient with predicted difficulty in&#xD;
      ensuring airway patency. Unlike LFNO, HFNO is characterized by high flow of heated and&#xD;
      humidified oxygen-air mixture (20-70 L/min) up to 100% FiO2. HFNO prolongs adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation time in patients during retrograde endoscopic cholangiopancreatography. Also,&#xD;
      HFNO could be alternative for noninvasive ventilation of patients with acute hypoxemic&#xD;
      respiratory failure. According to previously mentioned statements, LFNO has significant&#xD;
      limitations. Main characteristic of HFNO as innovative technique is supporting patients'&#xD;
      spontaneous inspiration effort through high-flow of heated and humidified oxygen-air mixture.&#xD;
      Higher inspiratory fraction of oxygen, positive end-expiratory pressure, decreasing of&#xD;
      pharyngeal airway dead space and decreasing of airway resistance lead to improved maintaining&#xD;
      of oxygenation combined with better patients' tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM of this study is to compare effect of HFNO and LFNO during standardized procedure of&#xD;
      intravenous analgo-sedation on periprocedural oxygenation maintenance in normal weight&#xD;
      patients of ASA I, II and III status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesized that application of HFNO compared to LFNO, in patients with&#xD;
      preserved spontaneous breathing during procedural analgo-sedation, contributes to maintaining&#xD;
      adequate oxygenation, consequently adding to greater peri-procedural circulatory and&#xD;
      respiratory stability of these patients. Investigators expect that HFNO will ensure reduced&#xD;
      bradypnoea intervals (frequency of breathing, FoB 1/min), longer maintenance of adequate&#xD;
      oxygenation, shorter intervals of desaturation (SpO2 ≤ 92%), reducing hypercapnia (PaCO2 ≥ 6&#xD;
      kPa) and less airway - opening maneuvers performed by attending anesthesiologist (Aom). These&#xD;
      will prevent partial respiratory insufficiency detected by low SpO2 or low PaO2 ≤ 11kPa&#xD;
      accompanied by normal or low PaCO2 ≤ 6 kPa, and global respiratory insufficiency detected by&#xD;
      decreased SpO2 ≤ 92% and PaO2 ≤ 11kPa with increased PaCO2 ≥ 6 kPa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators plan to conduct prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial. Trial will be managed according to principles of Declaration of Helsinki for&#xD;
      scientific clinical research and will be planned and guided according to CONSORT guidelines&#xD;
      (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). The trial has been approved by hospital's Ethic&#xD;
      Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source of information are going to be 126 adult patients scheduled for colonoscopy under&#xD;
      analgo-sedation in the setting of daily outpatient gastroenterology ambulance. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed and examined ambulatory by anesthesiologist together with&#xD;
      evaluation of ASA status, difficulty of airway management and body mass index (BMI). After&#xD;
      initial examination inclusive and exclusive criteria will be distinguished. Eligible&#xD;
      participants who give their written consent of participation will be included in this study.&#xD;
      After that, participants will be assigned to equal ASA I, II or III risk class group. Each&#xD;
      group will be randomized to intervention (HFNO) and control (LFNO) subgroup by random numbers&#xD;
      generator. Randomization will be used until we reach adequate number of participants in every&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: intervention subgroups participants will be oxygenated via nasal cannula using&#xD;
      high flow (40 L/min) of humidified and heated oxygen in air mixture (FiO2 40%). HFNO will be&#xD;
      applied by oxygenator (AirVO™2, Fisher and Paykell, New Zealand, Technomedika Croatia d.o.o.)&#xD;
      during procedural analgo-sedation for colonoscopy with maintained spontaneous breathing. In&#xD;
      control subgroups, LFNO will be applied via nasal catheter (Bauerfeind d.o.o, Zagreb,&#xD;
      Croatia) using standard low flow oxygen - 5 L/min, FiO2 40%. In both groups concentration of&#xD;
      oxygen delivered depends on oxygen flow which is regulated by standard flow-regulator&#xD;
      (flowmeter). Oxygen is delivered through pipelines from central hospital gas supply or from&#xD;
      portable cylinder gas supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia procedure will be uniformed for all participants. Integrated noninvasive&#xD;
      monitoring of vital functions will be set: EKG - (heart rate/min), SpO2 (%), blood pressure&#xD;
      (mmHg), respiratory rate (number of breaths/min) (Compact 7; Medical Econet GmbH, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have established intravenous infusion of 250 ml NaCl 0.9% through&#xD;
      intravenous cannula regulated by continuous flow (Extension set/CONTROL-A-FLO Regulator 19&quot;&#xD;
      Male Luer Lock Adapter, Baxter/Agmar d.o.o. United States of America/Croatia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial cannula (REF30401, 20 G - 1,10 mm x 45 mm 49 ml, atraumatic needle tip, Medbar LTD,&#xD;
      Izmir, Turkey) will be placed in radial artery in a previously anesthetized area with local&#xD;
      anesthetic (EMLA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxygenation (HFNO or LFNO) will be administrated in continuity until patients' awakening. It&#xD;
      will be started 3 minutes before starting analgo-sedation (preoxygenation), continued during&#xD;
      analgo-sedation and procedure of colonoscopy (perioperative oxygenation) and up to five&#xD;
      minutes after colonoscopy and until patient is awake (postprocedural oxygenation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous analgo-sedation will be started through continuous infusions of propofol and&#xD;
      fentanyl. Induction of sedation will be guided by TCI (Target control Infusion) (B. Braun&#xD;
      Melsungen, Germany) with initial target propofol concentration of 6 micrograms/minute.&#xD;
      Expected time of induction with this concentration is 60-120 seconds. This target&#xD;
      concentration allows hemodynamic and respiratory stability. Required analgesia will be&#xD;
      simultaneously applied through slow continuous infusion in dose of 0.05 mcg/kg/min in order&#xD;
      to preserve spontaneous breathing. Slow infusion will be applied through perfusor (B.Braun,&#xD;
      Melsungen, Germany). Analgo-sedation will be discontinued immediately after end of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of nasopharyngeal airway passage during procedure is achieved by using oropharyngeal&#xD;
      airway, if necessary. Oropharyngeal airway (Airway; Vigon-Medicpro d.o.o.) will be inserted&#xD;
      after achieving moderate sedation, and only if base of tongue is closing airway by dropping&#xD;
      on posterior pharyngeal wall. Every manipulation of patients' airway by anesthesiologist will&#xD;
      be documented (insertion of airway, jaw thrust maneuver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: one milliliter of arterial blood will be collected as three consecutive samples&#xD;
      from arterial cannula before, during and after analgo-sedation. Sample of arterial blood will&#xD;
      be drawn from left radial or cubital artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: measurement of oxygenation will be done using two methods: indirect&#xD;
      (noninvasive) method using pulse oxymeter (Compact 7, Medical ECONET GmbH, Germany) and&#xD;
      direct (invasive) method from obtained arterial blood sample. Measurement of SpO2 and drawing&#xD;
      arterial blood sample will be done simultaneously. Direct measurements of SpO2 and PaO2 will&#xD;
      be measured in intervals of time. SpO2 will be measured on the left-hand index finger. Data&#xD;
      will be uniformly collected through indirect - noninvasive (SpO2, heart rate, blood pressure,&#xD;
      respiratory rate) and direct - invasive (arterial blood gas analysis - pH, PaO2, PaCO2, SaO2)&#xD;
      measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible biases and confounding variables could be caused by hypothermia of participant, by&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer cuff pressure on the same arm where blood samples are drawn and by prolonged&#xD;
      time of arterial blood analysis. These difficulties can be bypassed by: adjustment of room&#xD;
      temperature where analgo-sedation is performed, blood pressure measuring on opposite arm from&#xD;
      where samples of blood are taken and by arterial blood gas analysis without delay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic data analyses will be performed by statistician. Sample size is determined by statistic&#xD;
      computing web program: http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize used statistic test&#xD;
      Inference for Proportions: Comparing Two Independent Samples. Assessment of sample size is&#xD;
      computed for two independent samples with assumption of clinically significant difference in&#xD;
      patients' oxygenation: ≤11 and ≥14.4 kPa with delta 4.4. Statistical significance of&#xD;
      difference will be inferred with 5% α-error, 50% β-error and study power 0.80. Calculated&#xD;
      size of sample is: 21 participant pro subgroup (total of 126 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect no changes to methods after trial commencement. All potential unwanted&#xD;
      events which may happen during analgo-sedation and colonoscopy that could cause deviation&#xD;
      from this trial's protocol will be reason for exclusion of participant from this trial. If&#xD;
      circumstances change, anesthesiologist responsible for application of anesthesia will carry&#xD;
      out procedure in way which is in patients' best interest.&#xD;
