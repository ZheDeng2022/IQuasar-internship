  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether oral taking Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 from 28th week of gestation can reduce the GBS colonization rate&#xD;
      of vagina and rectum in 35-37 weeks pregnant women as well as during laboring who present&#xD;
      with GBS-positive at 28 weeks pregnancy. Through the results of our study, we try to&#xD;
      investigate the role of probiotics in preventing the unnecessary tests, admission and&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment in newborn with GBS-positive mother who deliver fewer than 4 hours after&#xD;
      laboring and the influence of improving cervical diagnostics quality for postpartum Pap&#xD;
      testing. Investigators hope the findings may have some effects on GBS sepsis and protocols as&#xD;
      well as cervical diagnosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) guideline in 2010 recommends minimum of 4&#xD;
      hours of intrapartum antibiotics prophylaxis on GBS colonized pregnant women for preventing&#xD;
      early-onset GBS infection of neonates. However, GBS-positive mothers who arrive at the labor&#xD;
      floor and deliver in fewer than 4 hours is frequent, especially in multiparous mothers. This&#xD;
      problem is not easily resolved by antibiotic treatment of the pathogen; thus, such&#xD;
      traditional approaches need to be reevaluated. The administration of specific Lactobacilli&#xD;
      strains by mouth or intravaginally has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing&#xD;
      urogenital infections. Previous results have showed that GR-1 and RC-14 can decrease GBS&#xD;
      colonization during the later stage of pregnancy, taking probiotics capsules after GBS test&#xD;
      in 35 to 37 weeks pregnant is still have to follow GBS guideline by CDC in 2010 of use&#xD;
      antibiotics before delivery. Studies showed the use of antibiotics during pregnancy&#xD;
      influenced the GI flora of neonates. Non-antibiotics prophylaxis for preventing newborns' GBS&#xD;
      infection and reduce GBS colonization in 35-37 week pregnant are meaningful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The raised estrogen and growth hormone during pregnancy may increase the activity of HPV&#xD;
      molecule and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Short-time HPV persistence has been&#xD;
      associated with higher risk for cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia and a higher risk of&#xD;
      High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion(HSIL). Clinical data showed GR-1 and RC-14 can&#xD;
      improve the cervical malignancy diagnostics quality for non-pregnant women. The influence of&#xD;
      oral probiotics on postpartum cervical diagnosis result is remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective double blind randomized clinical trial. Vaginal and rectal GBS&#xD;
      test are carried out at 28 weeks of gestation. Subjects with GBS-positive are invited to&#xD;
      participate in this study after informed consent. 200 pregnant women are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the two groups. The study group is treated with two oral capsules of probiotics once&#xD;
      daily (before sleeping) for 18 weeks, and the control group will take 2 capsules of placebos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal and rectal GBS culture is repeated in 35-37 week of gestation and intrapartum period.&#xD;
      All participators will treat according to GBS guideline by CDC in 2010. Cervical diagnosis&#xD;
      will be completed at the 6th week after delivery. Through the results of this study,&#xD;
      investigators try to investigate the role of probiotics in preventing the unnecessary tests,&#xD;
      admission and antibiotic treatment in newborn with GBS positive mother who deliver fewer than&#xD;
      4 hours after laboring and the influence of improving cervical diagnostics quality for&#xD;
      postpartum Pap testing. Investigators hope the findings may have some effects on GBS sepsis&#xD;
      and protocols and cervical diagnosis.&#xD;
