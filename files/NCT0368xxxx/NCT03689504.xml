  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot quasi-experimental study to evaluate the impact of adding a family garden&#xD;
      intervention to an existing wrap-around nutrition intervention for children with chronic&#xD;
      malnutrition and their family. The existing nutrition intervention is provided by community&#xD;
      health workers affiliated with Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance. A single community in&#xD;
      rural Guatemala will participate in the intervention, with the goal to recruit approximately&#xD;
      70 families in the combined nutrition/garden intervention. A nearby community, also&#xD;
      participating in the nutrition intervention, will serve as a nonrandom contemporaneous&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the impact of the garden intervention on maternal and child dietary diversity,&#xD;
           child growth and household food insecurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Use the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to&#xD;
           conduct a preliminary implementation analysis, to guide a future, well-controlled study.&#xD;
