      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase I study to assess the PK, PD and safety of 2 week&#xD;
      treatment with inhaled AZD7594 in adolescent patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;

      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase I study to assess the PK, PD and safety of 2 week&#xD;
      treatment with inhaled AZD7594 in adolescent patients with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to be conducted at 4-10 study sites in the United States. Eligible 12 to&#xD;
      17-year-old patients with asthma controlled on Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) step 2&#xD;
      medication (ie, low dose inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] or leukotriene receptor antagonist&#xD;
      [LTRA]), as evidenced by an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5) score ≤1.5, will be asked to&#xD;
      stop their ongoing asthma maintenance treatment. After a washout period (14 to 21 days), all&#xD;
      patients with confirmed reversibility will start study treatment, consisting of inhalations&#xD;
      of AZD7594 (360 µg, delivered dose, via dry powder inhaler [DPI]) once daily for 15 to 16&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to include 24 patients in order to have 18 evaluable patients, enrolled in&#xD;
      equal proportion in the age group of 12 to 14 years (inclusive), and the age group of 15 to&#xD;
      17 years (inclusive), with at least 7 patients in each subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the duration of participation in the study will be approximately 5 to 7&#xD;
      weeks (37 to 52 days)&#xD;

             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prolonged QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥440 msec based on&#xD;
