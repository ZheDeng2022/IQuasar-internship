      -  Study phase: 3&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indication: Breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objectives: To determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative&#xD;
           margin evaluation via frozen section on margin positive rate Secondary objectives: To&#xD;
           determine the effect of selective omission of intraoperative margin evaluation via&#xD;
           frozen section on reoperation rate, local recurrence rate, operation time, resection&#xD;
           volume, medical cost and patient quality-of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis: Omitting intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen section biopsy in&#xD;
           selected breast cancer patients does not increase margin positive rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size: 1292 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedures: breast conserving surgery +/- margin frozen section biopsy (+/- additional&#xD;
           resection)&#xD;

      1.1 Preoperative work-up Preoperative breast MRI is recommended to assess multifocal/centric&#xD;
      lesions and non-mass enhancement surrounding main mass. Preoperative needle localization or&#xD;
      skin marking is done by each hospital's method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Surgical procedure Initial wide excision is performed as usual. The recommended target&#xD;
      gross margin is one finger breadth. Orientation of the specimen will be done according to&#xD;
      each center's principle. Randomization for frozen section biopsy vs. omission is done&#xD;
      intraoperatively, after initial wide excision. For the frozen section biopsy omission group,&#xD;
      no further procedures will be done. For the frozen section biopsy group, frozen section&#xD;
      biopsy is performed on the specimen or cavity by the operating surgeon. The precise method is&#xD;
      decided by the surgeon's discretion, but the recommended method is as follows. A minimum 1 x&#xD;
      0.5cm size of breast parenchymal tissue will be excised at minimum four directions of the&#xD;
      specimen or cavity with a thickness of approximately 0.1cm (Figure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional resection according to frozen section biopsy result will be decided by the&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion. After review of final pathology report, decision of second operation&#xD;
      for re-excision will also be done by surgeon's discretion. A recommendation of considering&#xD;
      re-excision for only a positive margin (tumor on inked margin) is noted but not mandatory.&#xD;
      Data on additional resection or re-excision must all be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Pathology procedure Evaluation procedure of the frozen section biopsy specimen and wide&#xD;
      excision, additional excision specimen is done by each hospital's method. A pathology report&#xD;
      of both intraoperative frozen section biopsy result and final pathology result of the frozen&#xD;
      section biopsy tissue must be done. Gross specimen measurements (height x length x depth)&#xD;
      must be specified on pathology report. Also margin status must be recorded, positive margin&#xD;
      defined as &quot;no ink on tumor&quot; for DCIS and invasive cancer. Recording of margin distance from&#xD;
      superior, inferior, medial, lateral, margin is recommended. If all margin distance is not&#xD;
      feasible for recording, at least margin distance of closest margin must be recorded. The&#xD;
      final pathology result of the additional resection specimen after frozen section result must&#xD;
      describe whether residual cancer cells were present and the site of them. This is the same&#xD;
      for re-operation resection specimens. Thorough microscopic examination for residual cancer&#xD;
      cells in additional/re-operation resection specimens is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4 Postoperative care and adjuvant therapy Postoperative care will be performed as usual.&#xD;
      Routine adjuvant care will be given, including adjuvant radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.5 Follow-up The subject's participation of this clinical trial finishes at last fill in of&#xD;
      postoperative quality-of-life questionnaire or after last surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Annual clinical examination, mammography and breast sonography is recommended for 5-year&#xD;
      local recurrence assessment. Local recurrence is defined as pathologically confirmed&#xD;
      ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.6 Alternatives This is a randomization between two commonly accepted surgical techniques&#xD;
      and there is not any oncological increased risk with either. All routine precautions will be&#xD;
      taken to minimize overall surgical risk. Alternatives to the trial would be to have standard&#xD;
      breast conserving surgery with or without intraoperative frozen section biopsy according to&#xD;
      surgeon's discretion and patients will be informed of this. In addition, all patients will be&#xD;
      informed of their option for mastectomy as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Compensation Patients will not be paid for participating in this study. Medical expenses&#xD;
      occurred during this study will be paid by the patient. This includes costs associated with&#xD;
      re-operation for margin re-excision.&#xD;
