  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational clinical trial investigating the morphological and&#xD;
      volumetric changes in the brain following cranial Radiation Therapy in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with brain or skull base tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain injury is a known complication of cranial RT, but little is known about the factors&#xD;
      that predispose patients to such injury. The brain is a highly interconnected organ linked&#xD;
      through neuronal connections, cellular migration, and vascular supply and is endowed with&#xD;
      exquisitely radiosensitive stem cell niches responsible for neuro-regeneration. To date, the&#xD;
      effects of brain radiation have been quantified in few brain substructures. The majority of&#xD;
      publications on this topic have focused on regions receiving higher doses. Even low dose&#xD;
      radiation exposure, however has global implications on brain development and function, and&#xD;
      its effects are less well studied. It is increasingly recognized that radiation damage to one&#xD;
      brain region can potentially affect brain development more broadly. This has important&#xD;
      implications on RT planning and the potential for understanding its long-term effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this protocol, the investigators aim to measure serum inflammatory cytokine levels and&#xD;
      other molecular biomarkers at baseline and post-exposure in an exploratory manner to&#xD;
      investigate potential associations with the risk of developing volumetric changes in the&#xD;
      brain and radiation-induced toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will observe sixty (60) patients under the age of 21 with brain or base of skull&#xD;
      tumor. The study team will observe the effect of radiation therapy per the study protocol&#xD;
      versus standard of care.&#xD;

        The study sample size will be 60 patients. This sample size was selected to ensure an&#xD;
        adequate distribution of primary tumor diagnoses and dosimetric variation in major brain&#xD;
        substructures treated based on tumor location/brain regions treated. The estimated case&#xD;
        distribution based on historical data from 2007-2015 will be: Craniopharyngioma 20%,&#xD;
        Ependymoma 20%, Low Grade Glioma 20%, Medulloblastoma/PNET 15%, Sarcoma 10%, Other 15%.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient (parent) must give study-specific informed consent on an IRB-approved consent&#xD;
             prior to any research related procedures or study treatment. Written assent will be&#xD;
             obtained as per Institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients (Age equal to or less than 35 years old) that are planned to receive photon&#xD;
             or proton RT to the brain according to standard of care are eligible to participate.&#xD;

          -  Patients that are planned to receive fractionated RT at 1.2-2.0 Gy RBE dose per&#xD;
             fraction per standard of care are eligible to participate. If patients are planned to&#xD;
             receive an alternative dose/fractionation regimen, then they should be treated&#xD;
             according to standard of care and should not be enrolled.&#xD;
