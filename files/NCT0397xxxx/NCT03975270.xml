  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies related to immunotherapy of HNSCC have shown that PD1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      has better clinical benefits than conventional chemotherapy. This phase II clinical study is&#xD;
      a single arm, open, single-center study. The aim of this study is to observe and evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Sintilimab combined with paclitaxel-albumin-binding for injection in&#xD;
      patients with advanced recurrent and metastatic HNSCC who fail to receive first-line or more&#xD;
      treatment. Participation in this study for treatment may benefit patients with advanced&#xD;
      recurrence or metastasis of HNSCC.&#xD;
