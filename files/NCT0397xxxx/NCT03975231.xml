    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well dabrafenib, trametinib, and intensity modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT) work together in treating patients with BRAF mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;
      Dabrafenib and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses high energy beams to kill tumor cells and&#xD;
      shrink tumors. Giving dabrafenib, trametinib, and IMRT together may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and tolerability (maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) of concurrent&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and BRAF-MEK inhibitors dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall objective response rate, time to progression of local recurrence,&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess pharmacokinetics during concurrent IMRT and dabrafenib plus trametinib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess pharmacodynamics of dabrafenib plus trametinib induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess mechanism of resistance to dabrafenib plus trametinib and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of dabrafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once&#xD;
      daily (QD) for 7-28 days in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPTIONAL SURGERY: Patients with resectable disease may undergo surgery 3 days after stop&#xD;
      treatment of dabrafenib/trametinib, and move to Concurrent Radiation 14 days after surgery&#xD;
      provided that surgical wound has healed. All other patients continue to receive dabrafenib PO&#xD;
      BID and trametinib PO QD in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCURRENT RADIATION: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD at weeks 6-7.&#xD;
      Within 2.5 hours of morning doses of dabrafenib/trametinib administration, patients undergo&#xD;
      intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on Monday-Friday delivered over 6.5 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-RADIATION: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD for 4 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients with residual disease receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients stop dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib 8 weeks after achieving complete response. Patients with no residual disease stop&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib, with the option of restarting dabrafenib and trametinib at time of&#xD;
      disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females are required to use an effective method of contraception from the time of&#xD;
             negative serum pregnancy test, throughout the study duration, and for 4 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of study medication. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of Azoospermia) prior to&#xD;
                  the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is patient?s sole sexual&#xD;
                  partner. For this definition, ?documented? refers to the outcome of the&#xD;
                  investigator's/qualified physician designee?s medical examination of the subject&#xD;
                  or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via&#xD;
                  a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject?s medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  caps) plus spermicidal agent (foam, gel, film, cream, suppository) These allowed&#xD;
                  methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and&#xD;
                  in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for&#xD;
                  ensuring subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific contraception requirements for males: To prevent pregnancy in a female&#xD;
             partner or to prevent exposure of any partner to the investigational product from a&#xD;
             male subject?s semen, male subjects must use one of the following contraceptive&#xD;
             methods during the study and for a total of 16 weeks following the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug (based upon the lifecycle of sperm):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Abstinence, defined as sexual inactivity consistent with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                  lifestyle of the subject for 14 days prior to first dose of study drug, through&#xD;
                  the dosing period, and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
                  Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condom (during non-vaginal intercourse with any partner - male or female) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) plus spermicidal&#xD;
                  agent (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) (during sexual intercourse with a&#xD;
                  female).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
