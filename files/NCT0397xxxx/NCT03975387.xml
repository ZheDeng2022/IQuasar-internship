      Study ASTX295-01 is a first in human Phase 1/2 open-label study of the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of ASTX295 in subjects with wild-type TP53&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Phase 1 is a dose escalation and dose expansion study design followed&#xD;
      by a Phase 2 study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTX295 is a synthetic small molecule that acts as an antagonist of Murine Double Minute 2&#xD;
      (MDM2; human homolog also known as HDM2). Study ASTX295-01 is a Phase 1/2 first in human&#xD;
      (FIH) study with ASTX295 in subjects who are refractory or have relapsed after treatment with&#xD;
      standard of care therapies, or for whom standard life-prolonging measures or approved&#xD;
      therapies are not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is composed of Phase 1a and 1b, a dose escalation stage followed by a dose expansion&#xD;
      stage, respectively. Phase 1 is intended to identify the recommended dose for expansion (RDE)&#xD;
      and ultimately the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
