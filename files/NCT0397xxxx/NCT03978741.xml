    <description>Responder rate at Day 21, where responder is defined as a subject who has at least 50% reduction in mean 12-hour pad weight test through assessment period of treatment phase (the last 7 days of 14-day device usage period), when compared to the mean pad weight test during the 7-day baseline phase</description>

    <measure>Percent change in Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) score</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>7 questions about how urinary incontinence has affected a subjects life. Questions cover physical activity, travel, social relationships and emotional health. The questionnaire asks whether the subjects life has been greatly affected, moderately, slightly or not affected at all.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent change in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>It gives a patient reported assessment of change after intervention. The higher the score, the greater the severity (1 being &quot;very much improved&quot;; 7 &quot;very much worse&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent change in Incontinence-Quality of Life (I-QOL) Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The I -QOL consists of 22 items, all of which use a five - point ordinal response scale in which 1 = extremely, 2 = quite a bit, 3 = moderately, 4 = a little, and 5 = not at all. The 22 items can be further grouped into 3 sub-scales: Avoidance and Limiting Behaviour (8 ite ms), Psychosocial Impacts (9 items), and Social Embarrassment (5 items). The total I -QOL and 3 sub scale scores are calculated by summing the unweighted item score and transforming them to a 100 point scale where 0 = mo st severe, and 100 = no problem .</description>
