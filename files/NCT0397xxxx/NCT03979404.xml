  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening eating disorder characterised by an intense fear&#xD;
      of weight gain and disturbed body image, which motivates severe dietary restriction or other&#xD;
      weight loss behaviours (e.g. purging). Treatment efficacy in adults with AN remains low: only&#xD;
      a small percentage of individuals fully recover, and dropout rates are high. For adolescents&#xD;
      with a relatively short term illness duration (under 3 years), family-based therapy has been&#xD;
      associated with more favourable outcomes. However, for those adolescents with a longer&#xD;
      illness duration (over 3 years), there are no specific treatments associated with positive&#xD;
      long-term outcomes and these individuals are at risk of developing a severe and enduring form&#xD;
      of the illness (SE-AN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part, treatment can be problematic due to ambivalence, which is reflected in poor take-up&#xD;
      of certain treatments (e.g. pharmacological treatments that lead to weight gain) and high&#xD;
      drop-out rates. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy&#xD;
      for treatment of AN in adults and improving treatment adherence. However, this has yet to be&#xD;
      investigated in adolescents with AN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use a novel type of rTMS, called intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS).&#xD;
      TBS takes as little as a few minutes duration compared to the classical rTMS protocol which&#xD;
      takes approximately 37.5 minutes. In addition, TBS has been found to produce longer&#xD;
      after-effects of the induced plastic changes and has a lower stimulation intensity, which may&#xD;
      therefore be more practical and potentially safer to administer in people with AN. Thus, the&#xD;
      aim of this feasibility case series is to obtain preliminary data on the longer-term (i.e. up&#xD;
      to 6 months) effects of 20 sessions of iTBS on reducing core symptoms of AN.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Throughout the study, lasting 7 months: baseline (before treatment), weekly throughout 4-weeks of treatment and 6 months after treatment (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Core symptoms of AN are computed by summing scores on three 10cm visual analogue scales (maximum score of 30) that assess levels of &quot;urge to restrict&quot;, &quot;feeling full&quot;, and &quot;feeling fat&quot;. Participants are requested to indicate on this line a degree or level of experiencing the specific emotion or behavioural urge from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>7 months: baseline (before treatment), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Low mood is measured on a 10cm visual analogue scale (maximum score 10). Participants are requested to indicate on this line a degree or level of experiencing &quot;low mood&quot; from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. Therefore a higher score reflects higher feelings of low mood.</description>

    <description>Anxiety is measured on a 10cm visual analogue scale (maximum score 10). Participants are requested to indicate on this line a degree or level of experiencing &quot;anxiety&quot; from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. Therefore a higher score reflects higher feelings of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>7 months: baseline (before treatment), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>Urge to exercise is measured on a 10cm visual analogue scale (maximum score 10). Participants are requested to indicate on this line a degree or level of experiencing &quot;urge to exercise&quot; from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. Therefore a higher score reflects a higher urge to exercise.</description>

    <description>Urge to be sick/purge is measured on a 10cm visual analogue scale (maximum score 10). Participants are requested to indicate on this line a degree or level of experiencing &quot;urge to be sick/purge&quot; from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. Therefore a higher score reflects a higher urge to be sick/purge.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in global scores on the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months: baseline (before treatment), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS-21 is a self-report questionnaire of 21 items, 7 items per sub-scale: depression, anxiety and stress. Participants are asked to score every item on a scale from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much) based on how much each statement applies to them over the past week. Global score is computed by adding up the scores on the items per sub-scale and multiplying them by a factor 2, therefore higher scores reflecting more severe depressive symptoms. Global scores for the DASS-21 range between 0 and 120.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in global scores on the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) from baseline to post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months: baseline (before treatment), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>The EDE-Q is a 28-item questionnaire that provides a measure of the range and severity of eating disorder features experienced over the past 28 days. The EDE-Q is scored using a 7-point, forced-choice rating scale (0-6) with higher scores reflecting a higher level of symptomatology. The EDE-Q yields a global score and four sub-scale scores: restraint, shape concern, weight concern, eating concern. The global score is calculated as the sum of the four sub-scale scores divided by the number of sub-scales (i.e. four). Global scores for the EDE-Q range between 0 and 6.</description>

    <time_frame>7 months: baseline (before treatment), post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up (long-term follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>BMI is a simple calculation of a person's height (m2; metres squared) and weight (kilograms). It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.</description>
