      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of relatively long-term use of a&#xD;
      wearable device that provides personalized and intelligent cues (e.g. only when FOG is&#xD;
      detected) on FOG. It is hypothesized that the use of this device will reduce FOG in the home&#xD;
      and in the community more than in a group of freezers who only receive basic gait information&#xD;
      unrelated to FOG-episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single- blinded bi-centric randomized controlled trial, consisting of 4 weeks&#xD;
      of intervention, pre- and post- assessments and free-living monitoring. For this purpose, the&#xD;
      DeFOG system was developed through a collaboration between our research group, the Sourasky&#xD;
      Medical Center Tel Aviv and mHealth Technologies Bologna, Italy. The system consists of a&#xD;
      smartphone, 2 foot-mounted inertial measurement units (IMU's) and earphones which enable&#xD;
      transmitting feedback and auditory cues for gait, when FOG is about to occur. The patients&#xD;
      will be randomized into an intervention group (DeFOG group) or a control group (N=31 per&#xD;
      group). All patients will wear the DeFOG system (mHealth Technologies, mHT) and both groups&#xD;
      will receive feedback about the daily number of steps produced. But, only the DeFOG group&#xD;
      will receive cueing following detection of FOG. The cueing consists of a metronome, and if&#xD;
      FOG persists, also a verbal instruction will be delivered. A therapist will personalize the&#xD;
      settings of the DeFOG system and will support the patients in using the system (for instance&#xD;
      in coping with false positives). Pre- and post- assessments will be performed by a blinded&#xD;
      researcher, both before and after taking medication (in OFF and ON medication state,&#xD;
      respectively), consisting of FOG-provoking tasks and questionnaires. During the&#xD;
      post-assessment, the FOG provoking protocol will be repeated in both groups with and without&#xD;
      the cueing option of the DeFOG system in the home situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If therapists involved in the trial note an increase of falls throughout the trial, then it&#xD;
      can be decided to involve an interim analysis of the data monitoring committee.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>This is an interventional study with a parallel design, consisting of pre- and post-assessments, 2x (pre- and post) 7 days of free-living gait monitoring and an intervention/control period of 4 weeks. The pre-assessment and first week of free-living gait monitoring will take place prior to randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Prior to randomization, all participants will be informed that the goal of the study is to compare the effects of two types of feedback about physical activity on freezing of gait. By withholding information about the cueing intervention, we hope that the participants in the control group will not realize that they are in the control group, in order to avoid a lack of motivation in this group. The intervention group will probably become unmasked after group allocation, as the cueing therapy was not mentioned in the informed consent.&#xD;
During the post-assessment, the FOG provoking protocol will be performed with and without cueing. This induces the risk of the investigator/outcome assessor becoming unmasked, as patients in the control group may mention that this cueing option is something they haven't experienced during the intervention period. In order to prevent this, the therapist will ask patients in the intervention group to also act surprised to the cueing modality.</masking_description>

    <description>Change in the duration to walk 4 meters (in seconds), both OFF- and ON-medication. The full 4 meter walk test (4MW) back and forth with turn consists of 5 meters (0.5 meter acceleration, 4 meter steady state walking, 0.5 meter deceleration, a turn on the spot, and then again 0.5 meter acceleration, 4 meter steady state walking and 0.5 meter deceleration). The duration to walk 4 meters before and after the turn will be determined based on video annotations and averaged. The 4MW is administered as part of the FOG-provoking protocol, during the pre- and post-intervention assessments (T1 and T2).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in motor function: score on the MDS-UPDRS part III</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Score on the Motor Examination (part III) of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), assessed both OFF and ON-medication during the pre- and post-intervention assessments (T1 and T2). MDS-UPDRS is a tool to measure the severity and progression of Parkinson disease (PD). Part III is a motor examination consisting of 14 items, each rated on a 5-point Likert type scale (ranging from 0 to 4), with higher scores indicating more severe impairment. The maximum UPDRS part III score is 132, with higher score representing worse motor disability from PD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in balance: score on the MiniBESTest</measure>
    <time_frame>immediate post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Change in score on the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (MiniBESTest), as assessed during the pre- and post-intervention assessment while ON-medication. The MiniBESTest consists of 14 items designed to measure balance performance during mobility tasks related to daily activities. Each item receives a score of 0 to 2, where a score of 0 represents an inability to complete the item and a score of 2 represents the ability to complete the task independently. The range of scores is 0-28, with a higher score representing worse balance impairments.</description>
