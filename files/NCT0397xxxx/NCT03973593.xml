  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kenya has made tremendous strides in improving contraceptive prevalence rate for the last 20&#xD;
      years, however the rate of contraceptive discontinuation as remained almost constant at 1 out&#xD;
      of 3 women using a family planning method. Contraceptive discontinuation increases unmet need&#xD;
      of family planning. Hence understanding the underlying reasons for discontinuation helps in&#xD;
      designing programs that improve method satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of the study is to understand the factors leading to contraceptive&#xD;
      discontinuation and switching among women of reproductive age (15 - 49 years) in Migori and&#xD;
      Kitui counties, Kenya. The secondary goal is to assess whether a client-centered intervention&#xD;
      focusing on contraceptive counseling can reduce modern contraceptive discontinuation and&#xD;
      increase client satisfaction with use of modern contraceptive methods among women of&#xD;
      reproductive age in the two counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the quality of family planning services offered in health facilities in Migori&#xD;
           and Kitui counties, Kenya&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore describe barriers and facilitators of modern contraceptive discontinuation&#xD;
           and method switch among women of reproductive age in Migori and Kitui counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the client-centered intervention focusing on contraceptive counseling in&#xD;
           reducing contraceptive discontinuation among women of reproductive age in Migori and&#xD;
           Kitui counties, Kenya&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The 24 month prospective cohort study will seek to understand reasons for contraceptive&#xD;
      discontinuation among women of reproductive age including adolescents in Kitui and Migori&#xD;
      Counties, Kenya. The study will be implemented to assess determinants of contraceptive&#xD;
      discontinuation after the barrier of lack of adequate counseling is removed. The barrier will&#xD;
      be addressed by implementing an intervention focusing on a client-centered counseling&#xD;
      approach in reducing contraceptive discontinuation among women accepting a contraceptive&#xD;
      method. Ten health facilities with a high family planning caseload will be enrolled into the&#xD;
      study. Counseling sessions will be conducted at the facilities using three channels:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Counseling by Community Health Volunteers (CHVs) The proposed intervention will identify&#xD;
           CHVs and build their capacity on contraception with an aim of having them providing FP&#xD;
           counseling and services in high volume facilities - thus providing additional human&#xD;
           resources. Their current training on family planning focuses on general information for&#xD;
           each contraceptive method but lacks adequate content on counseling for family planning.&#xD;
           The CHV training package will be enhanced with additional content on contraceptive&#xD;
           methods that will equip them with the necessary skills on counseling. They will also be&#xD;
           trained on adolescent focused counseling as well. Once trained, the CHVs will offer&#xD;
           counseling for family planning at facility level. Following the counseling, CHVs will&#xD;
           provide a method including pills and injectables to women and girls who have come for a&#xD;
           revisit, unless they request for contact with the health care worker. This is in line&#xD;
           with the Kenya's Ministry of Health task sharing policy and family planning guidelines&#xD;
           that allows CHVs to conduct community distribution of pills, condoms and injectables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individualized Counseling by Health Care Workers Once counseling has been done by the&#xD;
           CHVs, the heath care workers will attend to the women in need for additional counseling&#xD;
           and a method that the CHVs were unable to provide, for instance LARCs. The current&#xD;
           counseling method used by the health care worker is the Balanced Counseling Strategy,&#xD;
           which is cumbersome as it has a lot of information that overwhelms the providers and&#xD;
           clients. The study proposes to adopt the counseling for continuation materials that will&#xD;
           used to develop a simplified job aid for use by heath care workers to provide&#xD;
           individualized counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Partner Counseling by Health Care Workers (HCWs) CHVs will mobilize potential couples to&#xD;
           jointly attend contraceptive counseling sessions by the health care workers. The health&#xD;
           care workers will be trained on how to conduct couple counseling. Existing couples&#xD;
           counseling materials will be adapted based on the information gathered from the&#xD;
           formative assessment. The facility will identify a package of additional&#xD;
           non-contraceptive related services for the men who will have accompanied their spouses&#xD;
           for family planning services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll 1016 women of reproductive age in the following sub groups;&#xD;
      Implant, IUD, Injectables and Pill users. Follow up interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months will be&#xD;
      done to establish contraceptive use, discontinuation and method switching among women.&#xD;
