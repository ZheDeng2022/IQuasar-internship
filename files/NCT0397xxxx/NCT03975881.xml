    <textblock>
      Context: Suicide is the 2nd cause of death during adolescence Compliance with post SA care is&#xD;
      low and variable with effective compliance ranging from 17.5% to 47% . Therefore, prevention&#xD;
      programs should also focus on high-risk individuals with a previous history of SA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents and young adults are considered to be digital natives, they are therefore a&#xD;
      relevant population for the testing of Smartphone Application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project: The Investigators propose an innovative and new approach to prevent SA and Suicide&#xD;
      for patients, based on a mobile healthcare application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The program is an add-on to the usual care process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study: In a multicentric randomized pilot study with 15 to 35 years-old patients having&#xD;
      previous SA, the primary goal for pilot study is to observe the filling rate of the&#xD;
      application (feasibility).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 2nd cause of death during adolescence in Europe (1.200/year, 7.9 % of deaths&#xD;
      in this age group) and the prevalence of Lifetime Suicide Attempts (SA) in this population is&#xD;
      4.2%. Within a year of the SA, the repetition rate in adolescent populations ranges from 15%&#xD;
      to 28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-SA management is crucial and treatment compliance is a major concern in adolescent&#xD;
      populations. A French consensus psychiatric workgroup recommends that when patient is&#xD;
      discharged from emergency room (ER) or hospitalization, it is important to organize health&#xD;
      care. Unfortunately, these recommendations are imprecise and, moreover, from 40 to 77% of&#xD;
      adolescents with previous SAs do not follow the recommendations of the post crisis program.&#xD;
      In real clinical practice, patients barely follow the recommended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the SA repetition rate and increasing compliance with the recommended post-crisis&#xD;
      program are two synergic issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incredible and recent adoption of smartphone health applications (apps), that collect&#xD;
      data (weight, exercises…) and allow the consumer to see graphs and diagrams, illustrates the&#xD;
      sociological and psychological power of digital self-care and self-management. This&#xD;
      phenomenon is particularly important for adolescents and young adults, who are considered to&#xD;
      be digital natives. Medical experience is mainly based on the idea that is could be very&#xD;
      useful to ask the patient to fill in scales or questionnaires on his/her smartphone instead&#xD;
      of on a computer or a paper sheet. This is called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) as it&#xD;
      is a naturalistic method to access clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few positive experiments in self-management (or self-care) using smartphone&#xD;
      applications in psychiatry. In the field of suicide and mood disorders they have very&#xD;
      interesting and promising results (high filling rates and better compliance to heath care&#xD;
      programs). However, despite a few self-care aspects most of these apps are based on&#xD;
      psycho-education programs and suffer in reality from lack of feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second field of apps use is Ecological Momentary intervention (EMI). Main idea is to use EMA&#xD;
      data in algorithm in order to produce personalized comments and advises for patients. With&#xD;
      the development of machine learning, it is obvious that EMI will have great implication in&#xD;
      the future. There are few experiences with EMI but recent reviews all suggest that it is&#xD;
      results are promising in mood disorders and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are proposing an EMA + EMI new approach to prevent patient SA and Suicide&#xD;
      based on a mobile healthcare application. This application is not connected. This is&#xD;
      noticeably different then connected approach, using connected technology (phone, visual-phone&#xD;
      and text messages) such as the Suicide Intervention Assisted by Message (SIAM) program, with&#xD;
      text messages sent (sometimes automatically) by healthcare professionals to high-risk suicide&#xD;
      subjects has shown positive preliminary results, with a reduced repetition rate. The App will&#xD;
      be customised for each user when redeemed with a personal code provided by the practitioner.&#xD;
      The App will collect data from the patient regarding anxiety, mood and sleep disorders twice&#xD;
      a day (with a decreased frequence along the period of use), essentially based on analogic&#xD;
      visual scales and drop-down lists. An algorithm-based feedback will pro-actively inform the&#xD;
      patient with comments and advice based on WHO recommendations and/or associated with&#xD;
      self-coping or Mindfulness practices. The aim is to position the smartphone application like&#xD;
      a health care partner, it's name will be Medical Companion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the efficiency of the complete app the investigators will first lead a&#xD;
      multicentre open pilot study with 6 months of follow-up in an adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      population with a history of suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application is an association of a &quot;conventional&quot; EMA program and an innovative&#xD;
      algorithm-based response to the patient. Built on the notion of self-care, this app is not&#xD;
      connected and the patient's responses are processed in the algorithm: (i) to provide&#xD;
      feed-back regarding their mental state (contextualized, i.e. &quot;you seem to be less anxious&#xD;
      then yesterday&quot;) and, (ii) to advice them about what to do (for example &quot;call a friend&quot;&#xD;
      &quot;breath deeply 5 times in a row&quot;…). Each mental status will be analysed by the Bayesian&#xD;
      application algorithm. Regular evaluations are also provided on screen with easy to see&#xD;
      graphs that might be viewed by the patient. These graphs could (and should) be seen by the&#xD;
      psychiatrist, or psychologist involved in the Care as Usual program that all participants&#xD;
      will still have. In sum, medical practitioners involved in the patient's usual care will have&#xD;
      access to synthetic presentation of patient's responses and the investigators plan to ask&#xD;
      participants about their experience.&#xD;
