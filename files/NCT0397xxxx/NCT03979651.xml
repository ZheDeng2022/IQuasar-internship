  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) melanoma are currently treated with first&#xD;
      line immune checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab). Thus far, no targeted therapy&#xD;
      has been approved in NRAS mutated melanoma as a second line treatment, because although the&#xD;
      use of a MEK inhibitor (binimetinib) alone was superior to the gold standard chemotherapy&#xD;
      (dacarbazine) in a phase 3 trial, the progression free survival gain was very modest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro and in vivo work from the study team's lab (McMAHON, Huntsman Cancer Institute&#xD;
      (HCI), Salt Lake City), as well as, Ravi Amaravardi and Jean Mulchey-Levy suggests that the&#xD;
      activation of autophagy is a mechanism of resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in RAS and&#xD;
      RAF mutated cancers, such as melanoma, pediatric brain tumors and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
      The study team has shown in vivo, in four different NRAS mutated melanoma Patient Derived&#xD;
      Xenograft (PDX) models that the combination of the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the autophagy&#xD;
      inhibitor chloroquine results in a more dramatic tumor regression and inhibition than&#xD;
      trametinib or chloroquine used as single agents (Nat Med. 2019 Apr;25(4):620-627. doi:&#xD;
      10.1038/s41591-019-0367-9. Epub 2019 Mar 4). In two of the PDX models, the combination&#xD;
      resulted in almost complete tumor regression (quasi disappearance) that was not observed in&#xD;
      the single agent treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trametinib (MEKINISTR) is an orally available MEK inhibitor that is currently approved in&#xD;
      combination with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (TAFINLARR) to treat BRAF mutated metastatic&#xD;
      melanoma at the standard dosing of 2 milligrams (mg) once a day. Hydroxychloroquine&#xD;
      (PLAQUENILR) is an orally available autophagy inhibitor that has been used for many years to&#xD;
      treat autoimmune diseases like lupus, sarcoidosis and rheumatoid arthritis at the standard&#xD;
      dosing of 400-600mg/day. For this study, the investigating team would like to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and trametinib in a phase I&#xD;
      trial in patients with NRAS mutated metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
