  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if tucatinib with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) works&#xD;
      better than T-DM1 alone to help patients who have a specific type of breast cancer called&#xD;
      HER2 positive breast carcinoma. The breast cancer in this study is either metastatic (spread&#xD;
      into other parts of the body) or cannot be removed completely with surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will be randomly assigned to get either tucatinib or placebo (a pill&#xD;
      with no medicine). This is a blinded study, so neither patients nor their doctors will know&#xD;
      whether a patient gets tucatinib or placebo. All patients in the study will get T-DM1, a drug&#xD;
      that is often used to treat this cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days. Patients will swallow tucatinib pills or placebo pills&#xD;
      two times every day. Patients will get T-DM1 injections from the study site staff on the&#xD;
      first day of every cycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tucatinib in combination with&#xD;
      T-DM1 in subjects with unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic HER2+ breast cancer who&#xD;
      have had prior treatment with a taxane and trastuzumab in any setting. Prior pertuzumab&#xD;
      treatment is permitted, but not required. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to&#xD;
      receive 21-day cycles of either tucatinib or placebo in combination with T-DM1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study treatment, subjects will be assessed for progression every 6 weeks for the&#xD;
      first 24 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter, irrespective of dose holds or interruptions.&#xD;
      Study treatment will continue until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, or study closure. After completion of study treatment and after occurrence of&#xD;
      disease progression, subjects in both arms of the study will continue to be followed for&#xD;
      survival until study closure or withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
