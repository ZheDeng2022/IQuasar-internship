      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using telepractice to provide&#xD;

      The process objectives target focus on1) recruitment, 2) retention, 3) engagement with tools,&#xD;
      4) time demand on dyads, and 5) eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resource assessment objectives include: 1) equipment and internet accessibility 2)&#xD;
      communication methods, and 3) timelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management assessment objectives address: 1) ethical standards, 2) researcher&#xD;
      qualifications and 3) data storage and collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, when looking at the scientific assessment, the objectives relate to: 1) Is use of a&#xD;
      concurrent multiple baseline single-subject design feasible with this population? 2)capturing&#xD;
      dyad needs, 3) burden levels, and 4) safety protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the above listed dimensions of feasibility using a embedded mixed&#xD;
      methods approach that incorporates both a single-subject design and qualitative data gathered&#xD;
      throughout the research process and post intervention individual interviews.&#xD;

    <measure>Parent Sense of Competency (PSOC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks post intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures parent's feelings of self-esteem and satisfaction of the ability in a parenting role. The PSOC is a 17 item scale, with 2 subscales. Each item is rated on a 6 point Likert scale anchored by 1 = &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; and 6 = &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. A higher score indicates a higher parenting sense of competency.</description>

    <intervention_name>Modified Interaction Guidance</intervention_name>
    <description>The main steps in the procedure are to have the family identify the primary concern they are facing, highlight the strengths that the family already has in place and expand on those strengths, convey/impart caregiving and societal norms, and offer other perspectives (McDonough, 2004). The goal of this therapy is to engage the family to take an active role in the construction of their overall treatment. The individualized treatment approach focuses and builds on existing strengths.</description>
