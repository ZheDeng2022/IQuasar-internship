    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, open-label, dose-finding phase Ib clinical study with extension&#xD;
      phase, which is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of GB226 combined with&#xD;
      fruquintinib in treatment of relapsed or metastatic NSCLC patients with EGFR-sensitive&#xD;
      mutations who have failed to respond to EGFR-TKI treatment,evaluating the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics of GB226 and fruquintinib, and the immunogenicity of GB226, and preliminarily&#xD;
      evaluating the antitumor activity of GB226 and fruquintinib.&#xD;

      In this study, it is planned to enroll at least 42 NSCLC patients who meet relevant criteria.&#xD;
      This study includes dose escalation phase and extension phase of the combined therapy: three&#xD;
      combined dose groups are planned in the dose escalation phase; the dose extension phase is&#xD;
