  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary mitral insufficiency is a common complication of heart failure, aggravating&#xD;
      symptoms and prognosis, and may be responsible for worsening dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and&#xD;
      excess mortality. It is essentially a ventricular rather than a valvular disease, whose&#xD;
      origin may be ischemic or not. It is induced by a geometrical and contractile modification of&#xD;
      the left ventricle which causes an imbalance between the tensile and the closing forces of&#xD;
      the mitral valve thus causing a defect of coaptation and the increase of the surface between&#xD;
      the mitral leaves and the ring in systole (tenting). Dynamic mitral insufficiency is defined&#xD;
      by changes in the degree of severity of regurgitation as a function of hemodynamic&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During exercise, the course of mitral insufficiency is variable and is not predicted by the&#xD;
      degree of regurgitation at rest. The worsening of the leak is also well correlated with the&#xD;
      onset of dyspnea on exertion in patients with left Ventricular Ejection Fraction heart&#xD;
      failure (LVEF reduced). Nevertheless, there is little data available in the literature on the&#xD;
      factors predisposing to the development of stress-related mitral insufficiency, as well as&#xD;
      its clinical and echocardiographic impact in the cardiac insufficiency patient, particularly&#xD;
      in the case of preserved LVEF (6.7%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of echocardiographic data at rest to predict and anticipate the behavior&#xD;
      of mitral insufficiency in the effort (aggravation or stability / disappearance), would allow&#xD;
      a simplified evaluation and a better management in this population of patients for which the&#xD;
      evaluation in echography of effort can be technically complex and limited (difficulty of&#xD;
      quantification of the mitral leak, time of effort sometimes too short ...).&#xD;
