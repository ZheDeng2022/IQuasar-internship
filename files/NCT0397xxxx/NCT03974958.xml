  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an aortic dilatation superior or equal to 30 mm with an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence at 8% in men over 65 year-old. It evolves with no clinical signal until&#xD;
      the rupture of the aortic wall with dramatic outcomes. The pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      include extracellular matrix remodeling, smooth muscle cells apoptosis, aggregation and&#xD;
      activation of inflammatory cells in the aortic wall and heredity. The initiating and&#xD;
      regulatory processes are complex and not fully elucidated. They encompass local aortic&#xD;
      environment (flux, thrombus, wall shear stress, pressure and adipose tissue) and&#xD;
      patient-dependent genetic (de)regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project follows the previous prospective ACTA study that aimed at identifying clinical&#xD;
      criteria, circulating biomarkers or imaging data for thoracic aneurysm prognosis in an AAA&#xD;
      population. The preliminary results showed that 1) a low wall shear stress index and the&#xD;
      luminal volume are more predictive values for a rapid AAA growth and an intraluminal thrombus&#xD;
      than the maximal aortic diameter 2) three thoracic aortic phenotypes (normal, dilated,&#xD;
      aneurysmal) stratify the disease extent 3) the age and the female gender are associated to an&#xD;
      extended disease. During this study we created a biobank in which blood samples of AAA&#xD;
      patients were collected at the time of their inclusion (T1). This new ACTA-miRNA study aims&#xD;
      at correlating circulating biomarkers to the anatomical and biomechanical markers previously&#xD;
      highlighted for a rapid aneurysmal growth. Circulating miRNA are involved in parietal&#xD;
      remodeling and constitute promising targets for estimating patients-specific aortic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the literature, we thus selected 18 miRNA described to be involved in AAA biology:&#xD;
      inflammation, remodeling, cellular homeostasis and wall shear stress. As control, we select&#xD;
      non-AAA patients presenting with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD) matched in&#xD;
      age, BMI, tobacco consumption, diabetes, cholesterol level and blood pressure with AAA&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the ACTA study. During their follow-up, these ACTA patients are&#xD;
      solicited to continue the program research and can participate to the ACTA-miRNA study. A&#xD;
      third time analysis is performed for them (T3): we collect imaging data of total aorta&#xD;
      required by their standard follow-up, as well as a blood sample. Differential analysis of the&#xD;
      miRNA panel will be conducted between 1) AAA patients (T1) vs PAOD patients 2) fast-growing&#xD;
      AAA vs slow-growing AAA 3) AAA &amp; AAT patient group vs AAA alone and/or AAA &amp; dilatation of&#xD;
      thoracic aorta. 110 patients from the ACTA study are eligible to be included into the ACTA&#xD;
      mi-RNA study. Inclusion of PAOD controls will be conducted until the number of 165 cases is&#xD;
      reached (1:1.5 ratio).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary objective is to validate a circulating-miRNA signature specific for abdominal&#xD;
      aortic aneurysm.&#xD;
