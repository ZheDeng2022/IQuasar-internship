  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, HL-085 is a MEK inhibitor with the potential indication for cancers. It is an&#xD;
      oral medication to be given daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study is to find answers to the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the highest tolerable dose of HL-085 that can be given to subjects when given&#xD;
           orally (by mouth) on a twice daily basis?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What are the side effects of HL-085?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How much HL-085 is in the blood at specific times after dosing and how does the body get&#xD;
           rid of the HL-085?&#xD;

    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dose limitation toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following AE considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the IP, HL-085, by the Investigator and/or the Sponsor that occurs during Cycle 1 as described in below:&#xD;
Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes; or&#xD;
Non-hematologic toxicities Grade 3 or higher.&#xD;
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding, or other hematologic toxicity at Grade 4 or above.&#xD;
Neutropenic fever&#xD;
liver parameter abnormalities&#xD;
Any toxicity requiring permanent discontinuation of the IP</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>MTD will be determined when DLT occurs in great or equal to 33.3% of the same cohort subjects during During Cycle 1 (the first 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which DLT occurs in less than 33.3% of subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cMAX</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>cMAX is the maximum plasma concentration of HL-085 or metabolite(s).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of the study, estimated to be approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) v1.1.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>pERK expression</measure>

    <description>Subjects in the dose escalation cohorts will receive ascending doses of HL-085 until the MTD is determined. The first three subjects will receive twice-daily doses (BID) of HL-085 6 mg. Additional cohorts may receive doses of HL-085 9, 12 or 18 mg BID respectively and sequentially. If DLTs are observed in &lt;33.3% of subjects at the 18 mg dose.</description>

    <description>HL-085 is a MEK inhibitor with potential indication for cancers. it will be given twice daily continuously in the study until disease progression; or the risks outweigh the benefits, if the subject continues study treatment; or subjects with poor compliance; or subjects need to receive or have already started alternative anti-tumor drugs; or Subjects who need to receive or have already started alternative any other concomitant medication and/or treatment, which would significantly impact their safety; or interruption of IP administration for more than 14 days due to IP-related AEs.</description>
