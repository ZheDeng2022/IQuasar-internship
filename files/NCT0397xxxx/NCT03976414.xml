  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to (1) use participatory ergonomics to adapt and in-person&#xD;
      3-session intervention: Mind Over Matter: Healthy Bowels, Healthy Bladder (MOM) to an&#xD;
      electronic program (eMOM), and to (2) compare and characterize eMOM's reach when marketed via&#xD;
      community agencies versus Facebook advertising and to collect qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      data about effectiveness and uptake of key behaviors using electronic surveys and phone&#xD;
      interviews. The study will also collect information from community agencies that might&#xD;
      implement eMOM about its perceived value and their willingness and capacity to implement such&#xD;
      a program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of patients hospitalized with serious illness rated urinary and bowel&#xD;
      incontinence as a state worse than death in a 2016 JAMA (The Journal of the American Medical&#xD;
      Association) internal medicine study - worse than relying on a breathing machine, being&#xD;
      unable to get out of bed, or being confused all the time. Unfortunately, over 60% of&#xD;
      community-dwelling women over age 65 suffer from urinary and/or bowel incontinence,&#xD;
      accounting for a combined annual cost in excess of $30 billion. In addition to their impact&#xD;
      on quality of life, social isolation, and depression, urinary and bowel incontinence increase&#xD;
      caregiver burnout, risk for falls, hospitalization, and nursing home placement. However,&#xD;
      despite the existence of effective treatments, over half of women with urinary incontinence&#xD;
      and two-thirds of women with bowel incontinence do not seek medical care. Interventions to&#xD;
      promote continence in healthcare settings thus reach fewer than half of those in need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At University of Wisconsin, research team developed &quot;Mind Over Matter: Healthy Bowels,&#xD;
      Healthy Bladder&quot; (MOM), which is a small-group, community-based health promotion program that&#xD;
      builds skills and self-efficacy to make behavior changes that improve urinary and bowel&#xD;
      symptoms among older women with incontinence. Delivered by a trained facilitator, MOM allows&#xD;
      senior women to improve their symptoms without seeking medical care. In the randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) including 122 women in 6 Wisconsin communities, more than 70% of&#xD;
      participants (versus 23% of controls, p&lt;.0001) achieved improvement in urinary incontinence&#xD;
      and 55% (versus 26% of controls, p = .0015) achieved improvement in bowel incontinence three&#xD;
      months following completion of the program, corresponding to a number-needed-to-treat of 3&#xD;
      for urinary incontinence improvement and 4 for bowel incontinence improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, community-based, in-person programs like MOM continue to suffer limited adoption,&#xD;
      implementation, and reach. Many agencies that adopt and implement such health promotion&#xD;
      programs are under-resourced and often staffed by volunteers. To ensure intervention&#xD;
      fidelity, programs like MOM require a large commitment from their resource-stressed hosting&#xD;
      agencies. Implemented using a &quot;train the trainer&quot; approach organized by the Wisconsin&#xD;
      Institute for Healthy Aging (WIHA), MOM requires community facilitators to attend a 2-day&#xD;
      training and then run the workshop series at least twice annually. In addition to the 2-day&#xD;
      training, it requires approximately 24 person-hours to offer a single MOM workshop series. If&#xD;
      the trained facilitator leaves or is redirected to other activities, the community agency can&#xD;
      no longer implement or maintain the program without sending another staff member to be&#xD;
      trained. In addition to these hurdles at the organization level, there are barriers at the&#xD;
      individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent collaboration with the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), it was observed&#xD;
      that fewer than 20% of women with incontinence (mean age 55 years old) reported being likely&#xD;
      to attend a continence promotion program with the current, in-person MOM format. In&#xD;
      qualitative interviews, women expressed concerns about the time commitment, caregiver&#xD;
      responsibilities at home, issues related to travel (inclement weather, excessive distance to&#xD;
      reach a community center), and privacy, given the sensitive nature of incontinence. In&#xD;
      contrast, 65% of women with incontinence reported being likely to participate in an&#xD;
      electronic continence promotion program, increasing potential reach three-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation of the in-person MOM workshop to an electronic format (eMOM) has the potential to&#xD;
      overcome both individual and organizational hurdles, maximizing reach and minimizing barriers&#xD;
      to consistent implementation and maintenance. Women with incontinence can complete the&#xD;
      modules in privacy, at their convenience, and at their own pace. In contrast to the&#xD;
      commitment required for a community agency to implement the in-person MOM workshop, eMOM can&#xD;
      be implemented using whatever strategies the agency uses to share other electronic resources&#xD;
      with their members. eMOM can also be implemented via mass media, such as Facebook. Women age&#xD;
      65+ account for 11.6% of all Facebook users, and there are more than 200,000 monthly active&#xD;
      users in this demographic in Wisconsin alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research will provide invaluable information about the feasibility and reach of&#xD;
      implementing an electronic health promotion program through mass media versus through&#xD;
      existing community agencies - information applicable not just to continence promotion but&#xD;
      also to other health promotion programs trying to overcome similar barriers to reach,&#xD;
      implementation, and maintenance.&#xD;
