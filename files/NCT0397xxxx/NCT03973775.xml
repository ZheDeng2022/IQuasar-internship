      A Double Blind, Two Arm, Multicenter, Randomized, Parallel Group Bioequivalence Study with&#xD;
      Clinical Endpoints to Evaluate the Safety and Therapeutic Equivalence of, Permethrin Cream 5%&#xD;
      (Manufactured by Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC) &amp; Elimite™ (Permethrin Cream 5%, manufactured&#xD;
      for Prestium Pharma, Inc.) in Subjects with Scabies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To establish the clinical bioequivalence of Permethrin Cream 5%&#xD;
      (manufactured by Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC) and Elimite™ (Permethrin Cream 5%,&#xD;
      manufactured for Prestium Pharma, Inc.) in the treatment of scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei)&#xD;

    <masking_description>The Study Team consisted of blinded and unblinded teams. The blinded team consists of the Principal investigator(s) and their designee(s). This team includes trained study personnel who are experienced at finding scabies mites in skin lesions. Blinded team members completed informed consent/assent, screen for inclusion/exclusion criteria, enroll subjects, collect demographic information, perform the pre- and post-treatment evaluations and complete the Case Report Forms (CRFs). The unblinded team members consists of the dedicated study pharmacist and/or their designee(s).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the proportion of index subjects in the Per Protocol (PP) population in each treatment group with treatment cure when examined at Visit 4 (Day 28 ± 2 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 ± 2 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Cure is defined as demonstration of clinical cure (all clinical findings have completely resolved, including inflammatory/non-inflammatory lesions) and microscopic cure (demonstration of the absence of mites, ova, and/or mite feces) on Day 28. Negative microscopy can be declared if no mites, ova, or mite feces is found from a minimum of 3 skin scrapings from previously affected sites.</description>

             diagnosed with scabies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have dermatological evidence of active scabies (burrows, erythematous papules,&#xD;
             etc.) confirmed by recovery of live Sarcoptes scabiei (the Principal investigator or&#xD;
             trained and experienced Study Team examines the specimen(s) under magnification to&#xD;
             verify the identity and viability of the scabies mite, ova, or mite feces at the site)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The youngest subject (with scabies infestation as defined above) from each household&#xD;
             is considered the index or primary subject of the household for evaluation of the&#xD;
             primary endpoint. Other members of the household and close contacts are enrolled in&#xD;
             the study as Secondary subjects and evaluated for all safety parameters (not included&#xD;
             in primary endpoint analysis). Secondary subjects that are confirmed to have&#xD;
             dermatological evidence of scabies should receive the same study treatment as the&#xD;
             Index subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be available and willing to report for follow up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is otherwise healthy, well-nourished, non-febrile and not suffering from an infection&#xD;
             likely to require systemic antibiotic or topical therapy. These criteria will be&#xD;
             ascertained during screening by the Principal investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must agree not to use other scabicides or other medications likely to affect the&#xD;
             evaluation of their response to scabies treatment&#xD;
&#xD;

             dried the day after the first treatment. For materials that cannot be laundered,&#xD;
             insecticide powder or aerosolized insecticide may be used, or the items may be kept in&#xD;
