  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if study treatment with atezolizumab and PEGPH20&#xD;
      given before and after surgery, followed by chemotherapy is safe and if it can further&#xD;
      increase the immune response against the tumor rather than increase the chance of cure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Presently, surgical resection offers the only therapeutic means of cure. However only 15%-20%&#xD;
      of patients are found to have resectable disease at time of initial diagnosis. Of the&#xD;
      patients who undergo curative surgery, most will relapse and eventually succumb to the&#xD;
      disease. 5-year survival rates for node-negative and -positive disease at time of pancreatic&#xD;
      duodenectomy are 25%-30% and 10%, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although early phase trials have not offered great success in the metastatic setting for&#xD;
      patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma (PDA), interim analysis of a multicenter, phase 1 trial&#xD;
      with durvalumab presented at European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) indicated a disease&#xD;
      control rate of 21%. As mentioned previously, PD-L1 expression correlates with poor prognosis&#xD;
      and decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration within the tumor. Targeting PD-L1 in the&#xD;
      micrometastatic setting (resectable disease), when robust mature immunosuppressive pathways&#xD;
      may not have yet formed, may be the optimum time to investigate anti-PD-L1 therapy. This arm&#xD;
      of the study aims to test if atezolizumab is able to modulate CD8+ T-cell infiltration&#xD;
      compared to historical matched controls. As a secondary endpoint we will also evaluate how&#xD;
      clinical outcomes compare to matched historical controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoplastic, immune, and stromal cells within PDA reside in a highly dense desmoplastic&#xD;
      environment composed of an extracellular matrix of which hyaluronidase (HA) is an abundant&#xD;
      component. HA is a linear glycosaminoglycan and an integral component of not only PDA tumors,&#xD;
      but has also been shown to accumulate in many solid tumors and is associated with a poor&#xD;
      prognosis and increased immunosuppression. In a preclinical autochthonous mouse model of PDA,&#xD;
      Sunil Hingorani's group demonstrated that the interstitial fluid pressures were unusually&#xD;
      high within tumors that exhibited a high HA content. Furthermore, high HA tumors contained&#xD;
      low vascularity, which compromised delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine.&#xD;
      Mice treated with hyaluronidase resulted in decreased HA content and microvasculature&#xD;
      re-expansion within tumors which led to a survival benefit. These preclinical studies led to&#xD;
      early phase clinical studies in metastatic PDA where addition of PEGPH20 to gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel (GA) in a randomized phase 2 study demonstrated a survival benefit in patients&#xD;
      with HA-high tumors. The objective response rate for patients who were treated with a&#xD;
      combination of PEGPH20 and GA compared to GA alone was 45% versus 31%, respectively, and the&#xD;
      median overall survival was 11.5 versus 8.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio (HR), 0.96;&#xD;
      95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.57 to 1.61). A large phase 3 randomized clinical trial in the&#xD;
      high HA stage IV PDA population in the first line setting is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PDA likely invokes multiple immune evading mechanisms which result in its aggressive&#xD;
      behavior; it is expected that multiple agents will likely be needed to develop effective&#xD;
      therapies. One such rationale is the combination of PEGPH20 and immune checkpoint blockade to&#xD;
      allow increased cytotoxic T-cell infiltration by increasing vascular permeability and&#xD;
      decreasing interstitial pressure. In a breast cancer preclinical model, PEGPH20 resulted in&#xD;
      an increase accumulation of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) by 176% (p=0.0025) and&#xD;
      improved tumor growth inhibition by 38% relative to anti-PD-L1 alone (86% vs 62.4%,&#xD;
      p=0.0024). Other preclinical studies are also demonstrating increased CD8+ T-cell&#xD;
      infiltration with addition of PEGPH20 and improved tumor control in combination with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade. These and other preclinical studies suggest that this combination is&#xD;
      worth pursuing in patients with resectable PDA. The combination is hoped to increase CD8+&#xD;
      T-cell infiltration within the primary tumor for improved immune mediated cytotoxicity and&#xD;
      decreased interstitial pressure to allow improved surgical resections. Hypothetically, the&#xD;
      combination should also be effective in foci of micrometastasis, where the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment (TME) may not be as mature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identified risks for PEGPH20 include musculoskeletal events (MSEs), infusion-related&#xD;
      reactions (IRRs), and thromboembolic (TE) events.&#xD;

    <description>The change in number of intratumoral CD8+ T-cells the at time of surgery between treatment arm(s) compared to the atezolizumab arm. The CD8+ T-cell count within the tumor with neoadjuvant atezolizumab vs atezolizumab + PEGPH20 at the time of surgery will be reported using means and standard deviations by group and will be compared using a twosample T-test. If the data are not normally distributed, non-parametric models such as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used. Moreover, the distribution of CD8+ T-cell count by treatment arm will be assessed using box plots, histograms, and q-q plots.</description>

R0 resection rate is defined by the proportion of patients in whom an R0 resection was achieved during surgery. R0 resection is defined by complete removal of macroscopic tumor which contains negative microscopic surgical margins. The R0 resection rate will be estimated by the number of patients in whom R0 resection was performed divided by total number of patients in each study arm.

        <description>The change in number of intratumoral CD8+ T-cells the at time of surgery between treatment arm(s) compared to the atezolizumab arm. The CD8+ T-cell count within the tumor with neoadjuvant atezolizumab vs atezolizumab + PEGPH20 at the time of surgery will be reported using means and standard deviations by group and will be compared using a twosample T-test. If the data are not normally distributed, non-parametric models such as the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used. Moreover, the distribution of CD8+ T-cell count by treatment arm will be assessed using box plots, histograms, and q-q plots.</description>

        <title>R0 Resection Rate</title>
        <description>To determine the R0 resection rates with atezolizumab vs atezolizumab + PEGPH20 administered in the neoadjuvant setting. R0 resection rate is defined by the proportion of patients in whom an R0 resection was achieved during surgery. R0 resection is defined by complete removal of macroscopic tumor which contains negative microscopic surgical margins. The R0 resection rate will be estimated by the number of patients in whom R0 resection was performed divided by total number of patients in each study arm. The R0 resection rate will be reported along with the exact 95% confidence interval. The investigators will compare the R0 resection rates using Fisher's exact test.</description>

          <title>R0 Resection Rate</title>
          <description>To determine the R0 resection rates with atezolizumab vs atezolizumab + PEGPH20 administered in the neoadjuvant setting. R0 resection rate is defined by the proportion of patients in whom an R0 resection was achieved during surgery. R0 resection is defined by complete removal of macroscopic tumor which contains negative microscopic surgical margins. The R0 resection rate will be estimated by the number of patients in whom R0 resection was performed divided by total number of patients in each study arm. The R0 resection rate will be reported along with the exact 95% confidence interval. The investigators will compare the R0 resection rates using Fisher's exact test.</description>
