      Phase II Study of Avelumab plus chemotherapy in the peri-operative treatment for patients&#xD;
      with resectable Gastric cancer (GC) or Gastroesphageal Junction cancer (GEJC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of Avelumab to the perioperative chemotherapy in GC and GEJC patients may&#xD;
      increase pathological responses by a synergic effect activating the immune response.&#xD;
      Conclusively, the survival of these patients would improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate whether the addition of avelumab to FLOT chemotherapy&#xD;
      (docetaxel, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil/leucovorin) improves efficacy in terms of&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate, in GC and GEJC patients compared to the historical&#xD;
      data of chemotherapy alone in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;

      Phase II Study of Avelumab plus chemotherapy in the peri-operative treatment for patients&#xD;
      with resectable Gastric cancer (GC) or Gastroesphageal Junction cancer (GEJC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of Avelumab to the perioperative chemotherapy in GC and GEJC patients may&#xD;
      increase pathological responses by a synergic effect activating the immune response.&#xD;
      Conclusively, the survival of these patients would improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to investigate whether the addition of avelumab to FLOT chemotherapy&#xD;
      (docetaxel, oxaliplatin and fluorouracil/leucovorin) improves efficacy in terms of&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate, in GC and GEJC patients compared to the historical&#xD;
      data of chemotherapy alone in the neoadjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the addition of avelumab to the perioperative chemotherapy in regard to the&#xD;
           following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disease-free survival (DFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression-free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Surgical resection rate (R0)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall Response Rate (ORR) to neoadjuvancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of avelumab with FLOT chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform a comprehensive analysis of biomarkers, as exploratory endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicentric phase II clinical trial in&#xD;
      subjects with operable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. Tissue biopsies before and after&#xD;
      treatment will be required. Blood samples will be required at different points of the&#xD;
      treatment for biomarker analyses. Tumor imaging assessments will be performed at baseline,&#xD;
      after the neoadjuvant treatment, and after finalizing the adjuvancy with avelumab/FLOT, and&#xD;
      every 6 months thereafter to determine response to treatment. Clinical decision making will&#xD;
      be based on Investigator assessment of the scans using RECIST v1.1. Safety of avelumab/FLOT&#xD;
      will be monitored continuously by careful monitoring of all adverse events (AEs) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAEs) reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with resectable gastric and GEJ cancer suitable for preoperative&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: Summary tables (descriptive statistics and frequency tables) will&#xD;
      be provided for all demographic, baseline and safety variables, as appropriate. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range,&#xD;
      and median). Ninety-five (95) percent confidence intervals (95% CI) may also be presented, as&#xD;
      appropriate. Frequency counts and percentage of subjects within each category will be&#xD;
      provided for categorical data. The primary efficacy analysis (pCR) will be performed using&#xD;
      the binomial test procedure. Additionally, for the pCR rate one-sided 90% CI will be also&#xD;
      presented to be consistent with sample size calculation. Secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      summarized with descriptive statistics. Survival analysis will be performed to analyse OS,&#xD;
      PFS and DFS. Kaplan- Meier curves will be presented and possible comparisons will be tested&#xD;
      using the log-rank test or the Cox proportional hazard model for multivariate analysis,&#xD;
      hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI95%) will be provided. Any survival&#xD;
      analyses will be considered as exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population are patients with resectable gastric and GEJ cancer suitable for&#xD;
      preoperative chemotherapy. The study duration will be approximately 24 months of recruitment;&#xD;
      5 years of additional followup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding to the study product, peri-operatory treatment consisting of four cycles (each&#xD;
      cycle is 14 days) of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (docetaxel, oxaliplatin and&#xD;
      fluorouracil/leucovorin) plus avelumab previous to surgery. Surgery is recommended to be&#xD;
      scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after the last dose. Afterwards (4 to 10 weeks after surgery), four&#xD;
      cycles of adjuvant therapy with the same schema, followed by avelumab up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this study will be conducted in 10 centres in Spain.&#xD;

             behaviour; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with&#xD;
             study participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
