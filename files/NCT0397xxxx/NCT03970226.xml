  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two phases. The first phase (phase 0) will be looking at&#xD;
      patients with new or recurrent/ progressed craniopharyngioma tumors. These patients will be&#xD;
      given one dose of tocilizumab before they have SOC surgery of their tumor. The objective of&#xD;
      this phase is to see if drug reaches the tumor. If phase 0 is favorable and shows that drug&#xD;
      is penetrating the tumor, the second phase of the study (feasibility phase) will open. Both&#xD;
      phases will remain open concurrently and patients will be able to enroll on the Phase 0 then&#xD;
      &quot;roll over&quot; and enroll on the feasibility phase. During the feasibility phase patients will&#xD;
      be administered tocilizumab every two weeks for up to 13 cycles (approximately 1 year).&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for up to 5 years in the feasibility phase.&#xD;
