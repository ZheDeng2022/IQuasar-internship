      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with prostate cancer usually have their cancer imaged with a CT scan and bone scan.&#xD;
      They then have their prostate gland removed. Researchers want to test a scan that might&#xD;
      predict if prostate cancer will return after this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if a PET/CT scan before the prostate gland is removed can predict if prostate cancer&#xD;
      will return. Also, to test if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older with prostate cancer that appears to be contained within the prostate&#xD;
      but is at risk of having spread&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT and MRI scans: Participants will lie in a machine. The machine will take pictures of&#xD;
           the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a radiotracer injected into a vein. They will have a PET/CT scan of&#xD;
      their whole body 60 90 minutes later. During the scan, they will lie on their back and stay&#xD;
      still.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 60 days after the scan, participants will have surgery. This will remove the prostate&#xD;
      gland and lymph nodes around it. Some tissue will be used for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the PET/CT scan suggests the cancer has spread, participants may need to have another&#xD;
      biopsy within 60 days after the scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, participants will have follow-up visits for 5 years. They will have 5 visits&#xD;
      the first year and 2 the second. Then they will have visits once a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants cancer returns, they will have repeat PET/CT scans.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 30,000 men will die from prostate cancer in the US in 2018. The majority of these&#xD;
           men originally presented with localized cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment options for patients with high risk, localized disease typically involve&#xD;
           radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) in combination with androgen&#xD;
           deprivation therapy (ADT). Following RP, 70% of patients with high-risk disease will&#xD;
           experience a biochemical recurrence at 5 years, and approximately 20% will die of their&#xD;
           disease in 10-15 years, likely due to metastatic disease that was not detectable using&#xD;
           conventional imaging (99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and X-ray computed&#xD;
           tomography) at&#xD;
&#xD;
      the time of prostatectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is commonly expressed in prostate cancers and&#xD;
           is associated with biologic aggressiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second generation, PET tracer 18F-DCFPyl binds to the enzymatic portion of PSMA. It&#xD;
           exhibits high uptake in tumor and rapid washout in normal tissues leading to high tumor&#xD;
           to background ratios and the possibility of detecting metastases when conventional&#xD;
           imaging is negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if patients with a preoperative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT that is negative for&#xD;
      metastases experience 5 year progression free survival (PFS) which is improved (40%) over&#xD;
      that of historical data (30%) based on a general population of similar patients who have not&#xD;
      undergone imaging with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men greater than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must have histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma confirmed by a CLIA&#xD;
           certified laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Must have prostate cancer with high risk features defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gleason 8 and higher OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical stage T3a (i.e. likely extraprostatic extension on MRI) or T3b&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Leukocytes &gt;=3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total bilirubin &lt;2 X normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 X normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Creatinine &lt;2 X normal institutional limits OR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  eGFR &gt;=50 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional&#xD;
                normal (calculated via the MDRD equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be planning to undergo radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy&#xD;
           regardless of findings on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willingness and ability to undergo multiparametric prostate MRI and 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center trial designed to evaluate the&#xD;
           impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging on Progression-Free Survival at 5 years in patients&#xD;
           with high risk localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects meeting eligibility criteria will undergo baseline assessments to include&#xD;
           multiparametric MRI of the prostate, 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate bone scan and&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects meeting eligibility criteria will undergo 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will enroll up to 200 patients from 7 centers. Up to 40 patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled at NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will undergo radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy within 60 days&#xD;
           following PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects will be evaluated at 6 weeks, at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months, at 2, 3, 4, and 5&#xD;
           years post-prostatectomy to determine if there has been progression and to record&#xD;
           details of subsequent treatment and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging will be repeated at the time of progression.&#xD;
