  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is first genetic kidney disease and&#xD;
      fourth etiology of end stage renal disease in the world. Peritoneal dialysis is underuse in&#xD;
      this population. Indeed in this pathology, behind big kidneys and big liver, a hyper pressure&#xD;
      is feared with technical failure. The lack of abdominal space could generate increase of&#xD;
      peritoneal pressure. Hyper pressure is already known to be a risk factor of technical failure&#xD;
      and over mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients (all nephropathies included). It depends&#xD;
      on body mass index and body surface modulating injected volume for each patient. Anticipate&#xD;
      peritoneal pressure in this population ADPKD could be an important information for&#xD;
      distinguish those who can use peritoneal dialysis without fear and those at risk of technical&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to create and validate prediction score for intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      pressure, in peritoneal dialysis for ADPKD patients thanks to clinical and radiological&#xD;
      values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to study the association between intra-peritoneal pressure and&#xD;
      patient's outcome (global survival and technical survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective, multicentric, national, cohort study will be performed. For the first step&#xD;
      (score creation): ADPKD patients starting peritoneal dialysis for end stage renal failure&#xD;
      between 01/01/2010 and 31/12/2015 with tomodensitometry between one year before beginning and&#xD;
      one year after were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second step (score validation): ADPKD patients starting peritoneal dialysis for end&#xD;
      stage renal failure between 01/01/2016 and 31/12/2017 with tomodensitometry between one year&#xD;
      before beginning and one year after were included.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Data regarding organ volume and clinical data wich can influence pressure and patient's&#xD;
      outcome (global survival and technical survival) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A bivariate analysis will be performed to study the association between intra-peritoneal&#xD;
      pressure and clinical data. A multivariate analysis by multiple linear regressions will be&#xD;
      performed to create the score. Survival analysis by log rank test and cox regression model&#xD;
      will be performed for global survival and technical survival.&#xD;
