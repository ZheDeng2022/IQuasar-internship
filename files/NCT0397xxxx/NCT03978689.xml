    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study evaluating&#xD;
      the safety, anti-tumor effect, and immunogenicity of CUE-101 as monotherapy treatment in&#xD;
      second line or CUE-101 Combination Therapy with Pembrolizumab in first line patients with&#xD;
      HPV16+ Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CUE-101 is a novel fusion protein designed to activate and expand a population of tumor&#xD;
      specific T cells to eradicate human papilloma virus (HPV)-driven malignancies. HPV causes&#xD;
      multiple tumor types including cervical, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and&#xD;
      anal cancers. Initial testing of CUE-101 will be conducted in HPV16+ HNSCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of the Part A&amp;B, first-in-human trial, are to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of CUE-101 in subjects with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in the second line&#xD;
      setting and to determine the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose based on&#xD;
      markers of biological activity. Pharmacokinetics (PK), antitumor immune response, preliminary&#xD;
      antitumor activity and the potential for immunogenicity will also be assessed. The goal of&#xD;
      Part C&amp;D is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and biological effects of CUE-101 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC in the first line&#xD;
      setting. This will be an open-label multicenter phase I trial conducted in the U.S. involving&#xD;
      approximately 85 patients.&#xD;
