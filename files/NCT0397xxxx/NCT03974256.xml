  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radiopharmaceuticals manipulation used in nuclear medicine department is a significant&#xD;
      source of radiation for operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to Article R. 4451-13 of the Labor Code, the exposure limit for hands and skin&#xD;
      (average dose over a surface of 1 cm²) received during twelve consecutive months can't exceed&#xD;
      the annual dose limit 500 millisieverts (mSv).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The radiopharmaceuticals manipulation exposes operators to the risk of exceeding this limit,&#xD;
      as has been shown in a European study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are automatons on the market but only for radiopharmaceutical&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the advantages of such an automaton is to reduce irradiation of operators' hands&#xD;
      during the radiopharmaceuticals preparation. This reduction can reach 95% according to&#xD;
      certain authors and the type of automaton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore proposes to evaluate the effect of an original, newly designed automaton&#xD;
      on operators' dosimetry and the labelled radiopharmaceuticals' quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis emitted in this study is that the use of this automaton would allow to reduce&#xD;
      drastically operators' hands exposure and probably also to improve the precision of the&#xD;
      prepared syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in a paired way, require a randomization in cross-over and each of&#xD;
      the subjects included will be its own witness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic purposes are prepared by operators,&#xD;
      Technologist in Medical Electro-Radiology or/and Pharmacy Technicians, manually for&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with Technetium-99m (99mTc), or using an automaton for&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are automatons on the market but only for radiopharmaceuticals FDG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these automatons are currently only used to split into individual doses&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals FDG, the labelling radiopharmaceuticals being carried out before&#xD;
      delivery in nuclear medicine departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sysark SAS's company has created and patented, with the collaboration of the Center of&#xD;
      Research in Automatic Control of Nancy (CRAN, mixed unite of research 7039 common to the&#xD;
      University of Lorraine and the CNRS) an innovative automaton for the preparation of&#xD;
      radiopharmaceuticals labelled with 99mTc, used to perform scintigraphy examinations of&#xD;
      nuclear medicine department.&#xD;
