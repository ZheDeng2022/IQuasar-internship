  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival of thoracic tumour patients. However,&#xD;
      the associated exposure of normal tissues, often leads to side effects and possibly even&#xD;
      reduces survival. Indeed, there is growing evidence that overall survival after radiotherapy&#xD;
      for lung and oesophageal cancer is related to the radiation dose to heart and lungs. This&#xD;
      suggests that thoracic radiotherapy causes mortality, which is currently not recognized as&#xD;
      radiation-induced toxicity. So the question arises how to explain this treatment-related&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, Ghobadi et al demonstrated in rats that thoracic irradiation can lead to&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension (PH). Histopathological analysis showed that radiation-induced PH&#xD;
      closely resembles the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) subtype. Moreover, in a clinical&#xD;
      pilot study we confirmed early signs of PH including dose-dependent reductions in blood flow&#xD;
      towards the lungs in radiotherapy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general PH significantly affects survival. Moreover, the PAH subtype is the most-rapidly&#xD;
      progressive and lethal subtype. However, medical treatment can significantly slow down PAH&#xD;
      progression, providing opportunities for secondary prevention. Yet, hard evidence that&#xD;
      radiation-induced PH is a clinically relevant phenomenon in patients treated for thoracic&#xD;
      tumours, is lacking.&#xD;

      In the present study, the incidence and time course of treatment-related changes in&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary physiology will be assessed using standard diagnostic tools such as&#xD;
      echocardiography, cardiac MRI (CMR) and serum biomarkers and relate them to the radiation&#xD;
      dose distribution. Such insight in the characteristics of this possible radiation-induced PH&#xD;
      and contributing risk factors is essential to develop primary (radiation dose optimization)&#xD;
      prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (PH) is a clinically relevant radiation-induced side effect of thoracic irradiation. If&#xD;
      confirmed this allows us to take appropriate measures in patient care to improve quality of&#xD;
      life in thoracic cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this hypothesis, the following specific aims have been defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the incidence and time course of PH in a prospective cohort study in patients&#xD;
           treated with radiotherapy for lung or oesophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize other changes in myocardial function and pulmonary arteries, and their&#xD;
           function using cardiac MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine treatment-related risk factors, in particular radiation dose factors to the&#xD;
           lungs and heart that could be used for future optimization strategies to minimize the&#xD;
           risk of inducing PH in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the clinical impact by correlating PH to patient-rated outcome measure&#xD;
           (PROMs) and survival. Taken together this study will determine if radiation-induced&#xD;
           pulmonary hypertension is a clinically relevant toxicity and will provide information&#xD;
           required for future studies on its prevention and treatment. In addition, more insight&#xD;
           will be obtained on other forms of cardiovascular damage and complications that may&#xD;
           occur in these patients.&#xD;
