  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the efficacy and safety of a new oral treatment drug against&#xD;
      Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to T.b rhodesiense. 34 patients will be recruited in&#xD;
      2 sites located in Malawi and Uganda. All patients will receive the study drug fexinidazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the only treatment available for the stage 2 of HAT due to t.b rhodesiense is&#xD;
      melarsoprol, a very toxic drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate fexinidazole as an alternative treatment&#xD;
      over melarsoprol in patients with stage 2 of HAT disease due to t.b rhodesiense in a Phase&#xD;
      II/III cohort trial with 34 stage 2 patients. All stages of the disease will be recruited but&#xD;
      the recruitment will stop once 34 evaluable stage-2 patients have reached the end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be a multicentre, non-randomized, clinical trial in patients with r-HAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited among the patients reporting to Lwala Hospital (Uganda) and Rumphi&#xD;
      District Hospital (Malawi). If feasible, r-HAT patients from other hospitals and centres in&#xD;
      Kaberamaido/Dokolo Districts (Uganda) and Rumphi/Mzimba North District (Malawi) and well as&#xD;
      Zambia bordering areas, will be referred to Lwala and Rumphi Hospitals, respectively, for&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fexinidazole is an oral treatment which has to be taken every day for 10 days. In case of&#xD;
      lack of efficacy (e.g. disease relapse) the patients will be switched to the standart&#xD;
      treatment that is part of the National Control Program in each country (melarsoprol for&#xD;
      stage-2 patients and suramin for stage-1 patients)&#xD;
