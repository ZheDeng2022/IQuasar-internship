  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) is among the most common malignancies worldwide. Early&#xD;
      detection and prevention of OSCC is thought to have the highest potential to reduce morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. In prevention, the main focus is on precancerous lesions, especially oral&#xD;
      leukoplakia (OLP), as up to 67% of OSCC arise on the basis of OLP. The determination of the&#xD;
      transformation risk of OLP by histological determination of the degree of dysplasia is&#xD;
      unreliable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A promising marker for the timely development of a OSCC is the detection of antigens of the&#xD;
      MAGE-A gene family. The special feature of MAGE-A is that they can be detected in 93% of all&#xD;
      OSCC and in approx. 85% of OLP that transform to OSCC. The detection of MAGE-A could also&#xD;
      indicate changes in the immunological environment that occur prior to malignant OLP&#xD;
      transformation and could be used for immunotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to investigate MAGE-A as a predictive marker for the malignant&#xD;
      transformation of OLP in the setting of a prospective, multicenter study and to establish it&#xD;
      as a diagnostic parameter in addition to classical histology. In addition, the association of&#xD;
      MAGE-A expression with the occurrence of immunological changes in OLP will be investigated in&#xD;
      order to evaluate the possibility of minimally invasive immunotherapy of OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended to include 500 biopsies of non-selected patients with OLP from&#xD;
      university institutions and private practices. The follow-up should be at least 3 years,&#xD;
      whereby it is examined whether an OSCC on the basis of the original OLP developed. After&#xD;
      three years, an interim evaluation of the results with statistical evaluation will be carried&#xD;
      out. In order to ensure that the course of the disease is monitored for at least three years&#xD;
      for all OLPs, an extension of the monitoring period to 5 years is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study could establish a routine diagnostic parameter to supplement the&#xD;
      histo-morphological diagnosis of OLP and evaluate the possibility of immunotherapy of OLP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) is among the most common malignancies worldwide. Despite&#xD;
      the introduction of microsurgical reconstruction options and advances in multimodal tumor&#xD;
      therapy, the prognosis has not improved significantly in the last 30 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important aspect for increasing survival rate is seen in the early detection of OSCC&#xD;
      and its precursor lesions. Up to 67 % of OSCC develop on the basis of oral leukoplakia (OLP),&#xD;
      which frequently occur prior to the diagnosis of carcinoma. OLP treatment depends on the risk&#xD;
      of malignant transformation. Therapeutic approaches range from simple observation to complete&#xD;
      surgical excision of OLP. The scientific evidence regarding the handling of OLP is low.&#xD;
      Current literature outlines missing evidence in therapeutic management of OLP. The early&#xD;
      identification of OLP with a high risk of malignant degeneration is a relevant clinical&#xD;
      question, since approx. 2% of OLPs transform malignantly each year. In lesions with dysplasia&#xD;
      this rate increases to about 17%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gold standard for determining the risk of malignant transformation of OLP is the histologic&#xD;
      determination of the degree of dysplasia. As the histological degree of dysplasia increases,&#xD;
      so does the risk of developing PECM on the basis of OLP. The decision for a surgical or a&#xD;
      conservative therapy currently depends on the degree of dysplasia of the OLP. The&#xD;
      histopathological assessment of the degree of dysplasia is subjective and depends on the&#xD;
      experience of the pathologist making the assessment. However, the major disadvantage in&#xD;
      assessing the malignant transformation potential with this method is that many precursor&#xD;
      lesions do not follow the histopathologically determined degree of dysplasia. Thus, 0-3% of&#xD;
      hyperplasias (D0) and up to 30% of mild dysplasias (D1) transform to OSCC. D0 OLP are&#xD;
      lesions, which are usually only observed according to current therapy recommendations. Thus,&#xD;
      an assessment of the dignity of OLP and a long-term prediction of the risk for the&#xD;
      development of OSCC are not reliable. OLP with a histopathologically low malignancy potential&#xD;
      but a cell-biologically probable malignant transformation must be identified in order to&#xD;
      prevent undertreatment of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this explorative study is to investigate whether the malignant transformation of&#xD;
      OLP can be reliably predicted using immunohistochemical and molecular biological methods. A&#xD;
      significant association of the expression of MAGE-A expression with the malignant&#xD;
      transformation of OLP to OSCC has already been demonstrated in retrospective studies. It is&#xD;
      now necessary to further develop these available test procedures and evaluate them in a&#xD;
      prospective study in order to transfer them into clinical routine. Sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the investigated markers will be investigated in a prospective, multicenter&#xD;
      setting. A non-selected group of patients will be examined. The aim is to establish a test&#xD;
      procedure that can be used cost-effectively. The MAGE-A expression should serve as an&#xD;
      indicator and for the application of new, innovative therapy concepts such as the&#xD;
      immunotherapy of OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be answered:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) Do OLP with malignant transformation show an increased MAGE-A expression in a time&#xD;
      interval of 3 years (follow-up up to 5 years)? ii) How high is the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of MAGE-A expression as a predictive diagnostic test? Is immunohistochemical or&#xD;
      molecular biological (RT-PCR) detection of MAGE-A better suited as a diagnostic test? iii)&#xD;
      Can MAGE-A be used successfully as a diagnostic test in practice? iv) Is there an association&#xD;
      between MAGE-A expression and immunological changes preceding malignant transformation&#xD;
      (macrophage polarization, T cell infiltration, checkpoint expression, TLR expression)? v) Are&#xD;
      the immunological changes in OLP potentially amenable to immunomodulatory therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short summary of the study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient has been informed and included in the study, the first step is the photo&#xD;
      documentation and then the incision biopsy of the OLP. The treating physician is free to&#xD;
      choose whether to take a sample from one or more sites of the lesion. This procedure complies&#xD;
      with the standard diagnostic guidelines and is not a study-specific measure. Thus, there is&#xD;
      no deviation from the clinical routine for the study and no invasive measure required by the&#xD;
      study. The sample taken is then divided. The total amount of tissue taken corresponds to the&#xD;
      amount taken in the routine outside the study. One part of the sample is conventionally fixed&#xD;
      in formalin. The second part (max. 5x5x2mm) is preserved in RNA later for later PCR analysis.&#xD;
      Both samples will be sent to the study center in Erlangen. There the histological evaluation&#xD;
      of the tissue takes place in the Pathological Institute of the University Hospital Erlangen&#xD;
      within routine diagnostics. The result is communicated to the treating physician and the&#xD;
      study centre. The immunohistochemical and molecular biological analyses are carried out in&#xD;
      the laboratories of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Erlangen. The results of the analyses&#xD;
      are not communicated to the attending physician (blinding). A therapy decision is only made&#xD;
      on the basis of clinical and classical histological parameters (degree of dysplasia). D0 and&#xD;
      D1 lesions are monitored. D2 and D3 lesions are treated surgically or with laser coagulation&#xD;
      depending on the decision of the treating physician and patient. This corresponds to the&#xD;
      current clinical standard. If the patient rejects the treatment of the lesion and wishes to&#xD;
      continue observing its progress, he remains included in the study. The follow-up time during&#xD;
      the study period is 3 years (evaluations also after 2 years). After completion of the study a&#xD;
      further follow-up of 2 years is planned in order to achieve a total follow-up of 5 years.&#xD;
