    <textblock>
      In the Main Study Phase a total of 246 subjects were randomized 2:2:1 into three treatment&#xD;
      groups to receive either VLA15 with Alum (lower or higher dose) or Placebo. Main Study Phase&#xD;
      vaccinations were administered as intramuscular injections on Day 1, Day 57 and Day 180.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Booster Phase subjects from the higher dose group who completed their primary&#xD;
      immunization schedule according to protocol will be randomized 2:1 to receive an additional&#xD;
      higher dose VLA15 vaccination or Placebo at Month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration in the Main Study Phase per subject is a maximum of 20 months. Overall study&#xD;
      Duration is estimated to be 22 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per subject in the Booster Phase is a maximum of approximately 13 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per subject in the Main Study Phase and Booster Phase together is estimated to&#xD;
      be a maximum of approximately 33 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study duration (i.e., First-Subject-In to Last-Subject Out/ end of Booster Phase) is&#xD;
      estimated to be approximately 37 months.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, observer-blind (subject, Sponsor and investigator/site staff involved&#xD;
      in Clinical Evaluation of subjects are blinded), Placebo controlled, multicenter Phase 2&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Main Study Phase a total of 246 healthy subjects,aged 18 to 65 years, were randomized&#xD;
      2:2:1 to receive either VLA15 with Alum (lower or higher doser Placebo. Main Study Phase&#xD;
      vaccinations were administered as intramuscular injections on Day 1 (Month 0), Day 57 (Month&#xD;
      2) and Day 180 (Month 6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects from the higher dose group who completed their primary immunization schedule&#xD;
      according to protocol, will be randomized 2:1 to receive an additional injection of the&#xD;
      higher dose VLA15 with Alum or Placebo in a Booster Phase. The additional vaccination is&#xD;
      administered as intramuscular injection approximately 18 months after the first immunization.&#xD;
