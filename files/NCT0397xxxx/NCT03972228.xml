  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study for placement of a tiny microdevice into lung tumors to more precisely&#xD;
      predict tumor-specific drug sensitivity, and to help inform systemic therapeutic decisions.&#xD;
      The microdevice will provide a novel technique for interrogating human lung tumor tissue in&#xD;
      situ, and will uniquely facilitate assessment of response to multiple drugs simultaneously.&#xD;
      This will not only increase the specificity of a particular participant's chosen systemic&#xD;
      therapy, it will also augment the speed and efficiency with which investigators are able to&#xD;
      make clinical decisions regarding choice of therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The initial aims in this pilot study will focus on the safety and feasibility of microdevice&#xD;
      placement and retrieval in participants with suspicious lung lesions. The microdevice, which&#xD;
      is 5.5 mm in length and approximately 750 Âµm in diameter (i.e., comparable in size and shape&#xD;
      to commonly used fiducial markers), will be placed in the suspected tumor tissue at the time&#xD;
      of surgical resection. Multiple agents will passively diffuse into local, confined regions&#xD;
      (several microns) of the surrounding microenvironment. The agents are released at&#xD;
      approximately one millionth of a systemic dose. The device(s) will be removed for analysis at&#xD;
      the time of resection, which will be performed for clinical indications independent of&#xD;
      enrollment in this study. The investigators will collect data regarding the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of the placement and retrieval of the microdevices, and perform detailed tissue&#xD;
      analysis of drug response. Investigators hope to compile preliminary data regarding&#xD;
      correlations between in situ drug response and the genetic and histopathologic features of&#xD;
      tumors, systemic treatment response, and ultimately, clinical outcomes.&#xD;
