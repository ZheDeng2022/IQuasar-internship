  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-year study. The study's primary outcome is successful improvement of the Our&#xD;
      Whole Lives for Hypertension (OWL-H) online patient education platform, based upon&#xD;
      participant use and focus group feedback, to deliver information on self-management of&#xD;
      hypertension and other cardiac risk factors, and to encourage self-monitoring of blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 - To pilot test the OWL-H platform for 8 weeks with 26 patients with&#xD;
      hypertension (2 groups of 13) to refine its utility for home self-monitoring (number of times&#xD;
      patients record home blood pressure and input this data onto OWL-H and engagement of&#xD;
      self-management (i.e. # of logins, # of mind body sessions completed, # of times modules&#xD;
      accessed each day)). Hypothesis 1: Eighty percent of patients will log in and record their&#xD;
      blood pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 - At the end of each group, hold a focus group to obtain information about: 1)&#xD;
      the barriers and facilitators of using the OWL-H platform and using OWL-H to self-monitor&#xD;
      blood pressure at home, 2) satisfaction with OWL-H, 3) how OWL-H helped with reduction of&#xD;
      number of cardiac risk factors (e.g., smoking, eating habits, perceived stress, and amount of&#xD;
      exercise and health-related quality of life).&#xD;

    <measure>Blood Pressure Knowledge Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The Blood Pressure Knowledge Questionnaire (BPKQ) was used to assess the participants' level of knowledge regarding common characteristics and risk factors of hypertension. It consists of 8 items covering topics like common symptoms, White Coat Syndrome, and the amount of salt consumed by the average American, with a mix of multiple choice (6 items) and true/false questions (2 items). The correct items are totaled, with a range of 1-8, and higher scores indicating more hypertension knowledge. The information needed to answer each item correctly was covered in OWL-H's curriculum.</description>

    <measure>Hypertension Self-Care Profile Self-Efficacy Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self-efficacy instrument of the Hypertension Self-care Profile (HTN-SCP-SE) used for this study consists of 20 items assessing the respondent's confidence on a scale of 1 (Not confident) to 4 (Very confident) to regularly engage in lifestyle habits that are recommended for patients with high blood pressure. It was developed and validated in 2014. The instrument results in a total confidence/self-efficacy score ranging from 20-80, with higher scores indicating higher levels of confidence in engaging in heart-healthy lifestyle habits.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire (MDQ) consists of 14 yes-no items that assess participant's consumption of heart protective or harming foods. It was originally developed in Spain in 2004 to briefly assess adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and has been validated in multiple studies. Items assess the type of food eaten and whether the appropriate serving size is consumed, on a weekly basis. &quot;Yes&quot; responses are totaled, resulting in a score ranging from 0-14, with higher scores indicating a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numbers of Time Blood Pressure Self-Monitoring Occurred During One Week</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess blood pressure self-monitoring pre-post, we first asked &quot;Are you regularly (at least once per week) able to measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot;. Those who said &quot;yes&quot; were then asked &quot;How often, in a regular week, do you measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot; In their post-surveys, they were again asked to estimate their average weekly number of entries. Along with these self-report numbers, the OWL-H platform also keeps a log of every blood pressure entered by each participant across the 8 weeks.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Male and female subjects of all races and ethnicities who are English-speaking adults&#xD;
             over the age of 18 and who have a current diagnosis of hypertension.. OWL in currently&#xD;
             only available in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects' physical and mental health status will be sufficient to be able to&#xD;
             comprehend instructions and participate in the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to access computer technology (cellular phone, desktop, laptop)&#xD;
             and the internet to utilize the online OWL-H.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious underlying systemic or co-morbid disease, including psychotic or manic&#xD;
             symptoms, which preclude physical or cognitive ability to participate in the&#xD;
             intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The risk-benefit ratio of the interventions for these individuals may be potentially higher&#xD;
        than acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active substance abuse, given that individuals who have active substance abuse pose a&#xD;
             higher risk both to themselves and other members of the groups.&#xD;

It was originally developed in Spain in 2004 to briefly assess adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and has been validated in multiple studies. Items assess the type of food eaten and whether the appropriate serving size is consumed, on a weekly basis. &quot;Yes&quot; responses are totaled, resulting in a score ranging from 0-14, with higher scores indicating a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet.</description>

          <description>To assess blood pressure self-monitoring pre-post, we first asked &quot;Are you regularly (at least once per week) able to measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot;. Those who said &quot;yes&quot; were then asked &quot;How often, in a regular week, do you measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot; In their post-surveys, they were again asked to estimate their average weekly number of entries. Along with these self-report numbers, the OWL-H platform also keeps a log of every blood pressure entered by each participant across the 8 weeks.</description>

        <title>Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire (MDQ) consists of 14 yes-no items that assess participant's consumption of heart protective or harming foods. It was originally developed in Spain in 2004 to briefly assess adherence to a Mediterranean Diet and has been validated in multiple studies. Items assess the type of food eaten and whether the appropriate serving size is consumed, on a weekly basis. &quot;Yes&quot; responses are totaled, resulting in a score ranging from 0-14, with higher scores indicating a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet.</description>
        <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
        <population>One participant did not fully complete this questionnaire at baseline, resulting in 23 rather than 24 participants assessed.</population>

OWL-Hypertension 8 Wk Trial: Our Whole Lives - Hypertension is an innovative online community and self-management program that provides access to stress reduction, mind-body techniques, nutrition, exercise, and peer support. OWL-H provides educational materials including videos of clinician-led talks (stress reactivity, nutrition, movement, etc.). OWL-H also provides subjects a facilitated community blog, private journal, peer support, and an extensive resource library. It will be tested by 26 patients with hypertension, to refine the platform based on patient feedback and outcomes.</description>

        <title>Numbers of Time Blood Pressure Self-Monitoring Occurred During One Week</title>
        <description>To assess blood pressure self-monitoring pre-post, we first asked &quot;Are you regularly (at least once per week) able to measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot;. Those who said &quot;yes&quot; were then asked &quot;How often, in a regular week, do you measure your blood pressure outside of your doctor appointments?&quot; In their post-surveys, they were again asked to estimate their average weekly number of entries. Along with these self-report numbers, the OWL-H platform also keeps a log of every blood pressure entered by each participant across the 8 weeks.</description>
