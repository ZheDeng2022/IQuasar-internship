    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of cannabis for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      migraine headaches. Study subjects will be randomized to one of three groups: lower dose CBD,&#xD;
      higher dose CBD or placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of moderate to severe&#xD;
      headache, often accompanied by sensory sensitivity and nausea. Migraine can be very disabling&#xD;
      and often interferes with social and occupational functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the high prevalence of migraine and the significant burden it places on the individual&#xD;
      and society, it is an important condition to study and manage optimally. This is especially&#xD;
      true because current migraine treatments often result in only marginal improvement and are&#xD;
      frequently associated with intolerable side effects. For this reason, there is a need for new&#xD;
      migraine treatments. The endocannabinoid system is an important potential treatment target as&#xD;
      it is involved in pain processing and overlaps with some mechanisms of migraine&#xD;
      pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cannabis was legalized in Canada on October 17th, 2018. As a result, the consumption of&#xD;
      cannabis products for migraine treatment may increase. However, at this time there is limited&#xD;
      evidence for the safety and efficacy of cannabis for the treatment of migraine. As a result,&#xD;
      there is a need for further study and research in this area. Thus, we propose a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study cannabis (specifically cannabidiol)&#xD;
      as a preventative therapy for patients with chronic migraine.&#xD;
