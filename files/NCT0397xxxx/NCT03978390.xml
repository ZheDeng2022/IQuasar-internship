  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to investigate how to increase children cooperation in dental&#xD;
      settings using ideas adopted from psychology to make an effective interdisciplinary approach.&#xD;
      We want to test how showing images of mainstream superheroes such as Superman, Batman, etc.&#xD;
      can prepare children, 6-12 years old, to behave desirably during the dental injection. Also,&#xD;
      new modification will be applied to providing awards to children by telling them that they&#xD;
      can keep the rewards they receive before starting the procedure only if they behave&#xD;
      accordingly during the treatment. Moreover, it will be shown that if children's baseline&#xD;
      psychological characteristic, age, gender, and family income affect their cooperation in the&#xD;
      dental office. The results of this study help to manage children's behavior more efficiently&#xD;
      in the clinical settings which is crucial to achieving effective treatment.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the impact of priming effect and endowment effect,&#xD;
      concepts derived from psychology, on the behavior of children in mixed dentition period&#xD;
      during the dental injection. The moderating role of the psychological traits and demographics&#xD;
      of children will be investigated as well. The judgment on the children behaviors will be made&#xD;
      based on a well-established instrument which categorizes the behaviors into four levels. The&#xD;
      results will contribute to an interdisciplinary approach toward patient management and a&#xD;
      treatment plan that let practitioners manage their time more efficiently, and also increase&#xD;
      the chance of children's acceptable behaviors and cooperation during a dental visit and&#xD;
      attendance in follow-up sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management in pediatric dentistry is a matter of great importance as many children&#xD;
      may not be as cooperative as adults with their dentist when undergoing dental procedures.&#xD;
      Although there were developments in patient management in dentistry, particularly in the&#xD;
      pediatric field, an interdisciplinary approach is still lacking to cover all aspects of&#xD;
      behavioral management. Specifically, the findings derived from psychology and economics may&#xD;
      have the potential to be implemented in the medical field. That being said, the concepts such&#xD;
      as behavioral priming and endowment effect and constructs such as personality traits which&#xD;
      have led to promising results in cognitive and behavioral management have been scarcely&#xD;
      implemented in the medical field and dentistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conditioning or contingency reinforcement is one of the universally accepted techniques in&#xD;
      the behavioral management of children in dental clinics. The positive reinforcement is the&#xD;
      common approach for reinforcing the desired behaviors in children. Positive reinforcement&#xD;
      relies on promising children with positive social feedback (e.g., smile and praise) or&#xD;
      non-social token and rewards (e.g., badges and stickers). Although positive reinforcement was&#xD;
      reported to be successful, according to the concept of the endowment effect, other conditions&#xD;
      of providing awards to children may be even more efficient. The endowment effect, which is a&#xD;
      well-reported psychological phenomenon, states that people attribute more value to things&#xD;
      that they own and more inclined to retain them than obtaining the same object when they do&#xD;
      not possess it. Based on this concept, value is not absolute but perceptual in nature, and&#xD;
      perceived ownership would affect perceived value. The endowment effect is supported by the&#xD;
      loss aversion stating that losses have a stronger impact than gains. The asymmetry between&#xD;
      the impact of positive and negative expectations or experiences on oneself is traced back to&#xD;
      evolution. Organisms that had considered dangers as more important than opportunities had a&#xD;
      better chance of survival and reproduction. Providing a condition in which children can keep&#xD;
      the rewards after treatment only if they behave cooperatively may be more powerful&#xD;
      reinforcement than the traditional conditioning. Up to the authors' knowledge, except for&#xD;
      limited studies that applied the endowment effect in creating the health policies, it has not&#xD;
      been used in the medical field for behavioral management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Behavioral priming is referred to as the influence of different stimuli such as words,&#xD;
      sounds, smells, colors, and pictures on the various cognitive constructs and memory, which in&#xD;
      turn impact the behaviors. Overall, primes are classified into two categories based on how an&#xD;
      individual percept them, subliminal and conscious. That being said, the influence of both&#xD;
      types of primes is mostly outside one's awareness. Several studies in the past decades showed&#xD;
      that people can be induced to behave in certain ways such as acting socially or unsocially,&#xD;
      walking faster or slower, and being accurate or inaccurate as a result of priming outside of&#xD;
      their consciousness. Moreover, some new studies even used the effect of superhero priming on&#xD;
      social behaviors and found that exposing individuals to superhero images provokes prosocial&#xD;
      activity. Although the influence of the behavioral priming was documented in previous&#xD;
      studies, there are still disputes about the underlying mechanisms of the priming effect. The&#xD;
      traditional concept supports the enhanced accessibility to memory and psychological&#xD;
      constructs that active behaviors related to certain stereotypes. However, neglecting the&#xD;
      situational factors and other moderators led to failure in the replication of the effect of&#xD;
      primes in some recent studies. Therefore, the new approach toward behavioral priming states&#xD;
      that different situational factors play roles in making decisions and behaviors as well. The&#xD;
      new approach does not undermine the unconscious effect of the prime on behaviors but&#xD;
      emphasizes on considering the situational factors as well as the individuals' characteristics&#xD;
      in interpreting the effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the inductive effect of environmental forces and primes on behaviors, personality&#xD;
      traits can be reliable predictors of decisions and behaviors as well. Personality traits are&#xD;
      considered as a reference point and a moderator for different behaviors. This is true,&#xD;
      especially in uncertain situations, the presence of weak environmental forces, or extremity&#xD;
      of a person in a particular trait. Moreover, personality traits can have an impact on how&#xD;
      individuals infer and suffer from pain and consequently, the related behaviors. Some studies&#xD;
      reported a meaningful relationship between personality and pain perception. The five-factor&#xD;
      theory of personality (FFT): Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E), Openness (O), Agreeableness&#xD;
      (A) and Conscientiousness (C) is a model which takes into account the relationship between&#xD;
      personality and health. Furthermore, a recent systematic review found that despite the common&#xD;
      belief, the personality traits are not permanent and can be changed through experiences.&#xD;
      Therefore, assessing personality traits may not only have predictive value but may be&#xD;
      employed to help with the treatment procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to the authors' knowledge, no study has implemented the concept of endowment effect for&#xD;
      behavioral management in the medical or dental field. Besides that, the behavioral priming&#xD;
      has not been used in the dental field as well. The hypothesis is that implementing these two&#xD;
      concepts can help to improve pediatric patients' cooperation during dental injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the priming effect of superhero posters as stimuli on the behaviors of&#xD;
           pediatric patients during the dental injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the two scenarios of giving rewards to pediatric patients, i.e., before&#xD;
           starting the treatment (endowment effect) and after finishing the treatment (positive&#xD;
           reinforcement), in order to investigate their impact on children behaviors during the&#xD;
           dental injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate the moderating role of personality traits on the behaviors of pediatric&#xD;
           patients during dental injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To investigate the moderating effect of age, gender, and family income on the behaviors&#xD;
           of pediatric patients during dental injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed Methodology and Research Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in mixed dentition period will participate in this clinical trial. The&#xD;
      participants will be selected consecutively of patients refereeing to a specific dental&#xD;
      clinic. Before beginning the dental procedures or any interventions, all the parents' of&#xD;
      children will be asked to provide a consent form and if they agree and complete the form,&#xD;
      then they will be asked to fill out the short form of the hierarchical personality inventory&#xD;
      for children (HiPIC-30). The randomized block randomization method will be used to ensure the&#xD;
      equal sample size in each group based on the interventions. Half of the children will be&#xD;
      seeing images of the superheroes on the dental unit screen for five minutes while waiting for&#xD;
      the dental procedure to start. If the patient is a boy, images of three popular male&#xD;
      superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman will be shown. If the patient is a girl,&#xD;
      images of Wonder-woman, Batgirl, and Cat-woman will be shown. The other half of the patients&#xD;
      will see no images on the screen. Before starting the treatment procedure, children in each&#xD;
      group will again be subdivided into two other groups. One group will be given reward before&#xD;
      starting the procedure, but they will be told they only can keep the reward after the&#xD;
      treatment if they have a cooperative behavior during the dental procedure (endowment effect).&#xD;
      The reward will be put on a tray where the child can see it throughout the dental procedure.&#xD;
      The other group will not receive any reward at the beginning, but they will be told that they&#xD;
      will be given a reward if they cooperate during the dental procedure to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of positive reinforcement. Children are free to choose their reward, as it has been shown&#xD;
      gender, age, and cultural differences may affect the children choice. However, some small&#xD;
      toys of superheroes will be included among the awards to test whether seeing the images of&#xD;
      superheroes affect the award choice or not. To comply with the ethics, all children will&#xD;
      receive the reward after treatment irrespective of their behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children behavior (outcome measure) during the dental injection will be recorded and&#xD;
      scored later using Frankl's scale for general behavior by two examiners to prevent&#xD;
      subjectivity of measurement. The children recordings from the time of needle penetration&#xD;
      until taking out the needle will be scored. Frankl's scale helps to categorize the behavior&#xD;
      into four levels. To reduce the confounding effects, dentists who wear the same coat for&#xD;
      every dental visit will perform the dental examinations and procedures. Moreover, the dental&#xD;
      office where the examinations take place will be the same for all children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size will be calculated using GPower v3.1.9 software for the independent t-test.&#xD;
      Considering a medium to large effect size=0.6, α level=0.05, statistical power (1-β)=0.85,&#xD;
      the sample size of n=102 will be obtained. However, as the outcome measure is non-parametric,&#xD;
      an additional 4 samples will be recruited. Therefore, 106 participants will be needed for the&#xD;
      non-parametric test. However, considering 10% for drop-outs and missing data, the final&#xD;
      sample size will reach 117. The main effects of interventions i.e. priming effect and reward&#xD;
      system will be evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test. Moreover, using ordinal logistic&#xD;
      regression, the predictive value of the main variables and moderators for children's behavior&#xD;
      will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Outcomes and Expected Research Contribution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient management in pediatric dentistry is a matter of great importance to achieve a&#xD;
      successful and effective treatment. Injecting the children patients is one of the most&#xD;
      challenging steps for dentists which determine the cooperation of a child for the rest of the&#xD;
      treatment. The techniques proposed in this study are straightforward to apply in dental&#xD;
      settings with a minimum of the cost. We hope that the results of this interdisciplinary&#xD;
      approach be a step forward for future projects. The results will contribute to an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary approach toward patient management and a treatment plan that let&#xD;
      practitioners manage their time more efficiently, and also increase the chance of children's&#xD;
      acceptable behaviors and cooperation during a dental visit and attendance in follow-up&#xD;
      sessions.&#xD;
