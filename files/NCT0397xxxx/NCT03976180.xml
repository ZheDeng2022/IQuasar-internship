  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by recurrent vaso-occlusive pain crisis (VOC),&#xD;
      which may evolve to acute chest syndrome (ACS), the most common cause of death among adult&#xD;
      patients with SCD. Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment to abort VOC or&#xD;
      prevent secondary ACS. Management of VOC mostly involve a symptomatic approach including&#xD;
      hydration, analgesics, transfusion, and incentive spirometry, which was investigated in a&#xD;
      very limited number of patients (&lt;30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The polymerisation of HbS is one major feature in the pathogenesis of vaso-occlusion. Among&#xD;
      factors determining the rate and extent of HbS polymer formation, the hypoxic stimulus is one&#xD;
      of the most potent and readily alterable. Current guidelines recommend oxygen therapy in&#xD;
      patients with VOC in order to maintain a target oxygen saturation of 95%. Low-flow nasal&#xD;
      oxygen (LFNO) is routinely used to achieve this normoxia approach, particularly in patients&#xD;
      at risk of secondary ACS because they may experience acute desaturation. In contrast, various&#xD;
      case series suggest a potential beneficial role of intensified oxygen therapy targeting&#xD;
      hyperoxia for the management of VOC, particularly with the use of hyperbaric oxygen, but the&#xD;
      latter is difficult to implement in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) technology allows the delivery of humidified gas at&#xD;
      high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) through nasal cannula. The FiO2 can be adjusted up to&#xD;
      100% (allowing hyperoxia that may reverse sickling) and the flow can be increased up to 60&#xD;
      L/min (which generates positive airway pressure and dead space flushing, that may prevent&#xD;
      evolution of VOC towards ACS by alleviating atelectasis and opioid-induced hypercapnia). In&#xD;
      patients with acute respiratory failure, HFNO has been shown to improve patient's comfort,&#xD;
      oxygenation, and survival as compared to standard oxygen or non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to test the efficacy and safety of HFNO for the management of&#xD;
      VOC and prevention of secondary ACS. The investigators will use a multi-arm multi-stage&#xD;
      (MAMS) design to achieve these goals. HFNO will be delivered through AIRVO 2 (Fisher and&#xD;
      Paykel Healthcare, New Zealand), a device that incorporates a turbine allowing its use in&#xD;
      hospital wards.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a comparative randomized controlled superiority open-label multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) trial. The study will use a multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) trial design with three stages and four arms (one control arm and three intervention arms).&#xD;
&quot;Pilot&quot; stage: a formal safety/feasibility testing. Research arms will only continue to recruitment in the next stage if they have been shown to be both safe and feasible, although patient data from all patients and all stages will be included in the final analyses.&#xD;
&quot;Activity&quot; stage: an interim comparison of activity using the rate of VOC resolution without complication at day-5 as primary endpoint. At the end of this stage, an interim analysis will be used in order to select the most promising experimental treatment and compare it to control in the subsequent stage (&quot;pick the winner&quot; strategy).&#xD;
&quot;Efficacy&quot; stage: final comparison with secondary ACS at day-14 as the primary endpoint.</intervention_model_description>
