  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, 11 316 new cases of upper aero-digestive tract cancer were estimated in 2012.&#xD;
      These cancers are treated with a triple-therapy combining surgery, radiotherapy and&#xD;
      chemotherapy/targeted therapies. Treatment-induced sequelae are often burdensome: reduction&#xD;
      in mouth opening, eventually on to trismus, limitation of lips and tongue mobility,&#xD;
      deterioration in oral hygiene, pain due to inflammation and muscle fibrosis. Trismus is&#xD;
      defined as a mouth opening of less than 35mm in patients with head and neck cancers. It can&#xD;
      be induced by treatments (surgery or radiotherapy) but is also reported at the time of&#xD;
      diagnosis, due to the local evolution of the tumour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of trismus and its consequences is currently mostly based on physiotherapy of&#xD;
      maxillary constrictions in order to limit or decrease the reduction of mouth opening in these&#xD;
      patients. Exercise protocols have been set up and evaluated in the literature, but with&#xD;
      various results. The benefit of a physiotherapy intervention on trismus prevalence, mouth&#xD;
      opening, and patients' quality of life has not yet been shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that at least 30% of patients treated with radiochemotherapy are affected&#xD;
      by trismus. According to the nutrition national recommendations in oncology, patients the&#xD;
      most at-risk of loco-regional complications are those who receive radiotherapy doses of 54Gy&#xD;
      or more in the oropharynx and concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thus essential to provide these patients with an early and preventive management of&#xD;
      trismus and its consequences, during the whole duration of the treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of trismus and its side effects is essentially based on a re-education of&#xD;
      maxillary constrictions to limit or reduce the loss of mouth opening in patients. Exercise&#xD;
      protocols are in place and have been evaluated in the literature with discordant results. The&#xD;
      beneficial effect of a rehabilitation program on the prevalence of trismus, oral opening and&#xD;
      quality of life of patients is not yet clearly demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three studies did not show any significant beneficial effect of rehabilitation programs nor&#xD;
      on the prevalence of trismus or the quality of life of patients. A 2014 randomized trial&#xD;
      showed no benefit from a passive exercise program on trismus prevention and oral opening.&#xD;
      Another 2011 study compared 374 patients, a control group and an intervention group following&#xD;
      language mobility exercises, rehabilitation supervised by a physiotherapist and specific&#xD;
      trismus prevention exercises with the help of a doctor. specific tool (Jaw Trainer) during&#xD;
      and after radiotherapy. A third, more recent, randomized study evaluated the effect of a very&#xD;
      comprehensive rehabilitation program consisting of a 45-minute session per week of&#xD;
      rehabilitation with a physiotherapist, 7 exercises to be performed 5 times a day at home&#xD;
      supplemented by chewing. chewing gum 5 times a day. These last two studies nonetheless&#xD;
      concluded the importance of carrying out other work on the subject by working on the&#xD;
      objectives of the studies, on the tools used, and on the implementation of the exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, an other study cited above does not show a significant difference in mouth opening&#xD;
      between the two rehabilitation groups, but analyzes the adhesion and shows that it is&#xD;
      significantly higher (59 versus 41 days) in the standard rehabilitation group, less&#xD;
      burdensome for patients. Thus, the issue of patient adherence to active rehabilitation is&#xD;
      real and essential to take into account in studies assessing the effect of a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program on oral opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of trismus as well as its management in physiotherapy and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      a rehabilitation program are not clearly documented in France. Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      currently at least 30% of patients treated by radiochemotherapy are affected by a trismus.&#xD;
      According to national oncology nutrition guidelines, the patients most at risk for&#xD;
      locoregional complications are those who receive oropharyngeal ≥ 54 Gray radiotherapy doses,&#xD;
      plus concomitant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems essential to offer these patients early and preventive management of this symptom&#xD;
      and its consequences, throughout the duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is all the more relevant as the progress of treatment of upper aero-digestive&#xD;
      tract cancers have allowed an improvement in survival rates, with an increase in the number&#xD;
      of patients living with sequelae related to treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major benefit for patients will be a decrease in the loss of mouth opening during and&#xD;
      after treatment, with the consequent improvement of the criteria of well-being and quality of&#xD;
      life: the resumption of a normal diet, a decrease the duration of artificial nutrition,&#xD;
      better oral hygiene, improved speech and the recovery of mimicry. All this in order to&#xD;
      accelerate the return to the most normal social and professional life possible.&#xD;
