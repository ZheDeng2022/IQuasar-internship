      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of two different doses of&#xD;
      ANS-6637, 200 mg (given as 2 x 100 mg tablet) and 600 mg (given as 2 x 300 mg tablet) once a&#xD;
      day, and matched placebo, on alcohol cue-elicited alcohol craving during a human laboratory&#xD;
      paradigm after 1 week of daily dosing among subjects with moderate to severe alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) as confirmed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -&#xD;
      Fifth Edition (DSM-5™).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a 3-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 3-site study designed to assess the effects of ANS-6637 as compared with placebo on responses to in vivo alcohol cue exposure in the human laboratory setting.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in the &quot;strength&quot; of alcohol craving Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score in response to an alcohol cue minus the alcohol craving VAS score in response to a water cue during the alcohol cue reactivity session at Week 2 - after one week of investigational product treatment. The VAS has a minimum=0 and maximum=20 with higher values indicative of greater craving for alcohol.</description>
