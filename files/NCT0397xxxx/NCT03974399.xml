  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known neurotrophic factor important for&#xD;
      learning, memory, and synaptogenesis. Healthy activities such as exercise are believed to&#xD;
      raise BDNF, while stress is associated with lower BDNF. What is not well understood is if&#xD;
      there are certain supplements that may raise BDNF over time. Bacopa monnieri is well&#xD;
      characterized nutraceutical. Animal and pre-clinical data support multiple beneficial&#xD;
      mechanisms, including raising BDNF and increasing synaptogenesis. Additionally, small studies&#xD;
      have shown Bacopa enhances cognition and improves mood. We would like to investigate if BDNF&#xD;
      level changes in people after starting Bacopa.&#xD;

      This is a single site two-visit, 12-week, open label, trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and potential effects of Bacopa on BDNF, MoCA and GDS. Potentially eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be invited to screening (Visit 1) at the study site. Subjects will sign an&#xD;
      informed consent followed by collection of medical history and history of current&#xD;
      medications, have their height, weight, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature)&#xD;
      measured, complete study assessments (MoCA , BDS and LEC) Routine clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
      (hematology and chemistry) will be performed. Blood samples will be taken for analysis of&#xD;
      BDNF and genetics (APOE, BDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to orally self-administer the provided supplement (Bacopa)&#xD;
      preferably with food with no dietary restrictions once a day in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be contacted by phone at 1 week (+/- 3 days) to be reminded to go to two pills&#xD;
      per day, 1 month (+/-1 week) to check on compliance or any AE's and 2 months (+/- 1 week) to&#xD;
      report any Adverse events for review by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the study site for Visit 2 at the end of 12 weeks (+/- 1 week). Study&#xD;
      staff will question subjects about any changes in the subject's health since the first visit.&#xD;
      They will be asked about their exercise activity and if there have been any changes to their&#xD;
      LEC-5. Subjects will have their weight and vital signs measured. Routine clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests (hematology and chemistry) will be performed, and blood samples will be saved for&#xD;
      analysis of Bacopa and other biomarkers&#xD;
