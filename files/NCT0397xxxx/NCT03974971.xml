  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), with a synonym of blastic NK-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma, agranular CD4+ natural killer cell leukaemia, blastic natural killer&#xD;
      leukaemia/lymphoma, and agranular CD4+CD56+ haematodermic neoplasm/tumour, has been&#xD;
      classified under &quot;acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related precursor neoplasms&quot; since 2008&#xD;
      according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and among &quot;myeloid neoplasm&#xD;
      and acute leukemia&quot; following 2016 revision of WHO classification. The plasmacytoid dendritic&#xD;
      cells originates professional type I interferon-producing cells or plasmacytoid monocytes.&#xD;
      Therefore, the prerequisite for diagnosis of BPDCN is the CD4+ and CD 56+ co-expression&#xD;
      without common lymphoid or myeloid lineage markers1,2. This rare type of malignancy affecting&#xD;
      predominantly elderly man, is reported to comprise 0.44% of hematologic malignancy3 and 0.7%&#xD;
      of cutaneous lymphomas4, and the leukemic presentation or transformation is observed at&#xD;
      initial presentation or even in the course of disease progression5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin in¬volvement is a predominant clinical feature of BPDCN ranging in appearance from small&#xD;
      bruise-like areas to patches, nodules, and ulcerated masses, but lymphadenopathy,&#xD;
      splenomegaly, hepatomegaly are also commonly observed. There is no definite treatment&#xD;
      guideline for BPDCN. Retrospective studies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoma-like chemotherapy for management of BPDCN reported&#xD;
      53-89% of high complete remission rates but an eventual very poor overall survival of 12-23&#xD;
      months, with a preponderance of ALL/lymphoma- over AML-like treatment5. Recently, targeted&#xD;
      therapy with SL401, an IL-3 fusion protein which binds to CD123, is promising and the results&#xD;
      of the clinical trial will be unveiled in the near future6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several retrospective and small case series has been published so far7,8, there is&#xD;
      still no multicenter study on BPDCN classified after 2008 WHO classification in Asian&#xD;
      population. This study aims to retrospectively collect data of BPDCN patients from centers&#xD;
      participating the Consortium for improving survival of lymphoma (CISL) and analyze the&#xD;
      clinical features and treatment outcomes in this rare type of hematologic malignancy.&#xD;

        This study is a retrospective study, in which patients with patients diagnosed with SCC&#xD;
        tumors can participate, and patients who meet the selection criteria will be eligible. The&#xD;
        purpose of this study is explorative and descriptive, and it is impossible to calculate the&#xD;
        statistical background. Therefore, it is estimated that more than 40 patients are diagnosed&#xD;
        with the disease in Korea so far.&#xD;
