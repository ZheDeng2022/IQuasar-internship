  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are great disparities in the prevalence of obesity and chronic disease in different&#xD;
      sociodemographic groups. US Hispanic adults, in particular, have a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      obesity and chronic diseases than non-Hispanic whites. Population aging is also a major&#xD;
      contributing factor to the high prevalence of chronic disease, and Hispanics already make up&#xD;
      approximately 10% of the older population. Therefore, preventive measures are needed to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of chronic disease risks for Hispanics. Current lifestyle interventions for&#xD;
      weight management have been particularly ineffective in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot project is to develop a novel tailored lifestyle intervention for&#xD;
      use by Hispanic older adults with obesity. The Healthy Weight for Living intervention has&#xD;
      been validated among adults with mixed racial/ethnic backgrounds and has achieved clinically&#xD;
      impactful weight-loss. Its design features make it particularly suitable for use in&#xD;
      populations with low adherence to traditional interventions, including no requirement for&#xD;
      daily food logging and no increase in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final product of this project will be a culturally adapted prototype intervention in&#xD;
      Hispanic older adults that accounts for cultural heterogeneity. This work has direct&#xD;
      relevance to reducing health disparities and the burden of obesity-associated chronic disease&#xD;
      in a particularly at-risk population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific premise of this project is that appropriately tailored lifestyle interventions&#xD;
      for weight loss can achieve clinically impactful weight loss in Hispanic adults with obesity.&#xD;
      Older adults will be the focus, recognizing that requirements for tailoring may vary&#xD;
      according to age group. Given that older adults have a higher risk of chronic diseases caused&#xD;
      by obesity, there is a great need to focus on factors that disproportionately affect older&#xD;
      Hispanic adults. The objective of this project is to tailor a validated lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention developed and used by our team in ethnically mixed populations to older Hispanic&#xD;
      adults with obesity. This novel intervention does not require food logging or a large&#xD;
      increase in physical activity to achieve weight loss, making it more acceptable to population&#xD;
      groups with low adherence to traditional interventions. The long-term goal of this work is to&#xD;
      create an effective, culturally acceptable, sustainable, and scalable lifestyle weight&#xD;
      management program for routine use in Hispanic adults with obesity. Findings from this work&#xD;
      will be directly applicable to future community interventions and will be relevant for public&#xD;
      health measures in this at-risk population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To conduct focus groups in Hispanic older adults with obesity to identify factors that&#xD;
      can be addressed in the tailored intervention. Information will be collected on practical and&#xD;
      cultural barriers and promoters of successful weight management, including food access,&#xD;
      dietary patterns, physical activity, time and financial constraints, and additional&#xD;
      psychosocial and cultural factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Malleable dietary and psychosocial targets for weight loss and weight loss&#xD;
      maintenance can be identified, including factors such as food cravings, hunger and&#xD;
      disinhibited eating that have been shown to be effective targets in other population groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To conduct a pilot behavioral intervention of an initially adapted program in Hispanic&#xD;
      older adults with obesity. A prototype bilingual English-Spanish lifestyle intervention for&#xD;
      weight reduction will be created. The prototype will then be iteratively refined during a&#xD;
      series of short-term tests (two tests lasting 4 weeks, followed by a final test lasting 12&#xD;
      weeks) of intervention delivery. In these interventions, % weight loss, % drop-out, and&#xD;
      safety benchmarks will be monitored. Participant-reported barriers to adherence identified&#xD;
      during group meetings and exit interviews will be targets for improvement in successive&#xD;
      iterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Successive refinement of the program will result in progressive improvements in&#xD;
      mean % weight loss and participant retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final products of this project will be: a) a prototype adapted intervention in older US&#xD;
      adults of Hispanic background, accounting for cultural heterogeneity in this population; and&#xD;
      b) identification of additional barriers that can be addressed in subsequent iterations of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Healthy Weight for Living for Hispanics</intervention_name>
    <description>The Healthy Weight for Living (HWL) intervention, previously developed at the Energy Metabolism Laboratory (HNRCA), is broadly informed by the same behavior change theories as other interventions. For example, it also recognizes individual and environmental factors as potential areas to support behavior change for weight regulation, and provides practical tools for facilitating new habits. However, the HWL places greater emphasis on the role of biology in influencing eating behavior, giving a central role to hunger and food cravings as modulators of eating behavior. Therefore, HWL does not emphasize self-monitoring food intake and does not require increasing physical activity for effectiveness. The new intervention also targets autonomous motivation and prioritizes ease of implementation.&#xD;
Information from focus groups and sequential pilots will be used to develop a culturally tailored prototype version of Healthy Weight for Living that is acceptable for Hispanic older adults.</description>
