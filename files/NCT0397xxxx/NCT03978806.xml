  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latinos with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) represent 17% of the US adult ESRD community and&#xD;
      suffer a disproportionate burden of social challenges that impacts their well-being. With&#xD;
      support from the Amos award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the investigators&#xD;
      assessed the feasibility of a 1-arm intervention of a 5-visit lay Peer Navigator intervention&#xD;
      to support Latino ESRD patients with social challenges and adherence (using motivational&#xD;
      interviewing &amp; patient activation). This trial will build on the Amos work as a small RCT.&#xD;
      The overall aims of this proposal are to: 1) engage key operational and clinical stakeholders&#xD;
      early-on to develop a Peer Navigator-intervention; 2) conduct a pilot RCT of the peer&#xD;
      navigator intervention versus standard care to test feasibility and acceptability; and 3)&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of the intervention on interdialytic weight gain (primary outcome) as&#xD;
      well as health-related quality of life, patient activation, and hemodialysis adherence&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot RCT of a&#xD;
      culturally tailored peer-navigator (PN) intervention to improve patient-centered and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes for Latino patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We will compare a&#xD;
      culturally tailored intervention that includes a PN to control (standard care). In the&#xD;
      culturally tailored intervention, the bilingual PN will provide support with social&#xD;
      challenges during 5 visits. We will assess the feasibility of (1) referral, (2) recruitment,&#xD;
      (3) retention, (4) intervention implementation, and (5) data collection. We will also assess&#xD;
      various outcomes including inter-dialytic weight gain and other adherence and&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Conduct a pilot RCT of the peer navigator intervention to assess feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, as well as outcomes of the proposed peer navigator intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A culturally tailored intervention that consists of a&#xD;
      bilingual/culture-concordant peer navigator that provides support with social challenges for&#xD;
      Latino end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients, is feasible and acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: A culturally tailored intervention using a bilingual PN who provides support with&#xD;
      social factors and a bilingual LCSW who provides CCBT for depressed LEP Latino ESRD patients&#xD;
      is feasible and acceptable.&#xD;

    <description>The first PN visit will take place within 1-2 weeks of consent. Each of the 5 subsequent PN visits will take place every 1-2 weeks. We expect patients to complete the intervention within 2-3 months of consent. The function of the initial visit is to establish trust and ensure a more personal approach with participants. The community-based PN intervention is grounded in core Latino values (e.g. trust, personalized relationships). The core elements of the PN intervention include patient motivational interviewing as well as patient activation, empowerment (e.g. help with scheduling of healthcare appointments and re-scheduling of missed HD sessions), education (e.g. education of ESKD and need for renal replacement therapy), and social challenges (e.g. access to resources for transportation, benefits, immigration issues). The duration, individuals present during the visit, and content discussed will be documented in the visit form.</description>
