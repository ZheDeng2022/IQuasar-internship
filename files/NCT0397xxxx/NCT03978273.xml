  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a progressive three-dimensional deformation of the spine during growth, with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 80% in girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments currently used are surgery and rigid brace, which aim to stabilize scoliosis&#xD;
      evolution. The place of rehabilitation is disputed because the methods are multiple,&#xD;
      non-standardized and the sessions are infrequent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study (MOUVSCO, NTC02134704), researchers have identified systematic postural&#xD;
      abnormalities in patients with scoliosis, and developped a virtual-brace (medical device, MD)&#xD;
      to allow real-time self-correction of the trunk position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate for the first time the efficacy of the&#xD;
      virtual-brace on the correction of the posture of scoliotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that intensified rehabilitation with the virtual-brace will improve&#xD;
      pathological postures related to scoliosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is the first evaluation of the efficacy of the virtual-brace on scoliotic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of rehabilitation will be estimate on the correction of the posture of scoliosis&#xD;
      patients over 6 months by comparing 2 groups: a control group of patients conventionally&#xD;
      treated with a night-time brace (G0 group_conventional) and an experimental group of patients&#xD;
      wearing a night-time brace, doing postural rehabilitation exercises with the virtual brace&#xD;
      and follow-up visits with a physiotherapist (G1 group_virtual-brace).&#xD;
