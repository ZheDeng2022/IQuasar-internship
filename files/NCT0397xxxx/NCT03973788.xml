  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common reason for which patients are treated with opioids.&#xD;
      Because the misuse of prescription opioids has become a serious problem in the Uinted States,&#xD;
      finding effective alternative non-pharmaceutical interventions for chronic pain management&#xD;
      has become an urgent matter. A phenomenon termed central sensitization (i.e. mal-adaption of&#xD;
      the brain) has been hypothesized to be an underlying mechanism for the development of chronic&#xD;
      pain, leading to sensory hypersensitivity to extremal stimuli. Therefore, non-invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) may be an effective&#xD;
      intervention to regulate brain excitability, thus reducing chronic pain. However, research&#xD;
      has shown inconclusive evidence regarding the rTMS effects on chronic pain reduction, partly&#xD;
      due to the heterogeneity of participants in studies to date. Therefore, the primary purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the immediate and short-term effects of rTMS on neurosensory&#xD;
      changes (i.e., pain thresholds) in patients with CLBP. The secondary purpuse of the study is&#xD;
      to explore the relationship between changes of cortical excitability (TMS parameters) and&#xD;
      changes of pain thresholds after the rTMS intervention in patients with CLBP.&#xD;

      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pre- and post-test research design will be used to examine the immediate and one-week&#xD;
      carry-over effects of a single-session of rTMS intervention on individuals with CLBP. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measures, including PPT, cold pain threshold (CPT), heat pain threshold&#xD;
      (HPT), and heat-generated temporal summation (TS), will be collected three times: before the&#xD;
      rTMS intervention, immediately after the intervention, and one week after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are adults 18 years of age or older and who have had LBP for more than&#xD;
      6 months. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chronic pain is&#xD;
      defined as pain lasts more than 3 months or past the time of normal tissue healing. In order&#xD;
      to ensure the development of central sensitization in the investigator's participants, only&#xD;
      individuals with LBP for more than 6 months will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded from the study if they have previous low back surgery, systemic&#xD;
      joint disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis), evidence of red flags (e.g. fracture, infection,&#xD;
      tumor, cauda equina syndrome), cancer, neurological disorders, neuropathy, Raynaud's Disease&#xD;
      or pregnancy, and inability to maintain the testing and treatment positions (i.e. sitting,&#xD;
      supine hook-lying and prone-lying) for 15 minutes at a time. Additional exclusion criteria&#xD;
      for the rTMS intervention include: 1) history of significant head trauma, 2) electrical,&#xD;
      magnetic, or mechanical implantation (e.g. cardiac pacemakers or intracerebral vascular&#xD;
      clip), 3) metal implantation in the head and neck areas, 4) history of seizures or&#xD;
      unexplained loss of consciousness, 5) immediate family member with epilepsy, 6) use of&#xD;
      seizure threshold lowering medicine, 7) current abuse of alcohol or drugs, and 8) history of&#xD;
      psychiatric illness requiring medication controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the participant is enrolled the study, the participant will be asked to complete an&#xD;
      intake form, collecting their demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, occupation, hand&#xD;
      dominance), past medical history, and questions related to their low back pain (onset, injury&#xD;
      mechanism if any, location, duration, type, and nature). In addition, 4 self-reported&#xD;
      questionnaires will be collected from all of the participants before the rTMS treatment,&#xD;
      including pain intensity determined using the NPRS, disability determined using the Modified&#xD;
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire quality of life determined by the&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® - short form (PROMIS-29), and&#xD;
      severity of central sensitization determined by the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI ).&#xD;
      These questionnaires are commonly used in research studies of chronic pain or CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain Threshold Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will undergo a battery of tests to determine their sensory thresholds,&#xD;
           including pressure, cold and heat pain thresholds and heat-generated temporal summation&#xD;
           (TS). The pain thresholds and TS will be measured from three sites: the most painful&#xD;
           point of low back, as well as the web space (WS) and the tibialis anterior (TA) of the&#xD;
           painful side. Those who report no pain difference between the right and left low back,&#xD;
           pain thresholds will be measured from the right side. The TA testing site will be in the&#xD;
           muscle belly of the TA, approximately 2.5 cm lateral and 5 cm inferior to the tibial&#xD;
           tubercle. The WS and TA sites were chosen because they are the most commonly selected&#xD;
           sites in research studies for chronic pain. In addition, the first interosseous index&#xD;
           (FDI) is located in the WS, where is the target site for the TMS assessment and&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pressure pain threshold (PPT) testing: A hand-held computerized pressure algometer&#xD;
           (Medoc ltd., Ramat Yishai, Israel) will be used to measure the PPTs. The algometer&#xD;
           consists of a 1-sqaure centermeter round tip which will be pressed vertically on the&#xD;
           target location of the muscle. To provoke the patient's pain or discomfort, pressure&#xD;
           will be increased at a rate of 40 kPa/sec until the participant feels pain as indicated&#xD;
           by pressing a patient safety unit. The limit of pressure threshold will be set at 800&#xD;
           kPa, meaning that a pressure exceeding 800 kPa will be cut off to minimize tissue&#xD;
           damage. If the participant does not push the button at 800 kPa, a value of 800 is used&#xD;
           as the threshold value. Three trials of PPT testing will be administered to each testing&#xD;
           site, and the average of the three trials will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cold and heat pain threshold testing: A Medoc TSA II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc ltd.,&#xD;
           Ramat Yishai, Israel) will be used to measure heat and cold pain thresholds. All thermal&#xD;
           pain threshold tests will be obtained with ramped stimuli (0°5 C/s) which can be&#xD;
           terminated when the participant presses a safety button. Cut-off temperatures will be&#xD;
           set 0 and 52°C, and the baseline temperature will be set at 32°C (i.e., average skin&#xD;
           temperature). The contact area of the thermode is 23mmx30mm. All thermal pain threshold&#xD;
           tests will be demonstrated first at an area somewhere other than the three testing&#xD;
           sites. Three trials of thermal pain threshold tests will be administered per testing&#xD;
           site and the average of the three trials will be used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Heat-generated temporal summation (TS) testing: The instrument used for measuring cold&#xD;
           and heat pain thresholds will be used for the heat-generated TS test. During TS testing,&#xD;
           10 consecutive heat pulses of 0.5 sec duration will be delivered at an inter-stimulus&#xD;
           interval of 2.5 sec. The temperature of the heat stimuli will increase from 40°C as a&#xD;
           baseline temperature and inter-stimulus temperature, to 48°C at a rate of 8°C/sec.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to rate their pain intensity of each heat pulse on the NPRS&#xD;
           of 0-100 (0 being no pain, 100 being unbearable pain). The TS score will be calculated&#xD;
           by averaging the pain rating for the 10th stimulus and the 5th stimulus minus the 1st&#xD;
           pain rating, with higher score indicating greater hypersensitivity of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cortical Excitability Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           A series of single pulse generated from a TMS machine (Rapid2, Magstim Co., UK) will be&#xD;
           used to determine corticospinal excitability. Because the rTMS intervention will target&#xD;
           the M1 area, specifically in the area corresponding to the FDI muscle, motor evoked&#xD;
           potentials (MEPs), namely electromyographic (EMG) activity, will be recorded from the&#xD;
           FDI muscle to determine the &quot;hot spot&quot; for the rTMS intervention. A hot spot is defined&#xD;
           as the site at which the largest MEP amplitude is obtained at the lowest TMS stimulation&#xD;
           intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, a pair of surface EMG electrodes will be placed on the FDI muscle when the&#xD;
           participant is seated on a reclining chair and wearing a pair of earplugs to reduce&#xD;
           their awareness of noise from the rTMS equipment. Similar to the pain threshold testing&#xD;
           on the low back, EMG activity will be measured from FDI muscle on the same side of the&#xD;
           patient as the LBP. For those who report no difference in LBP between sides, EMG data&#xD;
           will be recorded from the FDI of the right hand. The Mega 600 EMG machine (Mega&#xD;
           Electronics Ltd., Finland) will be used to collect EMG data at a sampling rate of&#xD;
           2,000Hz and bandpass-filtered at 15-500Hz. During the cortical excitability assessment,&#xD;
           each participant will wear a Lycra swimming cap with a pre-marked grid. The intensity of&#xD;
           TMS will begin at 40% of maximum stimulator output and then will be increased gradually&#xD;
           to yield a MEP from the FDI until a 'hot spot' is observed. Next, the resting motor&#xD;
           threshold (RMT) will be defined. RMT is the stimulation intensity which yields a&#xD;
           peak-to-peak amplitude of MEP larger than 50 μV in 5 out of 10 consecutive trials. Once&#xD;
           the RMT is determined, the stimulation intensity will be set at 120% of RMT and 10&#xD;
           stimulations will be delivered to the hot-spot. The 10 supra-threshold MEP amplitudes&#xD;
           recorded from the FDI will be averaged and the average will be used for the&#xD;
           representation of corticospinal excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. rTMS Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the corticospinal excitability assessment, participants will receive 10Hz rTMS&#xD;
      delivered to the hot-spot contralateral to the painful side in the form of twenty 10-second&#xD;
      pulse trains (a total of 2,000 pulses) with a 50-second inter-train interval. The rTMS will&#xD;
      be delivered via an air-filled coil (see figure to the right). The stimulation intensity will&#xD;
      be set at 90% of RMT. After the rTMS intervention, the participant's corticospinal&#xD;
      excitability will be re-assessed using the single-pulse TMS method as described earlier.&#xD;
