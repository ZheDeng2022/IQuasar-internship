  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, taking stable angina pectoris as a research carrier, aims to explore the&#xD;
      preventive value of acupoint sensitization by conducting a double-blind multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of stimulating acupoints with different&#xD;
      sensitivity on the prevention of angina pectoris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the inclusion of eligible patients, the pressure-pain threshold of disease-related&#xD;
      acupoints will be detected by using Von Frey detector. Then, the patients will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into experimental group and control group. The patients in experimental group will be&#xD;
      given acupoints pressure on the five acupoints with the lowest pressure-pain threshold, while&#xD;
      the patients in control group will be given acupoints pressure on the five acupoints with the&#xD;
      five acupoints with the highest pressure-pain threshold. The two groups will be treated with&#xD;
      acupoints pressure 12 times within 4 weeks. The patients will be evaluated three times at&#xD;
      baseline, the end of treatment and four weeks after the end of treatment respectively,&#xD;
      including angina attack frequency, CCS classification and SAQ score.&#xD;
