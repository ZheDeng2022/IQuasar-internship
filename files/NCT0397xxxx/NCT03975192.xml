      This is a prospective pilot study to investigate the effects of Percutaneous Electrical Nerve&#xD;
      Field Stimulation (PENFS) on symptoms of opioid withdrawal in pediatric patients in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, unblinded, randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      the BRIDGE device when used on patients at high risk of opioid withdrawal following opioid&#xD;
      exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator team hypothesized that treatment of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)&#xD;
      patients (ages 5-17 years) with PENFS will prevent the development of opioid withdrawal&#xD;
      symptoms, reduce the need for long-acting opioid agonists or pharmacological rescue agents to&#xD;
      treat withdrawal, and decrease overall PICU length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Withdrawal, using the Withdrawal Assessment Tool (WAT-I) is less for those using PENFS&#xD;
      device than for those receiving standard of care (SOC) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The WAT-I will be lower in the PENFS group than the SOC group and this will be true, even&#xD;
      after adjusting for age and total opioid dose/kg pre-weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: For withdrawal symptoms of nausea, vomiting or pain, those receiving PENFS compared to&#xD;
      SOC will require less treatment for these symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: The PENFS groups compared to the SOC will have primarily fewer episodes of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal distress and lower pain scores resulting in the use of fewer doses of rescue&#xD;
      medications; further this will be true after adjusting for total opioid dose/kg pre- weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: PICU LOS will be less for those receiving the PENFS device compared to those receiving&#xD;
      SOC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Following the initiation of weaning, the PICU LOS will be less for those with PENFS than&#xD;
      those with SOC. This will be true after adjusting for age and total opioid dose/kg&#xD;
      pre-weaning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used to determine eligibility for this&#xD;
      study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children aged 5 to 17 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to PICU at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin (CHW)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure to at least 120 hours of continuous IV opioid administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age children &lt;5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known central nervous system injury (hypoxic ischemic injury, traumatic brain injury,&#xD;
           postoperative craniotomies),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Plan to wean benzodiazepine dosing during the active study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are developmentally delayed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defined as inappropriately non-verbal for age and determined through review of the&#xD;
           medical record and discussion with the PICU attending and consulting team members.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any pregnancy testing done during the subject's hospitalization will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (This will only be monitored if required as SOC, but will not be collected for the purpose of&#xD;
      the study alone.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known seizure disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known diagnosis of psoriasis or significant dermatological disease involving ear (?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with implantable devices (cardiac pacemaker, vagal nerve stimulator, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, and prior to the initiation of opiate withdrawal initiation, subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive the local standard methadone wean or placement of the BRIDGE device.&#xD;
      Randomization will be used to balance age (5-9 yrs., &gt;9 yrs.) and gender (male, female)&#xD;
      assigning subjects in a 1:1 ratio to the Bridge device or control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the treatment group will have the device placed immediately following their last&#xD;
      scheduled opiate dose. The device will be active continuously for 120 hours from the time of&#xD;
      placement. As needed (PRN) dosing of pain medication will be available for breakthrough&#xD;
      symptoms experienced by the subject. Subjects randomized to the SOC group will begin SOC&#xD;
      treatment per the PICU withdrawal protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BRIDGE device will be placed per manufacturer protocol. Electrodes will be placed&#xD;
      percutaneously in the external ear with the help of a transilluminator to visualize the&#xD;
      neurovascular bundles; three electrodes will be placed on the ventral and one on the dorsal&#xD;
      aspect of the ear. The electrodes will be taped and secured behind the ear next to the&#xD;
      generator itself which is secured to the skin with adhesive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electrode/needle arrays are placed according to the individual's distribution of&#xD;
      neurovascular bundles. The exact location of the placement will vary slightly from person to&#xD;
      person and is determined by both knowledge of auricular neuro-anatomy and visualization of&#xD;
      the neurovascular bundles by transillumination (IHS, Versailles, IN, USA). The points will be&#xD;
      targeted by four-point electrical stimulation using the BRIDGE device after carefully&#xD;
      disinfecting the ear. The contents of the Neurostimulation will be delivered below sensation&#xD;
      threshold for 5 consecutive days (120 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of the device will be done by a member of the study team if the patient is still&#xD;
      admitted to CHW, or by the subject's parents if discharge takes place prior to the completion&#xD;
      of the PENFS treatment. The device will be placed in a sharps discard container after&#xD;
      removal. Subjects who will be discharged with the device will be provided with a sharps&#xD;
      disposal bag that can be used to hold the device after removal. This bag can be discarded in&#xD;
      any sharps container accessible to the subject or brought back to CHW and discarded the time&#xD;
      of their next follow up appointment. If the subject's family is not comfortable removing the&#xD;
      device at home the study team will make arrangements for the family to return to CHW for&#xD;
      device removal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient in the PENFS group is experiencing significant breakthrough withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      (consistent WAT-I score of &gt;4) for more than 48 hours, the PI and care team will meet to&#xD;
      discuss whether scores are due to withdrawal symptoms or are being artificially inflated due&#xD;
      to confounding factors. If the patient is determined to be experiencing significant symptoms&#xD;
      of withdrawal, the device will be removed early, and the subject will be transitioned to SOC&#xD;
      withdrawal treatment. At that point the patient will be considered to have withdrawn from&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
