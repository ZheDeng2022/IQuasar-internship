  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open label, randomized, 3 treatment arms, with and without food&#xD;
      dosing, Phase 1b pharmacology study to assess the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      and Pharmacodynamics (PD) of Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) agonist/modulator EYP001a in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 16 participants (4 healthy volunteers and 12 NASH patients) will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 1: Dose A once daily morning dose (n=4 NASH patients, n=4 healthy&#xD;
           volunteers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 2: Dose B once daily morning dose (n=4 NASH patients)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 3: Dose C twice daily - first morning dose and second dose 3 hours post&#xD;
           first dose (n=4 NASH patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, all the enrolled participants (both healthy volunteers and NASH patients) will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of the 2 parallel study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A (n=8, 2 healthy volunteers and 6 NASH patients): This group will include 2 NASH&#xD;
           patients from Treatment Arms 1, 2 and 3 and 2 healthy volunteers from Treatment Arm 1.&#xD;
           Participants in Group A will be dosed in a fasted state on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 followed&#xD;
           by dosing in fed state on Days 6, 7, 8 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B (n=8, 2 healthy volunteers and 6 NASH patients): This group will include 2 NASH&#xD;
           patients from Treatment Arms 1, 2 and 3 and 2 healthy volunteers from Treatment Arm 1.&#xD;
           Participants in Group B will be dosed in a fed state on Days 2, 3, 4 and 5 followed by&#xD;
           dosing in fasted state on Days 6, 7, 8 and 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum total engagement duration for eligible participants in this study is up to 76&#xD;
      days: 60 days screening, 1-day admission visit and 8 days dosing period (in-patient in&#xD;
      clinical trial unit) and 7 days follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who are eligible for enrolment will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit&#xD;
      on Day 1. The participants will receive EYP001a at the study site by trained personnel per&#xD;
      the schedule of dosing for the study from Day 2 to Day 9 in fed/fasted state depending upon&#xD;
      the study group. Participants will be discharged on the morning (8:00 AM) of Day 10 after&#xD;
      collection of last PK and PD blood samples. Participants will return to the Clinical Trial&#xD;
      Unit on Day 16 for the follow-up visit.&#xD;
