  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to develop a new approach for the treatment of fasting induced hypoglycemia&#xD;
      during ramadan using mini-dose glucagon.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to understand whether subcutaneously-given mini-dose glucagon (MDG) as an&#xD;
      alternative to carbohydrate consumption could avert hypoglycemia or treat it effectively in&#xD;
      type 1 diabetes patients who choose to fast during Ramadan in observance of their faith. This&#xD;
      treatment method could also avert any negative psychological emotions Muslim people with&#xD;
      diabetes may experience by ingesting carbohydrates to control hypoglycemia, thereby breaking&#xD;
      their fast. Furthermore, it could improve ability to self-manage fasting, which is an&#xD;
      important action for their spiritual and overall wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two phases included in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-crossover Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before starting the crossover trial, a pre-crossover phase will conduct to evaluate&#xD;
           hypoglycemia eligibility, frequency and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Crossover Trial Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Crossover Trial Phase will include 20 participants and consist of two (2-weeks) periods.&#xD;
      Participants who don't develop any hypoglycemic event or failed to complete both periods will&#xD;
      be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group A in periods one will use MDG and glucose tablets in period two according to the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group B in periods one will use glucose tablets and MDG in period two according to the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the number of treated fasting induced hypoglycemic events.&#xD;
