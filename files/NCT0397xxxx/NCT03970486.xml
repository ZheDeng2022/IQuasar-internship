  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although dry-needling with or without manipulation has shown to be a useful technique to&#xD;
      reduce pain in patients with low back pain (LBP), it is unclear which of these two&#xD;
      dry-needling techniques would have a greater effect on the lumboscaral multifidus (LM) muscle&#xD;
      activation, which is essential in LBP rehabilitation. Therefore, the purposes of the study&#xD;
      are: 1) to investigate whether or not dry-needling would change muscle activity of the LM&#xD;
      muscles in asymptomatic healthy adults and in individuals with LBP, respectively, and 2) to&#xD;
      compare the effects of two dry-needling techniques on LM muscle activation and pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold (PPT) in asymptomatic healthy adults and individuals with LBP, respectively.&#xD;

      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from local communities, including but not limited to Texas&#xD;
      Woman's University (TWU) via flyers. The flyers will be posted at the TWU - Dallas campus,&#xD;
      and Texas Physical Therapy Specialist - Dallas where one of the principal investigators, Zach&#xD;
      Couch, works, and other community centers with approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are interested in taking part in the study will be asked to call the&#xD;
      investigators to schedule an appointment. The consent form will be presented at the beginning&#xD;
      of the appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are English-speaking adults and are 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
      Additional criteria for asymptomatic healthy adults include no existing LBP and no LBP in the&#xD;
      past 6 months. Additional criteria for symptomatic participants include existing LBP near the&#xD;
      L5-S2 level with an average pain intensity score ≥ 2/10 in the past 24 hours (numeric pain&#xD;
      rating scale of 0-10, 0 being no pain, 10 being unbearable pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for all participants include bleeding disorders (e.g. hemophilia), use of&#xD;
      anti-coagulants (e.g. Coumadin), previous low back surgery, systemic joint disease (e.g.&#xD;
      rheumatoid arthritis), cancer of the lower quadrant, neurological disorders, allergic&#xD;
      reaction to adhesive tape, or inability to obtain the testing position (prone lying).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Electromyographic (EMG) activity A Delsys EMG system with 2 wireless surface electrodes&#xD;
           (Delsys Inc., Natick, MA) will be used to obtain muscle activities of the LM, one at the&#xD;
           L5 level, and the other at the S2 level. The bandwidth of the EMG system will be set at&#xD;
           20 to 450 Hz with a gain of 1,000. The EMG signal will be recorded at a sampling rate of&#xD;
           2,000 Hz. Each surface electrode has a built-in reference electrode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) A hand-held computerized pressure algometer (Medoc ltd.,&#xD;
           Ramat Yishai, Israel) will be used to determine the PPT on the two most tender points&#xD;
           corresponding to the two EMG electrode sites. The algometer consists of a 1-cm2 round&#xD;
           tip that will be pressed vertically on the target locations of the muscle. To provoke&#xD;
           the patient's pain or discomfort, pressure will be increased at a rate of 40 kPa/sec&#xD;
           until the participant feels pain as indicated by pressing a patient safety unit. The&#xD;
           limit of pressure threshold will be set at 800 kPa, meaning that a pressure exceeding&#xD;
           800 kPa will be cut off to minimize tissue damage. If the participant does not push the&#xD;
           button at 800 kPa, a value of 800 is used as the threshold value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants are informed of the risks, benefits and procedures of the study, they will&#xD;
      be asked to sign a written consent form approved by the TWU Institutional Review Board -&#xD;
      Dallas. Eligible participants will be asked to complete an intake form to collect their&#xD;
      demographic data (age, gender, height, weight, occupation, hand dominance), past medical&#xD;
      history, and questions related to their past history of pain if applicable (onset, injury&#xD;
      mechanism if any, location, duration, type, and nature). The symptomatic participants also&#xD;
      will be asked to rate their pain intensity at present, at worst, and at best in the past 24&#xD;
      hours using the NPRS. Participants who exhibit any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded&#xD;
      from the study. Once the participants is determined to be eligible for the study, they will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the Modified Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (OSW),&#xD;
      which will be used to determine their perceived disability and functional limitations due to&#xD;
      LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, the EMG activity and PPTs will be collected from the painful side of the participants&#xD;
      with LBP and the right side of the asymptomatic participants. When the symptomatic&#xD;
      participants have bilateral LBP, the EMG activity and PPTs will be collected from the most&#xD;
      painful side. If both sides are equally painful, a coin toss was performed to select the side&#xD;
      (heads for the right side, tails for the left side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the EMG and PPT testing, participants will be asked to lie in a prone position on an&#xD;
      examination table with their arms on the sides. A pillow was placed under the participant's&#xD;
      abdomen to flatten the lumbar lordotic curve and an inclinometer will be placed on the&#xD;
      lumbosacral junction to ensure the lumbar curve ≤10°. The spinous processes of the L1-S2 and&#xD;
      posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) will be be identified by palpation and marked with a&#xD;
      skin marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. EMG Activity Recording&#xD;
&#xD;
           To prepare for EMG recording, each participant's skin over the LM muscles (between&#xD;
           L4-S2) will be cleaned with alcohol and, if needed, excessive hair will be shaved using&#xD;
           a disposable razor. Adhesive tape will be used to affix two wireless EMG electrodes to&#xD;
           the skin over the LM muscles, one at the L5 level and the other at the S2 level.&#xD;
           Following the recommendation by the Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non-Invasive&#xD;
           Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) project (http://www.seniam.org/), the L5 electrodes were&#xD;
           placed at the level of the L5 spinous process (i.e. about 2 - 3 cm from the midline) and&#xD;
           aligned with a line from the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) to the interspace&#xD;
           between the L1 and L2 spinous process. The S2 electrode was placed medial to the PSIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During EMG recording, participants will be asked to abduct the contralateral shoulder&#xD;
           and flex the contralateral elbow to approximately 90° while holding a 1.5 or 2 lb. hand&#xD;
           weight. A participant will hold a 1.5 lb. hand weight if his/her body weight is less&#xD;
           than 175 lbs., and hold a 2 lb. hand weight if his/her body weight is more than 175 lbs.&#xD;
           First, the EMG activity of the LM was recorded during a contralateral arm lift (Figure&#xD;
           1a), which has been shown to best elicit LM muscle activation. A verbal instruction will&#xD;
           be given before the participant performed the contralateral arm lift: &quot;Breathe normally.&#xD;
           Without moving your pelvis or spine, raise your arm above the table&quot;. Each participant&#xD;
           will be given one practice trial before EMG recording begins, and then perform a&#xD;
           5-second contralateral arm lift five times. If a participant demonstrate difficulty in&#xD;
           holding for 5 seconds, the participant will be allowed to hold for a shorter period of&#xD;
           time, but a minimum of 3 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Next, two trials of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the LM muscles&#xD;
           will be obtained by asking the participant to perform a contralateral arm lift while the&#xD;
           investigator applies a steady downward force on the elbow opposite the side of the&#xD;
           tested LM muscles (Figure 1b). Two 5-second MVIC trials will be recorded with a minimum&#xD;
           of a 1-min rest between the two trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pressure-pain Threshold (PPT) Testing&#xD;
&#xD;
           For PPT testing, participants will be instructed to stop the test as soon as the&#xD;
           &quot;pressure&quot; becomes &quot;uncomfortable or painful&quot; and will be instructed not to allow the&#xD;
           &quot;uncomfortable or painful sensation&quot; to continue. A standardized instruction will be&#xD;
           given to each participant prior to PPT testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot;This is a patient safety unit. (The investigator will show the participant the unit).&#xD;
           Please hold it with the hand opposite of the testing side. When the testing begins, we&#xD;
           will push the rounded tip of this instrument (point to the pressure algometer) into this&#xD;
           muscle (point to the testing point) and you will feel a &quot;pressure-like&quot; sensation. As&#xD;
           soon as this pressure-like sensation becomes painful or uncomfortable to you, push the&#xD;
           green button of the patient safety unit immediately. By pushing the green button, you&#xD;
           can stop the testing. Do not let this painful or uncomfortable sensation continue.&quot; Four&#xD;
           trials will be performed on each of two tender points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three investigators are experienced physical therapists in treating patients with LBP.&#xD;
           All are certificated manual therapists and fellows with the America Academy of&#xD;
           Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy. In addition, one investigator has practiced&#xD;
           dry-needling for the past 12 years and the other two have practiced dry-needling for the&#xD;
           past 5 years. Before data collections, the two dry-needling intervention techniques will&#xD;
           be standardized so that all three investigators will be able to administer either one of&#xD;
           the two dry-needling techniques when they are needed. In addition, the research&#xD;
           assistants who will collect the outcome measures (EMG activity and PPT) will be blinded&#xD;
           to the type of the dry-needling techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once baseline outcome measures are collected, each participant will be randomly assigned&#xD;
           into one of the dry-needling intervention techniques, with and without needle&#xD;
           manipulation. The insertion of the needles will be the same for both techniques. A&#xD;
           sterile, disposable 0.30 mm x 50 mm or 0.30 x 60 mm solid filament needle (Seirom Corp.,&#xD;
           Shizuoka, Japan) will be inserted into the bilateral LM muscles approximately 1.5 cm&#xD;
           lateral to the L5 or S2 spinous process level. The needling sites are corresponding to&#xD;
           the EMG and PPT testing points. The needles used in the study will be exactly the same&#xD;
           needles used for acupuncture. After piercing the skin, the needle will be directed&#xD;
           toward the spinous process in a slight inferior-medial angle (approximately 20 °). This&#xD;
           angle was chosen because the needle will be stopped by the bony laminia part of vertebra&#xD;
           to ensure a safe intervention and to standardize the depth of the needle insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the needle manipulation technique, the needle will be pulled in and out (sparrow&#xD;
           pecking) and redirected in small angles (coning) for 5-10 seconds. For the non-needling&#xD;
           manipulation technique, the four needles will stay (in situ) for 10 minutes after the&#xD;
           insertion of the needle. The investigator who administers the dry needling interventions&#xD;
           will wear gloves during the intervention and will dispose of the used needles in a sharp&#xD;
           container. Because needles will be used in the study, universal precautions will be&#xD;
           followed throughout the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reassessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the dry-needling intervention, the two outcome measures (EMG activity and&#xD;
      PPTs) will be collected again. Each participant will also be asked about any presence of&#xD;
      common adverse symptoms, including increased pain, nausea, dizziness and fatigue. If bleeding&#xD;
      occurs, the participant will be informed of the occurrence. All participants will also be&#xD;
      asked to avoid strenuous trunk activity or exercises for the following week. All participants&#xD;
      will be scheduled to return in approximately 1 week for the final reassessment, including EMG&#xD;
      activity and PPT testing. After return, all participants will be re-questioning about whether&#xD;
      they experience any adverse symptoms after dry-needling.&#xD;
