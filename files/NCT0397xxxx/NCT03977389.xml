      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of total wrist&#xD;
      denervation on pain by assessing the surgery survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The residual functional wrist's quality and the patients' satisfaction will also be evaluate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The degenerative diseases of the wrist are numerous and include both post-traumatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis lesions and inflammatory diseases. In any case, one of the main reasons for&#xD;
      consultation is pain. In case of inefficiency of a well-conducted medical treatment (splints,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories, infiltrations), surgical management remains difficult because of the&#xD;
      multitude of treatments that can be offered: partial or total arthrodesis of the wrist,&#xD;
      prosthetic arthroplasties, pyrocarbon implants or proximal row carpectomy. But these&#xD;
      treatments are heavy and can potentially be sources of complications such as stiffness, loss&#xD;
      of strength or progressive wear of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total wrist denervation is an alternative since 1966. The original technique follows an&#xD;
      anatomical study of the innervation of the upper limb. This technique has been proven to&#xD;
      significantly improve pain without major after effects. Several teams demonstrated a decrease&#xD;
      in pain associated with conserved strength and mobility, but few studies have studied the&#xD;
      long-term results of this technique, especially on the absence of residual pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of denervation on pain&#xD;
      by assessing the surgery survival, the residual functional wrist's quality and the patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;

        Patients undergoing total wrist denervation (TWD) between January 1995 and December 2013 at&#xD;
        Brest CHRU, performed by the same senior surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        TWD was indicated in a routine procedure for degenerative diseases of the wrist&#xD;
        (post-traumatic osteoarthritis lesions and inflammatory diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The aetiologies are varied: SLAC-wrist, distal radius fractures, SNAC-wrist, Kienb√∂ck&#xD;
        disease, chondrocalcinosis, peri-lunar luxation of the carpus, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
        haemochromatoses, ruptures of the luno-triquetral ligament.&#xD;
