  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to study the effectiveness of interprofessional advanced cardiac&#xD;
      life support (IP-ACLS) training in improving collaborative skills, self-efficacy and emotion&#xD;
      regulation among fourth-year nursing students using a prospective, open-label, non-randomized&#xD;
      controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that students who participated in the IP-ACLS training are&#xD;
      more likely to have better:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. collaborative skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. self-efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. emotion regulation.&#xD;

      A total sample size of 120 fourth year nursing students will be used. Subjective measures and&#xD;
      objective measure are used. Principal Investigator or trained part-time undergraduate student&#xD;
      research assistants will recruit nursing students in scheduled identical sessions. Informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained after an explanation of the nature, purpose, and potential risks of&#xD;
      the study according to the information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-test was conducted before starting the IP-ACLS training on Day 1; post-test 1 was&#xD;
      conducted immediately after the IP-ACLS training on Day 2; post-test 2 was conducted 1 month&#xD;
      after the IP-ACLS training before or after their scheduled lecture break. The students were&#xD;
      asked to complete the self-report questionnaire in approximately 10-15 min before and after&#xD;
      2-day IP-ACLS workshop and 1 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS), General Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      (GSE) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were used to measure collaborative skill,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and emotion regulation using self-administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check whether the scores followed normal&#xD;
      distributions. Independent sample t test was used for normally distributed data, whereas&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data to compare the AITCS, GSE and&#xD;
      ERQ scores in two groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 37 items with 3 subscales including partnership (19 items), cooperation (11 items) and coordination (7 items) (Orchard, King, Bezzina, 2012).&#xD;
Items incorporated on a five-point Likert scale (with 5 = always, 4 = most of the time, 3 = occasionally, 2 = rarely, and 1 = never) allowing respondents to rate their current feeling about their team and themselves.&#xD;
The sum score ranged from 37 to 185. The higher the scores obtained, the more collaborative skills had.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 10-item, 4-point unidimensional scale. Items had a response range from 1 (not at all true) to 4 (exactly true) (Schwarzer &amp; Jerusalem, 1995).&#xD;
The sum scores ranged from 10 to 40. The higher the total score, the more self-efficacious the respondent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Used to measure emotion regulation which consists of two scales corresponding to two different emotion regulation strategies: cognitive reappraisal (6 items) and expressive suppression (4 items) (Gross &amp; John, 2003).&#xD;
The 10 items are rated on a 7-point-Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The sum score ranged from 10 to 70, participants with higher total score have better emotion regulation.</description>

    <description>Three senior consultants and 12 trainers conduct 2-day IP-ACLS training.&#xD;
Pre-class activities: preparation First exposure reading on provider manual and lecturer notes about a new knowledge of ACLS to enhance self-directed learning.&#xD;
Interactive lecture sessions: 10 topics Interactive lectures (15-20 minutes per topic) introduce a new knowledge, which anchor to their existing knowledge according to ACLS algorithms.&#xD;
Simulation sessions: 10 sessions Skill sessions (50 minutes per session) used high-fidelity simulation mannequin in a team approach. Students learn through role-playing with different practical scenarios. Experiential learning is focused on hands-on and collaborative strategies for enhancing a deeper learning.&#xD;
Debriefing: feedback and reflection Trainers provide immediate feedback and discussion throughout the scenarios. Debriefing is focused on the positive aspect and areas for improvement.</description>
