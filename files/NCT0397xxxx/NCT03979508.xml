  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abemaciclib works in treating patients with triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer that can be removed by surgery (resectable) and does not respond to&#xD;
      treatment with chemotherapy. Abemaciclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the effects of abemaciclib on the CD8/FOXP3 ratio in chemotherapy resistant&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess abemaciclib toxicities. II. To examine the effects of abemaciclib on the percentage&#xD;
      of vimentin expressing invasive cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Within TNBC molecular subtypes (basal, mesenchymal, and luminal androgen receptor&#xD;
      [LAR]), to evaluate the effects of abemaciclib on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. The individual elements of tumor grade (mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, and tubule&#xD;
      formation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Tumor proliferation (as measured by tumor Ki-67 and serum tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      [TKI]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. pDUB3 as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers including SNAIL/SLUG,&#xD;
      TWIST, and E-Cadherin as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIId. Quantification of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (as examined by hematoxylin and eosin&#xD;
      [H&amp;E]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of abemaciclib on tumor ribonucleic acid (RNA)-seq data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the effects of abemaciclib on the immune phenotype of peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC), by evaluating expression of a panel of cell surface markers&#xD;
      optimized of identification of human immune cell subpopulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the effects of abemaciclib on tumor-infiltrating immune cells in&#xD;
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections, using multiplexed imaging&#xD;
      technologies (e.g imaging mass cytometry, Nanostring digital spatial profiling [DSP] or&#xD;
      CODEX) which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Genes directly involved in tumor cell antigen presentation (e.g. B2M, HLA-A, HLA-B,&#xD;
      HLA-C, TAP1, TAP2, TAPBP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIb. Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that regulate antigen presentation (e.g. STAT1,&#xD;
      NLRC5) and other ISGs (e.g. IRFs, OAS2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIc. Genes involved in double-strand ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) response (e.g. DDX58, DHX58).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIId. Genes encoding interferons, including type 3 IFNs (e.g. IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIe. Genes indicating a cytotoxic T cell response (e.g. PRF1, GZMB). IIIf. Regulatory T-cell&#xD;
      (Treg)-specific transcription factor genes (e.g. FOXP3, IKZF2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the difference in the frequency of JAK-2 amplification among patients whose&#xD;
      post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio &gt;= 1.6 and that among patients whose post-abemaciclib&#xD;
      CD8/FOXP3 ratio &lt; 1.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To generate organoids for future research. VI. To evaluate changes in the microbiome with&#xD;
      exposure to abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: Patients undergo standard of care surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Patients receive abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 or days 1-21&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo&#xD;
      standard of care surgical resection no later than 12 weeks after the last dose of neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients in group 2 are followed up within 30-60 days.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>A Simon optimum two stage phase II clinical trial design was chosen to test the null hypothesis that the rate of conversion to post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio of 1.6 or more is =&lt; 5% against the alternative that rate of conversion to post-abemaciclib CD8/FOXP3 ratio of 1.6 or more is &gt;= 20% with the target probability of a type I error and probability of a type II error set to 0.10. The probability of terminating after the first stage is 0.736, if the null hypothesis is true. A 90% confidence interval for this rate of conversion will be constructed using the Duffy-Santner approach taking into account the sequential nature of the study</description>
