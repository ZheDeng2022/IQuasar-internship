  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cost of medical care in the United States far exceeds that of all other advanced&#xD;
      economies and continues to accelerate at a rate unacceptable to our society, due primarily to&#xD;
      the high costs of new imaging technologies and novel drugs (1). Cardiac positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) imaging is a powerful new modality for the non-invasive detection of&#xD;
      provocable coronary ischemia in patients with low to intermediate-risk chest pain or its&#xD;
      equivalent. Intermountain Medical Center (IMC) is performing approximately 6000 clinical&#xD;
      cardiac PET scans annually. However, cardiac PET scans are expensive (i.e., billed at&#xD;
      &gt;$5,000/scan, average receivable revenue $1500-$2000/scan). Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is&#xD;
      a sensitive marker of coronary atherosclerosis. A CAC scan (CACS), performed by multislice&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT), is a relatively inexpensive (~$70-$150/scan), low-radiation dose&#xD;
      test that marks the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. The absence of CAC has been&#xD;
      shown to be associated with very low coronary risk. ACCURATE will test whether a CAC-first&#xD;
      strategy (i.e., risk stratification, when CAC ≤ 1, to medical management or to cardiac PET&#xD;
      stress testing), performed routinely in symptomatic patients presenting for evaluation of&#xD;
      possible coronary artery disease (CAD) prior to the cardiac PET stress test, can be used as a&#xD;
      gatekeeper for progression to the expensive rubidium-PET stress (regadenoson) perfusion scan&#xD;
      and be a major cost-saver without adversely affecting patient care or outcomes. Routinely,&#xD;
      qualifying patients undergo CACS when they present for evaluation of possible but unknown CAD&#xD;
      status and are referred for cardiac PET stress testing. In ACCURATE, those with CACS≤1 will&#xD;
      then be consented and randomized to either a cardiac PET stress test strategy or a&#xD;
      non-PET-driven medical care strategy. Subjects randomized to the cardiac PET stress test&#xD;
      strategy will receive appropriate subsequent care depending on the outcome of the cardiac PET&#xD;
      scan (i.e., depending on whether ischemia is present or not). Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      CAC-only arm will receive appropriate non-PET driven medical clinical management and&#xD;
      follow-up. All participating subjects' electronic medical records will be reviewed&#xD;
      indefinitely for clinical outcomes. Initial outcomes will be reported at 1-year, 2-years, and&#xD;
      5-years, with future analyses to be determined by the study investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that PET stress test strategy will&#xD;
      results in a decreasing in major adverse cardiac endpoint without exceeding $100,000 per&#xD;
      quality-adjusted life year compared to a CAC-first strategy for screening suspected/possible&#xD;
      coronary artery disease.&#xD;

    <description>The costs of routine cardiac PET stress test strategy will be less than &lt;$100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared to CAC-first strategy. Cost-effectiveness, categorized by the American Heart Association, will be defined as achieving at least fair cost effectiveness, i.e., as achieving &lt;$100,000/QALY, which is widely accepted as a &quot;willingness-to-pay&quot; threshold, with &lt;$50,000/QALY defined as good cost-effectiveness.</description>
