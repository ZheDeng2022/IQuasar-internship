  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Addiction to methamphetamine (MA) is a serious health problem in the United States. Right&#xD;
      now, there are no medically approved treatments for MA dependence. More research is needed to&#xD;
      understand how MA affects the brain and to eventually develop medical interventions for MA&#xD;
      addiction. The purpose of the study is to learn more about how MA use affects the brain by&#xD;
      investigating a receptor in the brain called trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). The&#xD;
      investigators are hoping to find out if individuals with certain versions of the brain&#xD;
      receptor react differently when given MA. The TAAR1 receptor has two prevalent genetic&#xD;
      variations due to a single nucleotide polymorphism. These are the wild type (WT) and a common&#xD;
      variant (CV). Preliminary studies have shown that these variants produce different&#xD;
      connectivity (resting state functional connectivity or RSFC) in the brains of individuals&#xD;
      with MA use disorder (MUD), specifically that individuals with the CV genotype exhibit lower&#xD;
      RSFC than WT. In this study, MA will be administered to individuals with MA use disorder and&#xD;
      healthy controls in order to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the influence of CV vs. WT genotype on RSFC and craving in individuals with&#xD;
           chronic MUD and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of acute methamphetamine or placebo administration on the&#xD;
           interaction of CV vs WT genotype on RSFC, craving, cognitive control, attention and&#xD;
           subjective experience in MUD and healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will determine the effect of a common variant (CV) synonymous single nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphism (SNP) of the gene for the human trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) on the&#xD;
      neural and behavioral response of subjects with methamphetamine (MA) use disorder (MUD) and&#xD;
      healthy control subjects to acute MA administration. The SNP (rs8192620 on human [GRCh38.p7]&#xD;
      chromosome 6 at 132,645,140 bp in htaar1, allelic frequency 22%) results from a change of&#xD;
      adenine to guanine in a valine codon at amino acid 288 (v288v). MA is a potent agonist at the&#xD;
      TAAR1 receptor, in addition to its actions at the dopamine transporter and the vesicular&#xD;
      monoamine transporter. In rodents, a decrease in TAAR1 expression or non-functional TAAR1&#xD;
      receptor is associated with an increase in striatal dopamine (DA) signaling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientific premise of this project is based on 1) preliminary findings that support a&#xD;
      model that the CV alters RSFC of the striatum, a dopaminergic terminal region, and associated&#xD;
      behavior in chronic MUD, 2) published reports that delineate the effect of TAAR1 on DA&#xD;
      signaling and 3) preclinical evidence that TAAR1 influences sensitivity to rewarding and&#xD;
      aversive effects of MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, this proposal will address questions that have important implications for&#xD;
      understanding and treating patients with MUD, as the TAAR1 receptor is implicated in MA&#xD;
      self-administration. As an allele of the murine TAAR1 gene associated with an inactive&#xD;
      receptor leads to increased MA intake in homozygotes, it is critically important to study the&#xD;
      feasibility of exploiting human variant htaar1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a model based on this premise that makes testable predictions about&#xD;
      the interaction of the CV with chronic and acute MA administration in MUD. The investigators'&#xD;
      preliminary data show that the CV causes over-expression of TAAR1 in cell culture.&#xD;
      Stimulation of the TAAR1 receptor decreases dopaminergic signaling in mesocorticolimbic and&#xD;
      corticostriatal networks. The investigators propose that this effect in conjunction with&#xD;
      chronic MA use causes neuroadaptations that result in the increased striato- and&#xD;
      corticolimbic RSFC as well as increased drug craving observed in MUD subjects with the CV.&#xD;
      The investigators can indirectly test the hypothesis of decreased DA release due to&#xD;
      ever-expression via MA administration. The effect of acute MA administration on RSFC in&#xD;
      humans is not known but acute administration of S-amphetamine and methylphenidate reduce RSFC&#xD;
      in salience attribution and default mode networks presumably via increased DA release.&#xD;
      Stimulation of over-expressed TAAR1 should blunt this effect in CV carrying individuals&#xD;
      compared to WT. There are no published reports on neural effects of the interaction between&#xD;
      either chronic or acute MA administration and htaar1 genotype in humans, therefore this&#xD;
      proposal represents a unique opportunity to determine whether the RSFC response to acute MA&#xD;
      administration in humans is mediated by genotype.&#xD;
