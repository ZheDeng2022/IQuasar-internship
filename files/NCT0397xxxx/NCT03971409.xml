      This phase II trial studies how well the combination of avelumab with liposomal doxorubicin&#xD;
      with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab govitecan works&#xD;
      in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that is stage IV or is not able to be&#xD;
      removed by surgery (unresectable) and has come back (recurrent). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab require activation of the patient's immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes a two week induction or lead-in of medications that can stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system. It is our hope that this induction will improve the response to immunotherapy&#xD;
      with avelumab. One treatment, sacituzumab Govitecan, is a monoclonal antibody called&#xD;
      sacituzumab linked to a chemotherapy drug called SN-38. Sacituzumab govitecan is a form of&#xD;
      targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of&#xD;
      tumor cells, known as Tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) receptors, and&#xD;
      delivers SN-38 to kill them. Another treatment, liposomal doxorubicin, is a form of the&#xD;
      anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained in very tiny, fat-like particles. It may have&#xD;
      fewer side effects and work better than doxorubicin, and may enhance factors associated with&#xD;
      immune response. The third medication is called binimetinib, which may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may help activate the&#xD;
      immune system. It is not yet known whether giving avelumab in combination with liposomal&#xD;
      doxorubicin with or without binimetinib, or the combination of avelumab with sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan will work better in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 active arms. The three previous study arms are&#xD;
      closed to further accrual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for a lead-in period of 15&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive&#xD;
      binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28, avelumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and&#xD;
      15, and liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive sacituzumab govitecan IV on days -15 and -8 as a lead-in period in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive&#xD;
      sacituzumab govitecan IV on days 1 and 8 and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15.&#xD;
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day -15. Patients then&#xD;
      receive liposomal doxorubicin IV over 60 minutes on day 15 and every 4 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
      Patients also receive avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 6 months&#xD;
      for a minimum of 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Anti-tumor effect of avelumab in combination with different therapeutic agents explored in&#xD;
      the sub-protocols of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Additional anti-tumor effects. II. Safety and tolerability of avelumab in combination with&#xD;
      different therapeutic agents explored in the sub-protocols of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Patient reported outcomes (PRO) between baseline and cycle 3 day 1 across arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Longitudinal trends in PRO outcomes across treatment arms. V. Differences in PRO outcomes&#xD;
      for patients who respond compared to those who do not respond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the therapeutic predictive role of the following on clinical outcome as well&#xD;
      as changes with induction therapy with either liposomal doxorubicin or targeted agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PD-L1 expression and immune 'hot-spots'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)s, and CD8 and CD4 positivity in TIL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A (MHC-I) and HLA-DR (MHC-II), FoxP3, OX40 and OX40L,&#xD;
           phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), and MYC expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Number/levels of expressed predicted class I and class II neoantigens, central memory&#xD;
           T-cells and T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Expression of effector/regulatory immune gene, innate PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES),&#xD;
           and B cell, T cell, and/or macrophage signatures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Basal or claudin-low molecular subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. T cell receptor (TCR) clonality in the tumor and peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Genomic mutational burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. PD-L1 positivity in circulating tumor cells (CTCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Soluble B7-H1 (sB7-H1) levels. II. To determine if circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
           acid (DNA) (ctDNA) results will discriminate pseudo-progression from true progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if certain genomic alterations detected in tumor tissue or ctDNA are&#xD;
      potentially associated with resistance to the tested drug combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To correlate the composition of the pretreatment microbiome with response and secondary&#xD;
      endpoints in each arm of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
