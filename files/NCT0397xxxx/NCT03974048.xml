  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate potential early alterations in the DNA&#xD;
      methylation profile after severe trauma and to investigate if the early marks persist.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Severe trauma is an extreme physical exposure, which may have significant&#xD;
      consequences for the patient. In addition to anatomical injury and hemodynamic compromise,&#xD;
      severe trauma causes an immense and rapid systemic immune reaction. At the genomic level,&#xD;
      trauma has been found to significantly increase gene expression in circulating leukocytes,&#xD;
      and preliminary data is also emerging that trauma may even cause epigenetic (DNA methylation)&#xD;
      alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetics, including DNA methylation, have been suggested as a mediator of genetic risk and&#xD;
      to play a significant role in subsequent non-traumatic disease. Within the field of trauma&#xD;
      DNA methylation has only been sparsely studied, but a few studies of traumatized animals have&#xD;
      suggested that DNA methylation alterations may occur in relation to trauma. Even though DNA&#xD;
      methylation is highly dynamic, some marks have been found to be stable over time, and thus&#xD;
      may have long-term consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An increasing understanding of the role of epigenetics in disease development and response&#xD;
      may pave the way for new treatment targets and modalities for multiple diseases including&#xD;
      trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question: Does trauma induce immediate (&lt;4 hours) and persistent (30 days&#xD;
      post-trauma) changes in the epigenome of peripheral blood cells, and do epigenetic changes&#xD;
      correlate with patient recovery?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To identify potential early alterations in the DNA methylation profile after&#xD;
      severe trauma AND to investigate if the early marks persist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective, observational, cohort study of trauma patients admitted to RH's&#xD;
      trauma center. The trauma cohort will be compared to a cohort of patients admitted for&#xD;
      elective orthopedic surgery in terms of DNA methylation profile in blood cells&#xD;
      pre-trauma/surgery, immediately post-trauma/surgery, and 30-45 days post-trauma/surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DNA methylation profiles will be assessed by array technique using Illumina's MethylationEPIC&#xD;
      Bead-Chip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Immediate (&lt;4 hours) post-trauma DNA methylation profile in blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: Pre-trauma/surgery DNA methylation profile, change in DNA methylation&#xD;
      from pre-trauma/surgery to immediately and 30 days post-trauma/surgery, occurrence of organ&#xD;
      dysfunction, sepsis, septic shock, 30-day mortality, ICU admission &gt; 24 hours, ICU length of&#xD;
      stay (LOS), hospital LOS.&#xD;
