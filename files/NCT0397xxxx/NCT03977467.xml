      This is a Phase II, two part trial (A and B), open label study of Atezolizumab for patients&#xD;
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or an advanced solid tumor that has been previously&#xD;
      treated with a PD-1 inhibitor (either nivolumab or pembrolizumab).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, Phase II study of atezolizumab in patients with NSCLC or&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors that have had prior treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor (e.g. nivolumab or&#xD;
      pembrolizumab). Arm A consists of patients with advanced NSCLC who received first-line&#xD;
      PD-1-monotherapy, who have subsequent disease progression. In Arm A, patients with NSCLC will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to either chemotherapy plus atezolizumab at a flat dose of 1200 mg IV every&#xD;
      3 weeks or chemotherapy alone until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Platinum-based&#xD;
      standard of care doublet chemotherapy (or triplet if bevacizumab is used) will be given by IV&#xD;
      every 3 weeks. Platinum chemotherapy may be cisplatin or carboplatin chosen based on&#xD;
      histology and at the discretion of the treating investigator. It should be administered&#xD;
      according to the directions in the approved labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B consists of approximately 10-15 patients per disease type (renal cell carcinoma [RCC],&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer [TNBC], small cell lung cancer [SCLC], squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      of the head and neck [SCCHN], melanoma, microsatellite instability-high [MSI-high] solid&#xD;
      tumors {as determined by local testing for MSI/mismatch repair (MMR)}), as well as patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC who were treated with a PD-1 antibody in ≥ second-line setting and who have had&#xD;
      subsequent disease progression and NSCLC patients who have progressed after pembrolizumab&#xD;
      plus chemotherapy in the first-line setting. In Arm B, patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      will be treated with an atezolizumab flat dose of 1200 mg IV every 3 weeks until progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR]) of combining atezolizumab with&#xD;
           standard of care chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have&#xD;
           progressed after prior exposure to anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy (ORR) of atezolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors who&#xD;
           have progressed after prior exposure to anti-PD-1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety of atezolizumab in patients with NSCLC and other advanced solid&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the 6-month disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall&#xD;
           survival (OS) in patients with NSCLC and other advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by immunohistochemistry&#xD;
           (IHC) with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of the tumor microenvironment by IHC, ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
           and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and correlation of&#xD;
           immune gene signatures with response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In selected patients with paired biopsy samples (pre-anti-PD-1 and pre-atezolizumab; or&#xD;
           pre and post-atezolizumab tissue):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of immune escape mechanisms, that may include but is not limited to&#xD;
                neoantigen profiling and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of tumor mutation burden (TMB) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and&#xD;
                correlation with response to therapy.&#xD;
