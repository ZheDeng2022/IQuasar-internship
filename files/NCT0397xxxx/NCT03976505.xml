  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with Parkinson's disease (Pd) don't respect medication prescriptions.&#xD;
      Non-adherence is caused by several factors among which three play an important role:&#xD;
      treatment complexity, cognitive decline, and patient-provider communication. One way for&#xD;
      improving medication adherence in these patients is to identify the best way for adapting&#xD;
      medication prescription presentation to these patients. This study is focused on&#xD;
      prescriptions displayed on touch-screens and tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory study aims at identifying the best format for presenting medication&#xD;
      prescription to Pd patients. An experiment with Pd patients and healthy volunteers is carried&#xD;
      out to analyze their behavior while filling a virtual pillbox from a education prescription&#xD;
      presented electronically in different formats on a tablet or a touchscreen. A table format&#xD;
      and a verbal format are compared to determine the most effective design for presenting&#xD;
      medication schedules. A facilitating effect of the table format is hypothesized.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many Pd patients are non-adherent to their treatments. Because Pd patients are generally over&#xD;
      60 years old, suffer from cognitive disorders, and have complex medication regimens, taking&#xD;
      medications as prescribed is a too complex cognitive task for them. It supposes the ability&#xD;
      to understand the prescription, to plan and memorize the actions to carry out and to remember&#xD;
      them while executing them. As prescriptions are communicated to patients via procedural&#xD;
      documents, it should be possible to improve patient's comprehension by using a format&#xD;
      suitable for their needs and characteristics. Previous studies with elderly people suggest&#xD;
      that the table format is more effective than the textual format. However no study addressed&#xD;
      this question with Pd patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One-hundred and twenty patients with Parkinson's disease and 120 healthy volunteers&#xD;
      participate voluntarily to the study. Their task consists in reading on a touch screen, or on&#xD;
      a tablet, two fictive medication prescriptions. One is presented in a table format and the&#xD;
      other in a textual format. Each prescription comprises two regular medications (same doses&#xD;
      and moments of the day) and two irregular medications (different doses or different moments).&#xD;
      For each prescription, participants must fill a virtual pillbox displayed on the screen as&#xD;
      prescribed in the prescription. Prescriptions and pillboxes are displayed by a tablet&#xD;
      software specifically designed to record in real time all participant's actions and related&#xD;
      chronometric data. Half participants perform the task in the &quot; tablet condition &quot;, and the&#xD;
      other half in the &quot; touch-screen &quot; condition. In the touch-screen condition an eye-tracker is&#xD;
      used to record eye fixations and scanpaths in real time. Once the 2nd pillbox filling is&#xD;
      finished a battery of cognitive tests and questionnaires is administered to participants to&#xD;
      identify Pd subtypes of impaired performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis predicts an effect of the format of prescriptions. More precisely, it&#xD;
      consists in two concurrent hypotheses. H1a (the mental model model hypothesis): the table&#xD;
      format should facilitate the pillboxes filling in the parkinsonian group and in the healthy&#xD;
      volunteer group by facilitating the elaboration of an accurate mental model. H1b (the working&#xD;
      memory load hypothesis): because parkinsonian patients are frequently impaired in&#xD;
      visuospatial tasks, the tabular format could have no effect or could have a negative effect&#xD;
      only in this group. A correlation between cognitive subtypes identified by cluster analyses&#xD;
      and task performances is expected. Several secondary hypotheses will be tested.&#xD;
