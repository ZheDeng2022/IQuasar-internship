      This study evaluates the effect of three different exercise strategies on physical function&#xD;
      in older adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three exercise groups:&#xD;
      resistance training, moderate-intensity continuous cycling on a stationary bicycle, and&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training on a stationary bicycle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project is confronting age-related physical disability by optimizing exercise strategies&#xD;
      for older adults. Aerobic training is recommended to improve cardiorespiratory (heart and&#xD;
      lung) function, while strength training is recommended for muscular function. These exercise&#xD;
      effects are necessary for building healthier lives and reducing mortality and disability&#xD;
      risk, but most older adults who do exercise typically only perform one type of exercise. In&#xD;
      doing so they are missing a key component for healthy aging. This study will address whether&#xD;
      stationary-cycling high-intensity interval training results in both cardiorespiratory and&#xD;
      muscular improvements, and it will be the first controlled study comparing adaptations to&#xD;
      high-intensity interval, aerobic, and strength training in sedentary older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear whether the lack of muscular adaptations to traditional aerobic training is due&#xD;
      to the low intensity/high volume model that is currently prescribed, and thus the central&#xD;
      hypothesize of the study is that stationary-cycling high-intensity interval training can&#xD;
      improve both cardiorespiratory and muscular function. To test this hypothesis, the&#xD;
      investigators will measure heart, lung, and muscle function, as well as physical performance&#xD;
      in sedentary older adults, before and after 12 weeks of supervised training using one of&#xD;
      three exercise strategies; stationary-cycling high-intensity interval training,&#xD;
      stationary-cycling moderate-intensity continuous training, or strength training. By comparing&#xD;
      the outcomes across these three groups, the investigators will be able to confirm if short&#xD;
      intervals of high-intensity exercise can elicit both cardiorespiratory and muscular benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will demonstrate that older adults can improve their cardiovascular health and&#xD;
      muscular strength with a single exercise strategy. Establishing in detail the cardiovascular&#xD;
      and muscular benefits of this exercise can lead to the implementation of new and improved&#xD;
      exercise guidelines for cardiovascular health and reduced physical disability in older&#xD;
      adults. Incidentally, it will also provide a framework for future studies to investigate the&#xD;
      importance of intensity in exercise. At the end of this study the investigators will be able&#xD;
      to disseminate a new evidence-based exercise protocol that will address a significant barrier&#xD;
      to healthy aging.&#xD;
