      This research study because you participate in long distance triathlon of Embrun. In recent&#xD;
      years, there has been a craze for races at increasingly longer distances (ultra-endurance)&#xD;
      with risks to the cardiovascular system poorly identified. In the short term, cardiac&#xD;
      functional ultrasonographic changes and disturbances of biomarkers such as troponin are&#xD;
      reported in participants in long-term endurance trials, assuming myocardial remodeling and&#xD;
      transient tissue damage leading to suffering or &quot;heart fatigue&quot;. These constraints could, to&#xD;
      the extreme, favor the development of arrhythmia at the atrial and ventricular stages.&#xD;
      Cardiac alterations are nevertheless poorly characterized and the consequences, in particular&#xD;
      the risk of ventricular rhythm disturbance, have not been studied.The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the relationship between right ventricular functional abnormalities and the&#xD;
      occurrence of ventricular rhythm disturbance, following intense and prolonged exercise, in&#xD;
      healthy triathletes subjects.&#xD;

      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While regular and moderate physical activity is strongly recommended in reducing&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, the scientific community questions the potentially harmful effects of&#xD;
      prolonged and intense physical activity. In the short term, functional ultrasonographic&#xD;
      changes (systolic and diastolic) and disturbances of biomarkers such as troponin are reported&#xD;
      in participants in long-term endurance trials, assuming myocardial remodeling and transient&#xD;
      tissue damage leading to suffering or &quot;heart fatigue&quot;. These constraints could, to the&#xD;
      extreme, favor the development of arrhythmogenic foci at the atrial and ventricular stages,&#xD;
      and at least, be responsible for a sudden death of the athlete. Adaptations of the athlete's&#xD;
      heart have mainly been studied in the left ventricle but more and more studies are studying&#xD;
      the right ventricle (RV). These alterations are nevertheless poorly characterized and the&#xD;
      consequences including the risk of ventricular rhythm disorder have not been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to test the existence of a relationship between RV functional&#xD;
      abnormalities induced by intense and prolonged exercise, and the occurrence of ventricular&#xD;
      ectopic beats (VEB) from RV. The secondary objectives are to characterize the respiratory&#xD;
      impairment of this type of course and to study its relation with the functional anomalies of&#xD;
      the RV and the occurrence of VEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study including male triathletes participating in the long-distance&#xD;
      triathlon of Embrun in August 2019 (3.8 km of swimming, 188 km of cycling and 42.2 km of&#xD;
      running), aged between 20 to 54 years years old. The criteria for non-inclusion are subjects&#xD;
      with a history of heart disease or rhythm disorder or who have one or more cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors, taking cardiovascular treatment or using doping products. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is the degree of correlation between course induced right ventricular functional&#xD;
      abnormalities (by the use of 2d-strain ultrasound imaging) and the number of VEB from RV&#xD;
      during or up to 72 hours after the race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place during the Embrun triathlon in August 2019. There will be 2&#xD;
      evaluations: one before the race and one 30 minutes after the race, where will be carried out&#xD;
      a self-questionnaire, a clinical examination, EKG, echocardiography and spirometry. An EKG&#xD;
      holter in the form of a patch, adapted to sport and submersible practice, will be put in&#xD;
      place 24 to 48 hours before the race and left until 72 hours after the race.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes / perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterizing the effects of a long-distance triathlon on cardiac contractile function and&#xD;
      evaluating the athlete's rhythmic risk would make it possible to better understand these&#xD;
      pathophysiological consequences and ultimately better detect athletes at risk of sudden&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
