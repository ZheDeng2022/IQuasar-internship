  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well the use of a continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) machine works in treating obstructive sleep apnea in patients with polycythemia vera&#xD;
      or essential thrombocythemia. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where a person stops&#xD;
      breathing during sleep, and is estimated to affect 30 to 50 percent of patients with&#xD;
      polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia. A patient with obstructive sleep apnea&#xD;
      typically snores, has disrupted sleep, experiences morning headaches, and has daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness. Patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea are typically treated with a&#xD;
      device called CPAP. The CPAP provides pressurized air that keeps upper air passages open&#xD;
      during sleep and may prevent them from narrowing or collapsing as occurs during snoring or&#xD;
      sleep apnea.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To understand effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) on the course of polycythemia vera/essential thrombocythemia (PV/ET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate prevalence of OSA in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. II. To&#xD;
      understand effects of CPAP for sleep apnea on the course of myeloproliferative neoplasms&#xD;
      (MPNs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To correlate OSA severity with thrombotic and inflammatory marker values in patients&#xD;
      with PV/ET at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT I (OBSERVATIONAL COHORT): Patients not diagnosed with OSA undergo observation for 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT II (TREATMENT COHORT): Patients diagnosed with OSA and prescribed a CPAP machine for&#xD;
      treatment receive continuous treatment with CPAP for 6 months.&#xD;
