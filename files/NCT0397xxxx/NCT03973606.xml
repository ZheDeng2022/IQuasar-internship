    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage study: The objective of the first stage is to explore health literacy&#xD;
      (HL) needs and preferences of Arab women through conducting Focus Group Discussions (FGDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage will employ conducting a HL intervention tailored to the participants' needs&#xD;
      and preferences as presented in the FGDs. Objectives include increasing the percentage of&#xD;
      women who utilize patient-doctor communication skills and increasing their cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) knowledge.The intervention consists of four sessions that will be conducted in&#xD;
      municipality-sponsored women's groups in Jerusalem and other Arab communities. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be completed before and three months after the intervention. The study answers the&#xD;
      following: Can HL workshops improve patient-doctor communication skills and CVD knowledge in&#xD;
      Arab women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arab women in Israel are at high risk of low health literacy due to lower levels of education&#xD;
      and low socio-economic status. Health literacy (HL) refers to the skills and competencies&#xD;
      enabling people to obtain and interpret health information and apply their knowledge to&#xD;
      inform health-related decision-making. It's also defined as &quot;the degree to which individuals&#xD;
      have the capacity to obtain, understand, and process basic health information and services&#xD;
      needed to make appropriate health decisions&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the first stage of the study is to explore health literacy needs and&#xD;
      preferences of Arab women through conducting Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with women in&#xD;
      East Jerusalem. Six different focus groups will be conducted at three of the six municipality&#xD;
      community centers in East Jerusalem. Participants will be recruited through identified&#xD;
      community centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will meet once for up to two hours. The study will be explained to them by an&#xD;
      investigator who has been trained in the administration of focus groups, and they will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a consent form. Discussions will be recorded without the names of the&#xD;
      participants (they will be instructed not to use their names once the recording begins). At&#xD;
      the end of the meeting, each participant will receive a bag and pamphlets with information&#xD;
      regarding women's health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second stage will employ conducting a HL intervention tailored to the participants' needs&#xD;
      and preferences as presented in the FGDs. Objectives include increasing the percentage of&#xD;
      women who utilize patient-doctor communication skills and increasing their cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD) knowledge.The intervention consists of four sessions that will be conducted in&#xD;
      municipality-sponsored women's groups in Jerusalem and other Arab communities. Questionnaires&#xD;
      will be completed before and three months after the intervention. The study answers the&#xD;
      following: Can HL workshops improve patient-doctor communication skills and CVD knowledge in&#xD;

    <measure>assessment of health literacy level and elucidate factors that will improve health literacy (barriers, incentives, etc.â€¦) among Arab women in East Jerusalem</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment will be done through conduction of focus groups. Focus groups will be audio- recorded, transcribed and analyzed using Systematic text condensation, a descriptive and explorative analysis strategy. Which consists of four steps: 1) total impression - from chaos to themes; 2) identifying and sorting meanings units - from themes to codes; 3) condensation - from code to meaning; 4) synthesizing - from condensation to descriptions and concepts. It is expected that six focus groups will be sufficient to achieve saturation of themes. If results are not sufficient, investigators will ask to increase the number of focus groups.</description>
