  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology of chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), resulting in the emergence of new therapeutic agents that have&#xD;
      significantly improved the long-term survival of patients. However, LLC is still considered&#xD;
      an incurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytogenetic abnormalities are frequently found in this pathology. Some abnormalities are&#xD;
      associated with a more aggressive disease and a poor prognosis. The deletion of chromosome&#xD;
      17p (del (17p)), in particular, makes leukemic cells more resistant to standard therapy.&#xD;
      Chromosome 17p contains the Tumor Protein 53 gene (TP53) which encodes the tumor suppressor&#xD;
      protein 53 (P53) protein. P53 plays a central role in the regulation of important cellular&#xD;
      functions such as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and drug sensitivity&#xD;
      of chemotherapies. In patients with CLL, the loss of p53 function is a major factor of&#xD;
      chemoresistance and is associated with an adverse prognosis. The deletion (17p) is observed&#xD;
      in approximately 5 to 10% of patients with CLL. In contrast, mutations in the TP53 gene are&#xD;
      observed in approximately 30% of patients with CLL. This means that about one-third of&#xD;
      patients with CLL have p53 dysfunction. TP53 and / or del (17p) mutated LLC cells show marked&#xD;
      mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction is responsible for a deregulation of&#xD;
      intracellular redox phenomena, leading to an increase in oxidative stress and an&#xD;
      overproduction of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dimethyl Ampal Thiolester (DIMATE) is an active, competitive and irreversible inhibitor of&#xD;
      aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1 and 3. In vitro, DIMATE eradicates human cells from acute&#xD;
      myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In patients with CLL, current treatments, particularly&#xD;
      effective, do not specifically target pathological B cells. This results in chronic B&#xD;
      lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemias that provide severe long-term infections, which is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death in patients with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, we will study, in vitro, the expression of ALDH 1, 3, 9 but also of&#xD;
      glutathione (GSH) and ROS on tumor B lymphocytes and healthy patients carrying an LLC.&#xD;
      Depending on the differences in expression observed, DIMATE could specifically eradicate&#xD;
      leukemic lymphocyte cells by sparing healthy lymphocytes, a hypothesis that will be tested in&#xD;
      vitro. A special evaluation will be made in patients with del (17) and / or TP53 mutation&#xD;
      whose prognosis is still considered unfavorable despite new therapeutic advances.&#xD;
