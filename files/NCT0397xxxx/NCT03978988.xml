  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tandem occlusion is defined by an acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with concomitant&#xD;
      steno-occlusive disease of the extra cranial carotid artery and concerned about 10% of AIS&#xD;
      patients. Whereas endovascular treatment has shown its efficiency in AIS by large vessel&#xD;
      occlusion (LVO), to date, there is no consensus on the endovascular management of the extra&#xD;
      cranial carotid artery in tandem occlusion. Only few of them were included in previous&#xD;
      randomized trials who evaluated mechanical thrombectomy and were often listed in the&#xD;
      non-inclusion criteria. Therapeutic management of this population was not specifically&#xD;
      addressed in recent trials. Endovascular management can be complex with the need of acute&#xD;
      stenting of the extra cranial carotid lesion along with the potential need of antithrombotic&#xD;
      therapy initiation, the benefit and the safety of stenting of the cervical lesion in acute&#xD;
      phase of AIS have shown encouraging results but however remains to be assessed. The TITAN&#xD;
      (Thrombectomy In TANdem lesion) trial aims to demonstrate the superiority of the combined use&#xD;
      of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting compared to intracranial&#xD;
      thrombectomy alone on the complete reperfusion rate in patients with acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      due to tandem lesion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TITAN trial is a prospective, randomized, multi center, controlled, open-label, blinded&#xD;
      clinical trial. This academic trial designed to answer the question: &quot;What is the best&#xD;
      endovascular management of the extra cranial carotid artery lesion in tandem occlusion with&#xD;
      LVO&quot; Patients will be recruited at 13 comprehensive stroke centers in France, all of which&#xD;
      regular conduct mechanical thrombectomy and carotid stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll adults patients admitted with cerebral infarction of the anterior&#xD;
      circulation, proven by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography,&#xD;
      associated with tandem lesion, within 8 hours of symptoms onset, with a neurological deficit&#xD;
      NIHSS &gt; 5, and eligible to thrombectomy according to the recommendations of the French&#xD;
      societies of neurovascular disease and neuroradiology (SFNR and SFNV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tandem occlusion of the anterior circulation will be proven on digital subtraction&#xD;
      angiography, defined as a proximal intracranial occlusion and an extracranial severe internal&#xD;
      carotid artery (ICA) lesion (complete occlusion or stenosis ≥90% North American Symptomatic&#xD;
      Carotid Endarterectomy Trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent according to the French laws will be sought from the patient if their level&#xD;
      of consciousness is sufficient or from a relative. This study will operate using an emergency&#xD;
      inclusion protocol due to the nature of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After emergency inclusion procedure according to French regulations, eligible patients will&#xD;
      be randomized in two balanced parallel groups to receive either combined treatment&#xD;
      intracranial thrombectomy with carotid stenting or intracranial thrombectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and Intervention Intravenous thrombolysis will be administered if possible.&#xD;
      Standard MT will be performed with a balloon Guide Catheter (BGC). MT technique (contact&#xD;
      aspiration, stent retriever, or solumbra) will be left at the discretion of the operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the cervical disease, emergent carotid stenting will be performed if the patient&#xD;
      is randomized in the intervention arm. The order to treat (head first or neck first), and the&#xD;
      choice of a previous angioplasty of the extracranial carotid artery lesion will be left to&#xD;
      the interventionist discretion. An intravenous bolus of 250mg of Aspirin will be given at the&#xD;
      end of the procedure in case of absence of complication. (Aspirin 250mg IV up to Imaging&#xD;
      24H).A second antiplatelet agent is used if a thrombus is formed : IV or nasogastric tube&#xD;
      (choice by operator)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the superiority of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting&#xD;
      compared to intracranial thrombectomy alone on the complete reperfusion (mTICI 3 at the end&#xD;
      of the endovascular procedure) rate and on the rate of NIHSS ≥ 4 points improvement at 24&#xD;
      hours in AIS patients with a tandem occlusion of the anterior circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility and the efficacy of the combined approach associating&#xD;
           intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting compared to intracranial&#xD;
           thrombectomy alone using a composite criterion (mTICI3 at the end of the endovascular&#xD;
           procedure or NIHSS improvement ≥ 4 points at 24h).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the safety of intracranial thrombectomy and extracranial carotid stenting&#xD;
           compared to intracranial thrombectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the combined approach compared to&#xD;
           intracranial thrombectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Data and Safety Monitored Board (DSMB) will provide subject safety oversight and make&#xD;
      recommendations to the Sponsor regarding continuing enrollment, modifying, or stopping the&#xD;
      study early based upon a review of safety data and more specifically the comparative rates of&#xD;
      symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and, neurological worsening (NIHSS4 points increase), at&#xD;
      D1, and mortality rates. They will take into account in their decision making and&#xD;
      recommendations the rates of procedure-related and device-related events in the treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSMB meetings will be organized by call conference by the sponsor before the start of the&#xD;
      study and every year until the end of the study. The members will also receive the results of&#xD;
      interim analyses. Additional extraordinary meetings will be set if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be constituted with two independent clinicians and one expert in methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Estimates Prior data indicate that a reperfusion rate of 30% mTICI 3 was observed&#xD;
      with mechanical thrombectomy in patients with tandem lesions. Assuming acute carotid stenting&#xD;
      will bring a 15% gain, a sample size of 162 patients per group will allow to evidence such&#xD;
      gain with a 80% power at a 5% type I error (PS v3.0). Allowing 5% loss to follow up leads to&#xD;
      include 216 patients per group, i.e. 432 patients in total&#xD;
