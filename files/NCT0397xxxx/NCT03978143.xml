  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to estimate the relative bioavailability and palatability&#xD;
      of 2 new crizotinib formulations to the commercially available crizotinib formulated capsule&#xD;
      at a 250 mg dose administered under fasted conditions in adult healthy participants.&#xD;
      Additionally, this study aims to assess the safety and tolerability of crizotinib 250 mg&#xD;
      single dose in 4 formulations when given fasted, with high fat meal, or with a proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor in healthy participants. Finally, this study will explore the effect of food or&#xD;
      proton pump inhibitor on the pharmacokinetics of the 2 new crizotinib formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize 1 of the 2 new crizotinib formulations will have improved relative&#xD;
      bioavailability and palatability than the formulated capsule under fasted or fed conditions&#xD;
      with or without a proton pump inhibitor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants who are overtly healthy as determined by medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment&#xD;
             plan, laboratory tests, lifestyle considerations, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in Appendix 1, which includes&#xD;
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent&#xD;
             document (ICD) and in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurological, or&#xD;
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,&#xD;
             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy, gastric or&#xD;
             intestinal bypass surgery, cholecystectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition possibly affecting the ability to taste (eg, dysgeusia, respiratory&#xD;
             infection).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;&#xD;
             positive testing for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (HBcAb), or hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb). Hepatitis B vaccination is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory test abnormality that&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the participant inappropriate for entry into&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or&#xD;
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of crizotinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with history of known sensitivity to esomeprazole or substituted&#xD;
             benzimidazoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous administration with an investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives&#xD;
             preceding the first dose of crizotinib (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A positive urine drug test or cotinine test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening supine blood pressure (BP) ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm Hg (diastolic),&#xD;
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If BP is ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥90 mm&#xD;
             Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 BP&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that demonstrates clinically relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities that may affect participant safety or interpretation of study results&#xD;
             (eg, QT interval corrected using the Fridericia's method [QTcF] &gt;450 msec, complete&#xD;
             left bundle branch block [LBBB], signs of an acute or indeterminate-age myocardial&#xD;
             infarction, ST-T interval changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia, second- or&#xD;
             third-degree atrioventricular [AV] block, or serious bradyarrhythmias or&#xD;
             tachyarrhythmias). If QTcF exceeds 450 msec, or the QRS complex exceeds 120 msec, the&#xD;
             ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 3 QTcF or QRS complex&#xD;
             values should be used to determine the participant's eligibility. Computer-interpreted&#xD;
             ECGs should be overread by a physician experienced in reading ECGs before excluding&#xD;
             participants.&#xD;
&#xD;

             screening, as assessed by the study-specific laboratory and confirmed by a single&#xD;
             repeat test, if deemed necessary: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT level ≥1.5 ×&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN); Total bilirubin (TBili) level ≥1.5 × ULN; participants&#xD;
             with a history of Gilbert's syndrome may have direct bilirubin measured and would be&#xD;
             eligible for this study provided the direct bilirubin level is ≤ ULN; Estimated&#xD;
             glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (See Appendix 10.2 for&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of alcohol abuse or binge drinking and/or any other illicit drug use or&#xD;
             dependence within 6 months of Screening. Binge drinking is defined as a pattern of 5&#xD;
             (male) and 4 (female) or more alcoholic drinks in about 2 hours. As a general rule,&#xD;
             alcohol intake should not exceed 14 units per week (1 unit = 8 ounces (240 mL) beer,&#xD;
&#xD;
             1 ounce (30 mL) of 40% spirit or 3 ounces (90 mL) of wine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more&#xD;
             within 60 days prior to dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
