      This is a Phase II single center, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent, inoperable, and/or metastatic inflammatory breast cancer with lymphangitic spread&#xD;
      to the chest wall. Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab administered as an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion at 200 mg in 21-day treatment cycles and oral cyclophosphamide (CTX) 50 mg per day&#xD;
      in metronomic administration as a 21 days cycle Forty-six patients will be required for the&#xD;
      study. Key inclusion criteria are PDL1 (≥1%) positive and/or tumor infiltrating lymphocyte&#xD;
      positive (≥1%) locally advanced &quot;chest wall&quot; breast cancer (with or without distant&#xD;
      metastases), who have been treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be eligible for&#xD;
      this study. Patients with cutaneous metastases only (with or without evidence of primary&#xD;
      tumor) are eligible for the study. Key exclusion criteria included prior anti PD1 or anti&#xD;
      CTLA-4 or other immune pathway-targeted therapy. Patients with autoimmune diseases and/or&#xD;
      receiving drugs who interfere with the immune system will not be eligible.&#xD;

      This is a Phase II single center, open-label, non-randomized study in patients with locally&#xD;
      recurrent, inoperable, and/or metastatic inflammatory breast cancer with lymphangitic spread&#xD;
      to the chest wall. Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab administered as an intravenous&#xD;
      infusion at 200 mg in 21-day treatment cycles and oral cyclophosphamide (CTX) 50 mg per day&#xD;
      in metronomic administration as a 21 days cycle. Forty-six patients will be required for the&#xD;
      study. The study will be open to participants with histologically confirmed, inoperable,&#xD;
      locally recurrent and/or metastatic breast cancer (mBC) with lymphangitic spread to the chest&#xD;
      wall (chest wall disease), which had received one or more prior cytotoxic treatment. Key&#xD;
      exclusion criteria consist of prior anti-PD1, anti-CTLA-4 or other immune pathway-targeted&#xD;
      therapy. Patients with autoimmune diseases and/or receiving drugs who interfere with the&#xD;
      immune system will not be eligible. Patients will be monitored carefully for the development&#xD;
      of adverse experiences and will be monitored for clinical and/or radiographic evidence of&#xD;
      disease progression according to usual standards of clinical practice. Adverse experiences&#xD;
      will be evaluated according to criteria outlined in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for&#xD;
      Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. For individual patients that experience dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicities, criteria for dose modification of pembrolizumab and CTX are outlined in details&#xD;
      in the protocol. Treatment with pembrolizumab and metronomic chemotherapy will continue until&#xD;
      documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse events (as reported by the site),&#xD;
      intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, Investigator's&#xD;
      decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject,&#xD;
      noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, completion of 24 months of&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring the cessation of treatment.&#xD;
      Subjects who attain complete response (CR) confirmed by central radiology review may consider&#xD;
      stopping trial treatment after receiving at least 24 weeks of treatment. Subjects who&#xD;
      discontinue treatment after 24 months of therapy for reasons other than disease progression&#xD;
      or intolerability or who discontinue treatment after attaining a CR may be eligible for up to&#xD;
      one year of retreatment after they have experienced radiographic disease progression. The&#xD;
      decision to retreat will be at the discretion of the Investigator, only if no cancer&#xD;
      treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab, the subject still meets the&#xD;
      safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and the trial remains open.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: assessment of the efficacy of pembrolizumab and metronomic&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide according to immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) criteria in patients with&#xD;
      chest wall breast cancer. Primary endpoint will be objective response (confirmed CR or PR as&#xD;
      best overall response) based on irRECIST criteria and also based on evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: duration of response (DoR); time to progression (TTP); progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS); overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives: responses according to levels of PD-L1, measured by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry IHC in unresectable locoregional lesion. Responses according to levels&#xD;
      of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Responses according to ER status. Responses according to&#xD;
      FISH ratio and HER2 copy number. Tumor dynamics during the disease course as well as&#xD;
      emergence of new clones (i.e.: resistance mechanisms) by determination of circulating tumor&#xD;
      DNA (ctDNA). Sequencing of material from tumor biopsies to determine molecular profiles of&#xD;
      responders and non-responders. Evaluation of efficacy by immune-related RECIST (irRECIST)&#xD;
      (i.e.: irORR, irDoR, irPFS, irDCR). Through analysis of peripheral blood transcriptome in&#xD;
      patients treated with pembrolizumab and cyclophosphamide therapy (P and CTX) combination&#xD;
      therapy the investigators aim at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Defining baseline peripheral blood gene signatures associated with treatment&#xD;
           responsiveness (pre-treatment biomarkers);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Defining molecular perturbations associated with the administration P and CTX&#xD;
           combination therapy and their relationship with immune-related adverse events&#xD;
           (post-treatment predictive biomarkers) and clinical outcome.&#xD;
