  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, team and individual components of mFOCUS vs.&#xD;
      standard care by conducting a 4-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) of individuals&#xD;
      who are due for follow-up of an abnormal cancer screening test.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard care consists of well-characterized existing decision support and systems for&#xD;
      follow-up in these three participating primary care networks and their affiliated integrated&#xD;
      delivery systems (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dartmouth&#xD;
      Hitchcock Health, the largest health care provider in New Hampshire). The primary outcome&#xD;
      will be whether an individual receives follow-up, defined based on the type of screening&#xD;
      abnormality and organ type (breast, cervical, lung or colorectal cancer), within 120 days of&#xD;
      becoming eligible for mFOCUS. Secondary comparisons will assess multi- and cross-level&#xD;
      (individual, team, system) outcomes. The study design will allow us to examine the marginal&#xD;
      effectiveness of system, team and individual-level enhancements, and exploratory analyses&#xD;
      will address subgroups defined by race/ ethnicity, socioeconomic status and cancer type.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All individuals in this study will receive the current standard of care at Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Dartmouth Hitchcock for the follow-up of abnormal cancer screening tests (Arms 1-4). In addition to this standard of care, we will test 3 additional arms of increasing intensity of intervention: Arm 2-access to an IT platform to facilitate updates to HM modifiers and problem lists for visit-based reminders; Arm 3- the IT platform in addition to automated reminders to patients between visits and the care team; Arm 4-the IT platform, automated reminders, and administrative outreach and navigation to help with scheduling and to address social barriers to care.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>The intervention is not masked to the providers or the participants. Randomization status is masked to the participants but not the providers. Masking is not feasible because randomization will take place at the level of the practice and practices will need to be informed about intervention components that will be made available to patients in their practice and the health care team</masking_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        individuals who have an abnormal screen that is due for follow-up including:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Breast: women 40-80 years with an incident (i.e., newly detected) abnormal screening&#xD;
             mammogram or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cervical: women 21-65 years with an incident abnormal screening Pap.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Colorectal: adults 40-80 years with an abnormal screen, including incident FOBT (Fecal&#xD;
             Occult Blood Test) / FIT (Fecal Immunochemical Test), or prevalent colonoscopy.&#xD;
             Because of the long periods of time required for follow-up of colonoscopies, we will&#xD;
             look back over a 5-year period and will therefore find prevalent abnormalities that&#xD;
             become due for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lung: adults 55-80 years, current and former smokers, with an incident abnormal LDCT&#xD;
             (Low Dose Computed Topography) result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will exclude patients who:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  are not English or Spanish-speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have had prior cancer of the organ for each screening test (i.e., women with prior&#xD;
             breast cancer will not be tracked for breast cancer screening abnormalities) as these&#xD;
             individuals may have non-standard follow-up care recommendations.&#xD;
