  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to evaluate how the genetic makeup of Pancreatic Ductal&#xD;
      Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) can affect the response to FDA-approved chemotherapy treatment,&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX, given before surgery to remove the tumor. Certain types of PDAC tumors can be&#xD;
      surgically resected (removed). However, not all types of PDACs are resectable, especially if&#xD;
      they are close to important structures like blood vessels or intestines. These types of PDACs&#xD;
      are treated with chemotherapy such as FOLFIRINOX. Research studies showed that chemotherapy&#xD;
      after surgical resection of PDAC tumors reduced the risk of the cancer returning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is used to treat PDAC that has not spread outside of the pancreas and is not&#xD;
      resectable. FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy treatment that combines multiple chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents, including oxaliplatin, leucovorin, irinotecan, and 5-FU. Patients receive these&#xD;
      agents by intravenous infusion. Of these drugs, 5-FU requires you to return home with a&#xD;
      chemotherapy pump that will deliver chemotherapy over 46 hours. This regimen has been studied&#xD;
      in pancreatic cancer that has been removed with surgery as a method for preventing the cancer&#xD;
      from returning. Studies showed FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy reduced the risk of cancer returning&#xD;
      and increased patients survival. In this study, researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy given before surgery will make the cancer easier to remove with surgery and&#xD;
      increase the chances of the cancer staying away after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers have shown that pancreatic cancers are not all the same when you look at the DNA&#xD;
      and RNA that is inside a pancreatic cancer cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the expression of different genes in a cancer cell, some pancreatic cancers may&#xD;
      respond differently to chemotherapy. In this study researchers want to know if FOLFIRINOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy can change the genetic profile of the cancer. This will be studied by obtaining&#xD;
      a biopsy of the cancer before the start of chemotherapy, and after 8 treatments of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. They will also study cancer cells that will be collected from blood samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase II clinical trial designed to assess the impact of tumor and&#xD;
      stromal molecular subtypes on the efficacy of neoadjuvant FOLFIRNOX in untreated subjects&#xD;
      with resectable, borderline resectable and unresectable locally advanced pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Subjects will undergo an EUS-guided core biopsy of the pancreas prior&#xD;
      to treatment and after cycle 8 of FOLFIRINOX. Imaging will be performed after every 4 cycles&#xD;
      of chemotherapy (8 weeks) and reassessed for resectability after 12 cycles. If patients show&#xD;
      a response to treatment that is deemed by the surgical oncologist to be amenable to&#xD;
      resection, surgery can be pursued after 8 cycles of therapy. In this case, the remaining 4&#xD;
      cycles of treatment will be given after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease progression,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from the study, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Subjects will be followed for 36 months after removal from study treatment or until death,&#xD;
      whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events&#xD;
      will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
