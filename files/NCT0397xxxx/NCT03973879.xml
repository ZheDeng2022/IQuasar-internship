      This study evaluates the safety of PVSRIPO treatment in combination with Atezolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with WHO grade IV malignant glioma. All patients will receive a single PVSRIPO&#xD;
      infusion followed by atezolizumab infusions every three weeks for up to two years.&#xD;

      The purpose of this phase1b/2 study of atezolizumab in combination with oncolytic&#xD;
      polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) in patients with recurrent World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) grade IV malignant glioma is to assess the safety of the combination of PVSRIPO +&#xD;
      atezolizumab, as well as describe the survival of patients receiving this novel therapy&#xD;
      combination. Patients will receive an intratumoral infusion of PVSRIPO followed by&#xD;
      atezolizumab treatment with possible surgical resection after the first atezolizumab&#xD;
      treatment at the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a recurrent supratentorial WHO grade IV malignant glioma based on&#xD;
             imaging studies with measurable disease (≥ 1 cm and ≤ 5.5 cm of contrast-enhancing&#xD;
             tumor). Prior histopathology consistent with a WHO grade IV malignant glioma confirmed&#xD;
             by the study pathologist, Roger McLendon, or his designate. Assuming patient meets all&#xD;
             other criteria, the treating neurosurgeon must confirm placement of infusion catheter&#xD;
             tip can occur ≥ 1cm from ventricles and that procedures can be completed per their&#xD;
             medical judgement and in keeping with the protocol, when considering individual lesion&#xD;
             characteristics including location relative to eloquent brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient or partner(s) meets one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e. not sexually active, physiologically incapable&#xD;
                  of becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically&#xD;
                  sterile, or any male who has had a vasectomy). Surgically sterile females are&#xD;
                  defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
                  tubal ligation. Postmenopausal for purposes of this study is defined as 1 year&#xD;
                  without menses.; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the following methods of birth&#xD;
                  control: approved hormonal contraceptives (e.g. birth control pills, patches,&#xD;
                  implants, or infusions), an intrauterine device, or a barrier method of&#xD;
                  contraception (e.g. a condom or diaphragm) used with spermicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age at the time of entry into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) ≥ 70%&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl unsupported is necessary for eligibility on the study;&#xD;
             however, because of risks of intracranial hemorrhage with catheter placement, platelet&#xD;
             count ≥ 120,000/µl is required for the patient to undergo biopsy and catheter&#xD;
             insertion, which can be attained with the help of platelet transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.2 x normal range prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive serum anti-poliovirus titer prior to biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have received a boost immunization with trivalent inactivated IPOL™&#xD;
             (Sanofi-Pasteur) at least 1 week, but less than 6 weeks, prior to administration of&#xD;
             the study agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At the time of biopsy, prior to administration of virus, the presence of recurrent&#xD;
             tumor must be confirmed by histopathological analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A signed informed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) will&#xD;
             be required for patient enrollment into the study. Patients must be able to read and&#xD;

             proximal muscle weakness, and atrophy of proximal muscle groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior, unrelated malignancy requiring current active treatment with the&#xD;
             exception of cervical carcinoma in situ and adequately treated basal cell or squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        NOTE: If a patient is treated for an unrelated malignancy other than the exceptions noted&#xD;
        within the past 3 years, a letter from their treating oncologist for the unrelated&#xD;
        malignancy must be on file confirming that said unrelated malignancy does not require&#xD;
        current active treatment (prophylactic like tamoxifen OK) and that the patient is stable&#xD;
        with low risk of recurrence/death within 3 years from this other malignancy (i.e., disease&#xD;
        is stable). If this letter is not on file, a consult with the Sponsor's medical designee is&#xD;
        required prior to submitting the patient for consideration of enrollment in the trial.&#xD;
