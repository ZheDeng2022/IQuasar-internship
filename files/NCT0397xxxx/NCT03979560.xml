  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the hospital, one out of every two elderly people is malnourished. This condition of&#xD;
      undernutrition generally worsens during hospitalization, where the effects of polypathology&#xD;
      and psychological distress are added. Muscle loss due to inadequate dietary intake,&#xD;
      hypermetabolism and immobilization results in the onset or worsening of mobility disorders&#xD;
      and functional decline. After hospitalization, 30-50% of elderly people hospitalized in&#xD;
      emergency in medical departments have lost autonomy in daily life. Nutritional management and&#xD;
      adaptive physical activity (APA) could have synergistic action to improve the nutritional&#xD;
      status and mobility of elderly patients. The short duration of the average stay the acute&#xD;
      geriatric units (10-15 days) is not enough to renew, nor to re-educate patients. It seems&#xD;
      important to continue these actions at home. The implementation of programs combining&#xD;
      nutrition and adapted physical activity (APA) at the hospital exit has not been studied to&#xD;
      date. We formulate the hypothesis that in elderly people who are malnourished or at risk of&#xD;
      undernutrition, after hospitalization, a personalized home intervention combining nutritional&#xD;
      advice and appropriate physical activity will limit their loss of autonomy.&#xD;

      Interventional study with minimal risk and constraints, prospective, multicentre, randomised&#xD;
      and controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older people at least 70 years, malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, on discharge&#xD;
           from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informal caregivers of patients included in study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention at home of professionals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mixed intervention: nutritional support, carried out by the dieticians of &quot; Saveurs et Vie &quot;,&#xD;
      in seven sessions over three months, combined with an adapted physical activity intervention&#xD;
      (APA), carried out by &quot; Siel Bleu &quot; professionals, also at a frequency of seven sessions over&#xD;
      three months, for a total of fourteen sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control arm will benefit from usual support (depending on practices of the department,&#xD;
      prescription or not of oral nutritional supplements and physiotherapy at home, but without&#xD;
      home intervention of adapted physical activity professionals or dieticians).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to screening/inclusion visits (D0), three follow-up home visits are scheduled at&#xD;
      D7, D45 and D90 for both study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion visit (D0), performed in hospital in geriatric ward prior to hospital discharge.&#xD;
      Verification of inclusion criteria, collection of consent by investigator, randomization,&#xD;
      collection of inclusion data (socio-educational level, family status, assessment of autonomy&#xD;
      (ADL, IADL, AGGIR) number of drugs, comorbidity (CIRS-G), cognitive status, biology performed&#xD;
      during hospitalization (albumin, CRP, Vitamin D) and discharge prescription (NOC, nutritional&#xD;
      advice, physiotherapy) are programmed to D7, D45 and D90 for both study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits to D7, D45 and D90, carried out at home by a clinal research technician&#xD;
      mandated by sponsor (Gérond'if). Assessment of autonomy (ADL, IADL, AGGIR scale), nutritional&#xD;
      status (weight, height, self-evaluation of appetite, MNA), functional status (Grinding&#xD;
      strength, 4-metre walking speed, SPPB), quality of life (EQ-5D), frequency and transit time&#xD;
      of home help workers, whether family or professional. Acceptability of interventions for the&#xD;
      home intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 patient/arms, a total of 372 patients divided as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventional arm : Nutrition intervention with appropriate physical activity for 186&#xD;
           patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: standard care for 186 other patients And up to 160 informal caregivers&#xD;
           (family members) in both groups, or 80 caregivers per group (one caregiver per patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion period: 15 months. Follow-up period: 3 months/subject (patients and caregivers)&#xD;
      Total length of study: 18 months&#xD;
