    <textblock>
      enroll patients with histologically confirmed high-grade gliomas to evaluate the ability of&#xD;
      regadenoson to transiently disrupt a relatively intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). determine&#xD;
      the best dose of regadenoson to disrupt the BBB and allow for enhanced penetration of&#xD;
      gadolinium during MRI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if there is a dose of regadenoson, in the range shown to be safe for clinical&#xD;
      administration, that can increase gadolinium Ktrans by more than 10 times the values reported&#xD;
      in the literature within normal-appearing brain parenchyma with a previously documented&#xD;
      intact blood-brain barrier in patients with high grade gliomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To determine if there is a dose of regadenoson, in the range shown to be&#xD;
      safe for clinical administration, that can substantially alter the normalized, contrast&#xD;
      enhanced MRI signal intensity in normal-appearing tissues and in: A) Brain adjacent to tumor&#xD;
      (i.e. T2 hyperintense, but without contrast enhancement before regadenoson) and B) Contrast&#xD;
      enhancing tumor (with contrast enhancement before regadenoson).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I Treatment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I of the protocol is designed to identify the best regadenoson dose(s) to transiently&#xD;
      disrupt the blood-brain barrier as measured by DCE-MRI and contrast enhancement on&#xD;
      T1-weighted images corresponding to an increase in the accumulation of MRI contrast&#xD;
      (gadolinium) into normal appearing brain contralateral to the brain tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are at low risk of having complications with a standard regadenoson cardiac&#xD;
      stress test (young with no known cardiac disease) and who have had stable MRI scans for at&#xD;
      least 2 months prior to enrollment will be asked to undergo a research MRI within two weeks&#xD;
      after their most recent previous MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II Treatment Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II will be initiated if the first portion of the study identifies one or more doses of&#xD;
      regadenoson that meets the desired endpoint of a Ktrans value &gt;0.04 min-1 within&#xD;
      contralateral normal-appearing brain following regadenoson administration. Part II patients&#xD;
      will undergo more extensive imaging prior to regadenoson administration to confirm that&#xD;
      regadenoson has a significant effect on the BBB using a more comprehensive imaging approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five additional patients who are at low risk to have complications of a standard chemical&#xD;
      cardiac stress test (young with no known significant cardiac disease) will be sequentially&#xD;
      enrolled at each regadenoson dose meeting the desired endpoint in Part I. In these cohorts,&#xD;
      the full research imaging protocol will be utilized in both the pre- and post-regadenoson MRI&#xD;
      scans which will allow a direct comparison of all imaging parameters in both the&#xD;
      pre-regadenoson and post-regadenoson settings to be directly compared.&#xD;
