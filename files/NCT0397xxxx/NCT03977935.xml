  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical application of the second-generation MCCG&#xD;
      with higher image resolution and frame rate for upper gastrointestinal tract compared with&#xD;
      the first-generation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Magnetically controlled capsule gastroscopy (MCCG) has been widely used in clinical practice&#xD;
      for gastric examination. However, there still exist blind spots under MCCG, particularly in&#xD;
      the esophagus and duodenum. Although the anatomy of the esophagus and duodenum can be the&#xD;
      main cause, MCCG still needs technical improvement. In addition, the gastric examination time&#xD;
      under MCCG can be further optimized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a new-generation MCCG is developed with a higher frame rate improved from 0.5-2 to&#xD;
      0.5-8 frames per second, image resolution improved from 480 x 480 to 720 x 720, view angle&#xD;
      improved from 140° to 150°, wireless anti-jamming technology is applied as a more effective&#xD;
      and stable information transmission method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, single-centered, blinded randomized controlled pilot study. Subjects&#xD;
      receiving MCCG at Changhai Hospital will be randomly allocated into two groups with a ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1 before the procedure, the first-generation or the second-generation MCCG. After&#xD;
      passage through the esophagus, the gastric examination and transpyloric passage of the&#xD;
      capsule is conducted under magnetic steering, and then examination is continued in the small&#xD;
      bowel under intestinal peristalsis.&#xD;

    <measure>Manipulation Performance Score of the MCCG</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 minutes after the examination</time_frame>
    <description>The performance of maneuverability is assessed using a semi-quantitative score related to the fluency, stability and comfortableness for examination procedure. Fluency is mainly reflected on the response speed to operation and smoothness of video playing. Stability is about the ability of holding the position for a long enough time and the real-time viewing of all images. comfortableness is the operator's sensation about manipulative force and fatigue degree. Maneuverability score was defined as a total scale of 3 to 15 calculated by adding up each evaluation index score above, and each index was graded from 1 to 5, with 1 as the worst and 5 as the best.</description>

    <description>The patients swallowed the first-generation MCCG with a small amount of water in the left lateral decubitus position. Once the capsule reached the stomach after investigating the esophagus, it was lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated and advanced to the fundus and cardiac regions, and then to the gastric body, angulus, antrum and pylorus. After finishing the stomach examination twice, the endoscopist controlled the capsule to face the pylorus and drag it close to the pylorus. The capsule would enter the duodenal bulb and was held stationary to investigate the duodenal bulb using the &quot;360-degree automatic scanning&quot; mode. In the descending part of duodenum, the endoscopist tried to control the capsule to view the major papilla. After passing through the duodenum, the capsule started to complete the small-bowel examination with the &quot;small-bowel mode&quot;. The magnetic steering time for passing through the pylorus was not allowed more than 15 min.</description>

Once the capsule reached the stomach after investigating the esophagus, it was lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated and advanced to the fundus and cardiac regions, and then to the gastric body, angulus, antrum and pylorus. After finishing the stomach examination twice, the endoscopist controlled the capsule to face the pylorus and drag it close to the pylorus. The capsule would enter the duodenal bulb and was held stationary to investigate the duodenal bulb using the &quot;360-degree automatic scanning&quot; mode. In the descending part of duodenum, the endoscopist tried to control the capsule to view the major papilla. After passing through the duodenum, the capsule started to complete the small-bowel examination with the &quot;small-bowel mode&quot;. The magnetic steering time for passing through the pylorus was not allowed more than 15 min.</description>

        <title>Manipulation Performance Score of the MCCG</title>
        <description>The performance of maneuverability is assessed using a semi-quantitative score related to the fluency, stability and comfortableness for examination procedure. Fluency is mainly reflected on the response speed to operation and smoothness of video playing. Stability is about the ability of holding the position for a long enough time and the real-time viewing of all images. comfortableness is the operator's sensation about manipulative force and fatigue degree. Maneuverability score was defined as a total scale of 3 to 15 calculated by adding up each evaluation index score above, and each index was graded from 1 to 5, with 1 as the worst and 5 as the best.</description>

            <description>The patients swallowed the first-generation MCCG with a small amount of water in the left lateral decubitus position. Once the capsule reached the stomach after investigating the esophagus, it was lifted away from the posterior wall, rotated and advanced to the fundus and cardiac regions, and then to the gastric body, angulus, antrum and pylorus. After finishing the stomach examination twice, the endoscopist controlled the capsule to face the pylorus and drag it close to the pylorus. The capsule would enter the duodenal bulb and was held stationary to investigate the duodenal bulb using the &quot;360-degree automatic scanning&quot; mode. In the descending part of duodenum, the endoscopist tried to control the capsule to view the major papilla. After passing through the duodenum, the capsule started to complete the small-bowel examination with the &quot;small-bowel mode&quot;. The magnetic steering time for passing through the pylorus was not allowed more than 15 min.</description>
