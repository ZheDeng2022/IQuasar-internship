  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant complication following non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      We sought to evaluate incidence of perioperative MI, its preoperative - and intraoperative -&#xD;
      risk factors and outcomes after this complication.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sweden, over 800 000 patents undergo surgery each year. Worldwide, the number of surgical&#xD;
      procedures yearly is over 310 million. Surgical care is en essential part of the advancement&#xD;
      in treating disease, associated with increased lift expectancy a d improved quality of life.&#xD;
      However as surgical volume continues to grow, the number of patients who suffer postoperative&#xD;
      complications will also increase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic instability in the perioperative period is frequent and there has been a&#xD;
      cumulative interest in this area and the relation to organ failure over the recent years.&#xD;
      There are several studies showing results of associations between intraoperative hypotensive&#xD;
      events and perioperative cardiac, kidney and cerebral injury, as well as increased mortality&#xD;
      in high-risk surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically the project aims to answer how intraoperative events, with a special focus&#xD;
      on hypotension, are related to perioperative myocardial and kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that patients, with preoperative risk factors, undergoing major non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery are at increased risk of developing perioperative organ damage in the presence of&#xD;
      intraoperative hypotension or other events such as tachycardia, hypoxia and extensive blood&#xD;
      loss.&#xD;
