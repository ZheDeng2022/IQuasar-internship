      This study evaluates the efficacy of home-based high tone external muscle stimulation (HTEMS)&#xD;
      compared to transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). One half of the participants will receive TENS therapy, the&#xD;
      other half will receive High tone external muscle Stimulation. It is expected that HTEMS&#xD;
      improves symptoms of CIPN.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common adverse side effects of chemotherapeutic agents especially in taxanes,&#xD;
      platins or vinca alkaloids is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Prevalence&#xD;
      of CIPN was reported in 30% to 40% of patients treated with neurotoxic chemotherapy and may&#xD;
      be transient or permanent. It appears predominantly as sensory neuropathy and affects the&#xD;
      peripheral parts of the extremities in a &quot;stocking and glove&quot;-distribution. CIPN often&#xD;
      presents with symptoms like paresthesia, pain, numbness or tingling, but motor symptoms can&#xD;
      occur as well. Symptoms of CIPN may lead to dose reduction or even early cessation of&#xD;
      chemotherapy and therefore may affect overall survival in cancer patients. Currently, no&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment (drug or non-drug therapy) is available for CIPN. Several approaches&#xD;
      to manage peripheral neuropathy have been proposed, but evidence showing a benefit of these&#xD;
      procedures regarding clinically relevant endpoints is scarce. One promising approach to ease&#xD;
      CIPN symptoms is the application of electrotherapy. Different types of electrical sensory&#xD;
      interventions have been explored in the literature e.g. transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (TENS) and high-tone external muscle stimulation (HTEMS).TENS is used in medical&#xD;
      settings and in self-administration of patients at home. In TENS only the frequency is&#xD;
      modulated. The device sends electrical impulses through conductive rubber electrodes to the&#xD;
      skin of the impaired region. The applied frequencies range from 2 to 120 Hertz. The pain&#xD;
      region must be in the middle of the two electrodes, which have a maximum distance of 20cm. In&#xD;
      contrast to the TENS therapy, the HTEMS operates in-depth directly on the muscle and produces&#xD;
      pleasant, but intense and thus effective contractions. Additionally in HTEMS, the amplitude&#xD;
      and the frequency are modulated simultaneously. The applied frequencies range continuously&#xD;
      from 4096 to 32768 Hertz. Different frequencies activate structures of different size. For&#xD;
      this reason, it is important to offer a broad spectrum of frequencies. The electrical&#xD;
      stimulation is applied by using conductive rubber electrodes. On the upper limbs as well as&#xD;
      on the lower limbs the electrodes are positioned as far as possible proximal and distal.&#xD;
      During the treatment the muscle is stimulated to contraction through intervals. One interval&#xD;
      consists of three seconds ramp-up time (intensity rises), three seconds holding time&#xD;
      (intensity maintains on maximum) and three seconds pause (no stimulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of HTEMS has been shown to be more effective than TENS in the therapy of&#xD;
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Furthermore, HTEMS demonstrated improvement in pain,&#xD;
      discomfort, sleep disturbance and quality of life in patients with end-stage renal disease&#xD;
      due to uremic peripheral neuropathy. So far, little research on HTEMS or TENS in CIPN has&#xD;
      been carried out, even if this approach is used in clinical practice. The aim of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the effect and feasibility of home-based HTEMS in patients with&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be based on a single blinded randomised controlled trial study design&#xD;
      with an observation time of eight weeks. Patients with cancer receiving a taxan-or&#xD;
      platin-based chemotherapy and symptoms of CIPN will be included. Subjects will be stratified&#xD;
      by treatment delivery, taxan and platin. The therapy will start after completed adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy after a time period of 4 weeks minimum to exclude patients with spontaneous&#xD;
      remission of CIPN and in order to reduce the effect of any known or unknown biases related to&#xD;
      the treatment regime. Potential study participants will receive information about the study&#xD;
      as soon as symptoms occurred to plan inclusion, randomisation and allocation of appointments.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a TENS or HTEMS device after randomisation. Participants who are&#xD;
      allocated to the control intervention group will receive TENS therapy. The participant is&#xD;
      educated for home-based therapy and the treatment should be used daily for 30 minutes for 8&#xD;
      weeks. Additionally, participants' compliance will be checked by reading out the tool box.&#xD;
      Participants are asked to fill out the EORTC CIPN 20 (chemotherapy-induced) and EORTC QLQ-C30&#xD;
      (quality of life) questionnaire at baseline and after 8 weeks. Clinical examination&#xD;
      encompassing vibration sensibility, tendon reflexes, temperature sensibility perception of&#xD;
      touch and muscel strength will be conducted at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would prefer not to constrain patients to specific daily time points and&#xD;
      disturb their individual rhythm. Therefore, the investigators recommend performing the&#xD;
      intervention at a regular daily time point adapted to the individual daily routine. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint is a change in the EORTC-QLQ-CIPN20 score during the eight weeks of&#xD;
      intervention. For our primary endpoint the investigators will use an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis according to the CONSORT statement. Furthermore, the investigators will analyse the&#xD;
      intensity of intervention (compliance) and the effect on the primary endpoint (for example&#xD;
      comparison of infrequently and frequently use of device). A minimum use on 5 of 7days per&#xD;
      week is required.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The random allocation sequence will be generated using the random number generator available online (www.randomization.com). The unit of randomization will be the individual participant, such that each patient will be randomised to either have use of the HTEMS device (intervention), or TENS device (control intervention). To ensure balance in the sample size across groups, we will perform a stratified block randomisation (ratio 1:1, block size 4). Subjects will be stratified by treatment delivery, taxan and oxaliplatin. To assure concealment of allocation, physicians of the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation will report to the Institute of General Practice, Family Medicine and Preventive Medicine as soon as patient recruitment has been completed and then randomisation by computerised sequence generation will be performed.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>After baseline data and outcome assessment participants will consecutively be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Thus, neither patients nor the responsible physician will know about the allocation to the HTEMS or TENS group at the time of recruitment.&#xD;
Physicians responsible for the clinical examinations and outcome assessment will be blinded. Due to the technical design of the intervention patients cannot be blinded. The analyst and outcome assessors will be kept blind to patient allocation.</masking_description>

    <measure>Improvement of CIPN associated symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of CIPN associated Symptoms will be assessed according to the EORTC CIPN 20 questionnaire.The EORTC QLQ-CIPN 20 contains 20 items assessing sensory (9 items), motor (8 items), and autonomic symptoms (3 items), using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 2 = &quot;a little,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;). All scale scores are linearly converted to a 0-100 scale (0=no sensory impairment, 100=worst sensory impairment)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QLQ-C30 Version 3.0 is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. The functional scales and the symptom scales have four-point scales. These are coded with &quot;Not at all&quot;, &quot;A little&quot;, &quot;Quite a bit&quot; and &quot;Very much.&quot; The global health status includes 2 items and an item range of 6 from &quot;Very bad&quot; to &quot;Excellent&quot;. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. The principle for scoring is the same in all cases: Estimate the average of the items that contribute to the scale; this is the Raw Score. Use a linear transformation to standardise the Raw Score, so that scores range from 0 to 100. For all scales, the Raw Score is the mean of the component items calculated with a formula included in the manual.</description>
