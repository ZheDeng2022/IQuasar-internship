    <textblock>
      Open label randomized controlled trial comparing evidenced based physical/occupational&#xD;
      therapy vs. physical/occupational therapy including blood flow restriction tourniquet in the&#xD;
      treatment of lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to one of two groups, and treatment will be open label and&#xD;
      unblinded. A target of 44 patients for enrollment has been set for 80% power. Treatment will&#xD;
      last for 6 visits with physical therapy with recommended visit intervals of 1 week :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Group: Evidence based physical/occupational therapy, with the addition of&#xD;
      therapeutic exercises using a blood flow restriction tourniquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: Patients will receive standard evidence based physical therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome (Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation [PRTEE]) will be collected at&#xD;
      enrollment, 3, 6, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be collected at the beginning and end of physical therapy&#xD;
      interventions (change in: numeric pain rating scale, maximum pain free grip strength, pain&#xD;
      free grip strength). We will collect treatments received after the end of physical therapy&#xD;
      and before final follow up.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnoses included are lateral elbow pain, lateral epicondylitis, or lateral&#xD;

             last year on contralateral upper extremity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of lymphectomy (such as axillary exploration with breast surgery, lymph node&#xD;
             biopsy in the affected axilla/arm)&#xD;
