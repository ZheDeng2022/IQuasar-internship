      <textblock>
        Adult and pediatric patients who weigh ≥13 kg who receive FDA-approved TPOXX as part of&#xD;
        their medical treatment for variola virus (VARV) infection in the United States (US). These&#xD;
        patients will have suspected, probable, or confirmed smallpox. The purpose of this field&#xD;
        study is to evaluate the safety, survival status, time to death, and smallpox rash&#xD;
        progression in patients who are receiving TPOXX for the treatment of smallpox in the US&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent or assent themselves or through a guardian or legally&#xD;
             authorized representative, receiving or initiating treatment with TPOXX, and willing&#xD;
             and able to adhere to the recommended procedures in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Determined, per the clinical definition of smallpox, that the patient presenting with&#xD;
             a case of acute, generalized vesicular/pustular rash meets Centers for Disease Control&#xD;
             and Prevention (CDC) criteria of having confirmed, suspected, or probable smallpox&#xD;
             and/or is at high or moderate risk for developing smallpox.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The CDC in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services/Assistant&#xD;
             Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) has released TPOXX to the physician or&#xD;
             designated health authorities for patient treatment, and the CDC has provided&#xD;
             physician contact information to PPD, the contract research organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Known allergy to tecovirimat and/or excipients of TPOXX.&#xD;
