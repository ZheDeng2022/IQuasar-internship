  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, partially blinded clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be&#xD;
      administered experimental malaria vaccines. There will be seven experimental groups of&#xD;
      volunteers, of which five receive vaccination with the novel malaria vaccine candidate, R21,&#xD;
      in combination with the vaccine adjuvant, Matrix M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the safety &amp; immune responses to vaccination, and the efficacy of the&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arms 1a &amp; 1b receive vaccines at 3 vaccinations at 4 week intervals and a booster vaccination&#xD;
      approximately 12 months after the first vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms 2a &amp; 2b receive 3 vaccinations at 0, 4 and 24 weeks. The protected volunteers in 2a from&#xD;
      the first malaria challenge, VAC072A, will receive a booster vaccination 28 days before the&#xD;
      rechallenge, VAC072B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms 3a and 3b receive 3 vaccinations at 0, 4 and 8 weeks. The protected volunteers in 3a&#xD;
      from the first malaria challenge, VAC072A, will receive a booster vaccination 28 days before&#xD;
      the rechallenge, VAC072B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms 4a and 4b will receive 3 vaccinations at 0, 4 and 24 weeks. The third dose is&#xD;
      fractional. Volunteers then have the option to be challenged 28 days after final vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5 will receive 3 vaccinations at 0, 4 and 24 weeks. The third dose is fractional.&#xD;
      Volunteers then have the option to be challenged 28 days after final vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 6 &amp; 7 are control groups and will receive controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in England across four research sites in Oxford, London,&#xD;
      and Southampton.&#xD;
