    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk of postoperative psychiatric disorders&#xD;
      of depression, anxiety outcomes and sexual dysfunctions and self esteem disturbance in women&#xD;
      with morbidly adherent placenta following hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women with morbidly adherent placenta, We will predict, evaluate and decrease the&#xD;
      psychological disorders following hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is there any difference in psychological outcome between caesarean section and caesarean&#xD;
      hysterectomy ? This study aims to assess the psychological outcome in women with morbidly&#xD;
      adherent placenta following hysterectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbidly adherent placenta, which describes placenta accreta, increta, and percreta, implies&#xD;
      an abnormal implantation of the placenta into the uterine wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of placenta accreta has increased significantly over the past several decades,&#xD;
      with the main risk factors include prior cesarean section and placental previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no well-designed trials have yet assessed the psychological outcome of women with&#xD;
      morbidly adherent placenta following hystrectomy. The investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective matched case control trial to evaluate the psychological outcome to assess the&#xD;
      risk of depression ,anxiety , sexual dysfunctions and self esteem disturbance following&#xD;
      hysterectomy in women with morbidly adherent placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Prospective matched case-control trial will take place at Ain Shams University Maternity&#xD;
      Hospital. Women in child bearing period, with morbidly adherent placenta will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placenta accreta (Morbidly adherent placenta) is a condition in which all or part of the&#xD;
      placenta is adherent to the uterine wall because of myometrial invasion by chorionic villi.&#xD;
      It may occur when there is either a primary deficiency of or a secondary damage to chorionic&#xD;
      villi or Nitabuch's layer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidly adherent placenta occurs in 5% of women with placenta previa. In some pregnancies,&#xD;
      the placenta may develop at an abnormal location or may extensively invade the adjacent&#xD;
      myometrium. Clinical entities include placenta previa, in which trophoblastic cells implant&#xD;
      over or near the internal cervical os .In other cases, trophoblast aggressively burrows into&#xD;
      the myometrium. Depending on the invasion depth, placenta accreta, placenta increta, or&#xD;
      placenta percreta is diagnosed. The term placenta accrete syndromes is clinically useful to&#xD;
      summarize these three types. Another interchangeable phrase also often used is morbidly&#xD;
      adherent placenta .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assisted reproductive technology and maternal smoking increase the risk of placenta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of accrete in women with a placenta previa and a prior caesarean section increased&#xD;
      from 3% with one previous caesarean section to 11%, 40%, 61% and 67% with two, three, four,&#xD;
      or more repeat caesarean sections respectively .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternal mortality risk may reach 7 % and the extensive surgery related morbidities&#xD;
      include massive transfusions, infections, urologic injuries and fistula formation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women often consider the uterus to be a sexual organ, and the controller and regulator of&#xD;
      important physiological functions in the body, as well as the source of youth, energy,&#xD;
      activity, and a symbol of child-bearing capacity .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between hysterectomies and psychological disorders has been raised since the&#xD;
      beginning of the 1990s. For example, in 1997, Thompson reported that there was a probability&#xD;
      of psychoses in women after hysterectomies; and within the three years following the surgery,&#xD;
      33% of the women experienced symptoms of depression .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three broad subsets of psychological symptoms. These are: anxiety and depression&#xD;
      attributed to the operation, sexual dysfunction (presenting as diminished libido, pain,&#xD;
      dyspareunia or anxiety surrounding sexual activity) and reactions related to perceptions of&#xD;
      feminity and low self-esteem.&#xD;

    <description>All patients will be subjected to fulfill Questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the patients who are invited to participate in the research through SCID I .Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID I) is a flexible semi structured diagnostic interview designed for use by trained clinicians to diagnose many adult DSM-IV axis I clinical disorders. It includes 7 diagnostic modules, focused on different diagnostic groups: mood, psychotic, substance abuse, anxiety, somatoform, eating and adjustment disorders then using Beck depression inventory scale.This is an inventory used for assessing the severity of depression state. It consists of 21 items, each of which has four responses of increasing severity. Numerical values from 0-3 are assigned each statement to indicate the degree of severity. The Arabic version will be used for the study.</description>

    <description>All patients will be subjected to fulfill Questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the patients who are invited to participate in the research through a a test which is a brief questionnaire measure of sexual functioning in women. It is 19-item questionnaire has been developed as a multidimensional self-report instrument for assessing the key dimensions of sexual function in women. It provides scores on six domains of sexual function (desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain) as well as a total score. The FSFI total score varies between 1.2 and 36, a score â‰¤ 26 defines sexual dysfunction. It is not a measure of sexual experience, knowledge, attitude, or interpersonal functioning in women. The Arabic version used in this research was a validated, reliable, and locally accepted tool for use in the assessment of female sexual disorder in the Egyptian population .</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be subjected to fulfill Questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the patients who are invited to participate in the research through Taylor scale. It is performed to assess the anxiety state. This early instrument is derived from the MMPI in which the patient has to answer Yes or No to these questions, which are phrased in formal Arabic and can be understood by all those people who can read simple Arabic.</description>

    <measure>Self-esteem disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All patients will be subjected to fulfill Questionnaire after obtaining informed consent from the patients who are invited to participate in the research. The self esteem scale is an Arabic self reported questionnaire designed to assess the overall self esteem of the reporter. It measures the self view of the reporter to his capabilities in different situations, for example: social situations, interpersonal relations, future ambitions and previous accomplishments.&#xD;
It is composed of 30 items rated as follows: frequently = 2, sometimes = 1 and never = 0. Items indicating low self esteem are inversely scored. Scoring is done by summing the ordinary questions and inversely scored questions. Higher scores indicate higher self esteem.&#xD;
The instrument showed good internal consistency reliability (0.76). The construct convenient of the scale is fairly supported by factor analysis and convergent validation with other scales measuring self esteem</description>
