      This study aims to explore learning process in a role play for undergraduate students working&#xD;
      on psychiatric interview. This study is one of the 3 studies included in a PhD on learning&#xD;
      process during simulation training in psychiatry. The results of this 3 studies will aim at&#xD;
      building a formative and summative assessment tool of competences specific to this pedagogic&#xD;
      context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Mixed method study with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self-reported questionnaries : &quot; Learning Effectiveness Inventory Scale &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sociodemographical data and others questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative : Grounded Theory&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Semi-structured interview of learners and teachers&#xD;

      Since the end of the nineties, pedagogical transformations question traditional pedagogical&#xD;
      system which favored a passive learning from master to student, trying to overcome classical&#xD;
      &quot; teaching paradigm&quot; to &quot; learning paradigm &quot;. Despite several critics, the notion of &quot;&#xD;
      professional competence &quot; emerges as one of the essential purpose of learning. Competence&#xD;
      might be defined as &quot; complex ability that professional built, starting from a specialized&#xD;
      knowledge base, developed and controlled by a collegial peer who constitute the profession &quot;,&#xD;
      implying &quot; a reflexive practice inside and after action &quot; which creates or increases new&#xD;
      competence in return.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However in french context, this paradigmatic revolution didn't really happened yet, including&#xD;
      in psychiatry. Moreover, to our knowledge, there are no engineering didactic work on specific&#xD;
      skills required by a physician (psychiatrist or not) should have in care of a patient with&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders. For instance, skills required when a surgeon has to deliver a &quot;clear,&#xD;
      loyal and adjusted&quot; information to a patient with a schizophrenia ; and try to get his or her&#xD;
      agreement so as to operate a intestinal blockage? As a matter of facts, no integrated&#xD;
      competence referential will be able to be a reference in this work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a report which is nowadays a reference for the faculties of medicine all over the world,&#xD;
      the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (CRMCC) define a framework of&#xD;
      essential skills that each physician have to control: medical expertise, erudition ;&#xD;
      communicational and relational abilities; collaboration ; professionalism ; management;&#xD;
      health promotion. In the French context, skills that each medical student have to provide for&#xD;
      the psychiatric speciality are defined by 33 questions of national classifying exam (ECN).&#xD;
      The &quot; Psychiatry and Addictology Referential &quot; points to medical students the reference&#xD;
      knowledge to provide to respond to these questions during the challenge of ECN. But this&#xD;
      referential doesn't explain skills, abilities and attitudes required with a patient with&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The places of providing essential skills defined by CRMCC applied in French psychiatry (as&#xD;
      relational and communicational skills for instance) are thus often situated in others spaces.&#xD;
      Realization of well supervised clerkship in psychiatry constitutes for example one of the&#xD;
      privilege way of skills acquisition. Nonetheless in French context, all the undergraduate&#xD;
      students can benefit from psychiatry during their clerkship; especially because of the&#xD;
      rarefaction of well supervised internship (decreasing demography of psychiatrist), associated&#xD;
      with increase number of medical student over the past few years. Moreover, realisation of an&#xD;
      only internship can not include all the diversity of main family situation that should be&#xD;
      known by each physician; mainly because of dichotomy of internship between adult and child&#xD;
      and adolescent psychiatry, specific populations specific who go to different service&#xD;
      according to there trouble (emergencies, closed unit, expert diagnosis centersâ€¦). Providing&#xD;
      pedagogical tools allowing acquisition of basic skills, abilities and attitudes&#xD;
      (complementary to knowledge and know-repeat) to care patient with psychiatric disorders seems&#xD;
      thus interesting, for improving medical training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, assessment modalities determine for students work methodology and time involved in&#xD;
      each learning, following Hawthorne effect. Assessments support learning assessed, involving&#xD;
      long term memory, following &quot; testing effect &quot; ; and hierarchize planning of ulterior&#xD;
      learning activities. Trials of ECN in this current shape will probably value acquisition of&#xD;
      declarative knowledge for students who would like to succeed in the competition; to the&#xD;
      detriment of know-how and life skills. These skills to care patients who suffer from&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders won't be neither provided during a specialty residency, unless it might&#xD;
      be especially oriented to psychiatry. Thus, it seems important to wider summative assessment&#xD;
      modalities in psychiatry during undergraduate medical studies, so as to value acquisition of&#xD;
      the wall skills required for a physician in care of a patient with psychiatric disorders.&#xD;
      Which implies precise explanation of skills, abilities and attitudes needed, to balance&#xD;
      success of ECN with their acquisition. In that context, simulation can offer a good response&#xD;
      to this double aim : formative et summative. However, if some theorical approach are&#xD;
      references to understand learning process in simulation, very few learning tool are validated&#xD;
      in simulation, and none, to our knowledge, did a modelisation on learning process in&#xD;
      psychiatric simulation for medical students.&#xD;
