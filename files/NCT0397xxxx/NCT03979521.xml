      Questionnaire-based survey addressed to german patients with the chronic autoimmune muscle&#xD;
      disease called myasthenia gravis regarding quality of life, socioeconomic impact, social&#xD;
      support, course of disease, complications of therapy and psychological comorbidities.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myasthenia gravis is a rare, chronic, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease that results in&#xD;
      muscular weakness. The patients suffer from symptoms such as visual disturbances (especially&#xD;
      double vision), weakness in the arms and legs, chewing and swallowing disorders and&#xD;
      respiratory disorders, as well as crisis-related worsening of ventilation. This is often&#xD;
      accompanied by pronounced fatigue (physical) and mental fatigue (depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite drug therapies that are on one hand symptomatic improving muscle strength, and on the&#xD;
      other hand modulating the immune system, as well as specific procedures and drugs used in&#xD;
      crises (plasmapheresis, immunoglobins) or refractory patients, patients are often severely&#xD;
      limited, affecting everyday activities of self-care, family, social and professional life,&#xD;
      thus affecting the mood and quality of life of patients. There is a lack of data measuring&#xD;
      quality of life adequately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the data collection is to record the quality of life of myasthenia patients. By&#xD;
      clinical information on the disease (including symptoms, course and therapy) and recording&#xD;
      the social and occupational situation, the data should be contextualized. The following&#xD;
      hypotheses are to be confirmed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myasthenia gravis affects the quality of life of patients comparable to neurological&#xD;
           diseases such as multiple sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are limited in their participation in their private and professional life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The severity of the disease is associated with the quality of life. Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myasthenia is associated with income busses and other economic disadvantages of the&#xD;
           night&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life in myasthenia patients is related to fatigue and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life in myasthenia patients depends on different therapy methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myasthenia gravis has an impact on family planning and care for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cooperation with the German Myasthenia Gravis Society, a questionnaire prepared by the&#xD;
      Charité will be sent to its members with a request for completion and an anonymous return.&#xD;
      Similar projects have already been implemented in the past (response rate&gt; 30%). About 3,300&#xD;
      patients should be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The returned questionnaires are then statistically evaluated and presented as part of a&#xD;
      publication. For the evaluation of the hypotheses suitable descriptive, univariate analysis&#xD;
      methods are used. Furthermore, with sufficient case numbers, multivariate analyzes (e.g.,&#xD;
      logistic regression) are also planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire contains general information and questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Education and employment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social situation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social Support&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Economic aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms and severity, course, treatment of myasthenia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatigue and depression&#xD;
