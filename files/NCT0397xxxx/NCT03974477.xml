  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the researchers will evaluate the efficacy of an intervention using the SALT&#xD;
      CONTROL H instrument (an innovative equipment to monitor and control salt) in workers at the&#xD;
      University of Porto to reduce dietary salt intake. This is a randomized clinical trial with&#xD;
      intervention conducted according to good clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will randomize 260 workers who meet the eligibility criteria and are enrolled&#xD;
      in occupational health appointments. Prior to the intervention, the informed consent of the&#xD;
      participants will be obtained and those who agree to participate will be allocated randomly&#xD;
      in one of the two arms of the study (control or intervention), with balance of baseline&#xD;
      characteristics (sex and hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last for 8 weeks, an individual session of presentation of SALT CONTROL&#xD;
      H will be carried out, with explanation of how the equipment works in the culinary&#xD;
      preparation with an adequate salt content, will be used an illustrative video and recipes&#xD;
      with an adequate salt content; use of SALT CONTROL H at home by the participant to control&#xD;
      the use of salt during the cooking process; supervision and enhancement of the use of&#xD;
      equipment; daily occurrence log; and the application of a satisfaction questionnaire on the&#xD;
      use of SALT CONTROL H. A leaflet will also be delivered about &quot;The new Food Wheel, a guide to&#xD;
      the daily food choice!&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: No intervention will be carried out except the provision of a leaflet on &quot;The&#xD;
      new Food Wheel, a guide to the daily food choice!&quot; to the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline, at the 4th and 8th intervention weeks, and 6 months after intervention analysis&#xD;
      will cover the following domains: urinary sodium excretion corresponding to a 24 hour urine&#xD;
      collection as a proxy for salt intake; 24-hour urinary potassium excretion, sodium:potassium&#xD;
      ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements. Urine samples&#xD;
      will be collected according to standardized procedures and analyzed by a certified&#xD;
      laboratory. Secondary data such as satisfaction questionnaire, daily use of equipment, iodine&#xD;
      analysis of salt used and excreted in urine 24h, hydration status, analysis of quality of&#xD;
      life and quality of diet will also be analyzed, as well as intestinal microbiota.&#xD;
