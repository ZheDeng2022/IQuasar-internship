    <textblock>
      This study [contRAst 2 (201791: NCT03970837)] is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double&#xD;
      blind study to assess the safety and efficacy of GSK3196165 in combination with csDMARD(s),&#xD;
      for the treatment of adult participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA) who have had an inadequate response to csDMARD(s) or bDMARD(s). The study will consist&#xD;
      of a screening phase of up to 6 weeks followed by a 52 week treatment phase in which&#xD;
      participants will be randomized in a ratio of 6:6:3:1:1:1 to receive GSK3196165 150&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) subcutaneous (SC) weekly, GSK3196165 90 mg SC weekly, tofacitinib capsules&#xD;
      (cap) 5 mg twice a day or placebo (three arms, each placebo arm will have 12 weeks placebo&#xD;
      followed by 40 weeks active treatment) respectively, all in combination with csDMARD(s).&#xD;
      Participants who, in investigator's judgement will benefit from extended treatment with&#xD;
      GSK3196165 may be included in the long-term extension study [contRAst X (209564:&#xD;
      NCT04333147)]. For those participants who do not continue into the long term-extension study,&#xD;
      there will be an 8 week safety follow-up visit following the treatment phase.&#xD;
