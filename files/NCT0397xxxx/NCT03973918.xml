      The goal of this study is to estimate the efficacy of encorafenib and binimetinib as measured&#xD;
      by radiographic response in recurrent high-grade primary brain tumors.&#xD;

      Primary Objective Estimate the efficacy of combination treatment with encorafenib and&#xD;
      binimetinib, as measured by response rate (RANO criteria), in patients with recurrent BRAF&#xD;
      V600E/K-mutated malignant glioma (MG) and anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXAs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate efficacy as measured by progression-free survival in subjects with recurrent&#xD;
           malignant glioma or anaplastic PXA containing a BRAF-V600E/K mutation who receive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate duration of response in subjects who have a partial or complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Quantify the time-to-response among subjects who have a radiologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Estimate efficacy as measured by overall survival in subjects with recurrent malignant&#xD;
           glioma or anaplastic PXA containing a BRAF-V600E/K mutation who receive drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib in&#xD;
           this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two arms: medical and surgical. Subjects on the surgical arm must have a high-grade&#xD;
      glioma or a known BRAF-mutated low-grade glioma with high clinical suspicion for progression&#xD;
      to high-grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical: Following enrollment, patients will receive encorafenib and binimetinib at the&#xD;
      FDA-approved dose of 450 mg of encorafenib once daily and the FDA-approved dose of 45 mg of&#xD;
      binimetinib twice daily separated by 12 hours, continuously in 28-day cycles until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be followed by routine blood work, and&#xD;
      general and neurological examination. A brain MRI will be performed prior to every&#xD;
      odd-numbered cycle (every 8 weeks). Response will be assessed by RANO criteria. Patients may&#xD;
      remain on study and receive treatment until progression or other reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical: These subjects will take encorafenib and binimetinib in combination at their&#xD;
      FDA-approved doses for 10-14 days prior to surgery. The last dose of both drugs will be&#xD;
      administered two hours prior to surgery. Specimens will be collected during surgery. After&#xD;
      surgery, the subjects will not take further encorafenib or binimetinib until a study visit to&#xD;
      assess their neurological exam, physical exam, and performance status, at 2-6 weeks&#xD;
      post-operatively. At time of restarting combination treatment, subjects will follow the&#xD;
      schedule for the medical cohort, and will continue treatment until progression.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patient has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 non-hematologic toxic effects of prior therapy&#xD;

             endocrinopathies) are exceptions and may enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Impaired cardiovascular function or clinically significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
             including, but not limited to, any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction, unstable&#xD;
                  angina, coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty or stenting) ≤ 180&#xD;
                  days prior to start date;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Congestive heart failure requiring treatment (New York Heart Association Grade ≥&#xD;
                  2);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% as determined by MUGA or ECHO;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as persistent systolic blood pressure ≥ 150&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Triplicate average baseline QTc interval ≥ 480 ms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Impairment of gastrointestinal function or disease which may significantly alter the&#xD;
             absorption of study drug (e.g., active ulcerative disease, uncontrolled vomiting or&#xD;
             diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection with decreased intestinal&#xD;
             absorption), or recent (≤ 90 days) history of a partial or complete bowel obstruction,&#xD;
             or other conditions that will interfere significantly with the absorption of oral&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of recent (≤ 90 days) thromboembolic or cerebrovascular event such as&#xD;
             transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, or hemodynamically significant&#xD;
             (massive or sub-massive) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary emboli (DVT/PE). Note:&#xD;
             Patients with DVT/PE that does not result in hemodynamic instability may enroll as&#xD;
             long as they are anticoagulated for at least 4 weeks. Note: Patients with DVT/PE&#xD;
             related to indwelling catheters or other procedures may enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements, are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of encorafenib and/or&#xD;
             binimetinib on a fetus are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             encorafenib or binimetinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with encorafenib and/or binimetinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients who previously received BRAF or MEK inhibitors are excluded (including but&#xD;
             not limited to dabrafenib, vemurafenib, encorafenib, sorafenib, trametinib,&#xD;
             binimetinib, cobimetinib, or selumetinib).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients will be excluded if their tumor harbors a known RAS activating mutation. This&#xD;
             does not need to be specifically tested for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3.4 Additional Inclusion Criteria for Surgical Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must meet the above inclusion / exclusion criteria for consideration with one&#xD;
        exception. Patients with a BRAF-V600 E or K mutated low-grade glioma for whom there is a&#xD;
        strong clinical suspicion of progression to high-grade would also be eligible for this arm.&#xD;
        Additionally:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have a clinical indication for a tumor surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. No a priori contraindication to biospecimen collection (blood, tumor, CSF).&#xD;
