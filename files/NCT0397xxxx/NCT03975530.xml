  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a randomized pilot study. Family Spirit home-visiting sites from&#xD;
      the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan (ITC of MI) will be selected based on comparability and&#xD;
      randomized to provide either standard Family Spirit or precision Family Spirit to their&#xD;
      clients. Sites in both groups will use an electronic platform to support implementation. The&#xD;
      investigators will select four sites and randomize two of them to standard Family Spirit and&#xD;
      two to precision Family Spirit. Sites will be matched based on annual volume of clients&#xD;
      served and geographic similarity (i.e. urban vs. rural). All participating sites will be&#xD;
      trained in the electronic implementation support platform. The two sites randomized to&#xD;
      provide the precision approach will receive additional training on how to provide it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each site, all new clients who are prenatal or up to 2-months postpartum will be offered&#xD;
      participation in the study. The study will then follow them until 12 months postpartum and&#xD;
      measure outcomes during this time (see measurement table below). Qualitative interviews will&#xD;
      be done at 6 and 12 months postpartum. Analysis of study instruments (basic psychometrics&#xD;
      based on baseline and endline data) and preliminary differences between the sites on Aim 3&#xD;
      and 4 outcomes will be done in December 2019 assuming the investigators have achieved their&#xD;
      estimated sample size with enough retention for 6-months post enrollment. Dissemination of&#xD;
      results will be done upon completion of the analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Home visiting programs provide critical support to families and young children to promote&#xD;
      healthy development and reduce health disparities. Decades of research has yielded a robust&#xD;
      evidence base supporting their effectiveness and impact on maternal and child outcomes. In&#xD;
      2010, the importance of these interventions was recognized nationally with the authorization&#xD;
      of $1.5 billion to fund Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) across&#xD;
      states and tribes. MIECHV was most recently reauthorized and funded for five years in early&#xD;
      2018. There are now 20 evidence-based early childhood home visiting models nationwide, all of&#xD;
      which have evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials, favorable impacts on primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes, and sustained impacts of the intervention over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite robust evidence of early childhood home-visiting effectiveness, replication and&#xD;
      scale-up beyond the context of research has been challenging. Improving program retention,&#xD;
      enhancing program content to address families' unique and often complex needs, and increasing&#xD;
      fidelity have been identified as priority areas for further research. While building the&#xD;
      evidence base for home-visiting programs, researchers necessarily took a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot;&#xD;
      approach - designing programs that are often lengthy (2-3 years long) and include standard&#xD;
      lesson sequencing and dosing delivered in the same way to all participants. However, mothers&#xD;
      and children do not all need the same program content or dosages. A one-size-fits-all&#xD;
      approach fails to address maternal-child need and has led to differential outcomes across&#xD;
      studies and populations, indicating that the promise of home-visiting to improve health has&#xD;
      yet to be fully realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for home-visiting programs that can address maternal-child diverse and emergent&#xD;
      needs and improve client reach and retention, while maintaining fidelity to the active&#xD;
      ingredients of evidence-based home-visiting programs, is at the forefront of research and&#xD;
      practice-based dialogue in the US. Recent qualitative research on high- and low-retention&#xD;
      sites within the Nurse Family Partnership network showed that nurses in high retention sites&#xD;
      were more collaborative with families and adapted the program to align more with families'&#xD;
      needs compared to nurses in low retention sites. Based on these findings, Ingoldsby and&#xD;
      colleagues used principals of motivational interviewing to provide nurses with more explicit&#xD;
      control over the visit schedule and content to families. When they compared retention rates&#xD;
      for nurses trained in motivational interviewing to rates for nurses trained in the standard&#xD;
      approach, they found retention rates were significantly better when nurses had more&#xD;
      flexibility in service delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the past two years, the Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health (CAIH) at Johns&#xD;
      Hopkins University has partnered with the Annie E. Casey Foundation for formative work to&#xD;
      develop a precision public health approach to the Family Spirit home-visiting program.&#xD;
      Leveraging CAIH's existing evidence-based home-visiting program, Family Spirit, the goal of&#xD;
      this project was to enhance the Family Spirit model to aid home visitors in tailoring content&#xD;
      to meet families' specific needs and continuously monitor clients' emergent issues or&#xD;
      improvements so that home-visiting education remains responsive, relevant, and feasible. This&#xD;
      precision approach and corresponding implementation support have been developed. The current&#xD;
      study will be a pilot study of the precision approach compared to the standard of care. In&#xD;
      the standard of care, families receive regular home visits, delivered in the same sequence&#xD;
      for up to 39 months. In the precision approach, there is a core set of lessons that every&#xD;
      mother will get, but then additional lessons will be added based on maternal or child need.&#xD;
      For example, if a mother is a first-time mom, they will get additional baby care lessons that&#xD;
      are included in the standard Family Spirit curriculum but may not be relevant for moms with&#xD;
      previous children.&#xD;
