      RESEARCH QUESTION: In syncope patients at least 50 years of age, a strategy of first&#xD;
      conducting a tilt table (HUT) will provide an earlier diagnosis at less cost than a strategy&#xD;
      of first implanting an implantable loop recorder (ILR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Syncope is a common condition. Approximately 0.6%- 1.5% of all Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED) visits occurs for syncope and of these, anywhere from 12%-83% are admitted,&#xD;
      depending on the country. The incidence rates for acute care visits increases with age and&#xD;
      rises steeply after the age of 50 years. Approximately one third of patients have at least&#xD;
      one recurrence of syncope in 3 years of follow-up. A recent analysis from Alberta found the&#xD;
      total cost of syncope presentations to the ED was $530 million dollars over a 6-year period.&#xD;
      Syncope has numerous causes, ranging from benign to life threatening, and determining the&#xD;
      underlying etiology is often challenging. Reflex syncope (vasovagal) is the most frequent&#xD;
      cause of syncope in all age groups and clinical settings. However, arrhythmic causes, with&#xD;
      higher clinical risk, become more common in older patients, and are responsible for about 10%&#xD;
      of syncope visits to the ED. The current approach for investigation of patients with&#xD;
      unexplained syncope is usually unstructured, with multiple specialist evaluations, numerous&#xD;
      and expensive tests, and recurring acute care visits. This results in high and unnecessary&#xD;
      costs. There are three competing approaches to diagnosis: a structured history, head-up tilt&#xD;
      (HUT) test, and implantable loop recorders (ILR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often syncope can be diagnosed on the basis of history, physical examination, and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG). However, even after this initial evaluation, syncope may remain&#xD;
      unexplained, accounting for as many as 41% of cases in older patients. In older patients,&#xD;
      history is often less reliable, due to a lack of autonomic symptoms associated with vasovagal&#xD;
      syncope, amnesia for pre-syncopal symptoms, and lack of witnesses. Further, co-morbidities&#xD;
      and polypharmacy add complexity to the diagnostic process. HUT: The HUT test has been used to&#xD;
      evaluate patients with syncope for nearly 3 decades. It is an orthostatic stress test to&#xD;
      assess the susceptibility of a vasovagal response to a postural change from a supine to an&#xD;
      upright position. A positive response is defined as inducible presyncope or syncope&#xD;
      associated with hypotension, with or without bradycardia (including asystole) that reproduces&#xD;
      clinical symptoms. HUT has been used in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope, when the&#xD;
      history is unhelpful. Although enthusiasm has waned for the role of HUT in the evaluation of&#xD;
      syncope due to variable protocols leading to high heterogeneity of test outcomes,&#xD;
      false-positives in controls, and availability of long-term cardiac monitoring; there is good&#xD;
      evidence for its usefulness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ILR is a small subcutaneously implanted device, lasting up to 3 years, that records heart&#xD;
      rhythms, and which may be either auto-triggered or patientactivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early observational and case-control studies found that the ILR leads to earlier diagnosis&#xD;
      and reduced the rate of unexplained syncope compared to HUT. Despite ILR entering routine&#xD;
      clinic practice over the last 25 years, there are surprisingly few rigorous data of its use&#xD;
      in the management of unexplained syncope. Comparisons of strategies of HUT and ILR: Two&#xD;
      randomized controlled studies have reported on the diagnostic yield of an early ILR strategy&#xD;
      compared to conventional testing including HUT in older patients with unexplained syncope.&#xD;
      All reported an increased diagnostic accuracy with ILR and a lower cost per diagnosis, but&#xD;
      each has substantial limitations. Study Structure: This will be a formal pragmatic study of 2&#xD;
      diagnostic strategies, designed around the PRECIS2 criteria addressing which test should be&#xD;
      done first, and subsequent care will be left in the hands of the physician responsible for&#xD;
      assessing syncope. Settings: Patients will be recruited from the ED, general cardiology,&#xD;
      arrhythmia, and syncope clinics, and medical and cardiology wards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Patients will be randomized to either i) the early HUT [protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      supine pre-tilt phase 5 min, un-medicated HUT to 70 degrees for 20 minutes; if response&#xD;
      negative then 400 μg of sublingual nitroglycerin and continued 70 degree tilt for 20 minutes]&#xD;
      OR ii) early implant of ILR without hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the outcome, subsequent testing and care will be in the hands of the&#xD;
      responsible physician. Patients will be seen 1 week after ILR implantation for wound&#xD;
      assessment and to reinforce patient understanding of the activation process. Subsequent&#xD;
      3-year follow-up will occur according to the policies of the device clinic (usually every 6&#xD;
      months). Patients will be seen quickly after a symptomatic event.&#xD;
