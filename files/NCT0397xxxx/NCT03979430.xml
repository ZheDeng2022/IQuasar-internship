  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic disease, leading to poor lung function with&#xD;
      a median survival of 2-3 years. Acute exacerbation of idiopathic IPF is a complication&#xD;
      associated with a mortality rate &gt; 50%. So far, the appearance of an acute exacerbation is&#xD;
      unpredictable. Worsening of the IPF accompanies with a decrease of the FVC-value, the lung&#xD;
      capacity. So far, studies are missing investigating the correlation between a decrease of the&#xD;
      FVC-value and emerging acute exacerbations. Therefore, this study uses daily home spirometry&#xD;
      to investigate that correlation. With this study the investigators hope to determine acute&#xD;
      exacerbations early and treat patients early.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-Center study happening on five different sites, Heidelberg, Gießen,&#xD;
      Grosshansdorf, München, and Hannover, all in Germany. Each site recuits ten patients for a&#xD;
      total of 50 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive a tablet and a spirometer for daily home spirometry. Each patient&#xD;
      is supposed to do the home spirometry at the same time every morning. The spirometer and the&#xD;
      tablet are connected via Bluetooth and data will be transferred to a webpage after the&#xD;
      measurement, that team members have access to the data and can see the progress daily. Alerts&#xD;
      will be automatically send to team members, if the FVC-value decreases about 5% or more&#xD;
      within three consecutive days or if the patient does not do the measurement on three&#xD;
      consecutive days. Study period is one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the home spirometry, patients will conduct a survey to measure health related&#xD;
      quality of life (K-BILD). This questionnaire will be conducted at baseline and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks. Every 4 weeks the patients are participating in a phone interview to record changes in&#xD;
      medication and condition. At baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, patients will conduct&#xD;
      a 6 minutes walking test, lung function test, blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis, and&#xD;
      sputum, nasal swab, and a urine sample will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim is to detect and treat an acute exacerbation early.&#xD;

    <description>A decrease in FVC value can predict an acute exacerbation. Through daily home spirometry, study team members have access to measured FVC-values from each patient. Therefore, changes in FVC values can be seen directly and actions can be taken to detect an acute exacerbation or even to avoid one.</description>
