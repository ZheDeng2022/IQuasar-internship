  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be unique for the rehabilitation of patients with facial paralysis in that&#xD;
      the focus is to generate novel 3D facial soft tissue measures to characterize the condition&#xD;
      and temporal changes, and on the generation of future testable hypotheses to optimize&#xD;
      surgical interventions and outcomes. In addition, the investigators will extend our previous&#xD;
      work, beyond the facial circumoral and lip areas/zones, to characterize additional facial&#xD;
      zones specific for facial paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach for facial mapping of soft tissue movement, when validated through this proposed&#xD;
      study, can be used for both surgical planning and to support the development and training of&#xD;
      implantable facial pacing devices. Mapping both normal facial movements and movements of&#xD;
      patients with unilateral facial paralysis are vital to describe the temporal and spatial&#xD;
      course of the recovery process. Ultimately, this information can be used to inform clinicians&#xD;
      on the precise placement of these devices and the signal strength needed to facilitate&#xD;
      movements in the required 'paralyzed' facial zones until the recovery process has been&#xD;
      completed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with facial paralysis have an obvious facial disability. The resultant facial&#xD;
      disability includes facial disfigurement and impairment in soft tissue movements,&#xD;
      particularly in facial expressive behaviors. These negative physical sequelae not only impact&#xD;
      facial esthetics and function, but also patients' social and emotional quality of life.&#xD;
      Treatments range from non-surgical interventions and facial reanimation surgery to new&#xD;
      implantable facial pacing devices that would potentially initiate artificial movement on the&#xD;
      paralyzed side of the face. Traditionally, surgeons' plan treatment based on isolated&#xD;
      measurements made from 2D photographs and subjective grading of the patient's face, both of&#xD;
      which are limited in scope and dimension. Our research group has demonstrated the utility of&#xD;
      a novel 3D dynamic and static quantitative (objective) measures for the evaluation of facial&#xD;
      soft tissue function. The measures are objective and quantitative, and they provide a more&#xD;
      precise diagnosis of facial soft tissue disability and evaluation of surgical outcomes. The&#xD;
      main goal of this prospective, observational study is to determine the applicability of these&#xD;
      novel 3D dynamic and static measures for quantification and measurement of impairment and&#xD;
      disfigurement, as well as change over time, in patients with facial paralysis. The global&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the use of the measures will provide a more comprehensive analysis of the&#xD;
      severity of facial paralysis and the changes over time (recovery) when compared with current&#xD;
      assessment methods.&#xD;
