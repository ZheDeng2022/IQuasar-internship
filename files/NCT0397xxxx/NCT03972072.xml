  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is the main treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head&#xD;
      and neck (SCCHN). Many advances regarding tumor control and patient survival have been made&#xD;
      over the past decades. However, treatment-induced toxicity remains a crucial problem, leading&#xD;
      to reduced quality of life and permanent impairment for many survivors. Xerostomia is up to&#xD;
      this day the leading cause of late toxicity for these patients. Toxicity has been reduced by&#xD;
      implementation of modern image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiotherapy (IMRT), but the low soft-tissue contrast of routine x-ray image guidance does&#xD;
      not allow exact planning adaptation and daily imaging is associated with high radiation&#xD;
      exposure. Furthermore, despite the routinely use of IMRT, rates of clinically relevant&#xD;
      xerostomia (i.e. grade 2 or worse) are still common and reported in approximately 38%.&#xD;
      Recently developed hybrid machines (MRidianÂ®-CE approval since 2016), consisting of a linear&#xD;
      accelerator and an integrated low-field MRI, could allow a) better visualization of tumor and&#xD;
      organs at risk, such as parotid glands during patient positioning and daily treatment, b)&#xD;
      daily imaging without additional radiation exposure, c) narrowest established safety margins&#xD;
      for the treatment volumes, and finally d) repetitive adaptation of target volumes according&#xD;
      to changes in patient weight and tumor anatomy during the radiotherapy course. These&#xD;
      procedures would facilitate a high-precision treatment and help reduce dose exposure of&#xD;
      critical structures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire consists of 30 questions with a maximal score of 100. Absolute scores after linear transformation will be reported as descriptive statistics The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.&#xD;
A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.&#xD;
