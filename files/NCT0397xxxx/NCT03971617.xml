  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that will investigate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of molecular hydrogen, a promising antioxidant agent, in patients with&#xD;
      early-stage Parkinson's Disease. The medication will be administered orally as 8 ounces of&#xD;
      hydrogen-enriched drinking water twice a day over the course of one year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of molecular hydrogen, a promising&#xD;
      antioxidant agent, in patients with early-stage Parkinson's Disease. Subjects will be&#xD;
      sequentially randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive hydrogen-enriched water or the&#xD;
      corresponding placebo twice a day, in addition to all standard-of-care treatments. Enrollment&#xD;
      goal is 70 subjects. Duration of therapy is 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures are safety and tolerability of hydrogen-enriched water.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures include: progression of motor symptoms, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, progression of cognitive decline, and progression of symptom burden.&#xD;

    <measure>Score on the Part III subscale of the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>56 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 56 in motor examination, as assessed by score on Part III of the MDS-UPDRS. Part III of the MDS-UPDRS assesses the motor signs of PD. Scores range from 0-33 with a lower score indicating less severe impairment.</description>

    <measure>Score on the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>56 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 56 in Parkinson's Disease-related quality of life, as assessed by PDQ-39. The PDQ-39 assesses how often patients experience difficulties across 8 quality of life dimensions. Scores for each dimension range from 0 to 100 with lower scores indicating more impaired quality of life. The overall score is an average of the scores for the 8 dimensions.</description>

    <time_frame>56 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 56 in overall cognitive function as assessed by MoCA score. Scores on the MoCA range from 0-30 with lower scores indicating more cognitive impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>56 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to week 56 in non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, motor symptoms, and motor complications, as assessed by scores on Parts I (score range 0-13), II (score range 0-13), III (score range 0-33) and IV (score range 0-6), respectively of the MDS-UPDRS. Total score ranges from 0-65 with lower scores indicating less severe impairment.</description>

    <description>The ingredient in the tablet producing H2 is magnesium. Each tablet contains 80 mg magnesium, a safe level well below the recommended daily dietary allowance of 420 mg for men/ 320 mg for women. Dissolving one tablet in 250 mL of water will achieve a saturating H2 concentration of approximately 1.6 ppm. Twice a day subjects will dissolve a tablet into water and drink the effervescent water.</description>
