  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2-sequence, 2-period,&#xD;
      2-treatment crossover design. The study population will consist of adult male and female&#xD;
      subjects with a documented history of episodic migraine (4 to 14 baseline migraine days), who&#xD;
      have failed at least 2 previous migraine prophylactic treatment for lack of efficacy or&#xD;
      tolerability. After a run-in phase of 4 weeks, patients will be randomized, according to a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, to a 24 weeks of treatment, as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 1: A/B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequence 2: B/A where: A=monthly subcutaneous erenumab 140 mg for 12 weeks; B=monthly&#xD;
           subcutaneous masked placebo for 12 weeks&#xD;
