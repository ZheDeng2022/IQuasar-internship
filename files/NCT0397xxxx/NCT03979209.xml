  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, more than 30 million people are diagnosed with sinusitis each year.&#xD;
      Moreover, chronic sinusitis effects approximately 15% of the U.S. population and is one of&#xD;
      the most common chronic illnesses in America. Budesonide and mometasone nasal sprays are used&#xD;
      to relieve sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose caused by hay fever or other allergies&#xD;
      (caused by an allergy to pollen, mold, dust, or pets).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of cortisol suppression with the&#xD;
      use of mometasone irrigations in varying doses. Low levels of cortisol can cause weakness,&#xD;
      fatigue, and low blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In using nasal sprays, a drug may enter the body's circulation through direct local&#xD;
      absorption in the nasal mucosa or oral absorption of any swallowed medication. Some people&#xD;
      can reduce symptom severity using medication, including antihistamines and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs. Nasal irrigation - the flooding of the sinus cavity with warm saline solution - can&#xD;
      help to reduce sinus congestion and is often recommended by otolaryngologists for a variety&#xD;
      of sinus conditions. The goal of nasal irrigation is to clear excess mucus and foreign debris&#xD;
      out of the sinuses, and to moisturize the mucosal membrane. The practice has been subjected&#xD;
      to clinical testing and has been found to be safe and beneficial with no apparent side&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of budesonide to nasal irrigations has become common practice in the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic rhinosinusitis. Mometasone has been shown to be an alternative to budesonide with&#xD;
      increased local effects and lower absorption by the body. Studies have shown that saline&#xD;
      irrigation treatments show greater effects versus saline spray for providing short-term&#xD;
      relief of chronic nasal and sinus symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited data on the use of mometasone in nasal irrigations. Subjects to be included&#xD;
      in the study are those with a diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis, with or without nasal&#xD;
      polyps and who have had prior endoscopic sinus surgery. This study will test 3 different&#xD;
      concentrations of mometasone in a nasal irrigation. Patients will receive either 1 milligram&#xD;
      mometasone in their nasal irrigations, 2 milligrams of mometasone, or 4 milligrams of&#xD;
      mometasone. The dose assignment will be determined by the treating physician. After 12 weeks&#xD;
      of entering this study and use of the mometasone irrigations, there will be a blood draw to&#xD;
      compare morning cortisol levels to a baseline blood draw.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sinusitis is inflammation of the sinuses that results in symptoms such as thickened nasal&#xD;
      drainage, nasal congestion and facial pain or pressure. Because sinusitis is often preceded&#xD;
      by and almost always accompanied by, inflammation of the nasal mucosa, the term&#xD;
      &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot; is used by ENT (ear, nose and throat) physicians to replace the term&#xD;
      &quot;sinusitis.&quot; Viruses, bacteria, and nasal allergies are common causes of inflammation. The&#xD;
      inflamed, swollen mucosa of the nasal and sinus cavities leads to obstruction of the openings&#xD;
      of the sinuses. Unable to circulate air and eliminate the secretions that are normally&#xD;
      produced, the sinuses then become an ideal environment for bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sinusitis is categorized into the following types according to the duration of symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute - symptoms are present for 4 weeks or less; Subacute - symptoms are present for more&#xD;
      than 4 weeks, but less than 12 weeks; Chronic - symptoms are present for 12 weeks or greater;&#xD;
      Recurrent Acute - 4 or more acute episodes occurring within 1 year, with resolution of&#xD;
      symptoms between episodes; Acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis involves an episode&#xD;
      of worsening symptoms in a patient with diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, more than 30 million people are diagnosed with sinusitis each year.&#xD;
      Moreover, chronic sinusitis effects approximately 15% of the U.S. population and is one of&#xD;
      the most common chronic illnesses in America. Both budesonide and mometasone nasal sprays are&#xD;
      used to relieve sneezing, runny, stuffy, or itchy nose caused by hay fever or other allergies&#xD;
      (caused by an allergy to pollen, mold, dust, or pets). These nasal sprays are in the class of&#xD;
      drugs called corticosteroids. They work by blocking the release of certain natural substances&#xD;
      that cause allergy symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of cortisol suppression with the&#xD;
      use of nasal mometasone irrigations in varying dosages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low levels of cortisol can cause weakness, fatigue, and low blood pressure. In using nasal&#xD;
      sprays, a drug may enter the body's circulation through direct local absorption in the nasal&#xD;
      mucosa or oral absorption of any swallowed medication. Some people can reduce symptom&#xD;
      severity using medication, including antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs. Nasal&#xD;
      irrigation - the flooding of the sinus cavity with warm saline solution - can help to reduce&#xD;
      sinus congestion and is often recommended by otolaryngologists for a variety of sinus&#xD;
      conditions. The goal of nasal irrigation is to clear excess mucus and foreign debris out of&#xD;
      the sinuses, and to moisturize the mucosal membrane. The practice has been subjected to&#xD;

      relief of chronic nasal and sinus symptoms. There is limited data on the use of mometasone in&#xD;
      nasal irrigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study will be 45 patients. Patients will sign the consent form and&#xD;
      get a baseline morning cortisol blood draw to confirm eligibility. Once enrolled, they will&#xD;
      be instructed on how to perform the nasal irrigation twice a day with a 240 milliliter saline&#xD;
      filled Neilmed bottle. Patients will receive either the 1 milligram mometasone dose, 2&#xD;
      milligram mometasone dose, or 4 milligram of mometasone dose. The dose assignment will be&#xD;
      determined by the treating physician. After 12 weeks of continuous use of the mometasone&#xD;
      irrigation, there will be a repeat morning blood draw to compare cortisol levels to the&#xD;
      baseline blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The addition of budesonide to nasal irrigations has become common practice in the treatment&#xD;
      of chronic rhinosinusitis. The dose of budesonide 0.5 milligrams/2 milliliters was chosen as&#xD;
      a result of convenience, as budesonide respules are commercially available as an inhalation&#xD;
      in the treatment of asthma. Mometasone is an alternative to budesonide with improved&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics resulting in increased local efficacy and lower systemic absorption,&#xD;
      however, data is limited in its use as a topical irrigation formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is relevant literature available discussing the pharmacokinetic profile of budesonide&#xD;
      and mometasone used intranasally. Following intranasal administration a drug may enter&#xD;
      systemic circulation through direct local absorption in the nasal mucosa or oral absorption&#xD;
      of any swallowed medication. The intranasal bioavailability of budesonide and mometasone&#xD;
      through nasal mucosa have been measured at 34% and less than 0.1% respectively. If a drug&#xD;
      enters systemic circulation through the nasal mucosa, the medication is subject to plasma&#xD;
      protein binding. When a medication is protein bound it is not bioactive and thus reduces the&#xD;
      potential for systemic adverse effects. Approximately 85-90% of budesonide is bound to plasma&#xD;
      proteins after entering systemic circulation. Alternatively, mometasone is 99% protein bound&#xD;
      at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, budesonide is bioactive at 10-15 times the&#xD;
      concentration of mometasone in the serum due to plasma protein binding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of the drug may also be cleared from the sinuses into the throat and swallowed,&#xD;
      making it available for gastrointestinal absorption. Medications absorbed through the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract are subject to first pass hepatic metabolism which largely determines&#xD;
      the amount of medication which reaches systemic circulation. Approximately 90% of swallowed&#xD;
      budesonide is metabolized by the liver during first pass metabolism7. On the other hand, when&#xD;
      mometasone is swallowed and undergoes first pass metabolism, 99% of the drug is eliminated&#xD;
      leaving only 1% of the drug to enter the circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A desired pharmacokinetic property of intranasal steroids is high lipophilicity. Higher&#xD;
      lipophilicity leads to increased intranasal absorption as well as prolonged retention in the&#xD;
      nasal tissue. Longer retention of the steroid in nasal tissue results in increased exposure&#xD;
      to the glucocorticoid receptor. The relative lipophilicity of budesonide and mometasone are&#xD;
      3,980 and 50,000 respectively. Thus, mometasone has twelve times higher lipophilicity than&#xD;
      budesonide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is current relevant data to assess the safety of mometasone administered intranasally.&#xD;
      A review of 20 clinical trials with more than 6,000 patients worldwide at doses up to 20&#xD;
      times the recommended daily dose found no detectable effect of mometasone on the&#xD;
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA). Additionally, mometasone at high doses, did not&#xD;
      cause atrophy to the nasal mucosa. Intranasal mometasone at a dose of 1600 micrograms, which&#xD;
      is 4 times the recommended dose administered daily to human volunteers for 29 days showed no&#xD;
      incidence of adverse effects. The effects of oral mometasone on HPA axis function has also&#xD;
      been studied. Oral mometasone was administered at doses of 2, 4, and 8 milligrams to 24&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers with no significant change in plasma or urinary cortisol from&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
