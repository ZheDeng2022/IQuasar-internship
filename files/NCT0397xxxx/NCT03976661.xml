           home and benefiting from Diapason 92 device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control arm: will be constituted by people residing at the EHPAD (retirement home)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative component: Study will cover 5 different populations since it concerns both:-&#xD;
      - Diapason 92 professionals who work directly with users&#xD;

      - About quantitative component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After verification of eligibility criteria adapted to each centre and once the non-opposition&#xD;
      has been collected and subjects have been included, the following data will be collected at&#xD;
      M0, M3, M6 and M12:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients : Start date of care by Diapason 92 or EHPAD, Quality of Life score,&#xD;
           benefit evaluation, Socio-educational level, evaluation of disruptive behaviour&#xD;
