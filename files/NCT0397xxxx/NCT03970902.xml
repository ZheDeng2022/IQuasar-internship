    <textblock>
      The researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention composed of&#xD;
      multiple actions targeting primary care healthcare workers and postmenopausal women with&#xD;
      osteoporosis by means of a quasi-experimental design in the form of a cluster-controlled&#xD;
      trial with clustering at family physician level. The study has 2 study arms. In one arm,&#xD;
      osteoporosis stakeholders receive a complex intervention (Integrated Osteoporosis Care(IOC)).&#xD;
      The second study arm serves as control and receives care as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The complex intervention is composed of&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  education and provision of educational material for all stakeholders in primary&#xD;
           osteoporosis care (patients, family physicians, nurse-educators, physiotherapists,&#xD;
           dietitians, pharmacists and if present patient's informal caregivers)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient self-management support by primary care osteoporosis stakeholders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the construction of a primary care osteoporosis treatment guideline and care pathway&#xD;
           Effectiveness will be measured by questionnaires and data from the (Electronic Medical&#xD;
           Record)EMR and IMA-database, in patients and family physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects measured in family physicians are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification failure rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of family physicians correctly implementing the osteoporosis treatment&#xD;
           guideline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients treated correctly as stated in the osteoporosis treatment&#xD;
           guideline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of family physicians correctly registering osteoporosis related information&#xD;
           in the EMR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of collaborative practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Knowledge of osteoporosis management and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects measured in patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication Possession Ratio(MPR) (Primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health literacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported treatment adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-reported nutritional intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of integrated osteoporosis care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient satisfaction with integrated osteoporosis care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRQoL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional independence (Activities of Daily Living - ADL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient resource use The study elapse time is 18 months. Participating family physicians&#xD;
           will receive postgraduate education and start to include patients during consultations&#xD;
           in their doctor's office. The inclusion period is 6 months, patients eligible for&#xD;
           participation are non-institutionalized postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of&#xD;
           osteoporosis who are able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period for patients is 12 months. Follow-up period for family physicians is 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quasi-experimental cluster-controlled trial will be conducted with 2 study arms -&#xD;
      intervention vs. control - with clustering at GP-level. The cluster design is imperative&#xD;
      because the intervention is implemented within the community, and data will be collected at&#xD;
      the physician and patient levels. Trial implementation will last 18 months. GPs will be&#xD;
      included prior to the study and will enroll patients during a 6-month period; patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 12 months. In the IOC-arm, multiple interventions, representing an integrated&#xD;
      approach to postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO) management, are offered for implementation. In&#xD;
      the control arm, no intervention will take place and patients will receive CAU. The&#xD;
      IOC-programme will be offered within the greater region of Ghent (GRG), GPs and patients from&#xD;
      the CAU-group will be located outside this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be GPs and their patients. For GPs, the only exclusion criterion will be&#xD;
      planned retirement during the study period. For GPs in the IOC-arm, willingness to adhere to&#xD;
      the newly developed PO management guideline is an extra inclusion criterion. In both arms,&#xD;
      GPs engage to enroll 8-12 patients, with requests for participation made to all patients&#xD;
      meeting inclusion criteria. Eligible patients are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postmenopausal women&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  With (newly) diagnosis of osteoporosis (BMD T-scores ≤ -2.5) OR eligible for&#xD;
           anti-osteoporosis treatment because of (previous) fragility fracture after the age of 50&#xD;
           years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Without terminal illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are able to speak and understand Dutch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are able to give informed consent Patient eligibility will be judged and patients&#xD;
           included by the participating GPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to current challenges in osteoporosis management, including the unavailability of a&#xD;
      locally applicable univocal treatment guideline for PC osteoporosis management, the limited&#xD;
      awareness of GPs[2] resulting in underdiagnosis[1, 24] and the treatment gap[1, 24, 25], a&#xD;
      guideline for the PC management of PO, hereafter the 'treatment guideline', was developed to&#xD;
      improve awareness and case-finding and to standardise treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers performed a thorough literature search and consolidated the information from&#xD;
      the most recent osteoporosis management guidelines and strategies from several western&#xD;
      countries [26-32]. This was subsequently discussed with a scientific steering committee (SSC)&#xD;
      representing medical stakeholders in osteoporosis care and adapted to Belgium reimbursement&#xD;
      criteria for dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and pharmacological treatment. Because no&#xD;
      consensus could be reached during the first SSC assembly, the results were presented to two&#xD;
      external osteoporosis experts, and their recommendations incorporated, followed by&#xD;
      re-presentation to the SSC. This process was repeated until final consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone Friendly Diet Current nutritional advice for women with PO is often directed towards&#xD;
      sufficient calcium and vitamin D intake and limited alcohol use[26, 27, 29], despite emerging&#xD;
      evidence for other nutritional components impacting BMD[30, 33, 34] or fracture risk[4] and&#xD;
      growing scientific conjecture of the relationship between osteoporosis and chronic&#xD;
      subclinical inflammation[5, 35] which might be modified through diet[11]. These associations&#xD;
      highlight the need for a broader nutritional approach, which has shown to be effective in the&#xD;
      management of other chronic diseases[36-38], and in risk reduction, disease prevention and&#xD;
      health promotion[39, 40].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the evidence for the roles of Vitamin D and calcium in bone mineralisation[1, 4, 33,&#xD;
      41] and other health factors[37, 40] and the beneficial effects of a Mediterranean-like&#xD;
      dietary pattern on diseases and health risks[40, 42, 43], including osteoporosis[11, 34, 44],&#xD;
      a Mediterranean diet-based approach has been developed with contributions of registered&#xD;
      dietitians to result in the Bone Friendly Diet which is incorporated in the patient education&#xD;
      brochure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information brochure (PIB) A literature search on effective fracture prevention&#xD;
      measures was performed. Non-pharmacological aspects of treatment incorporated in the brochure&#xD;
      are exercise, nutrition, sunlight exposure, limiting alcohol intake and smoking cessation. To&#xD;
      improve patient-friendliness, knowledge on exercise and nutrition were discussed with&#xD;
      physiotherapists and dietitians respectively, and underlying principles translated into&#xD;
      practical recommendations. For the pharmacological treatment, a chapter is dedicated to the&#xD;
      importance of treatment adherence, and scientific information on most frequent incorrect&#xD;
      assumptions of anti-resorptive treatment were incorporated. Together with general information&#xD;
      on osteoporosis, the information and recommendations is summarised in the PIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurse education information To support the nurse-educators in their role, an educational map&#xD;
      was developed based on the PIB with additional information on epidemiology and&#xD;
      pathophysiology, and material to support self-management in patients with chronic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physician level interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to patient inclusion, a researcher will conduct a 45-minute educational session with&#xD;
      each participating GP in the doctor's office on the clinical aspects and the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary management of PO. Each GP will receive a plasticised A3 version of the&#xD;
      treatment guideline for use during clinical practice. Prior to the education, the GPs will&#xD;
      complete a survey on osteoporosis management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after patient enrolment, the GPs will participate in an interactive 2-hour&#xD;
      postgraduate education focusing on osteoporosis management, integrated care (IC) for chronic&#xD;
      disease and the role of (nurse-)educators in chronic disease management. They will evaluate&#xD;
      the treatment guideline by means of an adapted version of the AGREE II [45] questionnaire, to&#xD;
      further improve the implementation feasibility. This session will be led by a professor in&#xD;
      family medicine specialised in PC organisation and chronic disease management and a professor&#xD;
      in rheumatology specialised in bone metabolism, densitometry and osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study period, GPs will be supported by a nurse-educator and pharmacists who will&#xD;
      have received training in osteoporosis care. They will be encouraged to collaborate with&#xD;
      physiotherapists and dietitians for additional support in the management and maintenance of&#xD;
      patients' lifestyle changes by means of referral indicators incorporated in the treatment&#xD;
      guideline to facilitate collaborative practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse-educator will provide assistance to the GPs through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      educating patients with osteoporosis on non- and pharmacological aspects of fracture&#xD;
      prevention and supporting their self-management detailed reporting of patient's idea's,&#xD;
      needs, concerns, difficulties and obstacles related to (non-)pharmacological treatment&#xD;
      adherence supporting collaborative practices between and referral to other PC stakeholders&#xD;
      after assessing patients and their living environments and enhancing patient-physician&#xD;
      communication by supporting patients in addressing difficulties in osteoporosis management in&#xD;
      consultation with their GP and by directly relating important issues to GPs after patient&#xD;
      assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacist will provide assistance to the GP through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      reminding patients who have not collected their medications and motivating them to attend new&#xD;
      GP consultation to obtain required prescriptions and enhancing patient-physician&#xD;
      communication via a standardised referral letter for the pharmacists, that relates&#xD;
      difficulties with treatment adherence, the lack of vitamin D and/or calcium in patients'&#xD;
      medication lists and/or medication interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiotherapist will provide assistance to the GPs through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      performing fall risk assessments in patients with decreased mobility, gait disturbances or&#xD;
      other relevant limitations designing personalised exercise programmes for patients to&#xD;
      incorporate in their daily routines supervising patients' exercises during physiotherapist&#xD;
      consultations and addressing patients' fear of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietitian will provide assistance to the GP through:&#xD;
&#xD;
      performing dietary assessments in patients not meeting daily caloric and/or nutritional&#xD;
      requirements or suffering from multiple conditions restricting food choices, and providing&#xD;
      meal plans and anti-inflammatory food choices for patients with limited intake of qualitative&#xD;
      food with regard to calories and nutritional value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-level intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive an IOC-programme package including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the PIB support from a patient-dedicated, trained nurse-educator specialised in osteoporose&#xD;
      care and self-management support, consisting of a home-based 60-90 minute education and&#xD;
      support session after study enrolment, with the emphasis on the importance of treatment&#xD;
      adherence and lifestyle changes to safeguard BMD. This will be done in a patient-centred&#xD;
      manner by addressing all life areas using the 'Zelf-management web' and the setting of&#xD;
      personal goals (e.g. dietary changes, treatment adherence improvement, exercise programme&#xD;
      implementation) person-tailored telephone follow-up on treatment adherence and the&#xD;
      integration of disease management in daily living, beginning 14 days after the educational&#xD;
      session and focusing on enhancing intrinsic motivation and implementing disease management in&#xD;
      daily living, based on patient preferences a follow-up home-based evaluation session 3 months&#xD;
      after the first session to assess progress towards personal goals, set new goals or address&#xD;
      barriers preventing goal achievement and support from their pharmacist, consisting of a&#xD;
      counseling interview on correct medication administration and intake of osteoporosis&#xD;
      medication, the use of calcium and vitamin D, tackling medication side effects and lifestyle&#xD;
      practices for bone health informational brochures developed by federal general association of&#xD;
      pharmacists(APB) on Osteoporosis, the use of bisphosphonates and calcium/vitamin D or the use&#xD;
      of denosumab and calcium/vitamin D - depending on the patients' medications and a referral&#xD;
      letter with which the pharmacist can inform the patient's GP on topics discussed (e.g. side&#xD;
      effects, medication interactions) and propose solutions to support patients in addressing&#xD;
      barriers to treatment adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      support from a physiotherapist, consisting of fall risk assessment when indicated due to&#xD;
      factors such as limited mobility, gait disturbance or other factors affecting fall risk&#xD;
      personalised exercises and addressing fear of falling and fall-efficacy, and supervision&#xD;
      during exercises and education on which exercises are safe to perform at home, and support&#xD;
      from a dietitian, consisting of specialised education on dietary decisions in cases of&#xD;
      multiple conditions requiring nutritional adaptations or restricting food choices, and help&#xD;
      in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacist-level intervention All pharmacists located in GRG will be invited to a&#xD;
      postgraduate education prior to patient inclusion. During this 2-hour session, they will&#xD;
      receive education on osteoporosis and barriers to treatment adherence, and the roles of the&#xD;
      pharmacist in addressing and supporting treatment adherence and communication with patients,&#xD;
      family members and GPs. This will be provided in collaboration with the APB and the&#xD;
      East-Flanders' association of pharmacists(KOVAG) , and led by a physician and a pharmacist&#xD;
      from the APB. The pharmacists will receive patient materials and personal supportive&#xD;
      information on osteoporosis and the counseling interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients have free choice of pharmacists, and we expect only a fraction of the 240&#xD;
      pharmacists in GRG to attend the postgraduate training, all pharmacists in the intervention&#xD;
      region will be informed about the project and their role by letter. They will receive the&#xD;
      educational material and will be invited to watch the postgraduate training online by means&#xD;
      of PowerPoint presentations with voice-over that will be provided on the APB website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physiotherapist-level intervention All physiotherapists in the GRG will be invited to a&#xD;
      postgraduate education prior to patient inclusion. During this 4.5-hour session, they will&#xD;
      receive education on the basic principles and practical management of osteoporosis in&#xD;
      physiotherapy, dealing with patients' fear of falling and supporting patients' adherence to&#xD;
      exercise and rehabilitation programmes. This education will include lectures from a&#xD;
      physician, a university physiotherapy instructor and a PhD researcher. Topics that will be&#xD;
      addressed are BMD and PO, and evidence from the literature on the effects of exercise on BMD&#xD;
      and fear of falling (physician), practical exercises for BMD maintenance (physiotherapy&#xD;
      instructor) and improvement and stimulation of patients' intrinsic motivation to initiate and&#xD;
      adhere to behavioural changes (PhD researcher).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes To measure the impact of and IOC-programme on patients, healthcare providers and&#xD;
      society, outcomes will be measured using surveys, data from the InterMutualistisch Agentschap&#xD;
      (IMA) and data retrieved from the electronic medical record (EMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research outcome is the patient's medication possession ratio (MPR) for all&#xD;
      antiresorptive treatments during the 12-month study period, starting 12 months prior to the&#xD;
      inclusion day and lasting 3 months thereafter, for full coverage of the study period. Patient&#xD;
      data on MPR for anti-resorptive treatment will be collected from the IMA-database in a&#xD;
      pseudomized manner and a between-group comparison will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are measured in GPs and patients. Over an 18-month period, the following&#xD;
      GP outcomes will be measured in both study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      identification failure rate; defined as the proportion of patients eligible for DXA in whom&#xD;
      no DXA was performed correct use of the treatment guideline; defined as osteoporosis&#xD;
      management in patients who gave informed consent proportion of patients in whom PO is managed&#xD;
      appropriately; defined as the proportion of patients eligible for anti-resorptive treatment&#xD;
      in whom pharmacological treatment was initiated and/or continued during the study time period&#xD;
      correct EMR registration of osteoporosis and -related outcomes; defined as the correct EMR&#xD;
      registration of osteoporosis as diagnosis, outcomes of technical investigations (laboratory&#xD;
      results, X-ray, DXA, …) and pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis intensity of&#xD;
      collaborative practices; defined as the proportion of patients referred to caregivers from&#xD;
      the primary or secondary multidisciplinary bone health team by the GP and knowledge of&#xD;
      osteoporosis management and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      During a 12-month period, the following patient outcomes will be measured using self-reported&#xD;
      methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      health-related competencies in patients (health literacy and self-management efficacy)&#xD;
      treatment adherence nutrition medication intake intensity of IOC patient satisfaction with&#xD;
      osteoporosis care patient HRQoL and ADL and use of social and healthcare services Economic&#xD;
      evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a healthcare payer perspective will be performed&#xD;
      with respect to the current modelling guideline in osteoporosis[46]. Cost-effectiveness of&#xD;
      IOC will be assessed at a treshold of €40,000 per QALY gained, based on Belgium gross&#xD;
      domestic product (GDP)[47] as recommended by the WHO[48]. An age-dependent state-transition&#xD;
      model will be used to assess incremental costs, expected QALYs and expected fracture risk&#xD;
      after the implementation of IOC compared to CAU. A cycle-length of 1 year and time horizon of&#xD;
      10 years will be applied, in accordance with the 10-year fracture probabilities as calculated&#xD;
      with FRAX® and maximum recommended treatment length with bisphosphonates[49]. Fracture risk&#xD;
      probabilities at baseline will be calculated with data obtained from both study groups while&#xD;
      fracture risk reduction (FRR) for the different therapeutic regimens will be obtained from&#xD;
      the literature. Real-world FRR, which also accounts for adherence, will be calculated using&#xD;
      study's MPR-data, thereby stratifying adherence into &quot;high&quot; (MPR &gt;80%), &quot;moderate&quot; (50% ≤ MPR&#xD;
      ≤ 80%) and &quot;low&quot; (MPR &lt;50%)[50]. Transition probabilities for each state will be obtained&#xD;
      from the literature and adjusted for therapeutic regimen and MPR-category.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study arms, costs of osteoporosis care will be calculated. For the IOC-group, these&#xD;
      include a yearly GP visit, the cost of anti-resorptive treatment multiplied with the MPR, the&#xD;
      cost of a 5-yearly DXA, 2 2-hourly visits from a nurse-educator annually and a yearly&#xD;
      pharmacist counseling interview. Resource use data collected within the study will be used to&#xD;
      calculate average accompanying costs. In the CAU-group, a similar calculation will be&#xD;
      conducted, leaving out costs for a nurse-educator and annual pharmacist counseling interview.&#xD;
      Cost per QALY gained will be calculated using the Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio&#xD;
      (ICER):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICER = (Cost(IOC)-Cost(CAU))/(QALY(IOC)-QALY(CAU)) Based on the KCE (Belgian Health Care&#xD;
      Knowledge Centre) guidelines for health-economic evaluations in Belgium, future costs will be&#xD;
      discounted at 3% and future QALYs at 1.5%[51].&#xD;
