  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the main cause of mortality by cancer in France. The lung cancer stage at time&#xD;
      of diagnosis is a major determinant of survival. To date, 75% of lung cancer are diagnosed at&#xD;
      an advanced stage with worse survival). Lung cancer screening is based on low dose CT scan&#xD;
      which allows to decrease lung cancer related mortality of 20% in patients aged 55-74&#xD;
      years-old with a history of tobacco consumption â‰¥ 30 PY active of who quite &lt; 15 years. These&#xD;
      criteria for eligibility for lung cancer screening lead to 1 to 2% of lung cancer diagnosis&#xD;
      at the first CT scan. In our experience regarding 1 year of lung cancer surgical resection,&#xD;
      only 45% of the patients presented criteria for lung cancer screening. Moreover, the duration&#xD;
      of tobacco consumption would provide a better stratification of lung cancer risk compared to&#xD;
      only PY. Therefore, other criteria for lung cancer screening eligibility could be proposed.&#xD;
      Currently, 9 out of 10 lung cancer is linked with tobacco consumption which is also a major&#xD;
      risk factor for atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular events. Around 40% of patients with&#xD;
      a lung cancer have a history of atherosclerosis-associated cardiovascular event, mainly&#xD;
      coronary artery diseases and peripheral artery diseases. Main Objective: The objective is to&#xD;
      compare the observed rate of lung cancer prevalence in our study to the rate of around 2 %&#xD;
      observed in lung cancer screening trials in south Europe (France and Italy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the population of patients with a history of&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular event associated with tobacco consumption present a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of lung cancer compared with the population of patients eligible for lung cancer&#xD;
      screening program which is defined by age and history of tobacco consumption.&#xD;
