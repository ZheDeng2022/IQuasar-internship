  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study drug for a selected subgroup of patients with AML and MDS whose disease features a&#xD;
      mutation in the cohesin complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Talazoparib as a treatment for&#xD;
      certain kinds of breast cancer. It is not currently approved for treating your disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talazoparib is a drug that stops the activity of a protein called poly (adenosine diphosphate&#xD;
      [ADP]-ribose) polymerase or PARP. PARP is involved in repairing damage to the DNA within your&#xD;
      cells. DNA is the set of instructions found within all of your cells that tells them how to&#xD;
      behave. The DNA is damaged all the time by things around in the environment, and is repaired&#xD;
      by several different methods, one of which uses PARP. When PARP is turned off by Talazoparib&#xD;
      in the normal cells, other methods can still work to repair damage to DNA. However, in some&#xD;
      cancer cells these other methods are broken and cannot be used. When PARP is turned off by&#xD;
      Talazoparib in these cancer cells, DNA damage cannot be repaired and leads to the death of&#xD;
      the cancer cells. Talazoparib is a drug that is safe and active in breast cancer and&#xD;
      gynecologic cancers. However, there were no responses among 33 unselected patients with&#xD;
      hematologic malignancies, including 21 with AML (acute myeloid leukemia) and 4 with MDS&#xD;
      (myelodysplastic syndrome), when they received treatment with Talazoparib by itself. It is&#xD;
      not known if there were any patients with cohesin-mutations that were on the clinical trial&#xD;
      (these mutations are rare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are testing if Talazoparib is an effective&#xD;
      treatment for patients with AML and MDS that have a mutation in the cohesin complex. The&#xD;
      cohesin complex is made up of a group of proteins that are critical for normal DNA&#xD;
      replication activity. Mutations in the cohesin complex occur in patients with MDS/AML and may&#xD;
      represent a new therapeutic target. In a chemical screen experiment in a Dana-Farber Cancer&#xD;
      Institute laboratory, the investigators found that leukemia cells featuring a mutated cohesin&#xD;
      complex were sensitive to Talazoparib (meaning the leukemia cells went away after treatment&#xD;
      with Talazoparib) by a mechanism called synthetic lethality (this means that the lab&#xD;
      experiments showed that leukemia cells with a mutation in cohesin were dependent on PARP&#xD;
      activity to survive; when inhibiting PARP with a PARP inhibitor like Talazoparib, the&#xD;
      leukemia cells died). The investigators thus identified Talazoparib to be a possible&#xD;
      treatment for actual patients with MDS or AML that have a mutation in cohesin complex.&#xD;

             treating investigator and must have a diagnosis of one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Secondary AML (can be untreated secondary AML if previously treated for MDS,&#xD;
                  MDS/MPN, or any MPN with any anti-leukemic therapy; or previously treated&#xD;
                  secondary AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Relapsed or refractory AML or relapsed/refractory AML without available approved&#xD;
                  AML therapy&#xD;

                  azacitidine or sooner if they experience intolerance/progression while on&#xD;
                  HMA-based therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease defined as 5% or more blasts (blood or bone&#xD;
             marrow).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Participants must have normal organ function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (unless considered to&#xD;
                  be secondary to leukemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (unless&#xD;
                  considered to be secondary to leukemia)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented pathogenic mutation in cohesin complex including a mutation in STAG2,&#xD;
             SMC1A, RAD21, PDS5B, or SMC3 gene from a CLIA-approved test (local testing allowed;&#xD;
             will be centrally confirmed). Patient must have a minimum VAF of 5%. Historical&#xD;
             testing (up to 3 months) allowed for treatment start on study as long as no&#xD;
             disease-modifying agent was received since testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of Talazoparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because PARP inhibitor agents are suspected to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of the study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of Talazoparib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a white blood cell count &lt; 10 K/uL by date of registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of child bearing potential only, must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy within 2 weeks prior to registering for the&#xD;
             study or those who have not recovered from adverse events (to at least grade 1 with&#xD;
             exception of alopecia) due to agents administered more than 2 weeks earlier. Patients&#xD;
             must not have required cytoreductive therapy within 2 weeks of starting study drug&#xD;
             except for hydroxyurea. Prior palliative radiotherapy is permitted if completed within&#xD;
             5 days prior to study registration and patient has no clinically significant&#xD;
             toxicities such as mucositis or esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No limitations to prior therapy. However, patient may not have received prior PARP&#xD;
             inhibitor for any indication. If a patient is post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
             transplant, he/she must be &gt; 2 months from day of donor cell infusion to date of study&#xD;
             registration. They must be off immunosuppression therapy for at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration (topical steroids are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known CNS leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements or compromise safety assessment, in the judgement of the&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Talazoparib is a PARP inhibitor&#xD;
             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with Talazoparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with Talazoparib. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has known active HIV, HCV or HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior malignancy are eligible however patient must either be in&#xD;
             remission from prior malignancy OR have inactive (note: meaning they do not require&#xD;
             treatment) and asymptomatic disease. Maintenance therapy such as hormone therapy is&#xD;
             allowed&#xD;
