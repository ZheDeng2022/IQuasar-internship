    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 trial which aims to determine the safety and feasibility of anti-CD33&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expressing T cells (CD33CART) in children and&#xD;
      adolescents/young adults (AYAs) with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The&#xD;
      trial will be done in two phases: Phase 1 will determine the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      CD33CART cells using a 3+3 trial design. Phase 2 is an expansion phase designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the rate of response to CD33CART.&#xD;

      This study consists of two phases. The objectives of Phase 1 and Phase 2 are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of lentivirally-transduced CD33-redirected&#xD;
      CAR-T cells (CD33CART) in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory AML&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: To determine the percentage of subjects treated with CD33CART who achieve&#xD;
      morphologic remission (&lt;5% blasts in marrow) at Day 28 post-CD33CART cell infusion&#xD;
