      This study will investigate whether the use of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) in&#xD;
      combination with BRAF/MEK inhibitor will result in durable regional and distant recurrence&#xD;
      free survival in the neoadjuvant setting for treatment of advanced nodal BRAF mutant&#xD;

      inhibitor in neoadjuvant setting for treatment of advanced nodal BRAF mutant melanoma. For&#xD;
