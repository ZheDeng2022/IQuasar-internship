      The purpose of this study is to determine the predictive value of 7 biomarkers cervical&#xD;
      vaginal fluid on future preterm birth in pregnant women whose gestational age are 16 to 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      Preterm births (PTBs) refers to a delivery with a gestational age prior to 37 weeks, which&#xD;
      can be divided into extreme PTBs (&lt;28 weeks), early PTBs (28-32 weeks), and advanced PTBs&#xD;
      (32-37 weeks). The prevalence of PTBs is on a global scale, with more than 1 million PTB per&#xD;
      year in China (with a prevalence of 7%), ranking the second in the world. PTBs is the main&#xD;
      cause of perinatal death. Meanwhile, premature infants are at higher risk of short-term or&#xD;
      long-term complications such as respiratory distress syndrome and mental retardation, causing&#xD;
      huge economic and mental burdens on families and society. Most PTBs are spontaneous or caused&#xD;
      by premature rupture of membranes (PROM) while the precisely reason remains unknown.&#xD;
      Effective early prediction of PTBs and timely intervention are key to reducing PTBs and&#xD;
      improving adverse pregnancy outcomes. Current prediction methods for PTBs can be divided into&#xD;
      the following three categories: risk factor assessment, cervical length measurement, and&#xD;
      biomarkers. However, about half of premature pregnant women do not have high-risk factors,&#xD;
      and only premature risk factors cannot accurately identify prematurely at-risk populations.&#xD;
      Biomarkers such as fetal fibronectin (fFN) have a very high negative predictive value (more&#xD;
      than 95%), but positive predictive value is low (with 200 ng/ml as a cut-off value, and fFN&#xD;
      predicts a positive predictive value for preterm birth at &lt;34 weeks gestation reaching only&#xD;
      37.7%). Other biomarkers such as hyperphosphorylated insulin-like growth factor binding&#xD;
      protein-1 (phIGFBP1) and placenta α1 microglobulin (PAMG-1) were detected, but their&#xD;
      predictive effects were still dissatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there is no currently effective screening method for predicting the occurrence of&#xD;
      PTBs. How to accurately predict and diagnose PTBs is still an unsolved problem in obstetrics.&#xD;
      Our previous study identified seven biomarkers in cervical vaginal fluid(CVF) that may be&#xD;
      associated with preterm birth and preliminary validation in animal experiments, suggesting&#xD;
      that biomarkers in selected CVF may be effective predictors of PTBs, but larger samples of&#xD;
      clinical trials are required for validation.&#xD;
