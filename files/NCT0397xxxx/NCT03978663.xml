  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high risk breast cancers (any locally advanced breast cancer patient defined as&#xD;
      Stages IIB-III [excluding inflammatory breast cancer] with stage IIA being eligible for&#xD;
      triple negative and HER2-positive breast cancers) will receive neoadjuvant radiation to any&#xD;
      portion of their tumour in three fractions in order to act as an immune primer. Radiation&#xD;
      will be delivered to a portion of the tumour in three fractions. The patient will be&#xD;
      positioned prone as per the SIGNAL 2.0 protocol. The patient will then go on to standard of&#xD;
      care treatment (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery) followed by whole-breast radiation as&#xD;
      needed. Pathologic complete response will be the primary outcome. Immune markers will also be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced stage III&#xD;
      (non-inflammatory) breast cancer or stage IIb (triple negative or Her2+) breast cancers will&#xD;
      be approached to participate in this single arm trial. Patients with staging investigations&#xD;
      ruling out distant disease will be approached to participate and will undergo pre-treatment&#xD;
      image guided core biopsy and blood samples for molecular correlative studies, followed by&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation (delivered prone) to entire tumor with dose constraints to skin,&#xD;
      critical organs and contralateral breast, plus a 0.5 cm PTV. As much of the tumor that can&#xD;
      receive planned dose of 8 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions every second day, with fall off dose&#xD;
      to 4 Gy per fraction x 3 fractions for PTV margin. Two weeks following completion of&#xD;
      radiation, patients will undergo a second image guided core needle biopsy of tumor and blood&#xD;
      sample. They will then begin standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy (anthracycline and taxane&#xD;
      based), followed by a third tissue biopsy under image guidance of any residual tumor and&#xD;
      blood sample and then standard surgery (breast conserving or lumpectomy). This will be&#xD;
      followed by standard whole breast radiation (50 Gy in 25 fractions). Herceptin therapy and&#xD;
      hormonal therapy will be administered as per clinical standard when indicated. Primary&#xD;
      outcome will be measured as pathological complete response to treatment, and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include toxicity, immune markers (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, PD-1 and&#xD;
      PD-L1 up-regulation and changes to the circulating lymphocyte counts.&#xD;
