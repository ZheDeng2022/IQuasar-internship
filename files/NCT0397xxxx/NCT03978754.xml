  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a common malignant disease that threatens the health of women.As a serious&#xD;
      chronic condition from breast cancer treatment, lymphedema, is caused by chronic accumulation&#xD;
      of lymph fluid in the interstitial spaces of the affected limb or surrounding areas.Reported&#xD;
      prevalence of lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer varies, ranging from 7-45% One&#xD;
      reason for the wide variation in the reported incidence of lymphedema is the different&#xD;
      measurement techniques used and the absence of an agreed diagnostic criteria. Nowadays, the&#xD;
      common method include limb circumference measurement、limb volume measurement、bioimpedance&#xD;
      spectroscopy (BIS) and self-report.Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages .&#xD;
      As a new method for detecting lymphedema ，some study have shown indocyanine&#xD;
      green（ICG）lymphography can have a certain value for the detection of subclinical edema。Early&#xD;
      detection demonstrate the greatest promise of reducing the incidence of late-stage lymphedema&#xD;
      in breast cancer patients undergoing surgery.The aim of this study was therefore to examine&#xD;
      the relationships between the most commonly used measures of lymphedema and the respective&#xD;
      reliability of each of these tools. And if it's possible ,investigators are going to test&#xD;
      which method is more sensitive for the diagnosis of clinical and subclinical lymphedema as&#xD;
      well as the value of indocyanine green（ICG）in detecting sub-clinical lymphedema.&#xD;
