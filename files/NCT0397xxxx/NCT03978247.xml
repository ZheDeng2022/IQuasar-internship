  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of an algorithm developed to detect metabolic&#xD;
      profiles specific of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH and based on the reading of a blood&#xD;
      sample's infrared spectra&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed at patients suffering from severe or morbid obesity and engaged in a&#xD;
      bariatric surgery course. An additional blood sample will be taken upstream of the surgical&#xD;
      procedure in the fasted subject. The metabolic fingerprint of the patient will be analyzed on&#xD;
      serum from spectral data measured at most two hours after collection. The spectra obtained by&#xD;
      the spectroscopy platform will be processed by algorithmic analysis to build the diagnostic&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgical procedure, a liver biopsy will be performed. The sample will be sent to&#xD;
      the pathology laboratory for preparation and the slides will then be anonymized to be sent to&#xD;
      a specialized laboratory for centralized reading by an expert pathologist. This expert will&#xD;
      determine the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-NASH after microscopic&#xD;
      analysis of the sample without having any information about the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two results obtained by the spectroscopic test and by means of the biopsy will then be&#xD;
      compared to determine the diagnostic performance of the developped test (NASHMIR test).&#xD;
