    <textblock>
      BenraliScan aims to obtain thoracic computed tomography imaging data to predict the future&#xD;
      level of patient response to a monoclonal antibody. Because the clinical responses under&#xD;
      study can take many months to manifest, early identification of patients most-likely to&#xD;
      benefit from treatment and treatment rule-out for others will save considerable time for&#xD;
      everybody involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of BenraliScan is to determine the prognostic value (sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) of air-trapping measures&#xD;
      (Expiratory/Inspiratory ratios for Mean Lung Density (MLDe/i)) detected via quantitative&#xD;
      thoracic computed tomography at baseline for improvement in exacerbation rate (the presence&#xD;
      of a ≥50% reduction in baseline exacerbation rate versus the absence of a ≥50% reduction in&#xD;
      baseline exacerbation rate) at 52 weeks among eosinophilic asthma patients treated with&#xD;
      Benralizumab.&#xD;

      Secondary, exploratory objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe clinical improvement category sub-groups (e.g. non-responders versus strong&#xD;
           responders) in terms of: target concomitant medication usage, symptomology, quality of&#xD;
           life (questionnaires), exacerbation rates (and other adverse events) and lung function&#xD;
           parameters, differential blood counts, serum club cell secretory protein (CCSP) levels,&#xD;
           other quantitative thoracic computed tomography (QTCT) variables, sinus mucosal&#xD;
           thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform exploratory, prognostic-value studies (including but not limited to&#xD;
           prognostic variables derived from changes occurring over 24 weeks and from clustering or&#xD;
           factor mining at baseline and 24 weeks). These exploratory studies will include (but are&#xD;
           not necessarily limited to) estimating the sensitivity/specificity of baseline/early&#xD;
           imaging variables (or combination thereof) for predicting clinical response variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the prognostic categories (e.g. predicted non-responder versus predicted&#xD;
           responder) found in terms of: clinical improvement, target concomitant medication usage,&#xD;
           symptomology, quality of life (questionnaires), exacerbation rates (and other adverse&#xD;
           events) and lung function parameters, differential blood counts, serum CCSP levels,&#xD;
           other QTCT variables, sinus mucosal thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a centralised image library associated with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To verify the reproducibility of the relationships found between mean lung density&#xD;
           (upper and lower lung, inspiratory and expiratory), the fractal dimension of -850 HU&#xD;
           segmentations, and clinical variables found during the SCANN'AIR study (NCT03102749).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the association between bronchial homothety curves (the homothety of two&#xD;
           consecutive bronchial measurements as a function of bronchial generation) and disease&#xD;
           severity/progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor patient safety throughout the study.&#xD;

    <description>An exacerbation is defined as follows: worsening of symptoms (increased shortness of breath, cough, sputum, with or without fever) which necessitates unscheduled healthcare resource use, a need for &gt;48h of oral corticosteroids. For oral steroids, a minimal dose of 0.25 mg/kg is required. For patients taking oral steroids on a long term basis, at least a doubling dose for 2 days is required.</description>

Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by responding to one bronchodilator use question and 5 symptom questions. Questions are weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ-6 score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and &lt;1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.5 indicates not well controlled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</description>
