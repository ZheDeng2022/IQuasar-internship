  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the lack of human resources, it is impossible to monitor patients' medication&#xD;
      adherence objectively or in-person by observation like tuberculosis programs worldwide do.&#xD;
      The feasibility and patient acceptance of the innovative video-based directly observed&#xD;
      therapy (VDOT) approach for improving medication adherence among tuberculosis patients has&#xD;
      been demonstrated through studies in the United States as well as internationally (7).&#xD;
      Medication adherence among VDOT users has been found to be comparable to in-person directly&#xD;
      observed treatment (91% vs 95%) among patients in New York (8). In this clinical research&#xD;
      project, we will test the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of an innovative&#xD;
      mobile-based behavioral intervention to improve medication adherence and depression symptoms&#xD;
      among patients suffering from depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a randomized prospective study utilizing Video Directly Observed Therapy (VDOT),&#xD;
      which is a novel means of remotely observing patients ingesting medications using videos sent&#xD;
      from the patients' smartphone application. The VDOT mobile phone application called&#xD;
      SureAdhere was developed and found to be feasible and acceptable for monitoring daily&#xD;
      treatment of active tuberculosis in San Diego, CA (R21-AI088326; PI: R. Garfein). For testing&#xD;
      the feasibility, acceptance and effectiveness of VDOT application (app) SureAdhere among&#xD;
      depression patients, we will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial for which a&#xD;
      maximum of 100 patients will be recruited (50 patients in study group; 50 patients in control&#xD;
      group). Informed consent will be obtained prior to the start of study&#xD;
      activities.Randomization will be performed using a computer generated randomization program&#xD;
      assigning a random group to each consecutive study participant. This will be performed prior&#xD;
      to the study and stored in a list with participant numbers. Those assigned to the control&#xD;
      group will receive care as usual. Those assigned to study group will receive assistance in&#xD;
      installing the SureAdhere app on their own smartphone. If they did not own a smartphone, a&#xD;
      loaned smartphone with internet service plan and preinstalled SureAdhere mobile phone&#xD;
      application will be provided to them if available. The SureAdhere app is programmed to send&#xD;
      encrypted, time/date stamped videos to a HIPAA-compliant server. The study group subjects&#xD;
      will receive a pin for their individualized log-in through a text message on their phone.&#xD;
      They will be trained on how to use the application to send videos through a training video&#xD;
      and handouts provided to them. Study staff will be available to answer any questions or&#xD;
      concerns about the SureAdhere app. In case of technical issues, study staff will gather&#xD;
      information about the concerns and then get input from the customer support team at&#xD;
      SureAdhere, Inc. to resolve the issues. The study group subjects will receive individualized&#xD;
      text reminders on their phone prior to each dose of their depression medicine. They will be&#xD;
      requested to use the VDOT smartphone app to make a video recording of each medication dose&#xD;
      ingested during the 3 month study period following their first visit. Research staff will&#xD;
      regularly monitor videos using a password protected website and document each medication&#xD;
      dose. Outcomes data will be obtained through self-report questionnaires at three time points:&#xD;
      baseline, about 6 weeks and about 3 months and from the patient medical records. The baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire will be conducted after the informed consent and will collect information about&#xD;
      demographic characteristics (i.e. date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, type of residence-&#xD;
      house vs apartment own vs rent, type of insurance), medication adherence (using ASK-20&#xD;
      Medication Adherence questionnaire) and depression symptoms (using Patient Health&#xD;
      Questionnaire-9). Both these validated survey tools are available for public use. The&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires sent to the subjects will obtain additional information regarding&#xD;
      technology acceptance from the participants in the study group only. From all subjects, the&#xD;
      follow-up questionnaires will gather information about medication adherence and depression&#xD;
      symptoms. Patient medical records and VDOT video review will be used to obtain an objective&#xD;
      measure of medication adherence, comorbidities (Elixhauser co-morbidity score) and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
