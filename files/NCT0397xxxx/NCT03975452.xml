  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study outlines a clinical prospective protocol consisting of preoperative chemoradiation&#xD;
      in locally advanced rectal cancer, without elective pelvic nodal irradiation. The proposal to&#xD;
      exclude lateral spaces from the target volume is based on the assumption that the&#xD;
      radiological evidence of recurrence in the lateral lymph nodes is shown to be below 5%. In&#xD;
      the study all patients underwent an accurate pre-treatment work-up including total body CT,&#xD;
      pelvic MRI and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT, in order to include patients without evidence of&#xD;
      disease in lateral lymph nodes. The primary endpoint of the study was the reduction of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicity; secondary endpoints were the pathological complete response (pCR),&#xD;
      the local control (LC) rate, the overall survival (OS) and the disease-free survival (DFS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by histologically proven rectal cancer were considered for enrollment in a&#xD;
      prospective protocol that included preoperative CRT and surgical treatment. All patients&#xD;
      underwent pre-treatment work-up (clinical examination, pancolonoscopy with biopsy, total body&#xD;
      CT scan, pelvic MRI, and whole body 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT scan). Eligible patients had&#xD;
      primary resectable cT2-low lying-T3, N0-N1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum, without evidence of&#xD;
      disease in lateral lymph nodes. Additional eligibility criteria included performance status&#xD;
      as well as liver, kidney, and bone marrow function that allowed for long-course CRT, older&#xD;
      than 18 years, and no distant metastases.&#xD;
