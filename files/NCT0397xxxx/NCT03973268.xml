      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most drugs that treat mood disorders take a long time to work. Ketamine works within hours. A&#xD;
      dose can last for a week or more. Certain receptors in the brain might help ketamine work. A&#xD;
      drug that blocks these receptors might affect how it works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the antidepressant response of ketamine is linked to AMPA receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-70 with major depression disorder without psychotic features&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened under protocol 01-M-0254. They will have blood tests and a&#xD;
      physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay at the NIH Clinical Center for 5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 lasts 4 weeks. For 2 weeks, participants will taper off their psychiatric medicine.&#xD;
      Then they will have the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI: Participants will lie in a machine that takes pictures of their brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MEG: Participants will lie down and do tasks. A cone lowered on their head will record&#xD;
           brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional sleep tests: Electrodes on the scalp and body and belts around the body will&#xD;
           monitor participants while they sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional TMS: Participants will do tasks while a wire coil is held on their scalp. An&#xD;
           electrical current will pass through the coil that affects brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For phase 2, on day 0 participants will take the study drug or a placebo orally. While having&#xD;
      a MEG, they will get ketamine infused into a vein in one arm while blood is drawn from a vein&#xD;
      in the other arm. On day 1, participants will again take the study drug or a placebo orally.&#xD;
      On days 3-7, they will repeat many of the phase 1 tests. Days 8 and 9 are optional and&#xD;
      include an open label ketamine treatment and many of the phase 1 tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work by our group and others has demonstrated that a single intravenous dose of the&#xD;
      glutamatergic modulator ketamine consistently produces rapid (within two hours), robust, and&#xD;
      relatively sustained (approximately one to two weeks) antidepressant effects in patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression. Although ketamine&#xD;
      is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, convergent evidence from&#xD;
      behavioral, cellular, and molecular ketamine studies supports the theory that enhanced&#xD;
      -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor activity-with a&#xD;
      concomitant increase in synaptic plasticity-is critical to its mechanism of antidepressant&#xD;
      action and may be the key to developing analogous rapidacting antidepressants. Notably, both&#xD;
      animal and human studies indicate that acute, sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion is associated&#xD;
      with robust increases in gamma power. Multiple synaptic mechanisms play a role in regulating&#xD;
      gamma oscillations, including AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated depolarization and gamma&#xD;
      aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-mediated inhibition. Ketamine may influence both of these&#xD;
      systems, both by silencing GABAergic inhibitory synapses and by increasing glutamate release,&#xD;
      thereby activating AMPARs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical translational mechanistic protocol, in parallel with a preclinical study&#xD;
      (Bench-to-Bedside Award, NIH), is designed to begin to disentangle the neurobiological&#xD;
      underpinnings of ketamine s mechanism of antidepressant action and to develop a cross-species&#xD;
      biomarker of target engagement (i.e., gamma power). The study will test the importance of&#xD;
      AMPAR throughput by attempting to block the behavioral (i.e., antidepressant),&#xD;
      electrophysiological, and biochemical effects of ketamine with an AMPAR antagonist. We first&#xD;
      demonstrated in animal models that administering an AMPAR antagonist (NBQX) could block&#xD;
      ketamine s antidepressant-like properties, suggesting that AMPAR neurotransmission was&#xD;
      involved in these effects. This finding has now been replicated by multiple labs. In the&#xD;
      present study, we propose to evaluate whether pre-treatment with perampanel, an AMPAR&#xD;
      antagonist, blocks or reduces the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with&#xD;
      treatment resistant depression (TRD). Further, we will examine whether AMPAR activity is&#xD;
      important to the continued antidepressant effects of ketamine by examining whether treatment&#xD;
      with perampanel blocks or reduces ketamine s continued antidepressant effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 patients ages 18 to 70 years, with a diagnosis of MDD (without psychotic features) will be&#xD;
      recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-phase pathophysiological study that attempts to understand the mechanism of&#xD;
      action of ketamine s antidepressant effects. Phase I includes a medication taper, drug-free&#xD;
      period, and baseline testing (e.g. clinical rating scales, sEEG, TMS, MEG). In Phase II,&#xD;
      participants will receive an open-label ketamine infusion with a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      add-on intervention (perampanel vs. placebo). Two to three hours prior to receiving ketamine&#xD;
      (0.5 mg/kg), subjects will be randomized into one of three arms. Subjects in Arm 1 will&#xD;
      receive perampanel (8 mg p.o.), while those randomized to Arm 2 or Arm 3 will receive&#xD;
      matching placebo. On Day 1, the second blinded oral medication will be administered after&#xD;
      clinical rating scales are obtained. Subjects randomized to Arm 1 and 3 will receive matching&#xD;
      placebo, while subjects randomized to Arm 2 will receive perampanel. sEEG, TMS, and MEG will&#xD;
      be obtained again on two more occasions during Phase II. Participants who completed Phase II&#xD;
      will also be offered one open-label ketamine treatment, during which they will be assessed&#xD;
      for mood symptoms and possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: By Day 1, patients treated with ketamine who are randomized to pre-treatment&#xD;
      with a single oral dose of the AMPAR antagonist perampanel will have significantly more&#xD;
      depressive symptoms than those who are randomized to pretreatment with placebo, as measured&#xD;
      by the MADRS. Hypothesis 2: By Day 2, patients treated with ketamine who were randomized to&#xD;
      perampanel on Day 1 will have significantly more depressive symptoms than those who were&#xD;
      randomized to placebo, as measured by the MADRS. To acquire data corroborating that ketamine&#xD;
      s antidepressant effects are mediated through AMPARs, surrogate plasticity measures will be&#xD;
      obtained using sEEG, TMS, and MEG. In addition, blood samples for biomarkers will also be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
