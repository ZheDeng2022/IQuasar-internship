  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study designed to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single oral dose of FIA586 in participants with mild and moderate hepatic&#xD;
      impairment (HI) compared to matched healthy participants.The information obtained in this&#xD;
      study will help to determine whether dosage adjustment for FIA586 is necessary in patients&#xD;
      with advanced liver fibrosis who have mild to moderate HI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single-dose, open-label, parallel-group study in participants with mild&#xD;
      (Child-Pugh A; n=8-10) and moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=8-10) hepatic impairment (HI) and&#xD;
      matched healthy participants with normal hepatic function (n=8-20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of an up to 28-day screening period (Days -28 to 2), a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation (Day -1) prior to dosing on Day 1, and a treatment period of 6 days (Days 1-6).&#xD;
      Participants will remain domiciled up to Day 6 after the Study Completion procedures have&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will be given a single dose of FIA586 following an overnight fast. PK&#xD;
      (plasma and urine) and biomarker samples will be taken prior to dosing of study treatment and&#xD;
      up to 120 hours (Day 6) post- dose. On Day 6, after the last PK sample has been taken, Study&#xD;
      Completion assessments will be performed, and the participant will be discharged, provided&#xD;
      there are no safety or tolerability concerns as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a post-study safety contact conducted approximately 30 days after&#xD;
      administration of study treatment.&#xD;
