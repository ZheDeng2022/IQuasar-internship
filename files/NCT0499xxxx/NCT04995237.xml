      The purpose of this research study is to find out if access to fresh produce along with&#xD;
      individual goal setting and education influences vegetable consumption, self-management&#xD;
      [self-efficacy], resilience, or quality of life. Researcher think access to fresh produce&#xD;
      along with individual goal setting and education, may improve all of the above. This study&#xD;
      will allow them to learn more about it.&#xD;

      This research study focused on examining how a Prescription Produce Plan (PPP) may influence&#xD;
      vegetable consumption, self-management [self-efficacy], resilience, and quality of life in&#xD;
      older adults. This research study involves meeting with a team of VCU students and faculty to&#xD;
      learn information about nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete a total of five (5) surveys and the consent process during the enrollment visit&#xD;
           lasting approximately 30 to 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record their blood pressure readings and blood glucose readings [if they already do&#xD;
           this] once a week in a notebook provided by the research team and then self-report the&#xD;
           blood pressure and blood glucose readings at the next two (2) study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Receive individualized teaching supporting obtaining the goals at this visit and future&#xD;
           study visits. The study team will discuss with participants the contents of the produce&#xD;
           bags and how to cook the contents of the bag. They will also work with participants to&#xD;
           set goals for themselves. Goals for this study will focus on vegetable consumption,&#xD;
           weight management, and either blood pressure and/or blood glucose measurements. The&#xD;
           initial study visit may last approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. At the end of the initial study visit, you will receive a voucher from the Shalom Farms&#xD;
           Mobile Market for once a week redemption over the course of 6 weeks while participating&#xD;
           in the program. VCU Health Hub 25th Street participants will receive a produce bag at&#xD;
           the end of this visit and will need to come to the Health Hub weekly to pick up the&#xD;
           produce bag.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subsequent study visits will focus on participant goals. Participants will meet with the&#xD;
           study team to discuss if goals were met or not met and the study team will provide&#xD;
           individualized teaching to support meeting participant's set goals. The study team will&#xD;
           ask participants to meet with them twice after the initial study visit for approximately&#xD;
           20 to 30 minutes at each visit. These meetings will be at Week #3 and at Week #6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Participants will record in provided notebooks their blood pressure, weight, and blood&#xD;
           glucose [if they are already checking their blood glucose prior to participating in this&#xD;
           study]. These measurements will also be reported during study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Participants are asked to meet with a member of the research team after six (6) weeks of&#xD;
           participating in the study to complete a total of three (3) post-study surveys. This&#xD;
           visit will last approximately 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last up to 8 weeks for a total of approximately 3 hours of&#xD;
      in person visits. Approximately 30 individuals will participate in this study.&#xD;
