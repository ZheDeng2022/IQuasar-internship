  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the most common forms of senile&#xD;
      dementia. Although the animal research of dementia has made remarkable progress, clinical&#xD;
      trials of drugs for AD pathology have failed in recent years. The study of dementia based on&#xD;
      cell and animal model generally aims at a single mechanism and target, and its results are&#xD;
      quite different from the real clinical environment. More and more studies suggest that&#xD;
      investigators should shift the focus of research to the early stage of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      before dementia. Prevention is more important than cure, and intervention against&#xD;
      multi-factors and multi-targets has become an important consensus. A large number of studies&#xD;
      have shown that the mechanism of vascular brain injury plays an important role in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of AD and VaD, and many vascular risk factors are interventionable to some&#xD;
      extent. Therefore, based on the clinical cohort, in-depth study of vascular cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (Vascular cognitive impairment, VCI) has important clinical significance for the&#xD;
      effective prevention and treatment of AD and VaD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leading team of the project has focused on VCI research for a long time. After nearly 20&#xD;
      years of experimental research and preliminary clinical observation, it is proposed that&#xD;
      chronic cerebral ischemia can not only be a clinical disease entity, but also an important&#xD;
      pathological basis for the early onset of VCI. This view has recently been supported by a&#xD;
      number of authoritative international research evidence. Big data's study of 1171 patients&#xD;
      with AD reported by Nature Commun in 2016 shows that the early pathological changes of AD may&#xD;
      not be a cascade of amyloid protein (Aβ), but a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Therefore,&#xD;
      this project intends to establish an early clinical research cohort of VCI to focus on three&#xD;
      key issues in VCI research and clinical practice: (1) the theory that cerebral hypoperfusion&#xD;
      may be an important pathological basis for the occurrence and development of VCI needs direct&#xD;
      evidence support from clinical studies, and its mechanism needs further elucidation. (2)&#xD;
      Based on the fusion of multimodal MRI of VCI vascular brain injury pathology and PET imaging&#xD;
      markers of Aβ molecular pathology, a multivariate VCI cognitive evaluation model is&#xD;
      constructed, and its sensitivity and specificity may be better than the existing VCI&#xD;
      diagnostic standards. (3) the protective effect of early comprehensive intervention of&#xD;
      vascular risk factors on cognitive decline in VCI may be more effective than that of single&#xD;
      risk factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of this project is to establish a study cohort of non-demented vascular&#xD;
      cognitive impairment(VCIND). Neurocognitive function assessment combined with multimodal MRI&#xD;
      including ASL, DCE, DTI and BOLD techniques were used to observe the role of cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion in the early stage and progression of VCI. At the same time, the relationship&#xD;
      between the changes of blood-brain barrier and neural network and cognitive decline was&#xD;
      dynamically observed to verify and explore the effect and mechanism of cognitive impairment&#xD;
      caused by cerebral hypoperfusion. The second part studies the pathology of vascular brain&#xD;
      injury based on MRI and the molecular pathology of A β based on PET and the relationship&#xD;
      between Aβ molecular pathology and cognitive impairment, including the main factors affecting&#xD;
      cognitive function, and uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to develop a multiple&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation system of VCI cognitive function, which is mainly based on the fusion&#xD;
      of MRI and PET image markers. In the third part, a multicenter randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      cohort study was conducted to observe the cognitive protective effect of comprehensive&#xD;
      intensive intervention of vascular risk factors on early VCI, so as to provide direct&#xD;
      clinical evidence and intervention model for the prevention and treatment of VCI. The topics&#xD;
      of the above three aspects covered by this project are closely related, which is not only a&#xD;
      key scientific problem, but also an important clinical problem to be solved in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of this project is expected to further clarify the role and mechanism of cerebral&#xD;
      hypoperfusion in VCI, provide a new theoretical basis for the prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      dementia, and develop a quantitative evaluation system of VCI cognitive function mainly based&#xD;
      on imaging technology and AI algorithm, so as to provide a more accurate and convenient&#xD;
      diagnostic tool for early clinical identification and scientific research of VCI. Draw up the&#xD;
      early comprehensive intervention paradigm of VCI based on vascular risk factors and&#xD;
      popularize it in clinic, gradually form an expert consensus, enrich and update the guidelines&#xD;
      for diagnosis and treatment of dementia, and effectively improve the level of prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of dementia related to VCI.&#xD;

      The main research contents of this project focus on the above three key issues: to study the&#xD;
      role and mechanism of cerebral hypoperfusion in the early pathogenesis of VCI; to establish a&#xD;
      predictive model for early diagnosis of MRI vascular brain damage and PET-A β pathology; to&#xD;
      explore the clinical effect of early comprehensive intensive intervention of VRF on the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To explore the role and mechanism of cerebral hypoperfusion in the early brain damage of&#xD;
      VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The relationship between vascular risk factor burden and VCI Vascular risk factor (VRF)&#xD;
           is not only an important factor in the occurrence and development of VCI, but also the&#xD;
           main intervention target. Elucidating the relationship between VRF and VCI can provide&#xD;
           an important theoretical basis for its early prevention and treatment. Some clinical&#xD;
           studies have shown that long-term VRF burden is closely related to the decrease of&#xD;
           global cerebral blood flow in young and middle-aged people without stroke, suggesting&#xD;
           that there is a close relationship between VRF, cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive&#xD;
           impairment, but it needs to be further clarified in clinical cohort studies. In this&#xD;
           project, a clinical cohort of VCIND was established, including 500 middle-aged and&#xD;
           elderly people with VRF burden, and their complete demographic information was&#xD;
           collected. The overall VRF burden was assessed by the Framingham Stroke risk Assessment&#xD;
           scale, and the subjects were divided into low risk group (10-year stroke risk &lt; 10%),&#xD;
           medium risk group (10-year stroke risk 10%) and high-risk group (10-year stroke risk &gt;&#xD;
           20%) for follow-up. The changes of cognitive function in baseline and 3-year follow-up&#xD;
           period were measured. The relationship between VRF burden and cognitive decline in VCI&#xD;
           was analyzed by mixed effect model, and whether decreased cerebral perfusion mediated&#xD;
           this correlation was analyzed by mediating effect model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The role of cerebral hypoperfusion in the early brain damage of VCI. Many experimental&#xD;
           studies have shown that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion may play an important role in the&#xD;
           occurrence and development of VaD and AD. Big data of 1171 patients with late-onset AD&#xD;
           in the last study showed that the early pathological changes in AD may not be an A β&#xD;
           cascade, but a decrease in cerebral blood flow, suggesting that cerebral hypoperfusion&#xD;
           may play an important role in cognitive decline. However, there is still a lack of&#xD;
           systematic prospective study on the role of cerebral hypoperfusion in the early&#xD;
           pathogenesis of VCI. Based on the establishment of a cohort of early VCI population,&#xD;
           arterial spin labeled magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI) was used to observe the&#xD;
           changes of whole brain and regional cerebral blood flow in 300 VCIND subjects during the&#xD;
           3-year follow-up period. The subjects were divided into 3 groups for follow-up according&#xD;
           to the tertile value of the relative total cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at baseline. At&#xD;
           the same time, 100 patients with normal cognitive function matching gender, age, and&#xD;
           education level were included as controls. The changes of cognitive function of the&#xD;
           subjects were evaluated with a complete neuropsychological scale. The follow-up outcome&#xD;
           indicators were as follows: VCIND progressed to VaD,VCIND progressed to AD or other&#xD;
           types of dementia, declining VCIND, stable VCIND, and cognition remained normal. The&#xD;
           mixed effect model was used to analyze the role of cerebral hypoperfusion in the early&#xD;
           brain damage of VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Damage of blood-brain barrier and neural network in the early stage of VCI. The&#xD;
           integrity of neural network is the neural basis of cognitive function, and the&#xD;
           blood-brain barrier is an important part of neurovascular units. Previous experimental&#xD;
           studies of investigators team have shown that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can lead to&#xD;
           damage of neural networks and blood-brain barrier in many brain regions, including&#xD;
           hippocampus. The subjects were followed up longitudinally to observe the changes of&#xD;
           blood-brain barrier and neural network. The outcome index of 3-year follow-up was as&#xD;
           follows: VCIND progressed from VaD, to AD and other types of dementia, VCIND, stable&#xD;
           VCIND and cognition remained normal. By comparing the multi-dimensional relationship&#xD;
           between blood-brain barrier, neural network and cognitive outcome in time and space, the&#xD;
           mechanism of brain function and structure damage in patients with early VCI was further&#xD;
           revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Early VCI diagnosis prediction model based on imaging technology and its key techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the occurrence and development of VCI is not only closely&#xD;
      related to structural MRI indexes such as cerebral infarction, cerebral atrophy and cerebral&#xD;
      microvascular disease, but also to functional MRI indexes such as cerebral hypoperfusion and&#xD;
      brain ultrastructural damage. However, a VCI quantitative evaluation system based on the&#xD;
      above imaging index fusion has not been established at present. On the other hand, up to&#xD;
      40-80% of VCI patients have AD-like pathological changes characterized by Aβ. The impact of&#xD;
      Aβ pathology on cognitive decline in patients with VCI and whether A β pathological&#xD;
      indicators need to be included in the diagnosis of VCI still need to be clarified in cohort&#xD;
      studies. This project intends to use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, combined with&#xD;
      MRI vascular brain pathological damage and related factors affecting cognitive function, to&#xD;
      build a VCI diagnosis prediction model suitable for clinical application, and verify it in&#xD;
      the cohort study. At the same time, the Aβ molecular pathological images based on PET were&#xD;
      integrated to establish a VCI diagnosis prediction model suitable for clinical scientific&#xD;
      research, and further clarify the possible role of Aβ pathology in the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establishment of VCI diagnosis and prediction model. Three hundred non-dementia subjects&#xD;
           (including pathology of VRF and / or vascular brain damage) were enrolled. According to&#xD;
           the clinical data, imaging data and systematic neuropsychological evaluation results,&#xD;
           all subjects were divided into VCIND and non-VCIND (including cognitive normal or other&#xD;
           types of cognitive impairment). The changes of cognitive function were systematically&#xD;
           evaluated during the 3-year follow-up. Two types of outcome indicators are defined as&#xD;
           cognitive decline and cognitive retention. The indexes of different degrees and forms of&#xD;
           brain injury (including vascular risk factors, structural MRI, ASL-MRI and DTI) were&#xD;
           recorded at baseline, and the corresponding quantitative analysis was carried out with&#xD;
           the outcome index. AI algorithm was used to establish an early VCI diagnosis model&#xD;
           suitable for clinical application. According to the cognitive outcome of the 3-year&#xD;
           follow-up period, a model was established to predict the cognitive outcome of VCIND by&#xD;
           imaging indicators at the baseline. In addition, 50 subjects in the VCIND group and 50&#xD;
           subjects in the non-VCIND group at the baseline were tested by 11C-PiB PET, and the Aβ&#xD;
           pathological images were fused with the above-mentioned MRI images to establish a VCI&#xD;
           diagnosis and evaluation system suitable for clinical scientific research.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Verification of VCI diagnostic and predictive model. At the end of the 3-year follow-up,&#xD;
           the brain damage and cognitive function of the subjects were re-evaluated. According to&#xD;
           the newly diagnosed VCIND, the reliability and validity of the diagnostic and predictive&#xD;
           model were verified, and the clinical application model and scientific research model&#xD;
           were verified.The sensitivity and specificity of type A were compared and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. A cohort study on the effect of comprehensive intervention of vascular risk factors on&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study on the effect of early comprehensive intensive intervention on vascular cognitive&#xD;
           impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The purpose of this study was to establish a cohort of VCIND (n = 250) and a cohort of&#xD;
           cognitive normal people with VRF (n=250). Each cohort was divided into two groups:&#xD;
           comprehensive intensive intervention group and general intervention group. Comprehensive&#xD;
           intensive intervention provides guidance on blood pressure, blood sugar, lipid&#xD;
           regulation, exercise and other aspects according to the corresponding VRF, and&#xD;
           formulates specific intervention programs and quality control standards. Medical staff&#xD;
           implement tracking management and regular reminders through smart wearable devices and&#xD;
           cloud platform data to achieve the goal of gradual intervention. General data, vascular&#xD;
           risk factors and neuropsychological assessment were completed at baseline and 1-year,&#xD;
           2-year, 3-year follow-up. Mixed random effect regression model and Cox proportional&#xD;
           hazard model were used to analyze the effects of VRF and comprehensive intervention on&#xD;
           the outcome of end events (main outcome: dementia, secondary outcome: stroke, myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, cognitive impairment, dementia subtype and mortality). According to the&#xD;
           Fuminghan stroke risk subgroup, the differences of clinical effects of comprehensive&#xD;
           intervention in different subgroups were statistically analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of comprehensive intensive intervention on early cerebral perfusion and Aβ in&#xD;
           patients with vascular cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of baseline and 3-year follow-up, 50 patients in the VCIND comprehensive intensive&#xD;
      intervention group and 50 patients in the general treatment group completed the detection of&#xD;
      ASL cerebral blood flow and 11C-PiB PET cerebral Aβ. The effects of comprehensive intensive&#xD;
      intervention on cerebral blood flow, Aβ and cognitive function were analyzed. To further&#xD;
      analyze the relationship between the changes of cerebral blood flow and A β pathology, as&#xD;
      well as its influence on cognitive function, to clarify the target and mechanism of early&#xD;
      comprehensive intensive intervention, and to establish a perfect evaluation standard of&#xD;
      imaging effect.&#xD;
