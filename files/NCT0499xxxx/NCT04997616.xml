  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Levels of major cannabinoid and cannabinoid metabolites (i.e., CBD, CBD-OH) will be&#xD;
      determined in the plasma of healthy volunteers following 10 days of Happy Lane Hemp&#xD;
      Extract/CBD soft gels (25 mg per capsule) supplementation using liquid chromatography-mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LCMS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the levels of CBD, CBD-OH, THC, THC-COOH, and&#xD;
      11-OH-THC in plasma of healthy volunteers that have ingested hemp extract/CBD for 10&#xD;
      consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team is planning to recruit 24 adults (12 females, 12 males), age of 18-45 years&#xD;
      old, inclusive to allow for enrollment of 20 eligible adults (10 females, 10 males). Subjects&#xD;
      will be identified and recruited using AR Research via the UAMS Translational Research&#xD;
      Institute (TRI). Specifically, TRI coordinators will assist with calling, screening, and&#xD;
      scheduling potential subjects based on the list generated from AR Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the informed consent form, which includes an attestation that the subject has&#xD;
      not used cannabinoids within the past 4 weeks and an attestation that the subject will not&#xD;
      use any prescription or over-the-counter medications during the study, each subject will&#xD;
      provide a baseline plasma sample (up to 15 mL, collected by TRI coordinators) that will be&#xD;
      used to determine if any cannabinoids (CBD, CBD-OH, THC, THC-COOH, and 11-OH-THC) are present&#xD;
      in the blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples (pre- and post-intervention) will be analyzed at the completion of the&#xD;
      study. Therefore, if cannabinoids are found in any of the baseline samples, the result will&#xD;
      be noted but will not necessarily result in any subjects being excluded from the study.&#xD;
      However, exclusion of data from subjects whose initial test show a positive result for CBD or&#xD;
      THC from the overall study may be deemed necessary by the research team under certain&#xD;
      circumstances (e.g., if the baseline THC and/or CBD signal in a study subject is so large&#xD;
      that accurate detection of the intervention would be hindered).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the informed consent form is signed and the baseline plasma sample is drawn, each&#xD;
      subject will be provided with Happy Lane™ Hemp Extract/CBD soft gels (25 mg CBD per capsule;&#xD;
      the certificate of analyses is provided along with this Study Protocol). Half of the subjects&#xD;
      (5 women and 5 men) will be taking one gel capsule per day (25 mg/day dose), while the other&#xD;
      half (5 women and 5 men) will be taking 2 gel capsules per day (50 mg/day dose, both capsules&#xD;
      will be taken at the same time). Group assignment will be made randomly based on a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will take gel capsules for 10 consecutive days at approximately the same time of day&#xD;
      (±1 hour) on each of these days, beginning the morning after consent is provided (Day 2).&#xD;
      During this 10-day period, subjects will record number of capsules (1 or 2) and time of day&#xD;
      ingested, as well as any adverse event in a diary. This diary will be provided to each&#xD;
      subject at the time of consent (Day 1), and each subject will return for a second visit&#xD;
      within 2 to 6 hours after the last dose of the 10-day regimen (Day 11). During the second&#xD;
      visit, subject will return to TRI, and a blood specimen (up to 15 mL) will be collected.&#xD;
      Diaries, empty capsule bottles, and any extra/unused capsules will also be returned to the&#xD;
      study staff during this second visit (Day 11), so that capsule count may be conducted by&#xD;
      study staff for drug accountability. Subjects will receive a follow-up phone call (Day 13 or&#xD;
      next business day) to collect any adverse events (AE) that occurred after diaries were&#xD;
      returned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood specimens will be used for determination of major cannabinoids using the liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. The cannabinoid/metabolite analysis will be performed at a&#xD;
      certified laboratory in Oxford, Mississippi - ElSohly Laboratories, Inc&#xD;
      (http://www.elsohly.com/). This is a DEA licensed analytical laboratory under leadership of&#xD;
      Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly.&#xD;
