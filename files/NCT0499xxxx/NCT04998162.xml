  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to analyze the effect of SVF injection produced by adipose&#xD;
      tissue processing, in terms of clinical improvement, in patients with moderate to severe&#xD;
      (stage 1-3) ankle osteoarthritis. Evaluation will be performed by administering pre-operative&#xD;
      and post-operative clinical assessment questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up with a pre-operative evaluation and post-operative evaluations&#xD;
      at 30 days, 3-6-12, and 24 months after application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients with moderate to severe ankle osteoarthritis (grade 1-3 according to Giannini's&#xD;
      classification) will be included in this pilot study, in which patients will be treated with&#xD;
      single injection of Stromal Vascular Fraction - SVF ,obtained by processing the patient's&#xD;
      abdominal adipose tissue. All patients will be examined with a baseline clinical visit. For&#xD;
      obtaining SVF, will be carried out a routinely performed procedure aimed at obtaining a small&#xD;
      amount of adipose tissue from all patients. Subsequently, patients will be followed up with&#xD;
      clinical evaluation at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>30 patients with moderate to severe ankle osteoarthritis (Giannini grade 1-3) will be included in the study and the affected ankle will be treated with a single injection of SVF (Stromal vascular fraction).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>AOS (Ankle Osteoarthritis Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>AOS is a score divided into 2 subscales, each with 9 questions. The first section assesses pain, while the other assesses ankle function. The answers consist of a rating on a 100-mm-long horizontal visual analog scale (from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; for pain section, and &quot;no limitation&quot; and &quot;extremely limited&quot; for function section). The highest possible value of the score is 100 (worst score) and the lowest (best score) is 0.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>AOFAS (The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score):</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>AOFAS is the most validated and widely used clinical and functional assessment tool for the ankle and foot. The score consists of 9 questions grouped into 3 categories for a total of 100 points maximum: Pain (up to 40 points), Function (up to 50 points) and Alignment (up to 10 points).100 points represent the best possible clinical-functional condition and absence of symptoms, 0 points represent the worst possible clinical-functional condition. AOFAS is a tool that combines the subjective component of the patients with the objective evaluation by the physician.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS-pain (Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>VAS Iis represented by a line 10 cm long: one end indicates the absence of pain and corresponds to 0, the other end indicates the worst pain imaginable and corresponds to 10. The scale is filled by the patient who is asked to draw a mark on the line representing the perceived pain. The distance measured from the 0 end corresponds to the subjective measure of pain</description>

    <measure>Range Of Motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 (12-Item Short Form Survey):</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 consist of 12 questions that permit to investigate the two synthetic indices, PCS Physical Component Summary for the Physical State and MCS Mental Component Summary for the Mental State. The main strengths of this questionnaire are its brevity and relative ease of use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D (EuroQoL) Current Health Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D profile, asks patients to classify their health based on self-assessed levels of problems (&quot;no&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;extreme&quot;) on five dimensions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-VAS Is a visual analog scale that has a range of scores from 0 (worst imaginable health condition) to 100 (best imaginable health condition).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS):</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A tool to assess patient satisfaction in consideration of their current degree of pain, function, and daily activity. Patients can express if their state of health will be satisfying, answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Final treatment opinion</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1,3,6,12,24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The patient should indicate satisfaction and relative degree with treatment at the end of the clinical trial (24 months follow-up). All patients will be able to indicate their health condition by choosing from this answers; &quot;Full recovery&quot;, &quot;much better&quot;, &quot;somewhat better&quot;, &quot;no change&quot;, &quot;a little worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;.</description>

    <description>Patients with ankle osteoarthritis will be treated with a single injection of 5 cc of SVF (stromal vascular fraction), obtained from patient's abdominal adipose tissue and concentrated through OPTYFAT device. Infiltration of the ankle, occurs from the safest portal, that is, from the antero- medial, between the tibialis anterior and the saphenous vein and nerve at the level of the articular rima.</description>
