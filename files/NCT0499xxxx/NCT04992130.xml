  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport-related concussions and traumatic lower body injuries (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      (ACL) tears) occur frequently in high-speed and contact/collision sports contributing to&#xD;
      significant time loss from training/competition and potentially devastating long-term&#xD;
      performance and health consequences. Neurological impairment following a concussive injury&#xD;
      may be subtle, but if missed, may have grave consequences in a high-risk, high-speed sporting&#xD;
      context. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of lower body musculoskeletal injury is&#xD;
      significantly higher for athletes sustaining a sport-related concussion in the three-month to&#xD;
      two-year period following injury. Most injury prevention research to date has focused on&#xD;
      modifiable extrinsic risk factors; there is a void or gap on modifiable intrinsic risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. determine the effect of a standardized supplementary pre-season multi-modal neurologic&#xD;
           training program, versus usual training, on concussion and/or traumatic lower body&#xD;
           injury risk among high-speed/contact/collision sport athletes (primary prevention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. determine the effect of a standardized supplementary pre-season multi-modal neurologic&#xD;
           training program, versus usual training, on concussion and/or traumatic lower body&#xD;
           injury severity (time loss from training/competition measured in days, determined from&#xD;
           the date of injury to the date a sport medicine physician medically clears the athlete&#xD;
           to return to unrestricted training/competition) (secondary prevention).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. determine the effect of a standardized supplementary pre-season multi-modal neurologic&#xD;
           training program, versus usual training, on neurologic performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that athletes completing the standardized supplementary&#xD;
      pre-season multi-modal neurologic training program, compared with usual training, will&#xD;
      significantly reduce the participants risk and severity of concussion and/or traumatic lower&#xD;
      body injury, and significantly improve neurologic performance.&#xD;

      This study will measure multiple neurological systems and brain processes on 400 Canadian&#xD;
      high-performance snow sport athletes and elite community ice hockey players in the&#xD;
      participants healthy (uninjured) state using reliable assessment technology and techniques. A&#xD;
      two-month standardized, pre-season, supplementary multi-modal training program will be&#xD;
      prescribed to 200 athletes (intervention cohort) by a team of experienced sport science and&#xD;
      medicine professionals targeting the specific intrinsic risk factors of interest identified&#xD;
      in the current concussion and ACL prevention literature. The control cohort of 200 athletes&#xD;
      will carry out their usual pre-season training programs. At the completion of the two-month&#xD;
      training period, the standardized neurological outcome measures completed at baseline will be&#xD;
      repeated on all athletes.&#xD;
