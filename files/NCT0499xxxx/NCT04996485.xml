      This is an experimental non-randomized clinical study aimed at expanding the indications for&#xD;
      the use of biological drugs with the aim of using them for the pathogenetic therapy of&#xD;
      children with congenital ichthyosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 50 children aged 6 months to 18 years with a clinically and&#xD;
      genetically confirmed diagnosis of congenital ichthyosis. Patients will be divided into 4&#xD;
      groups who will receive symptomatic therapy (using active external agents, emollients and /&#xD;
      or systemic retinoids) or biologics targeting the cytokines IL-12 / IL-23, IL-4 / IL-13 and&#xD;
      IL -17A. Immunophenotyping of all patients will be performed, the cytokine profile and&#xD;
      spectrum of sensitization and the degree of NF-kB activation in lymphocytes will be&#xD;
      determined. In experimental group №3, 10 patients with Netherton syndrome will receive&#xD;
      dupilumab, in experimental group №2, 10 patients will receive ustekinumab, and in&#xD;
      experimental group №1 10 patients will receive secukinumab. Efficiency will be assessed using&#xD;
      the Ichthyosis Area Severity Index (IASI), determination of the level of TEWL, and the change&#xD;
      in quality of life will also be assessed using the Children's Dermatological Life Quality&#xD;
      Index (CDLQI) in comparison from baseline, than at 16 and 52 weeks. Throughout the study, the&#xD;
      safety profile (registration of the development of infectious diseases) will be assessed.&#xD;
