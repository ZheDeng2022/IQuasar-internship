      This is an open-label, randomized and controlled phase Ⅳ clinical trial of quadrivalent&#xD;
      influenza vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co. , the purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the immunogenicity and safety after 1 dose of quadrivalent influenza vaccine with&#xD;
      that of 2 doses in vaccine-unprimed children aged 3-8 years old,to compare the immunogenicity&#xD;
      and safety after 1 dose of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in vaccine-unprimed children aged&#xD;
      3-8 years old with that of 1 dose in vaccine-primed children and to compare the&#xD;
      immunogenicity and safety after 2 doses of quadrivalent influenza vaccine in vaccine-unprimed&#xD;
