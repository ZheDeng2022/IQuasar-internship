  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 1900 pregnant women in the 1st trimester (633 women living with HIV (WLHIV)&#xD;
      initiating Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy, 633 WLHIV&#xD;
      continuing DTG use from pre-pregnancy, and 634 women without HIV) and their children will be&#xD;
      enrolled and followed for two years. As part of this, mother-infant pairs will be required to&#xD;
      attend up to 10 study visits separate from routine clinic visits, these visits include 3&#xD;
      antenatal visits (less than or equal to 14, 24-28 and 32-36 weeks) and 7 postnatal visits (&lt;2&#xD;
      and 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). Measurements in mothers will include demographics&#xD;
      and health status, HIV disease and ART use, intercurrent medical history including&#xD;
      concomitant medication use, HIV viral load testing, ART adherence, HIV antibody testing in&#xD;
      women without HIV; body composition, caloric intake, dysglycemia and insulin resistance (IR),&#xD;
      lipid profiles, anthropometry, resting energy expenditure, hepatic steatosis, specimen&#xD;
      collection (whole blood, plasma, serum, placenta and breastmilk), systemic and adipose&#xD;
      inflammation, as well as metabolites, lipid subspecies and eicosanoids. Measurements in&#xD;
      infants will include uterine gestational age and fetal growth, as well as metabolites, lipid&#xD;
      subspecies and eicosanoids, body composition, dysglycemia and IR, lipid profiles,&#xD;
      anthropometry, feeding, specimen collection (cord blood, whole blood, plasma and serum) and&#xD;
      intercurrent medical history including concomitant medication use. Additional data on&#xD;
      maternal health in pregnancy and birth outcomes will be abstracted from medical records.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being scaled up as part of the&#xD;
      preferred 1st-line ART regimen. However, DTG has recently been implicated as an obesogen that&#xD;
      is associated with increased weight and adipose tissue gain compared to other antiretroviral&#xD;
      agents. Obesity in pregnancy is associated with poor health outcomes for both mother and&#xD;
      child as pregnancy is a critical period during which exposures leading to alterations in&#xD;
      metabolic health may influence not only long-term maternal health but also fetal, neonatal,&#xD;
      and ultimately child health. To address the gap of knowledge on the obesogenic effects of DTG&#xD;
      in pregnant women living with HIV (WLHIV) and their children, the central objective of this&#xD;
      proposal is to investigate the impact of DTG in pregnancy and its obesogenic effects on the&#xD;
      metabolic health of WLHIV and their children, compared to women without HIV and their&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

    <description>This study focuses on the impact of Dolutegravir (DTG)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) on metabolic health of women and children in pregnancy, delivery and beyond. In order to understand the potential adverse effects of DTG, pregnant women living with HIV- both those initialing DTG-based ART in pregnancy as well as those who were established on DTG-based ART prior to pregnancy, will be less than or equal to 14 weeks' gestation at enrollment to allow for detection of metabolic abnormalities as they begin to develop during the course of pregnancy.&#xD;
This is considered standard of care.</description>
