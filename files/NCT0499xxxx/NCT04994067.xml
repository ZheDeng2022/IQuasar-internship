  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry trial is designed to track the local control rates and side effects of IORT,&#xD;
      which will be implemented for women who are suitable PBI per the latest ASTRO guidelines.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be referred for radiation oncology consultation by the operating&#xD;
      surgeon. Patients will be presented with all radiation options and if they choose IORT, they&#xD;
      will be offered enrollment onto the registry trial and consented accordingly. The registry&#xD;
      will collect treatment data from the operation, radiation and pathology notes post IORT for&#xD;
      each patient enrolled. Sources of research material, i.e. resected breast tissue and lymph&#xD;
      nodes, will be obtained as part of routine clinical care. No additional tissue will be&#xD;
      collected from patients due to enrollment on this registry trial. No additional studies will&#xD;
      be performed outside of the routine standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post treatment, the registry will collect data based on the standard of care follow up&#xD;
      schedule. Follow-up visits will be scheduled 2-3 weeks post-operatively, as per standard of&#xD;
      care, to review the final pathology and for the initial toxicity assessment. Patients found&#xD;
      to have positive margins and/or lymph node involvement may require further surgery and/or&#xD;
      additional external beam radiation. Additional follow-up visits with radiation oncology will&#xD;
      be scheduled at 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years following IORT. Toxicity will be scored&#xD;
      using CTCAE v4.03. Local control will be evaluated using clinical exam and semi-annual to&#xD;
      annual mammograms. All such information will be tracked and recorded into the registry&#xD;
      database.&#xD;

        Patients enrolled on this study will be planned for lumpectomy with or without sentinel&#xD;
        node biopsy for early stage breast cancer. Patients will be evaluated by a radiation&#xD;
        oncologist who specializes in the treatment of breast cancer and will be deemed to be&#xD;
        eligible for IORT. Patients with a history of ipsilateral cancer and/or prior in-field&#xD;
        radiation are eligible, as IORT would likely be less toxic than repeat whole or partial&#xD;
        breast external beam radiation and can allow patients to avoid mastectomy who wish to do&#xD;
        so.&#xD;
