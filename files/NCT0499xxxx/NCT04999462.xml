    <textblock>
      The objectives of this trial are to assess the effects of adding 2 servings/d of either&#xD;
      full-fat or low-fat fermented dairy products to the diet, as a replacement for non-dairy&#xD;
      foods with macronutrient composition similar to the low-fat fermented dairy condition, on&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, erythrocyte fatty acid profile and other cardiometabolic health markers&#xD;
      in metabolically at-risk adults.&#xD;
