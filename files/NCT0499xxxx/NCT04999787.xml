    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. About 90&#xD;
      liver disease subjects with moderate or above pruritus are planned to be enrolled. They will&#xD;
      be randomized to two dose groups (0.3 μg/kg and 0.6 μg/kg) and a placebo control group at a&#xD;
      1:1:1 ratio, with about 30 subjects in each group.&#xD;
