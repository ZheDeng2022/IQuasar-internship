  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research project is to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy preloading (NRT-P) in HIV-positive&#xD;
      smokers, who are struggling with cigarette dependence, urge to smoke (craving) and low&#xD;
      self-efficacy as barriers to successful smoking cessation. Sixty participants will be&#xD;
      recruited into a 16-week randomized pilot study. Thirty participants (control condition) will&#xD;
      receive standard smoking cessation counseling (NRT-S) and will initiate an 8-week course of&#xD;
      combination nicotine patch and lozenge (or gum, based on preference) on quit date (week 4),&#xD;
      consistent with recommended guidelines based on smoking rate. Thirty participants (active&#xD;
      condition) will start NRT patch 3 weeks prior to quit date, followed by an 8-week course of&#xD;
      combination nicotine patch and lozenge (or gum, based on preference), initiated on quit date.&#xD;
      The investigators will examine dependence, urge to smoke and self-efficacy for quitting prior&#xD;
      to and following quit date. The investigators will also examine differences in quit attempts&#xD;
      and biochemically validated smoking abstinence between the control and active conditions at&#xD;
      weeks 8, 12, and 16.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is more prevalent in persons with HIV (PWH) in the U.S. when compared with&#xD;
      the general population and is linked to increased morbidity and mortality in this population.&#xD;
      Furthermore, HIV-positive smokers have increased rates of lung and other smoking-related&#xD;
      cancers. Smokers with HIV are a particularly challenging group, often reporting high severity&#xD;
      of nicotine dependence and low rates of self-efficacy for quitting, both factors related to&#xD;
      poor smoking cessation outcomes. Establishing more effective smoking cessation approaches for&#xD;
      smokers with HIV, particularly those that address low self-efficacy and severe dependence, is&#xD;
      a public health priority. The overall goal of this research project is to examine the&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy&#xD;
      preloading (NRT-P) in HIV-positive smokers, who are struggling with cigarette dependence,&#xD;
      urge to smoke (craving) and low self-efficacy as barriers to successful smoking cessation.&#xD;
      Sixty participants will be recruited into a 12-week randomized pilot study. Thirty&#xD;
      participants (control condition) will receive standard smoking cessation counseling (NRT-S)&#xD;
      and will initiate an 8-week course of combination nicotine patch and lozenge on quit date&#xD;
      (week 4), consistent with recommended guideline based on smoking rate. Thirty participants&#xD;
      (active condition) will start NRT patch 3 weeks prior to quit date, followed by an 8-week&#xD;
      course of combination nicotine patch and lozenge, initiated on quit date. Dependence, urge to&#xD;
      smoke and self-efficacy for quitting prior to and following quit date will be examined.&#xD;
      Differences in quit attempts and biochemically validated smoking abstinence between the&#xD;
      control and active conditions at weeks 8 and 12 will also be examined. This study will be the&#xD;
      first to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of a novel intervention using NRT&#xD;
      preloading to improve smoking cessation outcomes in PWH. Given the high prevalence of smoking&#xD;
      and the significant morbidity associated with it in PWH, the development of effective&#xD;
      strategies to reduce the risks related to smoking in this group is critical. If determined to&#xD;
      be effective, this intervention could be readily disseminated in HIV clinics. This study will&#xD;
      provide key information on the potential benefit of NRT preloading in a population that is&#xD;
      highly dependent on nicotine and highly vulnerable to smoking-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The proposed research will include data from 60 subjects being enrolled into a pilot randomized clinical trial where participants who smoke combustible cigarettes will be randomized to one of two conditions: the nicotine replacement therapy preloading condition (NRT-P), or the standard treatment condition (ST). The final dataset will include self-reported demographic and behavioral data from interviews with the subjects. The final dataset will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing. We will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
