  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter international single-arm observational study to demonstrate&#xD;
      that use of stent-assisted coiling with LVIS® Evo™ and HydroCoil® Embolic System (HES) in&#xD;
      intracranial aneurysm treatment is effective and safe when assessed at 1 year after the&#xD;
      procedure&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient treatment and follow-up will be performed as per standard of care. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the proportion of aneurysms with complete occlusion based on Raymond-Roy occlusion&#xD;
      classification (RROC) at 12 ± 6-months, as well as other effectiveness and safety endpoints&#xD;
      such as the occurence of stent stenosis or parent artery occlusion, the occurence of&#xD;
      retreatment and recanalization, the rate of major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death,&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with good functional clinical outcome, the occurence of SAH,&#xD;
      aneurysm rupture, procedural complications, serious adverse events...&#xD;
