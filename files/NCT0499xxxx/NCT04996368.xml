      Perioperative bleeding during cardiac surgery is associated with a higher incidence of&#xD;
      reoperation and blood transfusion leading to an increase in morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Coagulopathy is a major cause of excessive bleeding. It is associated with use of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass which activates the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway,&#xD;
      platelet dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response. Increase in duration of&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass correlates directly with increase bleeding during cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Antifibrinolytic agents like tranexamic acid has shown promising result in major surgeries&#xD;
      and in trauma patients. Current clinical practice guidelines recommended use of tranexamic&#xD;
      acid in cardiac surgery. There are wide variations in dose of tranexamic acid ranging from&#xD;
      10mg/Kg to 100mg/kg. The higher dose of this drug is associated with seizures and&#xD;
      thromboembolic events including stroke. The objective is to find out the minimal effective&#xD;
      dose of tranexamic acid in open-heart surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective comparative study among the patients undergoing open heart surgery in&#xD;
      Shahid Gangalal National Heart Center, Kathmandu Nepal. The inclusion criteria include&#xD;
      patients with age more than 18years, surgery with total cross clamp time more than 60 min.&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are the patients with allergy to tranexamic acid or any of the lysine&#xD;
      analogues, history of seizure, chronic homeostasis abnormality, on anticoagulants, severe&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease with creatinine clearance less than 30ml/hr, deranged liver function&#xD;
      test, total cross clamp time less than 60 min. The sample size was calculated to be 100&#xD;
      including 10% dropout cases. Patients will be randomized into two groups Group H (High dose&#xD;
      group) and Group L (Low dose group) with a sealed envelope technique. Low-dose TEA consists&#xD;
      of 10 mg/kg bolus administration before incision, followed by1 mg/kg/hr infusion; High-dose&#xD;
      TEA consists of a 30 mg/kg bolus followed by a 1mg/kg/hr infusion till the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Blood sampling and transfusion will be done as per protocol of Shahid Gangalal National Heart&#xD;
      Center. The primary study endpoint was the amount of blood loss during the first 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of overall blood transfusion and&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentration on the first postoperative day after surgery. All adverse effects of&#xD;
      the drug were noted and were treated as per hospital protocol. Data will be collected using&#xD;
      the data collection form (proforma). Collected data will be analyzed by means of spss version&#xD;
      20 for windows. The result will be presented as mean Â± SD. The continuous variable will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups by student t test and categorical variables with the&#xD;
      chi-square test. A minimum level of significance is maintained at the p-value of &lt;0.05.&#xD;

      Perioperative bleeding is a common complication during cardiac surgery. This is associated&#xD;
      with higher incidence of reoperation and blood transfusion increasing morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. [1,2] Coagulopathy is a major cause of excessive bleeding. It is associated with&#xD;
      use of cardiopulmonary bypass which activates the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation&#xD;
      pathway, platelet dysfunction and systemic inflammatory response. [3,4] Increase in duration&#xD;
      of cardiopulmonary bypass correlates directly with increase bleeding during cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Antifibrinolytic agents like tranexamic acid has shown promising result in major surgeries&#xD;
      and in trauma patients. Tranexamic acid blocks reversibly the lysine binding sites of&#xD;
      plasminogen. It prevents the activation of plasmin and thus stops lysis of polymerized&#xD;
      fibrin.[5] Current clinical practice guidelines recommended use of tranexamic acid in cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.[6] The significance for use of this drug is more for the cardiac surgery with higher&#xD;
      risk of bleeding like Aortic valve surgery, Coronary artery bypass grafting, redo surgeries&#xD;
      and surgery with prolong cardiopulmonary bypass time.[7] However, there is wide variation in&#xD;
      dose of tranexamic acid ranging from 10mg/Kg to 100mg/kg.[8] The tranexamic acid use is not&#xD;
      free from adverse events. The higher dose of this drug is associated with seizures and&#xD;
      thromboembolic events including stroke. [9,10] The objective of this study is to find out the&#xD;
      minimal effective dose of tranexamic acid in high-risk open-heart surgeries.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The doses of tranexamic acid used during cardiac surgery varies with the institutions that ranges from 10mg/kg to 100mg/kg. This study aims to compare two doses of tranexamic acid, one dose is a conventional dose ( 30mg/kg) and the other is low dose 10mg/kg. Effects of tranexamic acid regarding its effectiveness and side effects profile will be observed. Participants will be randomly selected into two groups ( low dose group and high dose group)</intervention_model_description>
