  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France currently has more than 10 million disabled people, including 3 millions who could be&#xD;
      better treated. In fact, people with disabilities face many obstacles in accessing care and&#xD;
      receiving appropriate support (physical access to certain locations, communication...).&#xD;
      Difficulties are also encountered by the healthcare staff, leading to often heterogeneous&#xD;
      practices in health establishments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INFRA health circuit has been set up at the &quot;Groupe Hospitalier Mutualiste de Grenoble&quot;&#xD;
      since June 2018 according to the guidelines published by the French High Authority for Health&#xD;
      (HAS) on improving professional practices &quot;Reception, support and organization of care in&#xD;
      health establishments for people in situation of handicap &quot;of July 2017. The INFRA nurse&#xD;
      collects and anticipates the necessary adaptations for the patient's stay, in conjunction&#xD;
      with their caregivers (whether family or institutional). They are an interface with other&#xD;
      healthcare professionals to adapt care procedures and protocols (body care, feeding methods,&#xD;
      pain management, drug management) to the patient's disability. Before hospitalization and&#xD;
      until the patient is discharged, the INFRA nurse transmits to the personnel involved all the&#xD;
      information necessary for the proper continuation of care. In addition to legal and&#xD;
      regulatory obligations, the INFRA nurse ensures the effective accessibility of the&#xD;
      establishment's facilities and premises, and helps maintaining patient autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The INFRA study is an observational study aimed at assessing the feasibility of the INFRA&#xD;
      health circuit and evaluating the benefit for the patients and the healthcare staff.&#xD;
