    <textblock>
      African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 to&#xD;
      an extent not observed in other racial/ethnic subgroups. People of color are uniquely&#xD;
      affected because keeping diabetes under control - the best defense against COVID-19 - has&#xD;
      become more difficult as the pandemic has disrupted medical care, exercise and healthy eating&#xD;
      routines which are already well-known challenges for the African American community. Diabetes&#xD;
      Self-Management Education and Support (DSMS/S) facilitates the knowledge, skills, and ability&#xD;
      necessary for diabetes self-care as well as activities that assist a person in implementing&#xD;
      and sustaining the behaviors needed to manage their condition on an ongoing basis. Now, given&#xD;
      the implications of COVID-19 on the AA/POC diabetes community, it is imperative to enhance&#xD;
      DSME/S with education about protection and prevention of COVID-19. To begin to solve this&#xD;
      problem we will adapt and implement the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; DSME/S program to provide&#xD;
      enhanced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) education with an additional emphasis on COVID-19&#xD;
      protection and prevention. This study will employ Community Based Participatory Research&#xD;
      methods and will be conducted virtually in the community setting. The proposed hypothesis,&#xD;
      based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is: African&#xD;
      Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) in Los Angeles County with type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM) randomized to participate in the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program (N=48) are more likely&#xD;
      to demonstrate sustained glycemic control, increase in knowledge and skills related&#xD;
      behaviors, and risk factors associated with T2DM and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and increased&#xD;
      compliance with prevention, and vaccination as compared to those who are randomized to usual&#xD;
      care (N=48) in this 12 week program. We propose a randomized control study design among 96&#xD;
      participants with 48 assigned to an intervention group and 48 assigned to a control group.&#xD;
      This study will also explore the experience of the participants' appraisal of knowledge and&#xD;
      skills acquisition for DSME/S to maintain T2DM control, reduce complications, and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) prevention and protection. The ultimate goal is to design prospective larger&#xD;
      behavioral studies (SuRe first or R21) with a multi-centered intervention with other RTRN&#xD;
      institutions to demonstrate the applicability of this approach specifically focusing on the&#xD;
      AA/POC community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with co-existing diabetes were more likely&#xD;
      to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more complications, and had higher&#xD;
      incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation, and&#xD;
      death. Another important finding is that African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) are&#xD;
      disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 to an extent not observed in other racial/ethnic&#xD;
      subgroups. Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMS/S) facilitates the knowledge,&#xD;
      skills, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care as well as activities that assist a&#xD;
      person in implementing and sustaining the behaviors needed to manage their condition on an&#xD;
      ongoing basis. Now, given the implications of COVID-19 on the AA/POC diabetes community, it&#xD;
      is imperative to enhance DSME/S with education about protection and prevention of COVID-19.&#xD;
      We will adapt and implement the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; DSME/S program to provide enhanced type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) education with an additional emphasis on COVID-19 protection and&#xD;
      prevention. The proposed hypothesis, based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of&#xD;
      Planned Behavior (TPB), is: African Americans (AA)/People of Color (POC) in Los Angeles&#xD;
      County with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) randomized to participate in the &quot;emPOWERed to&#xD;
      Change&quot; program (N=48) are more likely to demonstrate sustained glycemic control, increase in&#xD;
      knowledge and skills related behaviors, and risk factors associated with T2DM and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) and increased compliance with prevention, and vaccination as compared to those who&#xD;
      are randomized to usual care (N=48) in this 12 week program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: to determine the efficacy of the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program on the knowledge and&#xD;
      skills related to eating habits, physical activity, stress management, and medication&#xD;
      adherence in the AA/POC population with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: we hypothesized that AA/POC participants randomized to the program will have 20%&#xD;
      increased knowledge and skills related to eating habits, physical activity, stress&#xD;
      management, medication adherence, and control of diabetes compared to those randomized to the&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 to determine the effect of the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program on the knowledge related&#xD;
      to T2DM and COVID-19 (risk factors, prevention of infection, COVID-19 vaccines, and access&#xD;
      resources for vaccination) and compliance with prevention and vaccination against COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: we hypothesized that AA/POC participants randomized to the program will have 20%&#xD;
      increase in knowledge related to T2DM and COVID-19, compliance with prevention and&#xD;
      vaccination against COVID-19 compared to those randomized to the usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a randomized control study design among 96 participants with 48 assigned to an&#xD;
      intervention group and 48 assigned to a control group. This study will also explore the&#xD;
      experience of the participants' appraisal of knowledge and skills acquisition for DSME/S to&#xD;
      maintain T2DM control, reduce complications, and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) prevention and&#xD;
      protection. The ultimate goal is to design prospective larger behavioral studies (SuRe first&#xD;
      or R21) with a multi-centered intervention with other RTRN institutions to demonstrate the&#xD;
      applicability of this approach specifically focusing on the AA/POC community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity significantly increases the risk&#xD;
      for hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were&#xD;
      found to be more likely to develop severe or critical disease conditions with more&#xD;
      complications and had higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, and death (Zhang, et al., 2020). In light of these findings, the&#xD;
      potential that existing racial and ethnic disparities will be worsened and compounded by&#xD;
      COVID-19 because African Americans continue to suffer a disproportionate burden of chronic&#xD;
      diseases, with more pronounced disparities in type 2 diabetes, congestive heart failure, and&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health disparities among AAs has continued and have shown to be perpetuated by the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. California's death rate among African Americans is disproportionate as compared to&#xD;
      representation in the population (10% mortality versus 6% population) and even more&#xD;
      disproportionate in some counties. Specifically, the data from Los Angeles County showed a&#xD;
      14% mortality rate among African Americans, who make up 9% of the county's population (Azar,&#xD;
      et al., 2020). In the context of circumstances surrounding COVID-19, the California Health&#xD;
      Care Foundation identifies this pandemic as &quot;a perfect storm of irrefutable evidence that&#xD;
      people of color are caught in a web of social inequality.&quot; (Hernández, 2020) DSME/S is a&#xD;
      crucial element in helping patients navigate and incorporate successful care into their daily&#xD;
      lives. It has been proven to: instill lifestyle modifications which are directly associated&#xD;
      with improved blood sugar control, reduce risk of diabetes complications, fewer&#xD;
      hospitalizations, lower diabetes related medical cost and to be cost-effective. Some reports&#xD;
      show that less than 38% of patients diagnosed with diabetes actually receive DSME/S (Torres,&#xD;
      Tiwari, Movsas, Carrasquillo &amp; Zonszein, 2015). The proposed study and intervention seek to&#xD;
      consider and begin to mitigate these confounding issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the COVID-19 pandemic appears to be ending among some populations, research suggests that&#xD;
      AAs continue to be severely impacted. In communities that have higher percentages of AAs,&#xD;
      study findings indicate an association between negative COVID-19 health outcomes and AAs,&#xD;
      including higher prevalence and higher death rates. In addition, the data suggests that the&#xD;
      odds of surviving the epidemic may correlate to poverty levels, indicating that other at-risk&#xD;
      minority populations, affected by poverty, may also be disproportionately affected (Cyrus et&#xD;
      al., 2020). Snowden and Graaf (2021) report that there are greater African American&#xD;
      COVID-induced challenges and suffering, and COVID-19 threatens to perpetuate these&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is understood that policies are fundamental to shifting the trajectory of the&#xD;
      Diabetes epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that COVID-19 education enhanced&#xD;
      DSME/S interventions are promising. Moreover, we believe that by incorporating&#xD;
      community-based outreach, testing, and access to culturally competent educational&#xD;
      interventions within African American communities hold great promise for increased protection&#xD;
      and prevention against COVID-19 along with better T2DM outcomes. This will in turn have a&#xD;
      positive impact on some of the observed disparities. This research project can provide the&#xD;
      groundwork to further develop and implement DSME/S that is easily accessible and less&#xD;
      limiting than traditional DSME/S programs for this population, especially during a critical&#xD;
      inflection point in the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature suggests digital technology is the next link to enhanced communication between&#xD;
      providers and patients. Patients with diabetes often report a variety of barriers to&#xD;
      accessing DSME/S, especially issues with transportation and time commitments in attending&#xD;
      on-site DSME/S programs. This online T2DM education program provides an alternative for those&#xD;
      who are unable or unwilling to attend traditional DSME/S. While an online program does not&#xD;
      replace the need for traditional DSME/S or certified diabetes educators, having&#xD;
      online/on-demand availability does provide an additional resource for providers to offer for&#xD;
      educating patients with diabetes in self-management and COVID-19 prevention and protection&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program presents a unique, novel and timely approach to DSME/S with&#xD;
      the enhancement of COVID-19 education. The program leverages digital technology to better&#xD;
      support patients. It will be delivered virtually, on-demand, with culturally sensitive&#xD;
      content and utilize mHealth and social media which has shown to be increasingly useful given&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic while capitalizing on the current trends of preferred engagement via&#xD;
      technology for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;emPOWERed to change program&quot; also integrates support through the use of Social media.&#xD;
      This interaction provides an additional means for assisting patients with diabetes as it&#xD;
      increases access to care, provides tools for self-management, and fosters support from others&#xD;
      diagnosed with the same disease (Kenny, 2014). According to Power and Pitfalls of Social&#xD;
      Media in Diabetes Care, (McMahon, 2013) some individuals find extra value in interacting with&#xD;
      their peers online, as they may feel their provider lacks the ability to relate to them in&#xD;
      the way other patients with diabetes can. Providers report finding that when patients utilize&#xD;
      social media for support, they have become increasingly compliant with treatment&#xD;
      recommendations, and appear to sustain healthy lifestyle changes (Cooper &amp; Kar, 2014). These&#xD;
      lifestyle changes include healthy eating and engaging in physical activity more often when&#xD;
      these individuals have the support of their peers, and these peers, in many cases, are&#xD;
      available exclusively online (Cooper &amp; Kar, 2014). Also, engagement of individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes via social media has been shown to provide the foundation for patients modified&#xD;
      treatment regimens (McMahon, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While behavior modification plays an important role in controlling blood sugars, the use of&#xD;
      technology can support self-management techniques and behaviors helpful to patients&#xD;
      self-monitoring their blood glucose levels (Park, Burford, Nolan, &amp; Hanlen, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data from The Suga Project Foundation's DSME/S program, led by Natalie Pauls, PI,&#xD;
      has shown that the elements of the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program are effective at increasing&#xD;
      knowledge about type 2 diabetes, helping avoid risks of complication, improved communication&#xD;
      with healthcare providers and an overall increased sense of better well-being through stress&#xD;
      management and peer support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature reviews by Cotter, et al., (2014) and Gabarron, et al., (2018) suggests that&#xD;
      technology-enabled strategies provide a viable option for facilitating diabetes&#xD;
      self-management, however, future research is needed on the use of web-based interventions in&#xD;
      underserved communities, which is what this study will attempt to begin examining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design We propose a randomized, controlled study design among 134 participants. Through&#xD;
      a simple randomization methodology, half of participants will be randomized to an&#xD;
      intervention program and usual care group. The proposed hypothesis, based on the Health&#xD;
      Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), is: African Americans&#xD;
      (AA)/People of Color (POC) in Los Angeles County with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who&#xD;
      participate in the &quot;emPOWERed to Change&quot; program will demonstrate sustained glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (HbA1c&lt;7%) and increase in knowledge of the risk factors associated with T2DM and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      (COVID-19) and increased adherence to medication and compliance with prevention, and&#xD;
      vaccination as compared to those in the usual care group.&#xD;
