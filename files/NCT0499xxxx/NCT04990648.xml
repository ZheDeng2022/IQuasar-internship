    <textblock>
      The research was conducted as a randomized controlled experiment to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      Buzzy® on pain level during the measles-rubella-mumps (MMR) vaccine injection in 12-month-old&#xD;
      infants. This study was done with infants meeting the sampling criteria (buzzy group: 30,&#xD;
      control group: 30) on November 2018-May 2019 in Istanbul Bakirkoy 9 Family Health Center.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of Buzzy® application on pain, which is a combination of cold and&#xD;
      vibration, during measles-rubella-mumps (MMR) vaccine injection administration on&#xD;
      12-month-old infants. The study is a randomized contrlled experimental research. The research&#xD;
      sample is composed of 60 infants (buzzy:30, control:30) who are 12-month-old injected MMR&#xD;
      vaccine at Bakırköy No. 9 Family Health Center between November 2018-May 2019. As a data&#xD;
      collection tool Data Collection Form, FLACC Pain Scale and Buzzy® device have been used.&#xD;
      While Buzzy® was applied on infants in the trial group before, during and after the vaccine&#xD;
      injection, the infants in the control group were applied routine vaccine injection. The pain&#xD;
      response of the infants was evaluated by the nurse and the parent before, during and after&#xD;
      the vaccine injection and the physiological parameters were evaluated by the nurse before and&#xD;
      after the vaccine injection.&#xD;

    <description>Buzzy ® was placed on the left arm deltoid muscle site and kept there for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds, Buzzy ® was taken 1 cm up and MMR vaccine injection was administered to the left deltoid muscle site. After the vaccine injection, Buzzy ® was taken to the injection site and kept for another 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>Buzzy ® device (Buzzy ® Mini Healthcare) has been used to reduce pain by using local cold application and vibration effect. Buzzy ® was developed by Dr. Amy Baxter in 2009. The size of the Buzzy ® device measures 2⅞ꞌꞌ x 1⅞ꞌꞌ x ⅞ꞌꞌ (7,2 cm x 4,8 cm x 2,2 cm). It is a bee-shaped device made of hard plastic with a vibrating motor (2 settings - fixed and pulsed), powered by a 2AAA battery. There are 4 ice packages and elastic fastening strap. On the part where the device touches the skin, there is an ice package in the shape of a wing. When the button on the device is pressed, it vibrates.</description>
