  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-centre, randomized, 2-arm clinical trial comparing follow-up consisting of&#xD;
      tumour-specific Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePROs) with targeted symptom management&#xD;
      versus standard of care follow-up during adjuvant systemic therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention in this study will consist of a web-based portal that leverages the existing&#xD;
      data entry and reporting capacity of the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) platform&#xD;
      to prompt study participants to enter various health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and&#xD;
      symptom measures online at regular intervals throughout the course of the adjuvant systemic&#xD;
      therapy, and particularly in between scheduled clinic visits (per standard of care dependent&#xD;
      on chemotherapy protocol). Specifically, the portal will incorporate the following PROs: the&#xD;
      Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale revised version (ESASr), the European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire Cancer Patients (EORTC-QLQ&#xD;
      C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire Breast Cancer (EORTC-QLQ BR23), and the European Organization for Research and&#xD;
      Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Questionnaire Colorectal Cancer (EORTC-QLQ CR29), and&#xD;
      selected adverse event-related questions related to commonly prescribed adjuvant systemic&#xD;
      therapy regimens for breast and colorectal cancer. The portal will identify all study&#xD;
      participants who have entered scores 4 or greater on the ESASr scale and subsequently alert&#xD;
      the participant's research nurse to perform a review of the patient's records and initiate a&#xD;
      telephone assessment with the study participant. The study hypothesizes that patients&#xD;
      experiencing this level of symptom severity are currently accustomed to initiating contact&#xD;
      with the nurse; this is a reactive approach whereby the healthcare team does not respond&#xD;
      unless the patient initiates the contact. The investigators propose a more proactive approach&#xD;
      whereby the healthcare team initiates the contact as symptoms are reported. By addressing&#xD;
      symptoms as they occur, this will most likely reduce the resources (nursing time, etc.)&#xD;
      required to address symptoms as a point when they have become more severe or need acute&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants with mild symptoms (Less than 4 on ESASr), subjects will be prompted by the&#xD;
      online system to refer to standardized patient educational materials on self-management of&#xD;
      symptoms (provided as hyperlinks to online web-based standardized self-management&#xD;
      information. Hyperlinks to standardized educational materials with instructions on how to&#xD;
      manage common symptoms associated with chemotherapy treatment will also be provided to&#xD;
      participants on the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who are identified as having a high burden of symptoms (e.g., a score of 4&#xD;
      or greater on any one symptom), the research nurse will be able to pre-emptively offer&#xD;
      clinical advice by phone on appropriate symptom management, notify the responsible physician,&#xD;
      and provide interventions to alleviate these symptoms as per usual routine. If needed, the&#xD;
      research nurse and physician may offer the participant an unscheduled clinic visit to manage&#xD;
      symptom crises in person. Conversely, for participants with a very low symptom burden (e.g.,&#xD;
      all symptom scores less than 4) or no symptoms at all, the portal will offer these&#xD;
      individuals an opportunity to opt-out of the next scheduled face-to-face clinic visit within&#xD;
      24 hours prior to the scheduled clinic visit. Prior to the opt-out, the research nurse will&#xD;
      also perform a review of the patient's records, conduct a telephone assessment with the&#xD;
      participant to assess symptom levels, and notify the physician to confirm that cancelling the&#xD;
      in-person clinic visit is both safe and clinically reasonable to pursue. It will ultimately&#xD;
      be at the discretion of the treating oncologist whether or not participants feel comfortable&#xD;
      canceling this visit. Asymptomatic participants will retain the right to keep the scheduled&#xD;
      clinic appointment. All ePROs and their trends over time will be made available at each&#xD;
      clinic visit to the primary cancer nurse and oncologist(s) both electronically and on the&#xD;
      paper chart to further facilitate treatment decision-making and optimize symptom management.&#xD;

Although they will not be asked to complete PROs in between clinic visits, they will be asked to respond to a series of HRQOL questionnaires at baseline, at 6 months (±2 weeks) from enrollment, and at completion of adjuvant systemic therapy if this date differs from the 6-month time point by more than 4 weeks. A satisfaction questionnaire will also be administered at the end of study.</description>

In addition, however, they will also receive an email reminder at the mid-way point between scheduled clinic visits to prompt them to enter ePROs via the REDCap online system, including measures such as the ESASr, the EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORTC-BR23 or EORTC-CR29 and specific symptom questionnaires.</description>
