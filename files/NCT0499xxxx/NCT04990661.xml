  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled experimental study was to determine the effect of the&#xD;
      massage applied to hemodialysis patients with complaint of cramp on the cramp frequency,&#xD;
      cramp severity, and sleep quality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted with patients receiving treatment in a total of four hemodialysis&#xD;
      units. The sample of the study comprised a total of 36 patients (18 patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 18 patients in the control group) with complaint of cramp. In the&#xD;
      study, intradialytic massage for lower extremity was applied to the intervention group in&#xD;
      three sessions a week and a total of six sessions for two weeks. No intervention other than&#xD;
      routine care was applied to the control group patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the data were collected using a patient information form, cramp assessment&#xD;
      short survey, the &quot;Visual Analog Scale (VAS)&quot;, &quot;Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index&quot; (PUKİ), and&#xD;
      patient follow-up forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to conduct the study, the necessary Ethics Committee approval and institutional&#xD;
      permission were obtained. The individuals included in the study informed about the purpose of&#xD;
      the research, their verbal consent obtained and the participant's informed consent form&#xD;
      signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention and control groups were assigned according to the research criteria,&#xD;
      the days and sessions of the groups were determined and recorded in the digital randomization&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
