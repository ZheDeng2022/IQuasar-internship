  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEP) were proved to be useful during complicated&#xD;
      spinal surgeries to prevent iatrogenic complications. The effect of anesthetic agents was&#xD;
      comprehensively discussed in literature. The Investigators studied a new balanced anesthetic&#xD;
      protocol using propofol and sevoflurane in addition to continuous fentanyl infusion in which&#xD;
      they compared values and ratios of amplitudes and latencies of TcMEP waves at different time&#xD;
      point.&#xD;

      This is a prospective double- blind randomized controlled study. After approval by the ethics&#xD;
      committee at the National Cancer Institute (Cairo University) and El-Sahel Teaching Hospital&#xD;
      (GOHTI, Cairo) and after written informed consents,46 ASA I-II patients who are scheduled for&#xD;
      various spinal surgeries (such as: intra-spinal tumor resection, spondylolisthesis&#xD;
      correction, traumatic spinal fractures' fixation,…) will be included in this study. Surgeons&#xD;
      and neurophysiologists will be the same and will be blind to the anesthetic techniques in all&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization list will be generated then patients will be randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      control and study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, all patients will be checked for any exclusion criteria and the routine&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation will be done. On arriving operative theater, all patients will&#xD;
      receive 0.1 mg/kg midazolam IV. After connecting all the basic monitors' cables (NIBP, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry and ECG) and canulating the radial artery to monitor IBP, induction of anesthesia&#xD;
      will be done to all patients with 4μg/kg fentanyl, 2-3mg/kg propofol IV and 0.5mg/kg&#xD;
      atracurium to facilitate endotracheal intubation. After intubation, central venous catheter(&#xD;
      CVP), temperature probe through nasopharynx and urinary catheter will be inserted. Fentanyl&#xD;
      infusion will be maintained in a rate of 2μg/kg/hour and will be discontinued 60 minutes&#xD;
      before recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this time on, patients will be randomly allocated into control and study groups, each&#xD;
      group is 30 patients; control group is the propofol (P) group and the study group is the&#xD;
      balanced anesthesia (BA) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: propofol will be infused continuously in a rate of 75-100 μg/kg/min Study&#xD;
      Group: propofol infusion in a rate of 25μg/kg/min will be given with sevoflurane. Sevoflurane&#xD;
      concentration will be individually calculated by age-adjusted end - tidal MAC as follows: for&#xD;
      age of 18-25 years, 26-40 years and ≥40 years MAC will be 2.6%, 2.2% and 1.8% respectively&#xD;
      then final concentration to be delivered will be 0.2% lower than calculated half MAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be mechanically ventilated with O2/Air mixture (FiO2 50%) in a rate of&#xD;
      10-12/minute and tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg to insure oxygen saturation (SpO2) around 99% and&#xD;
      end-tidal CO2 between 28-35 mmHg. Body temperature must be kept between 35-37oC( Celsius&#xD;
      degrees) using warm fluids and warming blankets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative fluids will be given guided by central venous pressure (CVP)and urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotension ( mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) ˂60 mmHg in normotensive patients or ˂70&#xD;
      mmHg in hypertensive patients) will be treated with Norepinephrine (Levophed®) in an infusion&#xD;
      of 0.05-1.0μg /kg/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TcMEP Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction, transcranial stimulation electrode will be connected at C1- C2, Cz and C3-C4&#xD;
      (10-10 international system) and subdermal needles inserted in the appropriate muscles,&#xD;
      according to the scenario selected, processing will be done using NIM-SPINE™ SYSTEM (2005&#xD;
      Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc.). The stimulation used is a train-of-five square wave&#xD;
      stimulation, 2ms inter-stimulus interval, 500 μs width and 40-220 mA intensity which can be&#xD;
      increased with 10 mA steps till muscle answer potential is recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first TcMEP (R1) will be taken before positioning and surgical incision, at least 20-25&#xD;
      minutes after induction; fading of the neuromuscular blockade will be checked by&#xD;
      train-of-four (TOF) and double- burst stimulation using peripheral nerve stimulator connected&#xD;
      to the ulnar nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second reading (R2), which is the surgical baseline reading, will be taken 20 minutes&#xD;
      later; during which positioning of the patient is done; again muscle relaxant fading is&#xD;
      confirmed before the reading as above. A third reading (R3) will be taken after the surgical&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With every TcMEP reading, MAP, pulse rate, Oximetry, En-tidal CO2, nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      temperature, ulnar train-of-four response, sevoflurane percentage concentration / propofol&#xD;
      infusion rate and CVP will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between R1 and R2 will be dedicated to the effect of anesthetic regimen, while&#xD;
      subsequent readings will indicate both the effect of anesthetic regimen and any surgical&#xD;
      insult (if any).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decrease in every wave amplitude by more than 50% in relation to R1 and increase in latency&#xD;
      more than 2 ms will be recorded as an alarming criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recovery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After fulfilling the Modified Aldrete Recovery Score, patients will be discharged from&#xD;
      postoperative recovery unit (PACU) to the intermediate care unit. All patients with an&#xD;
      alarming criterion will be checked by neurosurgeon for any motor deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of balanced anesthesia using low dose&#xD;
      propofol and less than half MAC sevoflurane versus propofol based anesthesia while using&#xD;
      medium-dose fentanyl in both techniques on TcMEP intraoperative monitoring during spine&#xD;
      surgeries. Based on the previous paper published by Palazon et al., 2015, the difference in&#xD;
      latency between the 2 groups was 3 with an average variability of 3. A total sample size of&#xD;
      46 (23 per group) will be sufficient to detect that effect size, with power 90% and 5%&#xD;
      significance level the sample size was calculated by the G power program.&#xD;
