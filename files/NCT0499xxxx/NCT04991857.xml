  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by inefficient myocardial&#xD;
      pumping with signs of pulmonary and systemic congestion. Its progressively deteriorating&#xD;
      trajectory punctuated by episodes of acute disease decompensation, not only compromises&#xD;
      patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL), but also causes a hospitalization epidemic.&#xD;
      Indeed, this clinical cohort is characterized by exceptionally high readmission rate of 25%&#xD;
      and 50% within 4 weeks and 6 months, respectively, with ineffective self-care being as the&#xD;
      most prominent modifiable risk factor. Effective transitional care is crucial to enhance the&#xD;
      patient outcomes and control the economic impact. However, the concerned service in Hong Kong&#xD;
      is rather under-developed due to the human resource burden and inadequate integration of the&#xD;
      primary and tertiary healthcare systems. In fact, family support is of utmost important to&#xD;
      support the HF patients in the post-discharge period. Together with the advance in E-health&#xD;
      intervention, this study aims to evaluate the effects and cost-effectiveness of a&#xD;
      technology-based family-centered empowerment program (T-FAME) to enhance the self-care and&#xD;
      post-discharge outcomes of this clinical cohort.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the technology-based family-centered&#xD;
      empowerment program for heart failure (T-FAME-HF) on hospital readmission, mortality,&#xD;
      event-free survival, HF-related self-care, family functioning and HRQL among patients&#xD;
      admitted with HF. The study targets to recruit 270 participants in local hospitals in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T-FAME-HF is a 16-week program adopts a hybrid approach to combine nurse-led home visits,&#xD;
      an Apps, tele-care and optimized family support to enhance the post-discharge disease&#xD;
      management, disease monitoring, and patients' access to the nurse, and telephone visits. The&#xD;
      Program includes 3 four-week phases (1st - 4th; 5th - 8th; 9th - 12th week), which followed&#xD;
      by 2 bi-weekly telephone visits. Each phase is designated with a specified goal of care to&#xD;
      guide the disease management activities. Commenced with the home visit by the team nurse for&#xD;
      each phase, patients' condition and self-care will be assessed. A goal-setting approach will&#xD;
      be used to enhance disease monitoring, symptom recognition and response, and treatment&#xD;
      compliance. The T-FAME Apps supports the prescribed actions for goal attainment by&#xD;
      facilitating: i) BP and symptom monitoring with provision of corresponding health advice, ii)&#xD;
      nurses' disease monitoring, iii) video-based training on knowledge and skills, iv) easy&#xD;
      access to nurse through real-time chatroom, and v) weather and air quality alert. A blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor device will be provided to support the health monitoring. After the 3rd&#xD;
      phase, the nurse will monitor goal-attainment via tele-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who assigned into the control group will receive a HF education program, the&#xD;
      care dyad will receive a 16-week HF education program that comprises a home visit by another&#xD;
      team nurse, five bi-weekly online training on self-care through videos on Whatapps/ WeChat&#xD;
      with two subsequent telephone follow-up.&#xD;

    <masking_description>It is a single-blind study. A research assistant (RA1) will identify eligible patients (participants) by record review, invite their participation and obtain their informed consent. After recruiting the participants, simple randomization will be conducted using a computer-generated sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio to allocate the subjects to receive either the T-FAME-HF or HF education program. Single blinding is maintained by using the another research assistant (RA2), who has no information about group assignment, to collect the post-test self-reported data on outcome variables (i.e. self-care, HRQL and family functioning) via telephone interview.</masking_description>
