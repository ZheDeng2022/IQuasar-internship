  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present protocol is to evaluate the effectiveness of real HBMT&#xD;
      versus placebo on reducing HAB and aggression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the present protocol are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the role of individual difference variables on HAB, interpersonal&#xD;
           aggression, and effects of HBMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect vocal recording data to inform the development of algorithms to predict&#xD;
           emotional stress from changes in speech.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aggression refers to causing harm to someone who is motivated to avoid that harm (Anderson &amp;&#xD;
      Bushman, 2002). Many Soldiers report heightened levels of anger and display elevated rates of&#xD;
      aggressive behavior following combat deployments (Adler et al., 2011; Jakupcak et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Novaco &amp; Chemtob, 2015; Orth &amp; Wieland, 2006; Thomas et al., 2010). Treating and addressing&#xD;
      anger and aggression in combat Veterans can improve Soldier health as well as promote force&#xD;
      readiness and lethality. One key predictor of anger and aggression when responding to the&#xD;
      actions of other people is the extent to which the victim believes that the provocateur acted&#xD;
      in an intentionally hostile manner (e.g., being shoved on purpose) versus not intending to be&#xD;
      hostile (e.g., being shoved by mistake; De Castro, Veerman, Koops, Bosch, &amp; Monshouwer,&#xD;
      2002). This is called &quot;hostile attributional bias&quot; (HAB). Interpretation and attribution&#xD;
      biases toward perceiving threats and danger are elevated in individuals with posttraumatic&#xD;
      stress symptoms (Bonyea, Johnson, and Lang, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators test the effectiveness of a computer-based training&#xD;
      called Hostile Bias Modification Training (HBMT) to reduce HAB and aggressive behavior in&#xD;
      response to an ambiguous provocation (ambiguously hostile comments). Volunteers will complete&#xD;
      a real or placebo version of a computer training designed to reduce HAB, then receive and&#xD;
      react to either unambiguously hostile or ambiguously hostile feedback. The feedback is in&#xD;
      regards to an essay the volunteer was asked to write as part of the study. The investigators&#xD;
      predict that receiving the real (vs. placebo) computer training will reduce HAB in response&#xD;
      to the ambiguous feedback, but not the unambiguous feedback. Volunteers will then partake in&#xD;
      a second computer task, which involves a reaction time competition against the same&#xD;
      confederate where the loser receives a penalty in the form of a short, unpleasant, acoustic&#xD;
      tone delivered via headphones. The volunteer is told they can set the volume and duration of&#xD;
      unpleasant acoustic tones that would be administered to the confederate. Aggression is&#xD;
      operationalized as setting higher volumes and/or longer durations for tones. This will allow&#xD;
      us to measure how aggressive volunteers are in response to ambiguous provocations and&#xD;
      determine if the computer training is effective in reducing aggression to ambiguous&#xD;
      provocations and if reduced HAB is the underlying mechanism of this effect. Finally,&#xD;
      volunteers will complete a set of personality measures so we can determine if the effects of&#xD;
      the computer training are contingent on individual differences. If successful, this research&#xD;
      would add validity to a potential intervention to help people suffering from anger and&#xD;
      aggression management issues to reduce their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are also using this experiment as an opportunity to collect vocal pattern&#xD;
      data to inform the development of algorithms to predict emotional stress from changes in&#xD;
      vocal patterns. As such, voice recordings of volunteers reading standardized scripts will be&#xD;
      made at three points in the study.&#xD;
