      the purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the rate and routes of excretion of BIA 5-1058 and the mass balance in&#xD;
           urine, feces and exhaled air, after a single oral dose of 400 mg 14C labeled BIA 5 1058&#xD;
           containing 3.7 Megabecquerel (MBq) of radiocarbon;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of total radioactivity (TRA) in plasma and whole&#xD;
           blood and to assess the blood-to-plasma ratio;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to determine the PK of BIA 5-1058 and its metabolites in plasma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, single-center, open-label, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and&#xD;
      excretion study in 8 healthy adult male subjects. Subjects received a single oral dose of 400&#xD;
      mg BIA 5-1058, containing approximately 3.7 MBq (0.08 milliSievert [mSv]) of 14C-BIA 5-1058&#xD;
      as oral capsules. Screening was between Day -21 and Day -2 and confinement period was of one&#xD;
      period in the clinic involving drug administration on Day 1, with admission on Day 1 and&#xD;
      discharge on Day 15 (336 hours post-dose).&#xD;
