      Telemedicine (Virtual Clinic) Effectively Delivers the Required Health-care Service to&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Children often get sick, either from congenital or acquired lesions. The Covid-19 associated&#xD;
      regulatory precautions had made the process of seeking medical advice getting more difficult&#xD;
      and much challenging. In this article, we aim to present our experience in utilization of&#xD;
      telemedicine, specifically the virtual clinic via video consultation, in sorting and guiding&#xD;
      the pediatric surgical patients, evaluate the effectiveness, and document its results in&#xD;
      giving a convenient solution for this heavily distressing problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study addressed the utilization of telemedicine, specifically the virtual&#xD;
      clinic via video consultation in the field of pediatric surgery in the current era of&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic. Data recorded for analysis included demographic data, condition&#xD;
      distribution (system/body region affected), conversation duration, ultimate fate of the&#xD;
      consultations. Service was evaluated by on-line patient questionnaire ranging from 1 to 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study was carried out at 3 pediatric surgery tertiary centers (Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz&#xD;
      Hospital in Riyadh, Alyamamah Obstetric &amp; Children's hospital in Riyadh, and Al-Azhar&#xD;
      University hospitals in Cairo) on pediatric surgical patients, in the period from June 2020&#xD;
      to July 2021, in comparison to the statistics of the period from June 2019 till June 2020.&#xD;
      All patients' guardians enrolled in the study had electronically signed a written informed&#xD;
      consent before commencement of a video consultation. The study was approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board and ethics committee (Registration number: H7D4-2020-0051E). The&#xD;
      main objective was to assess the efficacy utilization of telemedicine (mainly virtual clinic&#xD;
      via video consultation) in sorting and correct guiding of children with surgical issues.&#xD;
      Primary outcome measurements included attendance rate, cancellation rate, re-admission rate,&#xD;
      and parent/patients' satisfaction. Secondary outcome measurements included time interval from&#xD;
      appointment request till the actual encounter, encounter duration, and fate of the video&#xD;
      conversations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are requested to register in the MOH registry (including ID and phone numbers,&#xD;
      address, &amp; e-mail), and are given instructions on how to use the certified applications to&#xD;
      organize their access to the service via approved applications at any time. Also, on-call&#xD;
      pediatric surgery specialists were ready all the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine (virtual clinic via video consultation), between a well-trained expert pediatric&#xD;
      surgeon and a motivated child's caregiver, effectively bridges the gap caused by the&#xD;
      regulatory precautions mandated by the current Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM&#xD;
      Corp. Data will be presented as mean, standard deviation, number &amp; percentage, using&#xD;
      Chi-squared test (X2) for qualitative data. The significance level will be set at P &gt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Discussion will focus on demonstrating and achieving the main objective that was to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy utilization of telemedicine (mainly virtual clinic via video consultation) in&#xD;
      sorting and correct guiding of children with surgical issues. Points of discussion will&#xD;
      include attendance rate, cancellation rate, re-admission rate, and parent/patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction, fate of the video conversations.&#xD;
