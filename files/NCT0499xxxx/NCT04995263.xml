  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized adult patients suffer from sleep deprivation, which has been associated with&#xD;
      multiple negative consequences, both in short and in the long term. Many factors have been&#xD;
      attributed to poor sleep quality, including excessive noise, inappropriate lighting,&#xD;
      interactions with the healthcare team, administration of drugs, patients' symptoms, among&#xD;
      others. There is scarce evidence reporting multicomponent interventions aimed at ensuring and&#xD;
      improving sleep quality in hospitalized patients. The following before-after, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will evaluate and determine the feasibility, acceptability and effectivity&#xD;
      of a multicomponent intervention in improving sleep quality and reducing the consequences of&#xD;
      poor sleep in a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU). The intervention is comprised of&#xD;
      changes in health personnel habits, improvements in the PICU environment, patient's&#xD;
      psychoeducation and continuous sleep and activity monitoring through a validated wearable&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

    <description>The nursery staff will be instructed to promote sleep hygiene. Nurse technicians will: inform patients of the efforts to ensure a healthy sleep environment, verify the minimization of light and noise after 23:00 PM, favour natural light after 07:00 AM, and foment patient's activities and participation in group therapy. Nurses will: reduce sleep interruptions to a minimum, to only perform actions (i.e. blood testing, clinical controls, medicine administration) deemed strictly necessary between 23:00 PM and 07:00 AM. A list of commonly used medications with their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties tailored by a pharmaceutical chemist will be provided, to ensure optimal medication administration while protecting the guaranteed sleep hours, to be coordinated with the treating physician.</description>
