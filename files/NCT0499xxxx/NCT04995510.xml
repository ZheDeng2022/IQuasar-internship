    <textblock>
      In the literature, studies evaluating respiratory muscle function, diaphragm thickness and&#xD;
      health-related physical fitness parameters together are insufficient in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the thesis study, it is thought that the&#xD;
      respiratory muscle function, diaphragm thickness, health-related physical fitness parameters,&#xD;
      physical activity and lung functions of individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease can be evaluated together to contribute to the literature. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate diaphragm thickness, respiratory muscle strength, endurance, body composition,&#xD;
      aerobic exercise capacity, upper and lower extremity muscle strength and endurance, grip&#xD;
      strength, flexibility in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and compare&#xD;
      them with the healthy group.&#xD;

      Breathing is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases with inspiration (breathing in)&#xD;
      and expiration (breathing) in order to maintain the optimum oxygen level in arterial blood.&#xD;
      Respiration takes place through respiratory muscles. While inspiration takes place through&#xD;
      the diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscles; Expiration takes place passively.&#xD;
      Respiratory muscle function is determined by evaluating respiratory muscle strength and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle endurance together. respiratory muscle dysfunction; It is a decrease in&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, endurance, or both, caused by factors such as elongated&#xD;
      diaphragm fibers, increased respiratory workload, changes in muscle mass and abdominal&#xD;
      weight. Today, respiratory muscle strength are widely used in the evaluation of respiratory&#xD;
      muscle function. However, evaluation of respiratory muscle endurance is more effective than&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength in the evaluation of submaximal respiratory muscle contraction,&#xD;
      which is valid for daily activities, and in the clinical, functional and prognostic&#xD;
      evaluation of respiratory muscles. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory&#xD;
      muscle function is associated with pulmonary functions, symptoms, comorbidities, health&#xD;
      status, airway obstruction, lung volumes, and physiological disorders. Respiratory muscle&#xD;
      dysfunction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increases with disease progression.&#xD;
      Dysfunction in the diaphragm, which is the most important respiratory muscle, can be&#xD;
      evaluated with respiratory muscle strength and endurance, as well as diaphragm thickness.&#xD;
      Diaphragm thickness provides information about disease progression in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is known that diaphragm thickness is associated&#xD;
      with respiratory muscle strength and respiratory function parameters in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization defines health as &quot;a state of complete physical, social and&#xD;
      mental well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity&quot;. One of the important&#xD;
      factors for maintaining health is physical fitness. physical fitness; It is the ability to&#xD;
      perform occupational, recreational and daily activities correctly and successfully without&#xD;
      fatigue. Physical fitness is also known as the ability to do daily tasks vigorously and&#xD;
      carefully, without excessive fatigue, and to allocate sufficient energy for leisure and&#xD;
      unexpected emergencies. Physical fitness is divided into two as health-related physical&#xD;
      fitness and sports-related physical fitness. While health-related physical fitness parameters&#xD;
      are body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and endurance,&#xD;
      flexibility; Sport-related physical fitness parameters are balance, coordination, reaction&#xD;
      time, agility, speed and power. Decreased physical fitness in individuals with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with respiratory problems (such as airway&#xD;
      obstruction). It is known that physical fitness is related to the ability to perform physical&#xD;
      activity. Low physical fitness occurs in most individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease due to decreased physical activity. There is an important relationship between&#xD;
      physical fitness and lung functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, studies evaluating respiratory muscle function, diaphragm thickness and&#xD;
      health-related physical fitness parameters together are insufficient in individuals with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In the thesis study, which is planned to be done, it&#xD;
      is thought that the respiratory muscle function, diaphragm thickness, health-related physical&#xD;
      fitness parameters, physical activity and lung functions of individuals with chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease can be evaluated together to contribute to the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate diaphragm thickness, respiratory muscle strength,&#xD;
      endurance, body composition, aerobic exercise capacity, upper and lower extremity muscle&#xD;
      strength and endurance, grip strength, flexibility in individuals with chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease and compare them with the healthy group.&#xD;
