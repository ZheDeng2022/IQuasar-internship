  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to examine the effects of a public health nursing intervention plus m-Health&#xD;
      applications for hypertension management on enhancing the Self-care, systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure, and quality of life in older adults during the lockdown period in Jordan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no differences between the three groups in:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01 HTN self-care (SC-HI) score. H02 Health-related quality of life (SF-36) score. H03 The&#xD;
      management of systolic and diastolic BP levels.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has affected all health aspects and aggravated chronic diseases health&#xD;
      disparities because it is more common among vulnerable populations such as seniors 1.&#xD;
      Hypertension (HTN) is a long-term chronic disease, affects more than 1 billion people around&#xD;
      the world 2. In Jordan, one-third of Jordanian adults are hypertensive 3, one study expected&#xD;
      that the prevalence of hypertension in 2013 may increase 7.2% by 2030 4, the HTN deaths rate&#xD;
      touched 5% of total deaths, ranks Jordan number 7 in the world, and ranks the HTN at number 6&#xD;
      of leading causes of death, after coronary heart disease and stroke, the first and second&#xD;
      leading causes of death in Jordan 5. If high blood pressure is uncontrolled, HTN is the main&#xD;
      contributor to heart failure, cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney disease, and death 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent with COVID-19, care is compromised in the context of lockdown and social&#xD;
      distancing. Patients with chronic illness at his time have the risk that they are not&#xD;
      obtaining the necessary hospital care, and alternative solutions are required, such as&#xD;
      improving patient's self-care of his or her chronic disease 6. Since the hospitals are&#xD;
      occupied with COVID-19 cases, the elderly have a perceived threat of COVID-19 and have begun&#xD;
      avoiding or delaying health care follow-up 1. It is essential that the investigators find&#xD;
      innovative solutions and sustainable methods for patients with HTN to control the blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP), enhance self-care, and protect them from COVID-19, and ultimately improve&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engaging the patient in self-care makes him/her an active participant in the management of&#xD;
      illness 7. Researchers worked to provide patients with the essential knowledge, skills and&#xD;
      abilities to follow treatment recommendations and tolerate blood pressure control 8,9.&#xD;
      Although they agreed that the best ways to prevent and manage high BP are through reasonable&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, i.e., weight loss, low salt diet, stop smoking, limited alcohol, stress&#xD;
      management, exercise, and medication 8, this makes the managing of high BP neither more&#xD;
      difficult, nor easier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to support healthy behaviors, the big electronic revolution provides a good&#xD;
      opportunity to involve patients suffering from HTN in the health care process and self-care&#xD;
      engagement in a safe space 10,11. Moreover, in order to adapt to disruptions during COVID-19,&#xD;
      telehealth, mobile health (m-health), and other technologies which support the self-care&#xD;
      process and facilitate access to care are appropriate approaches to protect vulnerable&#xD;
      populations who are living with chronic diseases 1,12,13. However, improving the self-care of&#xD;
      HTN using m-health is not a new approach; it has been studied previously by researchers from&#xD;
      different disciplines such as technical medicine, family medicine, and pharmacy 14-19, with&#xD;
      less attention given to the nursing role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In literature, especially nursing literature, there is a lack of sufficient scientific&#xD;
      research on the effectiveness of m-Health, guided by nurse's intervention, on self-care of&#xD;
      HTN, particularly among older adults12,13. Recently, one study provided a nurse-led program&#xD;
      as an example of an effective method to HTN management among older adults 20. The&#xD;
      consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (isolation, social distancing, quarantine) show major&#xD;
      challenges in provision of care for older adults with chronic illness 1,6. The m-Health&#xD;
      offers a great chance for providing care during the lockdown period, which can be applied via&#xD;
      mobile apps 21. Thus, examining m-Health Apps guided by public health nursing (PHN)&#xD;
      interventions for the management of HTN in older adults during the pandemic can provide&#xD;
      important empirical evidence of effectiveness of such new innovative self-care of HTN&#xD;
      interventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to examine three patients outcomes; self-care of HTN,&#xD;
      change of systolic and diastolic of BP, and quality of life in three groups of older adult&#xD;
      patients with HTN: the interventional group (4-free Apps + PHN interventions + education),&#xD;
      control groups 1 (4-free Apps + education), and control group 2 (education) during the&#xD;
      imposition of lockdown in Jordan as a result of COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

    <description>Self-care of HTN was measured by the SC-HI scale, which developed to measure the self-care in patients with HTN 26. SC-HI has the ability of evaluate the effectiveness of such self-care interventions. SC-HI is 23-item in three subscales: measuring self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management, Cronbach's α were 0.83, 0.75, and 0.83 for the three subscales. For the purpose of this study, authors cross-culturally translated the scale into Arabic in a previous study; Cronbach's α were 0.82, 0.61, and 0.86 for the three subscales 27. . Each subscale is scored distinctly and identical from 0 to 100, the final score calculated as: (the participant score - minimum) / (maximum - minimum) * 100. The separate score 70 or greater is indicated better self-care.</description>

    <description>Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured and recorded by a clinic nurse who has 9 years' experience in the cardiac clinic two times for the purpose of study's analysis; at baseline and after 3 months following the same assessment process: Patients in setting position with their arms at the chest line, relaxed for 5 minutes, then measuring the BP of the right arm using an electronic sphygmomanometer which was checked for calibrated regularly. BP readings through the 3 months were measured by patients themselves at home.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (SF-36) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>basic and after 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life (QOL) of hypertensive patients was measured using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). SF-36 questionnaire has been used as health indicator to screen the health status of persons and evaluate the health interventions 28. The questionnaire has the feasibility to be administered as a self-report, personal interview or by telephone, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete. SD-36 included 8 subscales: physical functioning (PF), bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems (RF), role limitations due to personal or emotional problems (RE), emotional well-being (EW), social functioning (SF), energy/fatigue (EF), and general health perceptions 28. SF-36 was frequently used to measure QOL in older adults with hypertension; the Arabic version was used in studies with Cronbach's α ≥ 0.70 29,30.</description>
