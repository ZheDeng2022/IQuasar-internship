    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known to cause urinary disorders, sexual and bowel dysfunction.&#xD;
      Urinary symptoms due to MS are well known and profit of multiple questionnaire or tool&#xD;
      developed in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of bowel disorders in MS is difficult to assess. Some studies up to 70% bowel&#xD;
      disorders in MS patients. Constipation and fecal incontinence are the two main symptoms in&#xD;
      neurogenic bowel dysfunction and frequently coexist in this population, generally in&#xD;
      association with urinary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high prevalence of bowel disorders their and the major impact on the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with Multiple sclerosis (PwMS) , and the cross-talk bladder-rectum&#xD;
      (persistence of anorectal dysfunction leading to poor neurogenic bladder control) assessment&#xD;
      of bowel disorders in MS is necessary. But this evaluation is difficult as no specific score&#xD;
      exist. The neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction score (NBD) is often used. The NBD was developed and&#xD;
      validated for spinal cord injury (SCI) population but not for PwMS MS. Yet NBD is often used&#xD;
      in research for all neurologic patients despite its lack of sensibility in various neurogenic&#xD;
      population other than spinal cord injury patient. As recommended in a Cochrane revue in 2014,&#xD;
      there is a need of a specific evaluation for bowel symptoms in neurogenic population,&#xD;
      especially for PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to create and validate a new multidimensional questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess bowel dysfunction and impact on quality of life in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a prospective multicenter study (8 centers) between June 2019 to&#xD;
      April 2021. This study was developed in 3 steps. First step was literature review and&#xD;
      qualitative interview. Then the second step was the feasibility study to evaluate&#xD;
      comprehension, acceptability of the different items. The last part of the study was the&#xD;
      validation study of the questionnaire. This part of the study was performed between June2020&#xD;
      and April 2021. Validation study allowed to determine the psychometric properties of the new&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged over 18 years with multiple sclerosis diagnosed on the 2017 revised McDonald's&#xD;
      criteria were included. Patients not able to read or understand the objectives and procedures&#xD;
      for conducting the protocol and patient who had a recent relapse of MS were excluded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune autoimmune central nervous system (CNS) disorder&#xD;
      characterized by demyelinisation and central neurologic damage. MS is the first cause of&#xD;
      disability in young adults and affects 2.8 million people in the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is known to cause urinary disorders, sexual and bowel dysfunction.&#xD;
      Urinary symptoms due to MS are well known and profit of multiple questionnaire or tool&#xD;
      developed in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of bowel disorders in MS is difficult to assess. Some studies up to 70% bowel&#xD;
      disorders in MS patients. Constipation and fecal incontinence are the two main symptoms in&#xD;
      neurogenic bowel dysfunction and frequently coexist in this population, generally in&#xD;
      association with urinary disorders. Chronic constipation and fecal incontinence were defined&#xD;
      by Rome IV criteria. According to these criteria, constipation is a bowel disorder in which&#xD;
      symptoms of difficult, infrequent, or incomplete defecation predominate for at least 3 months&#xD;
      and fecal incontinence is defined as the recurrent uncontrolled passage of fecal material for&#xD;
      at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, neurogenic bowel dysfunction has a real impact on quality of life and can cause&#xD;
      social isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high prevalence of bowel disorders their and the major impact on the quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with Multiple sclerosis (PwMS) , and the cross-talk bladder-rectum&#xD;
      (persistence of anorectal dysfunction leading to poor neurogenic bladder control) assessment&#xD;
      of bowel disorders in MS is necessary. But this evaluation is difficult as no specific score&#xD;
      exist. The neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction score (NBD) is often used. The NBD was developed and&#xD;
      validated for spinal cord injury (SCI) population but not for PwMS MS. Yet NBD is often used&#xD;
      in research for all neurologic patients despite its lack of sensibility in various neurogenic&#xD;
      population other than spinal cord injury patient. As recommended in a Cochrane revue in 2014,&#xD;
      there is a need of a specific evaluation for bowel symptoms in neurogenic population,&#xD;
      especially for PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to create and validate a new multidimensional questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess bowel dysfunction and impact on quality of life in patients with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators conducted a prospective multicenter study (8 centers) between June 2019 to&#xD;
      April 2021. This study was developed in 3 steps. First step was literature review and&#xD;
      qualitative interview. Then the second step was the feasibility study to evaluate&#xD;
      comprehension, acceptability of the different items. The last part of the study was the&#xD;
      validation study of the questionnaire. All these phases allowed a full psychometric&#xD;
      validation of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged over 18 years with multiple sclerosis diagnosed on the 2017 revised McDonald's&#xD;
      criteria were included. Patients not able to read or understand the objectives and procedures&#xD;
      for conducting the protocol and patient who had a recent relapse of MS were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: literature review and qualitative interview. The investigators conducted a review of&#xD;
      literature on Pubmed to know all the existing questionnaires or tools developed and validated&#xD;
      to assess neurogenic bowel dysfunction in MS. All articles published until April 2020 were&#xD;
      included. The following keywords were used: &quot;neurogenic bowel dysfunction&quot;, &quot;constipation&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;fecal incontinence&quot;, &quot;anorectal disorders&quot;, &quot;multiple sclerosis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition a single trained nurse performed qualitative interviews with patients suffering&#xD;
      from ano rectal disorders secondary to MS. These interviews were lead in two phases. First&#xD;
      part allowed to determine the wording of the different symptoms and mode of response for each&#xD;
      item. The second part of the face-to-face was free and patients could express themselves if&#xD;
      there was a gap in our list of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this first phase of the study a panel of 8 experts was selected, composed of neuro&#xD;
      urologists and gastro enterologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first version of the questionnaire was made based on the patients' qualitative&#xD;
      interviews, on the reactions and comments of the expert team and on the literature review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Feasibility study The feasibility study was conducted between April 2020 and June&#xD;
      2020. This pilot study included 30 patients and was performed to assess comprehension,&#xD;
      acceptability and pertinence of the items the investigators have created to build the&#xD;
      questionnaire. More of response was also evaluate by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Validation study. This part of the study was performed between June2020 and April&#xD;
      2021. Validation study allowed to determine the psychometric properties of the new tool. All&#xD;
      items were discussed for ceil or floor effect by the expert team. Each item with more than&#xD;
      50% of patients having the same response were discussed by panel experts to decide if they&#xD;
      were excluded or not of the final version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain good psychometric properties, the investigators included 10 patients for each items&#xD;
      of the questionnaire in the final version. This number of subjects was calculated to allow&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Internal consistency reliability was calculated using the alpha coefficient of Cronbach. Each&#xD;
      response has been transformed in a numeric value to perform this test. Alpha coefficient of&#xD;
      Cronbach was considered as very good if &gt; 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-retest reliability was tested using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) which&#xD;
      was significant over 0.7. The first questionnaire was filled at the end of the first&#xD;
      consultation and patients had to mail a second questionnaire (filled at home) 7 to 14 days&#xD;
      after the first consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses: Final version of STAR-Q (Symptoms and Treatment Assessment of&#xD;
      Ano-Rectal disorders in multiple sclerosis patients Questionnaire) was composed by 3 sub&#xD;
      domains. First one was symptoms, second one was treatment, and a third sub domain was quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each sub domains, the investigators calculated an alpha coefficient of Cronbach and a&#xD;
      ICC. the investigators also assessed these properties for total score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total score was compared to NBD total score which represents gold standard in ano rectal&#xD;
      disorders and thus constitutes the reference testing external consistency. Finally, PGI&#xD;
      (Patient Global Improvment) severity scores were used to determine category of severity for&#xD;
      STAR-Q scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes were performed with the R-studio version 3.3.1 and Statviews (SAS&#xD;
      institute V 5.0).&#xD;
