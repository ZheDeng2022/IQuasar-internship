  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called ART4215 in participants with advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumors. The main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of ART4215 that can be given safely to participants alone and&#xD;
           in combination with talazoparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects of ART4215 alone and in combination with talazoparib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the effectiveness of ART4215 alone and in combination with talazoparib&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase I/IIa study designed to evaluate ART4215, a new first-in-class&#xD;
      investigational medicinal product that is a potent and selective inhibitor of&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase (pol) theta. ART4215 is being developed as an oral&#xD;
      anti-cancer agent for monotherapy treatment of patients with cancers that harbor defects in&#xD;
      DNA repair and in combination with anticancer medicines that cause DNA damage.&#xD;
