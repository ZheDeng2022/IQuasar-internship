  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Supaglutide injection in the treatment&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycemic control after diet and exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes dosage determination (Phase IIb) and efficacy confirmation stage(Phase&#xD;
      III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the phase IIb period is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Supaglutide and to provide the recommended dosage for the Phase 3 period after&#xD;
      12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the Phase III period is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Supaglutide after 24-week, double-blind treatment. The secondary outcome is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Supaglutide after 24-week, double-blinded plus 28-week, open-label&#xD;
      treatment period.&#xD;

      This trial includes a 2-week screening period, a 4-week induction period, a 24-week&#xD;
      double-blind treatment period and a 28-week open-label treatment period, followed by a 4-week&#xD;
      follow-up period and a follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample size was calculated to be 324, including 140 subjects in the period of Phase IIb and&#xD;
      184 subjects in the period of Phase III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomly assigned to once-weekly subcutaneously injected Supaglutide 1mg, 2mg,&#xD;
      3mg and placebo according to a 2:2:2:1 ratio. During the IIb period, after Interim analysis&#xD;
      and IDMC(Independent Data Monitoring Committee) confirmed the RP3D ( Recommended phase 3&#xD;
      dosage ) high and low doses, subjects were randomly assigned to Supaglutide RP3D high dose,&#xD;
      RP3D low dose and placebo group according to a 2:2:1 ratio.&#xD;
