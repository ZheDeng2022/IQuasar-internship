  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the GAMification to&#xD;
      Encourage End-Of-Life (GAME-EOL) intervention, which uses the Hello Game program to encourage&#xD;
      and facilitate quality end-of-life (EOL) discussions between implantable cardioverter&#xD;
      defibrillators (ICD) recipients and family members of ICD recipients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD)s are first-line treatment for the primary and&#xD;
      secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest in populations with a history of, or at high&#xD;
      risk for, lethal arrhythmias. Despite the relatively short survival expectancy following&#xD;
      device implantation, many ICD recipients do not participate in advance care planning and&#xD;
      either have no advance directives or advance directives that do not address end-of-life (EOL)&#xD;
      decisions related to ICDs. The prevalence of ICD recipients with general advance directives&#xD;
      ranges from 10-30%. Of these advance directives, only 2% have language related to the ICD&#xD;
      specifically, leaving hundreds of thousands of ICD recipients at risk of unnecessary and&#xD;
      painful shocks. Approximately 30% of ICD recipients will receive a shock in the active dying&#xD;
      phase of a terminal illness, from which resuscitation was not intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication among family members is integral to EOL decision-making. Appropriate quality&#xD;
      discussions can create concordance of perceptions and well thought out advance care plans for&#xD;
      EOL that are congruent with the values and beliefs of the chronically ill and family members.&#xD;
      The Hello Game (commonpractice.com) was created to encourage conversations among families&#xD;
      about EOL choices. The gameplay presents a series of questions that include practical and&#xD;
      philosophical question prompts. These questions range from 1) What kind of music would you&#xD;
      like to be listening to on your last day alive? to 2) Who should your health care surrogate&#xD;
      seek advice from if they need to make a decision about your care? Participation in the game&#xD;
      has been found to improve advance care planning behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the GAME-EOL&#xD;
      intervention, which uses the Hello Game to encourage and facilitate quality EOL discussions&#xD;
      between ICD recipients and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine feasibility of the GAME-EOL intervention to facilitate EOL conversations&#xD;
      between ICD recipients and family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To provide preliminary estimates of the efficacy of the GAME-EOL intervention on:&#xD;
      (2.1) Completion of advance directives (2.2) Completion of device specific advance directives&#xD;
      (2.3) Discussion of EOL choices between ICD recipients and family members&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine efficacy of GAME-EOL on improving the concordance of EOL perceptions and&#xD;
      advance care planning between ICD recipients and family members.&#xD;

    <description>The feasibility, likability, and acceptability of GAME-EOL will be assessed using a Likert style questionnaire and one open-ended question. Recruitment and retention statistics will be calculated to provide additional quantitative assessment of feasibility and acceptability.&#xD;
This questionnaire consists of 18 Likert style questions and one open-response section allowing participants to place additional comments. These questions are broken down into six categories: 1) four questions relating to the content of the education and intervention sessions, 2) four questions related to the technology used to collect data (it's feasibility and user-friendliness), 3) three questions related to the intervention itself, 4) four questions related to the effectiveness of the instructional methodology, 5) three questions about the participants comfort level throughout the study, and 6) one section for additional comments</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The prevalence of completed general and device specific advance directives will be compared to reports in the literature to determine effectiveness. Medical records will be reviewed eight weeks following completion of data collection to determine if the advance directives were communicated to the healthcare provider and placed in the participants' electronic medical record. Additionally, 8 weeks following study completion, the participants will be contacted for a self-report of conversations with healthcare providers and family.</description>

    <measure>Change in concordance of end of life (EOL) Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Preferences for Care Near the End-of-Life instrument will be used to determine congruence of EOL attitudes between ICD recipient and family member. This 32-item questionnaire uses a 5-point Likert scale to identify attitudes toward EOL care with questions such as &quot;I do not want CPR&quot; and &quot;I want my family to make all of my decisions&quot;. The instrument will be completed by the ICD recipient and an adapted version with the stem of the question changed from &quot;I&quot; to &quot;my family member&quot; will be completed by family members. Completed instruments will be compared to determine the convergence of attitudes and clarity of communication that occurred during the intervention. This instrument has been found to be valid and reliable in multiple populations. This instrument will be completed by both patients and family members.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in experience of end of life issues</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 10 item subscale of the ICD End-of-Life Questionnaire assesses the experiences of end of life issues using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'Not at all' to 'Very much so'. These questions center around a participant's or Caregiver's worries about the ICD device in every-day and EOL contexts. These questions will be asked at the initial Baseline assessment and then again after the education/intervention. The differences in experiences and worries will be assessed. A higher score (the 'Very much so' option) relates to higher levels of worry and anxiety about their device.&#xD;
This instrument will be completed by both patients and family members.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attitudes about discussions and actions related to end of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 18 item subscale of the ICD End-of-Life Questionnaire assesses the attitudes about discussions and actions related to end of life, which break down into two categories. For the first 10 questions, patients can select either 'Agree' or Disagree'. These assess the attitudes a participant has about discussing, with a healthcare professional, the issue of turning off the ICD in the event they are experiencing painful shocks. The remaining 8 questions are intended to assess their attitudes toward the ICD itself in the context of deteriorated health. Participants have the choice of selecting 'Yes', 'No', and 'Can't take a stand'. We will also qualitatively analyze the recorded interventions to detect any change of attitudes about EOL topics.&#xD;
This instrument will be completed by both patients and family members.</description>

    <measure>Knowledge about the ICD in relation to end of life (EOL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This 11 item subscale of the ICD End-of-Life Questionnaire assesses the knowledge about the ICD in relation to EOL. It contains 11 items divided into ethical aspects, function of the ICD, and practical consequences, and has been shown to be valid and reliable in the ICD recipient and caregiver populations. This will be administered before and after the intervention so that we may see the effects of the intervention and education on the patient's/caregiver's understanding of their device. For each question, participants can either select 'True', 'False', or 'Don't know'.&#xD;

    <description>The GAME-EOL involves Hello game booklets as well as meetings with an interventionist. Players (ICD recipient and their family member or friend dyad) take turns asking the questions in their booklet and providing their answers to the question. The gameplay continues until all questions are answered or the dyad wishes to stop. Following the completion of the game play, participants will be offered the opportunity to complete advance directives using the conversation guide and advance directive form included in the conversation guide that accompanies the questionnaire booklet.</description>
