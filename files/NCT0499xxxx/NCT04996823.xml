  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if taking axitinib with ipilimumab is&#xD;
      effective in treating advanced melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety and tolerability of the combination of ipilimumab and axitinib will be tested in&#xD;
      advanced melanoma patients who are intolerable/refractory to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy and have&#xD;
      not previously received treatment with ipilimumab.&#xD;
