  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the effects of replacing energy from SoFAS with&#xD;
      energy from avocado on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and other aspects&#xD;
      of the cardiometabolic health profile including fasting lipoprotein lipid and particle&#xD;
      concentrations, insulin sensitivity and blood pressure in men and women with elevated&#xD;
      triglycerides (TG).&#xD;
