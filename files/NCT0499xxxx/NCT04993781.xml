  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this project are to 1) develop primary care clinical eSTEPS decision support&#xD;
      (CDS) to ensure that older adults at risk of falling receive appropriate exercise referrals,&#xD;
      education and support from their provider and 2) to conduct a cluster randomized control&#xD;
      trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS&#xD;
      intervention on falls and injurious falls in patients over age 65 at high risk for falls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will use traditional fall risk screening and machine learning approaches to&#xD;
      accurately identify older adults at risk for falls. Investigators will then develop, CDS&#xD;
      implemented into the electronic health record that helps primary care providers and older&#xD;
      patients develop a tailored fall prevention exercise plan (eSTEPS). Investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a cluster randomized control trial in urban and rural primary care clinics to test&#xD;
      the efficacy of the eSTEPS CDS intervention. Development of the eSTEPS CDS within the widely&#xD;
      adopted Epic Electronic Health Record will support dissemination of evidence for older&#xD;
      adults, with a focus on rural elders.&#xD;
