  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether providing a targeted heart health education&#xD;
      campaign to regions at high risk of heart attacks will improve ACS patient's symptom&#xD;
      recognition and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be will be evaluated according to a cluster randomized, stepped wedged&#xD;
      design. The clusters are eight local government areas (LGAs) in Victoria, Australia. The main&#xD;
      primary outcome will be assessed in consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments&#xD;
      from the six LGAs throughout the study period with an ED diagnoses of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if targeted heart health education will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase ambulance use in ACS patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Decrease patient and prehospital delay times in ACS patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase awareness of personal cardiovascular risk and associated factors in adult&#xD;
           community members; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Increase cardiovascular knowledge and confidence to act to heart attack warning signs in&#xD;
           adult community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if targeted heart health education:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduces the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improves survival in OHCA patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improves survival in ACS patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Improves survival and ACS patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Increases presentations to ED for ACS and unspecified chest pain; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Increases the rates of calls to ambulance for chest pain and non-chest pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Increases the rate of Heart Health Checks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: To meet the objectives of the study, we will employ HM coordinators for each of&#xD;
      the eight high-risk LGAs to organise and deliver our HM education program using HM materials&#xD;
      and Partner resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The stepped-wedge design is a uni-directional cross-over design - where the&#xD;
      randomisation element is when the cluster crosses-over to the intervention following a&#xD;
      control period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the 16-month study period, the eight LGAs will move into the intervention phase at two&#xD;
      month intervals. As four LGAs are in close proximity, these LGAs will switch from control to&#xD;
      intervention periods at the same time to avoid possible contamination.&#xD;
