    <description>The intervention group performed two types of relaxation techniques, that have shown their positive effects on immune functions, including progressive muscle relaxation exercise (PMRs)16 and cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM). We used two types of relaxation techniques to produce maximum effects of relaxation techniques within the limited period of COVID-19 quarantine (2 weeks). the control groups did not receive any treatment during the study; however, they were treated afterwards.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A recent mild or moderate COVID-19 with no or low-grade fever 99.5- 100.94 째F&#xD;
             (37.5-38.3 째C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient was not hospitalized and had high-grade fever &lt;100.94 째F (&lt;38.3 째C) or&#xD;
             other chronic diseases such as heart problems, hypertension, or diabetes. Women how&#xD;
             were using contraceptives were excluded because contraceptives decrease immune&#xD;
             functions and might affect the subjectivity to autoimmune disorders with marked&#xD;
             increases in risk for various autoimmune disorders&#xD;
