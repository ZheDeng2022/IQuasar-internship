  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators proposed an artificial intelligence-based preoperative&#xD;
      automatic reminder system on colonocopy, which can improve the quality of bowel preparation&#xD;
      and the rate of polyps and adenomas detection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in bowel preparation methods, bowel preparation is inadequate in up to&#xD;
      one-third of all colonoscopies in reported series. Inadequate bowel cleansing results in&#xD;
      negative con-sequences for the examination, including incomplete visualization of the colon,&#xD;
      missed lesions(22-48%), procedural difficulties, prolonged procedure time and reduced time&#xD;
      interval until follow-up, and an estimated 12-22% increase in overall colonoscopy cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adequacy of a bowel preparation is closely linked to patient compliance with both dietary&#xD;
      and purge instructions. Previous work has shown that 18-23.5% of the patients with poor&#xD;
      preparation had failed to follow preparation instructions. One study performed in Asia showed&#xD;
      that non-compliance with bowel preparation instructions, lower education level, and a long&#xD;
      wait for the colonoscopy appointment were independent risk factors for poor bowel&#xD;
      preparation. A survey among doctors showed that gastroenterologists with the highest number&#xD;
      of patients with inadequate bowel preparation believed that patients are unwilling to follow&#xD;
      preparation instructions, struggle with the prescribed diet, and are unable to tolerate the&#xD;
      full course of purgative. It is reasonable to hypothesis that efforts to improve education&#xD;
      and maximize patient compliance during the preparatory period will enhance the efficacy of&#xD;
      bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research has shown that telephone-based re-education about the details of bowel preparation&#xD;
      on the day before colonoscopy significantly improved the quality of bowel preparation and&#xD;
      polys detection rate. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully&#xD;
      applied in multiple medical fields. But there has not been an artificial-intelligence-based&#xD;
      system which can automatically remind patients of the details of bowel preparation on the day&#xD;
      before colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we proposed an artificial intelligence-based preoperative automatic reminder&#xD;
      system on colonoscopy, which can improve the quality of bowel preparation and the rate of&#xD;
      polyps and adenomas detection.&#xD;

    <description>The numerator is the number of patients qualified for intestinal preparation, and the denominator is the number of all patients undergoing colonoscopy. The definition of intestinal preparation qualification is: e-bbps qualification is defined as colonoscopy with e-bbps ≥ 6; BBPS is defined as enteroscopy with scores ≥2 for ascending colon, transverse colon and descending colon. At the same time, if one or more of the following conditions are met, intestinal preparation is considered insufficient: (1) colonoscopy with e-bbps &lt;6 is insufficient（ 2) Cancel colonoscopy due to poor intestinal preparation or personal reasons（ 3) Incomplete colonoscopy.</description>
