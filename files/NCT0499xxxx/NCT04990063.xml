  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innate immune cells are an important part of the body's innate immune system, the first line&#xD;
      of defense against infection and cancer. Tumor killer cells (TKC) are mixed cultures of two&#xD;
      kinds of innate immune cells, namely natural killer cells (NK cells) and gamma delta T cells&#xD;
      (γδT cells), which are co-activated and co-cultured ex-vivo in a certain proportion by the&#xD;
      unique TKC technology. Adoptive TKC transfer is expected to exert a strong anti-tumor effect&#xD;
      through synergistic action between NK cells and γδT cells. In this study, the safety,&#xD;
      tolerance, and preliminary efficacy of adoptive TKC transfer combined with chemotherapy will&#xD;
      be examined in patients with advanced NSCLC.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● To describe the safety profile and toxicity tolerance of combining adoptive TKC transfer&#xD;
      with chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of combining adoptive TKC transfer with chemotherapy&#xD;
      in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a single-centre, open label, non-randomised, no control clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NK cells and γδT cells are isolated from the patients' peripheral blood mononuclear&#xD;
           cells (PBMCs) obtained before chemotherapy and then co-cultured with TKC technology&#xD;
           ex-vivo. The mixed cultures will be used in multiple infusions under administration. The&#xD;
           first infusion will be conducted in 7-10 days after chemotherapy and is assessed by the&#xD;
           investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical responses will be evaluated closely in about 30 days and last up to 2 years&#xD;
           after treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a clinical response (objective tumor regression).ORR is computed by: the sum of the number of patients with Complete Response (CR) and number of patients with Partial Response (PR) / total number of patients. The total number of patients is the sum of the number of patients with CR, PR, stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) is used as the criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears (CR), shrinks (PR), stays the same (SD) or gets bigger (PD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is the time between the initial response to treatment per RECIST v1.1 and subsequent disease progression among patients achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). RECIST v1.1 is used as the criteria to determine whether a tumor disappears (CR) or shrinks (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is the length of time from the date patient enrolled in to the date on which tumor progresses or the patient dies for any cause.</description>

    <description>NK cells and γδT cells are isolated from the patients' PBMCs obtained before standard chemotherapy and then co-cultured ex-vivo. Patients will receive multiple TKC treatments under administration, 3 weeks/cycle. The first infusion will be conducted in 7-10 days after chemotherapy and is assessed by the investigators. TKC cells are transfused to patients in a dosage escalated manner. Dose escalation starts at 1×10^8 cells/kg (based on the whole body weight). After the safety assurance of the initial administration, the next course, up to 8 courses, is resumed and the dose maybe increased subsequently at the discretion of the investigators, or reduced for safety reason.</description>
