  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, degenerative movement disorder, the&#xD;
      incidence of which increases with age, characterized by motor and non-motor findings.&#xD;
      Cardinal motor findings such as bradykinesia, rigidity, rest tremor, postural instability,&#xD;
      and gait dysfunction and secondary motor symptoms additional to these such as dysarthria, and&#xD;
      associated movements in the arms may be seen throughout the course of the disease.&#xD;
      Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons occurs in the basal ganglia, together with a&#xD;
      decrease in the speed and angle of movement. Loss of postural reflexes causes balance&#xD;
      disturbance findings such as impaired postural control, rigidity in the extremities, and&#xD;
      akinesia.Falls, decreased mobility, disability and quality of life impairment occur as a&#xD;
      result of balance disorder. Higher rates of falls or fall-related fractures have been&#xD;
      reported in PD compared to the non-PD elderly population.There are several exercise&#xD;
      applications aimed at balance improving strategies in PD. Strengthening exercises combined&#xD;
      with conventional balance exercises, treadmill walking training, tai chi, and biofeedback&#xD;
      have been shown to improve gait and and balance control in PD. Various publications have&#xD;
      shown that biofeedback therapy in elderly individuals and in healthy individuals with&#xD;
      postural disorder exhibits positive effects on balance by enhancing postural stability and&#xD;
      reducing body tremor. The basic aim of this study was to investigate the effects of static&#xD;
      posturography-assisted visual and auditory biofeedback therapy on balance and the risk of&#xD;
      falls in PD. In addition, the study was intended to determine the effects of balance training&#xD;
      on the individual's daily living activities, perceived safety level, and emotional state.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>All patients in this study were classified based on the Hoehn and Yahr scale prior to treatment. This scale is widely used for classifying PD into five stages. It permits objective evaluation of the progression of the disease, from Stage 0 (no disease symptoms) to Stage 5 (the patient is confined to a wheelchair or bed).</description>

    <measure>The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is an extensive scale employed for the clinical evaluation of severity of PD. It consists of four sections including non-motor findings, motor problems, motor findings, and treatment complications. Fourteen motor findings (0 - no finding, or normal, 4- severe finding) in the second section of the scale and comprising the motor problems part were evaluated before treatment in this study.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of two sections assessing gait and balance. The first nine questions concern balance, and the following seven concern gait. The total possible score is 28, consisting of 12 for the gait scale and 16 for the balance scale</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale consists of 14 sections and measures the ability to maintain balance during voluntary movements and postural changes in the trunk and extremities. Scoring is between 0 and 4 (0: unable to complete the task, 4: normal performance). The highest possible score is 56. Scores of 0-20 indicate balance disorder, scores of 21-40 indicate acceptable balance, and scores of 41-56 indicate good balance</description>

    <description>Biofeedback system is a center of pressure-controlled video game-based exercise system designed for patients with neurological and orthopedic diseases and provides balance training using auditory, visual, and pressure biofeedback. The system contains several games, each designed to focus on a different component of balance. Biofeedback is provided by means of a monitor in front of the patient. The balance exercises program involved a total of 18 sessions, each lasting 20 min, three times a week for six weeks, and were individually tailored based on the patient's tolerance and current motor and sensorial capacities. All patients performed conventional exercises.</description>
