  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute engagement effort aimed at training&#xD;
      researchers/providers and patients to work in research teams together online throughout the&#xD;
      research process (including: development, design, and dissemination) to address critical gaps&#xD;
      in their care. This is a change from the typical research done with people with CF as they&#xD;
      are frequently isolated from other members of the CF community because of infection control&#xD;
      guidelines that restrict in-person contact to avoid the spread of bacteria between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project has four aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. build capacity for PCOR knowledge and skills applicable for longitudinal online&#xD;
           engagement,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. create and disseminate a best practices PCOR user guide for populations that solely&#xD;
           engage online,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to create an interactive web-based version of our User Guide through a survey and three&#xD;
           modified Delphi rounds, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to create a comprehensive training manual for conducting PCOR online (step-by-step&#xD;
           instructions), which will incorporate the aforementioned user guide.&#xD;

      The CF Reproductive and Sexual Health Collaborative (CFReSHC) will introduce and support&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) to the greater CF community using existing PCOR&#xD;
      training products and adapt them so that they address key issues related to&#xD;
      researcher-patient teams that solely engage online. We will create a best-practices user&#xD;
      guide for online engagement by performing key-informant interviews with patient- or&#xD;
      community-engaged teams and periodic assessments of day-to-day platform use with CFReSHC&#xD;
      members and other PCOR teams.&#xD;

    <description>we evaluated each of our training sessions by administering a survey to participants before the training and another similar survey immediately after the training. For both the pre- and post-training surveys, we asked participants to rate their agreement about PCOR knowledge, confidence about engaging in PCOR and training session satisfaction (post-training only) using a 5 option Likert scale. Participants were given a statement related to the learning objective and asked to rate how much they agreed with the statement with options ranging from strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree and strongly agree. At the end of each survey, we asked open-ended questions regarding what the participants liked about the training session and how we could improve. Surveys were administered online via REDCap.</description>

    <description>We created four online training sessions. Our first training for patients/caregivers only (Research 101) was an exception, however, in which we produced a 25-minute asynchronous, self-directed learning seminar intended to be viewed before the subsequent interactive PCOR sessions. Of the three following synchronous interactive training sessions, two included both learner working groups (patients/caregivers and researchers/providers) together (PCOR 101 and PCOR Team Dynamics) and one session (PCOR Study Design) was for researchers/healthcare providers only.</description>
