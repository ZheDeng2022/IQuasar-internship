      To compare intraoperative as well as postoperative outcomes of SOLTIVE Thulium laser compared&#xD;
      to Ho:YAG laser for the treatment of urolithiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that utilizing the SOLTIVE Thulium laser for the treatment of urolithiasis&#xD;
      will result in a more efficient procedure, with comparable stone free rate to that of Holmium&#xD;
      laser and subjective improvement in physician satisfaction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urologists utilize several different laser technologies which continue to rapidly advance and&#xD;
      improve. The Holmium:YAG laser (Hm:YAG), Thulium:YAG (Tm:YAG) laser and most recently, the&#xD;
      thulium fiber are essential tools used in endourology. The holmium:YAG laser fiber is a&#xD;
      2120nm which has been the primary workhorse for many endoscopic procedures as it is broadly&#xD;
      available with many versions and upgrades. The thulium:YAG laser has also shown its own set&#xD;
      of advantages such as being lighter weight, having high frequency capability, generating less&#xD;
      degradation, and consuming less energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The natural progression of lasers has continued with the development of the thulium fiber&#xD;
      laser (TFL), which is a distinct technology from the previous Thulium:YAG lasers. This&#xD;
      remains an important separation as prior studies with Tm:YAG the cannot be directly applied&#xD;
      to this new technology. TFL's have a wavelength of 1940nm, different from the Hm:YAG laser of&#xD;
      2120nm and Tm:YAG at 2010nm, which is absorbed nearly five times more in water further&#xD;
      allowing for improved efficiency and has less penetration of a depth of 0.15mm. In&#xD;
      preclinical studies, the TFL demonstrated two to threefold higher comparison to holmium:YAG&#xD;
      as well as four times less retropulsion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thulium fiber laser has been studied and applied in several different Urological&#xD;
      procedures and the initial clinical data on these has been promising. Based on the temporal&#xD;
      pulse shape, the TFL resulted in a two-fold ablation power in comparison to holmium as well&#xD;
      as greater versitility. More specifically, the TFL has been effective in several studies&#xD;
      during laser lithotripsy. In a comparison study of the TFL and high-powered holmium laser in&#xD;
      ureteral stones, the procedures were faster, required fewer stents and no residual stones&#xD;
      were seen at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, Olympus's super-pulsed SOLTIVE thulium laser fiber was FDA approved for use in&#xD;
      numerous urological indications including lithotripsy. This SOLTIVE thulium laser fiber is a&#xD;
      super pulsed laser with numerous benefits including high frequency capabilities of 2,200&#xD;
      Hertz (Hz) compared to Ho:YAG capabilities of 80-100 Hz, decreased fiber degradation,&#xD;
      continuous laser mode resulting in smoother cut, shallower tissue penetration (0.15 mm) which&#xD;
      results in less surrounding tissue damage, 50 mm diameter laser fiber versus 200 mm allowing&#xD;
      for increased maneuverability, visibility, and decreased energy consumption. The SOLTIVE&#xD;
      laser allows for greater power through a smaller fiber decreasing fiber failure and endoscope&#xD;
      damage. This greater tissue ablation capacity also results in improved hemostasis if&#xD;
      identified during endoscopy. Finally, this laser is much smaller and compact in size in&#xD;
      comparison to Holium lasers. It allows for a less crowded operating room and has the ability&#xD;
      to be utilized in any operating room outlet in comparison to the 220 Volt outlet required by&#xD;
      Holium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, as the prevalence of stones continues to rise, the economic burden of stone&#xD;
      disease is also increasing. Despite this upward trend, there are very few studies that have&#xD;
      looked at this economic impact of specific stone treatments based on particular laser&#xD;
      subtypes. Perez-Ardavin et al looked at comparison between extracorporeal shockwave&#xD;
      lithotripsy and ureteroscopy for stones smaller than 2cm which showed higher cost and&#xD;
      increased perceived affection. The TFL may address some of this disparity with improved&#xD;
      efficacy, less OR time and potential reduced need for ureteral stenting. Furthermore, the TFL&#xD;
      may lead to decreased patient costs and allow for more procedures to be completed in turn&#xD;
      providing benefit to both patients and hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the favorable data and qualities in other TFL studies, there remains an insufficient&#xD;
      data on clinical performance of the SOLTIVE Thulium laser fibers for treatment of&#xD;
      urolithiasis, particularly in the United States. Additionally, there has been limited&#xD;
      comparison of economic utility of the TFL to the widely utilized holmium laser fibers.&#xD;
