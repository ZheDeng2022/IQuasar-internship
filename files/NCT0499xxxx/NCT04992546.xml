    <textblock>
      This is a Ph2a study that consists of a double-blind, intra-patient placebo-controlled&#xD;
      treatment period and an open-label uncontrolled treatment period with objective to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of PRN473 in up to 40 patients with&#xD;
      mild to moderate AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 (Baseline) of the Blinded Period, 2 target lesions with a difference no greater than&#xD;
      1 point in Total Sign Score (TSS) will be randomly assigned to treatment in an intra-patient&#xD;
      1:1 manner, one lesion to PRN473 and the other to matching placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will take approximately 13 weeks, including up to a 5-week screening period, a&#xD;
      6-week treatment period, end of study assessments 1 day after last dose, and a safety&#xD;
      follow-up phone call 2 weeks after last dose.&#xD;
