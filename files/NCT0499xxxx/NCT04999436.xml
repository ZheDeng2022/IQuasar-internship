  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Living donor (LD) kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end-stage&#xD;
      kidney disease (ESKD). However, LDs take on a higher risk of future ESKD themselves. African&#xD;
      American (AA) LDs have an even greater, 3.3-fold, risk of ESKD than white LDs post-donation.&#xD;
      Because evidence suggests that Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) risk variants contribute to this&#xD;
      greater risk, transplant nephrologists are increasingly using APOL1 testing to evaluate LD&#xD;
      candidates of African ancestry. However, nephrologists do not consistently perform genetic&#xD;
      counseling with LD candidates about APOL1 due to a lack of knowledge and skill in counseling&#xD;
      about APOL1. Without proper counseling, APOL1 testing will magnify LD candidates' decisional&#xD;
      conflict about donating, jeopardizing their informed consent. Given their elevated risk of&#xD;
      ESRD post-donation, and AAs' widely-held cultural concerns about genetic testing, it is&#xD;
      ethically critical to protect AA LD candidates' safety through APOL1 testing in a culturally&#xD;
      competent manner to improve informed decisions about donating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No transplant programs have integrated APOL1 testing into LD evaluation in a culturally&#xD;
      competent manner. Clinical &quot;chatbots,&quot; mobile apps that use artificial intelligence to&#xD;
      provide genetic information to patients and relieve constraints on clinicians' time, can&#xD;
      improve informed treatment decisions and reduce decisional conflict. The chatbot &quot;Gia,&quot;&#xD;
      created by a medical genetics company, can be adapted to any condition. However, no chatbot&#xD;
      on APOL1is currently available. No counseling training programs are available for&#xD;
      nephrologists to counsel AA LDs about APOL1 and donation in a culturally competent manner.&#xD;
      Given the shortage of genetic counselors, increasing nephrologists' genetic literacy is&#xD;
      critical to integrating genetic testing into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and evaluate the effectiveness of an&#xD;
      APOL1testing program for AA LDs at two transplant centers serving large AA LD populations&#xD;
      (Chicago, IL, and Washington, DC). The APOL1 testing program will evaluate the effect of the&#xD;
      culturally competent testing, chatbot, and counseling on AA LD candidates' decisional&#xD;
      conflict about donating, preparedness for decision-making, willingness to donate, and&#xD;
      satisfaction with informed consent. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adapt Gia and transplant counseling to APOL1 for use in routine clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on decisional conflict, preparedness,&#xD;
           and willingness to donate in a pre-post design&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the implementation of this intervention into clinical practice by using the&#xD;
           RE-AIM framework to longitudinally evaluate nephrologist counseling practices and LDs'&#xD;
           satisfaction with informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of this study will be the creation of a model for APOL1 testing of AA LDs, which&#xD;
      can then be implemented nationally via implementation science approaches. APOL1 will serve as&#xD;
      a model for integrating culturally competent genetic testing into transplant and other&#xD;
      practices to improve patient informed consent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical practice guidelines advise &quot;â€¦considering APOL1 genotyping in live kidney donor&#xD;
      candidates with sub-Saharan African ancestors&quot; and using shared decision making until the NIH&#xD;
      APOLLO study of APOL1 outcomes in living donors provides population-level data. Transplant&#xD;
      physicians are increasingly adopting APOL1 testing. However, physicians do not consistently&#xD;
      inform live donor candidates about APOL1, perform genetic counseling, or practice shared&#xD;
      decision making with live donor candidates. Our prior research has shown that this variation&#xD;
      results from lack of knowledge and skill in counseling about APOL1, and fear that APOL1&#xD;
      testing will deter live donor candidates from donating. It is unknown if they address African&#xD;
      American live donor candidates' cultural concerns about genetic testing while counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective counseling about APOL1 test results is critical especially because genetic&#xD;
      information can magnify live kidney donor candidates' decisional conflict about donating. The&#xD;
      consequences of such decisional conflict may be reduced donation rates, which could&#xD;
      exacerbate disparities in African Americans patients' access to living donor kidney&#xD;
      transplants and health outcomes. Therefore, effective culturally competent counseling is&#xD;
      ethically essential to reduce live donor candidates' decisional conflict and enable informed&#xD;
      decisions about donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will entail adapting established genetic counseling discussions for transplant&#xD;
      nephrologists to counsel donor candidates about APOL1 test results and engage in shared&#xD;
      decision making to improve live donor candidates' informed consent for living donation. The&#xD;
      APOL1 counseling training program will address nephrologists' practical knowledge and&#xD;
      counseling skill deficits about APOL1 as identified in our prior work. The specific duration&#xD;
      and format of the counseling training program will be finalized through a final nephrologist&#xD;
      needs assessment early in Year 1. Our preliminary needs assessment revealed a preference for&#xD;
      a 2-4 hour educational program delivered by a genetics counselor through a live webinar&#xD;
      format. The investigators plan to enroll all transplant nephrologists who evaluate live&#xD;
      kidney donor candidates (n=6) across both sites for participation in the counseling training&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the nephrologist counseling training program will be assessed primarily&#xD;
      by assessing increases in nephrologists' skill in delivering counseling for APOL1 by&#xD;
      comparing the number and quality of prescribed counseling behaviors observed between&#xD;
      nephrologists counseling live donor candidates in the control group (year 1) versus&#xD;
      intervention group (years 2-5). Secondarily, we will evaluate the counseling training program&#xD;
      via paired tests of pre-post scores of validated surveys assessing practical knowledge and&#xD;
      skills in counseling. Additionally, we will qualitatively analyze nephrologists' perceptions&#xD;
      of their APOL1 counseling over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training materials will be updated after two years of implementing the APOL1 intervention&#xD;
      based on lessons learned, and will be available for future dissemination. The findings&#xD;
      generated from this research have the potential to meaningfully protect donor candidate&#xD;
      safety by providing culturally competent counseling and shared decision making to improve&#xD;
      candidates' informed consent. As such, we believe this proposal is both timely and responsive&#xD;
      to the NIDDK Program Announcement (PA-18-330) &quot;Investigator-Initiated Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Targeting Diseases within the Mission of NIDDK.&quot;&#xD;

The training program aims to increase transplant nephrologists' practical knowledge, self-efficacy, and skills in counseling live donor candidates about APOL1 in a culturally competent manner. The program will include training in: current APOL1 data; the value of APOL1 testing and meaning of positive test results for living donor clinical evaluation; risks of having two APOL1 gene variants on the donor's kidney health; how to engage in shared decision making about donation; how to address cultural concerns about genetic testing; and how to protect donor candidates' privacy and confidentiality with APOL1 test results. The APOL1 counseling training program will be delivered by a genetic counselor through webinars and other interactive modalities and last 2-4 hours.</description>
