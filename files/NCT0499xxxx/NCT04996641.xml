      Pilot study involving 20 patients undergoing dental treatment prior to radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Comparison of outcome parameters to existing data of age and gender matched patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced radiation therapy systems are part of head/neck cancer treatment. 2-3 weeks prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of radiation therapy (preRT), patients undergo dental screening, simple&#xD;
      restorations and the removal of teeth deemed a osteoradionecrosis risk, often including&#xD;
      asymptomatic, vital teeth. Time limitations preRT generally prohibit a traditional&#xD;
      multi-visit approach for endodontic treatment, crown preparation, and an externally&#xD;
      fabricated restoration. Precision restorative dentistry, with CAD/CAM milled ceramic&#xD;
      restorations allow for immediate post-endodontic rehabilitation on the same. The Center for&#xD;
      Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) at PDM conducts the ARMOR trial, a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial testing the efficacy of two oral care protocols enrolling 120 cancer&#xD;
      patients from the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine (PCAM) over 3.5 years. This pilot&#xD;
      study will enroll 20 patients of the ARMOR trial for endodontic treatment and restoration of&#xD;
      posterior asymptomatic and vital teeth using microscopic endodontics and digital precision&#xD;
      CAD/CAM restoration. These teeth would otherwise be extracted due to time limitations preRT.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen for the dental treatment within the time window from diagnosis to&#xD;
      initiation of radiation therapy. Patients will be evaluated for (1) feasibility of the&#xD;
      suggested protocol (primary objective); quality of life as in the ARMOR trial; 2) tooth&#xD;
      survival; 3) endodontic status [PAI index]; 4) periodontal prognosis and status [McGuire-Nunn&#xD;
      Criteria, etc]; and 5) restorative status [USPHS Criteria, etc] (secondary objectives) at&#xD;
      1,2,5 months follow-ups of the ARMOR trial. For control, data for tooth survival and QLQ will&#xD;
      be compared to 20 other participants of the ARMOR trial (10/10 per study arm) that do not&#xD;
      participate in the EndoRest substudy and to 20 other matching participants patients (age,&#xD;
      gender) from an existing, comparable dataset of the ORA-RAD studies of the Penn Study arm at&#xD;
      PDM Oral Medicine. Periodontal status and restorative status (iff applicable) will be&#xD;
      compared to contra-lateral or counter-arch teeth of the individual participant.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1-5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of whether the proposed one-day root canal treatment plus crown restoration protocol can be utilized and executed prior to radiation treatment of head and neck cancer patients. The evaluation will be on a per patient, not per tooth, basis. Failure is defined as the inability to complete endodontic treatment and definitive restoration of a qualifying tooth in a study participant, resulting in the need for pre-radiation extraction of the tooth.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delay in RT initiation, calculated on a scale of 0-100 for the study, as described below (Feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>2-10 days</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of whether the onset of radiation therapy was delayed due to participation in the EndoRest study. The evaluation will be on a per patient, not per tooth, basis. Delay in RT start will be scored on the following scale:&#xD;
5 points: RT started as planned; no delays 4 points: RT delayed by 1 day due to participation in the EndoRest study 3 points: RT delayed by 2 days due to participation in the EndoRest study 2 points: RT delayed by 3 days due to participation in the EndoRest study 0 points: RT delated by 4 or more days due to participation in the EndoRest study&#xD;
The total points for all participants in the study will be summed. A score of &gt;=90 indicated that the protocol is feasible. A total score &lt;90 indicates that the protocol is not feasible.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants who need post-radiation extraction of a qualifying tooth.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of whether a qualifying tooth for which endodontic and restorative treatment was successfully completed was extracted in the time interval post-radiation therapy up to 5 months after the initial visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of quality of life (QOL) based on the EORTC-QLQ-C30</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life and function will be assessed using the validated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) with the Head and Neck specific questionnaire add-on (HN43). This questionnaire assesses general quality of life as well as issues specific to head and neck cancer patients (e.g. difficulty swallowing, pain, dry mouth).&#xD;
All questions on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC-QLQ are assigned a score of 0-100. A higher score indicates a higher response level (for function questions, a high score indicates a high level of function, indicating a better outcome. For symptom questions, a high score indicates a high level of symptomology, indicating a worse outcome).</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of tooth survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tooth survival after completion of endodontic-restorative treatment will be assessed in all participants using standard survival analysis techniques.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of endodontic status using the PAI</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Endodontic status will be assessed using the periapical index (PAI). PAI uses a scale of 0-5, with 0 meaning &quot;healthy&quot; and 5 meaning &quot;severe periodontitis with exacerbated features.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of periodontal status</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Periodontal status will be assessed through probing depths of periodontal pockets of the treated tooth.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of restorative status using the USPHS criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>5 months</time_frame>
    <description>Restoration status will be assessed using United States Public Health System (USPHS) criteria. The USPHS criteria assesses anatomical form, marginal adaptation, color match, marginal discoloration, surface roughness, and caries, in a single assessment tool. Higher scores indicate less favorable outcomes.</description>
