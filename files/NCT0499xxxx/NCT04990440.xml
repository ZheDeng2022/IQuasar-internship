    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)-75 (Greater Than or Equal to [&gt;=] 75 Percent [%] Improvement from Baseline) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher score indicative of more severe disease. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6 in which 0 indicates 'no eruption', 1 indicates '&lt;10%, 2 indicates '&lt;10%-29%', 3 indicates '&lt;30%-49%', 4 indicates '&lt;50%-69%', 5 indicates ' &lt;70%-89%', and 6 indicates '&gt;90%-100%'.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 20</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a pharmaceutical (investigational or non investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 20</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event based on International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and European Union (EU) guidelines on pharmacovigilance for medicinal products for human use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: a) results in deaths; b) life-threatening (the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.); c) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; d) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; e) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; f) is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product; g) is medically important.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Both validated Investigator Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) Score of 0 or 1 and a Reduction from Baseline of &gt;=2 Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with both vIGA-AD of 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of &gt;=2 points will be reported. The vIGA-AD is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 where 0 indicates clear, 1 indicates 'mostly clear', 2 indicates ' mild', 3 indicates 'moderate', and 4 indicates 'severe'. The IGA score is selected using the morphological descriptors that best describe the overall appearance of the AD lesions at a given time point.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with improvement (reduction) of eczema-related itch NRS score of &gt;=4 from baseline among participants with a baseline itch value &gt;=4 will be reported. The Eczema Skin Pain and Itch NRS is a 2-item Patient-reported outcome (PRO) developed by the sponsor that participants will use to rate the severity of their eczema-related skin pain. Each item is rated on a 0 to 10 NRS ranging from 0 &quot;none&quot; to 10 &quot;worst possible&quot; and will be scored separately.</description>
