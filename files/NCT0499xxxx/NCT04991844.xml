  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Healthy Eating for Successful Living in Older Adults™ (HESL) is a six-week community&#xD;
      nutrition and lifestyle education program designed specifically for the elderly (&gt;60 years),&#xD;
      to promote dietary and behavioral changes towards a healthy lifestyle. The intervention was&#xD;
      evaluated using a randomized-controlled trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The elderly are at a higher risk of various chronic diseases. The burden of various chronic&#xD;
      diseases such as heart disease and osteoporosis can be reduced with change in dietary and&#xD;
      other lifestyle behaviors. The Healthy Eating for Successful Living in Older Adults™ (HESL)&#xD;
      provides elderly with needed knowledge on healthy food choices and lifestyle behaviors, and&#xD;
      tools that support behavioral changes. The investigators aimed to evaluate this intervention&#xD;
      program by determining, among others, the impact of the intervention on factors such as&#xD;
      dietary intake of fiber, and other nutrients, as well as healthy behaviors and food choices,&#xD;
      and quality of life at 6 months post-intervention, using a randomized-controlled trial. The&#xD;
      intervention group was compared to the control group receiving no intervention to evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of the six-week HESL intervention on our outcome measures of interest.&#xD;

    <description>Intervention group participants met once a week, for 2.5 hours, over a period of six weeks for the HES workshops. The HES workshops followed a scripted curriculum that incorporated information from the USDA's MyPlateTM, and the USDA 2015-2020 dietary guidelines. Participants were also taught goal-setting, problem-solving through brainstorming, group support, self-assessment and management of dietary and physical activity patterns.</description>
