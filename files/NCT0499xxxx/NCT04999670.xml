    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate post-operative pain in patients undergoing elective caesarean&#xD;
      sections based on the method of fascial closure. Patients will be randomised into one of&#xD;
      three groups based upon the method of fascial closure and will be followed up over a 10 week&#xD;
      period evaluating analgesia use in the acute setting, and also following up with pain scores&#xD;
      using a visual analogue score throughout the follow-up period.&#xD;

      Participants will be approached prior to their elective caesarean section to be consented. If&#xD;
      they agree to be a part of the study, they will then be randomised into one of three groups&#xD;
      based upon the method of fascial closure after delivery of the foetus and closure of the&#xD;
      hysterotomy site:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Fascia sutured with #1 polysorb braided absorbable suture, with the knot being&#xD;
           superficial to the fascia, starting at the left angle of the fascial incision and closed&#xD;
           in a continuous fashion. The contralateral angle is grasped with a kocher clamp and the&#xD;
           suture is then tied behind the angle ensuring adequate closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fascia sutured using #1 polysorb braided absorbable suture with a superficial knot,&#xD;
           starting at the left angle and closed in a continuous fashion until the suture is above&#xD;
           the right rectus abdominis muscle belly. A second #1 polysorb braided absorbable suture&#xD;
           is tied behind the right angle with a superficial knot and run across in a continuous&#xD;
           fashion to meet the opposing suture which are then tied together.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fascia sutured using #1 polysorb braided absorbable suture with a buried knot below the&#xD;
           fascia starting at the left angle and closed in a continuous fashion until the suture&#xD;
           overlies the right rectus abdominis muscle belly. A second #1 polysorb braided&#xD;
           absorbable suture is then tied behind the right angle with a buried knot below the&#xD;
           fascia and run across in a continuous fashion to meet the opposing suture which are then&#xD;
           tied together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remainder of the caesarean section is completed in the standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent to this, patients are followed up with a modified brief pain inventory on&#xD;
      post-operative day #1, day #7, day #14, day #42 and day #70 to evaluate their pain in the&#xD;
      post-operative period. In addition, whilst being inpatients, participant's analgesia use is&#xD;
      evaluated using the medication administration record within the unit.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Analogue Score for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative day #1 and 2, 2, 6, and 10 weeks post-operatively.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to fill in a modified MD Anderson Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire with questions related to their overall pain using a visual analogue score ranking from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). A higher score will delineate poorer pain control. This questionnaire can be found the attached protocol under &quot;Appendix C&quot;. The time points at which these will be measured is on post-operative day #1 and 2, as well as at 2, 6, and 10 weeks post-operatively. We aim to observe a change in the overall pain between groups.</description>
