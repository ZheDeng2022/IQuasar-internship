  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the outcomes, ease of use, and cost of the Werewolf&#xD;
      FLOW50 device to the institutional standard of care which is does not include the use of&#xD;
      electrocautery devices during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery in&#xD;
      patients 12-18 years of age using a randomized control trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a lower proportion of participants who undergo ACLR and&#xD;
      are randomized to the Werewolf FLOW50 procedure will experience post-operative arthrofibrosis&#xD;
      compared to those randomized to standard of care (control group).&#xD;
