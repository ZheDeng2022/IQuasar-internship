  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate how to manage the axillary lymph nodes in&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer. The investigators will determine if a sampling of the lymph&#xD;
      nodes under the arm will give the information necessary to determine if fewer lymph nodes can&#xD;
      be removed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>False Negative Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The false negative rate of targeted axillary dissection after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) in study participants. A false negative event will be defined as a case where the specific node (either the clipped node or the sentinel lymph node, depending on the analysis) does not show metastasis even though residual disease is identified in the other axillary nodes. The false negative rate will be computed as the number of false negative events divided by the total number of pathologically node-positive patients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sentinel Lymph Node Identification Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Day of Surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The sentinel lymph node identification rate is the number of study participants with at least one sentinel lymph node divided by total number of study participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clipped Lymph Node Identification Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Day of Surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>The clipped lymph node identification rate is the number of study participants with at least one clipped lymph node removed divided by the total number of study participants with clipped lymph nodes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accuracy Rate of Imaging Studies</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy rate of imaging studies in determining response in the breast and axilla will be calculated as the sum of true responders on imaging and true non-responders on imaging divided by total number of study participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with pCR will be reported. The percentage of patients with pCR will be calculated as the number of patients with a pCR divided by the total number of study participants. PCR is defined as the lack of all signs of cancer in tissue samples removed during surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs). AEs will be assessed by and assigned severity and treatment attribution by the treating physician using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 5.0.</description>
