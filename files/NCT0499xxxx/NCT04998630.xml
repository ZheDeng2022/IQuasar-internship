  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myofascial pain syndrome is one of the common causes of musculoskeletal pain seen in clinical&#xD;
      practice and is characterized by the presence of trigger points associated with sensitive&#xD;
      areas such as taut bands of skeletal muscle. It may also be accompanied by referred pain,&#xD;
      which is pain in other parts of the body. Although the pathophysiology and etiology of&#xD;
      myofascial pain syndrome and trigger points are still unknown, there are reports that&#xD;
      myofascial pain is a complex form of neuromuscular dysfunction caused by motor and sensory&#xD;
      abnormalities involving both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been considered as a method of treatment for myofascial pain syndrome. In&#xD;
      addition, although pain reduction and functional improvement of focused ESWT in patients with&#xD;
      myofascial pain syndrome have been reported, related studies are lacking on the effect of&#xD;
      focused ESWT according to the frequency difference. The purpose of the study is to examine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of focused type ESWT frequency in patients with myofascial pain&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
