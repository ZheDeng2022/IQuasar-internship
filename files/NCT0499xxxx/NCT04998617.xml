  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To investigate the short-term clinical effect of curcumin-containing toothpaste on&#xD;
      halitosis as compared to placebo and to assess potential shifts in the composition of dental&#xD;
      biofilm associated with the use of curcumin-containing toothpaste&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: This clinical study will 30 adult participants under prophylactic or&#xD;
      periodontal maintenance protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participants will be included and throughout the protocol will not&#xD;
      allow the use any other oral hygiene products except standard manual toothbrush and study&#xD;
      toothpaste (either test -curcumin-containing or placebo). Additionally participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to odiferous foods such as onions, garlic and spices. At each of the three&#xD;
      examination sessions, Plaque Index (six sites, O'Leary) and volatile sulphur compounds (VSC)&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;

    <measure>Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC) at day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC) values for all subjects will be recorded. F-tests will be used to compare the curcumin group with the placebo group at each timepoint. P-values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC).</description>

    <measure>Repeated Measures Regression of Volatile Sulphur Compounds (VSC)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>A repeated measures regression with VSC as the response and treatment (curcumin or negative control) and time (7, 14 or 21 days) as predictors. An autoregressive correlation matrix will be used to account for the correlation between repeated measures within subject.</description>
