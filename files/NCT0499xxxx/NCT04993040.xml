    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm PK study in approximately 24 breast cancer&#xD;
      patients for whom paclitaxel treatment is indicated. The study contains 3 periods: the&#xD;
      Screening / Baseline Period, the Treatment Period, and the Follow-up Period. A Final Visit&#xD;
      will occur within 7 days of the last dose of study treatment. If subjects achieve stable&#xD;
      disease (SD), partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) at the end of the Treatment&#xD;
      Period, they may continue Oraxol treatment in a separate extension study.&#xD;
