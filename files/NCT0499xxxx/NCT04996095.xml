&#xD;
      To enroll a total of 400 ESCC patients with different ages and stages according to the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria defined in section 5 and section 6.To perform NGS analysis of ESCC tumor&#xD;
      tissues, and correlated with the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of ESCC&#xD;
      patients.To compare the difference of the genetic and molecular profiles among different age&#xD;
      groups of ESCC patients.To reveal the evolution changes of genetic and molecular profiles of&#xD;
      ESCC by comparing the difference of genetic and molecular alterations between primary and&#xD;
      recurrent ESCC and between locally advanced and metastatic ESCC. 。 Study Method, Procedures,&#xD;
      and Implementation Status Sample size: 400 patients with ESCC who fit inclusion criteria and&#xD;

           profiles among different age groups&quot;, a minimum of 75 young ESCC patients (with age of&#xD;
           ESCC diagnosis at 20-45 years old) and a minimum of 75 elderly ESCC patients (with age&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a major histological subtype of esophageal&#xD;
      cancer in Asia including Taiwan, with distinct epidemiological, clinical, and pathological&#xD;
      features from esophageal adenocarcinoma which is commonly seen in Western countries. For&#xD;
      decades, esophageal cancer has ranked as one of top leading causes of cancer-related death in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Most ESCC patients are men, and present with locally advanced or metastatic disease&#xD;
      at diagnosis. Chemoradiotherapy and surgery are commonly employed in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced ESCC; however, more than half of them would eventually develop disease recurrence or&#xD;
      distant metastasis. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with recurrent and&#xD;
      metastatic ESCC; unfortunately, the efficacy of chemotherapy has been limited and&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Even anti-program cell death protein 1 (PD-1)- based immunotherapy has&#xD;
      recently become an important treatment modality for advanced ESCC, the prognosis of these&#xD;
      patients remains poor with a median survival time around a year. Therefore, a better&#xD;
      understanding of this deadly disease is crucial for finding better therapeutic strategies for&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trend of increasing incidence in young age (less than 45-years-old) has been observed in&#xD;
      Taiwan recently. This disease not only could devastate these young patients but also would&#xD;
      cause huge financial impact to their families. In one of our previous study focusing on the&#xD;
      prognosis of metastatic or recurrent ESCC patients treated with systemic chemotherapy, the&#xD;
      investigators found that elderly ESCC patients might have better prognosis than young&#xD;
      patients. Additionally, the preliminary data of our recent works suggest that the genetic&#xD;
      alterations of ESCC in patients of different age groups might be distinct. However, whether&#xD;
      the genetic alterations are significantly different among ESCC patients of different age&#xD;
      groups and whether the differences exhibit any prognostic or predictive impact have not yet&#xD;
      been systematically investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators thus proposed this multi-center research project to address the&#xD;
      fore-mentioned questions by collecting tumor tissues from ESCC patients for next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing analysis with a panel of cancer-related genes, and creating a platform for data&#xD;
      storage and sharing. The specific aims of this project are (1) to establish the tumor genetic&#xD;
      and molecular profiles of ESCC in Taiwan, (2) to compare the difference of the genetic and&#xD;
      molecular profiles among different age groups of ESCC patients, and (3) to reveal the&#xD;
      evolution changes of genetic and molecular profiles of ESCC. The long-term goals of this&#xD;
      study are to help implement personalized therapy, to develop novel therapy, and to improve&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with ESCC.&#xD;
