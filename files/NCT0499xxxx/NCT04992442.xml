  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine absolute bioavailability (ABA) of TAK-935 (F)&#xD;
      following a single microdose intravenous (IV) administration of 50 microgram (μg)&#xD;
      (approximately 1 microcurie [μCi]) [14C]TAK-935 and a single oral administration of 3×100 mg&#xD;
      milligram (mg) TAK-935 tablets in Treatment Period 1, and to assess the mass balance,&#xD;
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of TAK-935 and metabolite [M-I (N-oxide)] in plasma&#xD;
      and urine, and total radioactivity concentration equivalents in plasma and whole blood&#xD;
      following a single oral administration of 300 mg (approximately 100 μCi) [14C]TAK-935 in&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-935 (also known as soticlestat/OV935). The&#xD;
      study determines ABA in Treatment Period 1, and the absorption, metabolism, excretion, and&#xD;
      mass balance of TAK-935 after single oral administration in Treatment Period 2 in healthy&#xD;
      adult male participants, by collecting plasma, urine, and feces samples for drug&#xD;
      concentration analysis, and plasma, whole blood, urine, and fecal samples for total&#xD;
      radioactivity analysis and metabolic profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 6 healthy adult male participants. The study is designed&#xD;
      to consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period 1 (ABA Study Period) and Treatment Period 2&#xD;
      (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Elimination [ADME] Study Period). In Treatment&#xD;
      Period 1, all participants will receive a single unlabelled oral dose of TAK-935 as 3×100 mg&#xD;
      tablets and a microdose IV infusion of 50 μg (approximately 1 μCi) [14C]TAK-935, followed by&#xD;
      a Washout Period of 7 days before the dose in Treatment Period 2. In Treatment Period 2, all&#xD;
      participants will receive a single dose of 300 mg (approximately 100 μCi) [14C]TAK-935 as an&#xD;
      oral solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to&#xD;
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including Screening Period. Participants&#xD;
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment. This compound was transferred to Takeda and acquired on 29 March 2021. This&#xD;
      registration is retrospective due to the transfer of ownership.&#xD;

    <description>Bioavailability is defined as the proportion of a drug which enters the circulation when introduced into the body and so is able to have an active effect. Percent absolute bioavailability, calculated for plasma TAK-935 as [Actual Dose (IV) x Area Under the Concentration-time Curve from Time 0 to Infinity {AUCinf} (oral)] / [Actual Dose (oral) x AUCinf (IV)] x 100.</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE that is starting or worsening at the time of or after study drug administration.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (example, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A TEAE is defined as an AE that is starting or worsening at the time of or after study drug administration.</description>
