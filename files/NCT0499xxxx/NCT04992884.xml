    <description>Gastric Alimetry is a medical device intended to record, store, view and process gastric myoelectrical activity as an aid in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal motility disorders. The device is indicated for use during the diagnostic work-up of patients reporting gastric symptoms, who are suspected of having an underlying gastric motility problem.</description>
