  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticotomy and micro-osteoperforation (MOP) have been proven to accelerate tooth movement&#xD;
      and shorten orthodontic treatment time, compared to conventional treatment. MOP is less&#xD;
      invasive; however, it is unclear whether it is as effective as a corticotomy. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the maxillary canine retraction achieved by these techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirteen patients (5 females, 8 males; mean age, 18.07±6.74 years) with healthy permanent&#xD;
      dentition requiring the extraction of maxillary first premolars were included in a&#xD;
      split-mouth randomized clinical trial. Subjects with previous orthodontic or endodontic&#xD;
      treatment of canines were excluded. At least 3 months post-extraction, MOPs, and&#xD;
      corticotomies were performed distal to the canines. Mini-screws with closed-coil springs&#xD;
      (150g) were used for canine retraction. Dental casts were attained at baseline (T0) and 3&#xD;
      months post-intervention (T1). Calibrated examiners measured the distances from the canine to&#xD;
      the second premolar on both sides. A Signed-rank sum test was used to compare canine&#xD;
      retraction achieved in 3 months (T0-T1) in two sides&#xD;

    <description>A full-thickness labial mucoperiosteal flap was reflected.&#xD;
Two vertical corticotomies (1 mesial and 1 distal to the canine) were performed . The cortical bone was cut 2 to 3 mm below the alveolar crest towards the apex until bone marrow was exposed.&#xD;
Cortical-cancellous bone grafts (0.5cc; PuraGraft, Kingwood, TX) were placed at the corticotomy sites.&#xD;
The mini-screws were placed.&#xD;
A nickel-titanium (NiTi) closed-coil spring was placed and secured with a 0.014&quot;SS ligature wire at the canine and mini-screw. A Dontrix gauge (Orthopli Corp., Philadelphia, PA) was used to measure the force (150g).</description>

Six perforations were made along 2 parallel vertical lines (each line with 3 holes spaced ~2mm apart) distal to the canine and perpendicular to the buccal cortical bone.&#xD;
