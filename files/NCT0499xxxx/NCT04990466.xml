  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IIBR-100 (VSV-ΔG) is a self-propagating live virus vaccine that contains the spike protein of&#xD;
      the Wuhan wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. Preclinical and phase 1/2 trials have demonstrated no&#xD;
      safety signals of concern and have further demonstrated immunologic response that&#xD;
      approximates the response seen in convalescent individuals. The purpose of this phase 2b/3&#xD;
      trial is to document the non-inferiority of IIBR-100 vs. an already-approved vaccine for&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

      STUDY RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the deadliest in 100&#xD;
      years. The pandemic emerged from Wuhan Province in China in December 2019 and was declared by&#xD;
      the WHO Director-General a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January&#xD;
      2020. Early cases have been reported in Israel around February 2020, and at the time this&#xD;
      protocol is being drafted. The virus has spread to 190 countries with more than 198 million&#xD;
      confirmed cases and more than 4.2 million confirmed deaths as of August 2, 2021 (WHO website&#xD;
      https://covid19.who.int/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to curb the pandemic, the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR) has&#xD;
      developed a replication-competent recombinant VSVΔG-spike vaccine (rVSV-SARS-CoV-2-S,&#xD;
      IIBR-100), in which the glycoprotein of VSV is replaced by the spike protein of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. Pre-clinical data suggested IIBR-100 as a safe, efficacious, and protective&#xD;
      vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, clinical experience from over 20,000&#xD;
      subjects vaccinated with Ervebo®, an Ebola vaccine developed by Merck &amp; Co. and licensed by&#xD;
      FDA in 2019, also supports the safety of the VSV-ΔG backbone. An overlapping Phase I/II study&#xD;
      in Israel is showing a good safety profile. This study is intended to support late-stage&#xD;
      clinical studies and eventual mass immunization of the Georgian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase IIb/3, prospective, randomized, comparator-controlled, observer-blind,&#xD;
      multi-center non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive two intramuscular (IM) injections of the IIBR-100 (prime-boost)&#xD;
      separated by 28 days consisted of 1 ml replicating viral rVSV SARS-CoV-2-S vaccine or active&#xD;
      comparator. Injection will be performed at Day 0 and Day 28±2d in the deltoid muscle and will&#xD;
      be followed through 12 months post last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up (FU) visits will occur 1, 2 and 4 weeks, as well as, 2 ,3, 6, 9, and 12 months post&#xD;
      last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be PCR+ infection with COVID-19 six months after vaccination. Key&#xD;
      secondary outcome will be serologic immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactogenicity will be assessed at these visits, and blood will be drawn for immunogenicity&#xD;
      assays. Additional safety and reactogenicity data will be solicited via electronic diary and&#xD;
      telephone calls to subjects performed 1 and 2 days post each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reactogenicity will be measured by the occurrence of solicited injection site reaction and&#xD;
      systemic reaction from the time of each vaccination through 7 days post each vaccination.&#xD;
      Unsolicited non-serious Adverse Events (AEs), Serious adverse events (SAEs), new-onset&#xD;
      chronic medical conditions (NOCMCs) and medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) will be&#xD;
      collected through 12 months after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical safety laboratory evaluations will be performed at screening, as well as immediately&#xD;
      prior to and 7 days post each vaccination.&#xD;
