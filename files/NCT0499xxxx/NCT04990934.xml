  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Explosive growth in the use of telemedicine (video or telephone visits) has followed the&#xD;
      onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in order to meet healthcare needs&#xD;
      while avoiding unnecessary exposure risks in ambulatory care spaces. Accordingly, in March&#xD;
      2020, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services expanded reimbursement for telemedicine&#xD;
      visits to equal that of in-person services. The policy and infrastructure that enabled this&#xD;
      emergency transition is laying the groundwork for enduring expansion of elective&#xD;
      telemedicine, a technology that could significantly decrease the burden of medical care in&#xD;
      older patients with cancer. To benefit from telehealth, patients must have a certain level of&#xD;
      knowledge and capacity to engage with technology, which can be a challenge for some older&#xD;
      adults because of inexperience, access, and disability. As cancer is mainly a disease of&#xD;
      older adults, with a median age of 65 at diagnosis for most cancer types, this is a&#xD;
      significant limitation on the utility of telemedicine in oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our study is to better understand older breast cancer patients' experiences with&#xD;
      telephone and video telemedicine with regard to visit convenience, completeness, and&#xD;
      interpersonal satisfaction through semi-structured interviews with patients.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 participants will be consented in this study. 20 will have participated in video&#xD;
      telemedicine appointments with their treating breast cancer oncologists, and 10 will have&#xD;
      used telephone. Semi-structured interviews lasting no more than 30 minutes will be conducted&#xD;
      to ascertain the participant's (1) reason for choosing a certain telemedicine modality, (2)&#xD;
      perception of telemedicine visit convenience, completeness, and interpersonal satisfaction&#xD;
      compared to in-person visits, and (3) use of peripheral virtual support from healthcare team,&#xD;
      such as messaging in MyChart. After the interview has been conducted, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked complete the patient-reported portion of the Geriatric Assessment (GA) either through&#xD;
      an internet link, or verbally with the research staff reading the questions and recording the&#xD;
      answers. Data pertaining to the participant's breast cancer diagnosis and treatment will be&#xD;
      extracted from Epic@UNC.&#xD;
