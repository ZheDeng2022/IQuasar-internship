  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit (ICU) staff are frequently exposed to traumatic events at work (e.g.,&#xD;
      witnessing patients die), amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant proportion&#xD;
      experience intrusive memories of these events that pop suddenly into mind: these&#xD;
      imagery-based memories can disrupt functioning and contribute to posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder. Previous research has shown that a brief behavioural intervention can reduce the&#xD;
      number of intrusive memories after a traumatic event. In this study we aim to optimise a&#xD;
      brief digital intervention to help reduce the number of intrusive memories experienced by ICU&#xD;
      staff (primary outcome). We will explore if it can improve work functioning and wellbeing&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes). We will recruit approximately 150 ICU staff with intrusive memories of&#xD;
      events experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by the Wellcome Trust (223016/Z/21/Z).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A statistical analysis plan will be prepared prior to the first interim analysis for the&#xD;
      outcomes that will guide study optimisation, i.e., primarily the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular monitoring will be performed by P1vital Products to verify that the study is&#xD;
      conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance with the protocol,&#xD;
      GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance representatives from the Sponsor may carry out an audit of the study in&#xD;
      compliance with regulatory guidelines and relevant standard operating procedures.&#xD;
