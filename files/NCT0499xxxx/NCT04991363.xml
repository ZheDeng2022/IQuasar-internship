  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial aimed to evaluate the effect of Image Standardization Device&#xD;
      (ISD) on standardization of clinical images from the same entry point (patient right 45o).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital photography is highly important on multiple levels and has become associated with&#xD;
      modern dentistry. Its application in dental practice is simple, quick, and extremely useful&#xD;
      for procedures documentation, patient education, and conducting clinical research, resulting&#xD;
      in several benefits for dentists in the terms of examination, diagnosis, treatment planning,&#xD;
      progress and monitoring treatment outcomes. On the other hand, digital photography becomes&#xD;
      significant tool for patient reassurance as showing before and after photos of several&#xD;
      procedures helps in patient relaxation and understanding from the start, as well as improves&#xD;
      the patient-dentist trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the terms of producing decent digital dental photographs, standardization in several&#xD;
      aspects of the photographic equipment, environment, and patient position become a critical&#xD;
      issue for successful reproducible photographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different standardization methods have been mentioned in the literature, some of them&#xD;
      discussed the standardization characteristics in the terms of camera settings and adjustment&#xD;
      using tripod only with standardized camera/patient distance, lighting, and background color.&#xD;
      Other studies discussed standardization from a different point of view regarding the&#xD;
      standardized patient head position and fixed camera/ patient distance using various devices&#xD;
      slightly resembles the ISD used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology of the current study included a total of twenty patients, photographed with&#xD;
      ISD taking duplicate photographs and using individualized photography as a control group via&#xD;
      conventional Tripod from the same photography point at 45ยบ from the patient's right side to&#xD;
      study the effect of the image standardization device in photograph standardization over&#xD;
      conventional imaging methods. The Intervention used in this study was bleaching that was done&#xD;
      before taking the same photographs once again from the same projections to reproduce the same&#xD;
      images using both methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment was done by measuring in millimeters the horizontal and vertical measurements&#xD;
      of the canine in each patient by using a ruler tool on digital software and comparing them&#xD;
      with the reference standard which was the canine's real measurements.&#xD;

    <description>Digital images for each patient will be taken once with the camera fixed on the classic tripod and again when the camera was fixed on the ISD , then horizontal and vertical measurements of the canines will be recorded by using a computer software on the digital images, then bleaching will be fine for all patients, then a second set of images will be taken again with the tripod and then with ISD, then measurements will be repeated and compared with the first set of images</description>
