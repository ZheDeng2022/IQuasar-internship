  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly&#xD;
      impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed&#xD;
      to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, the research community lack evidence about which&#xD;
      symptoms for which patients are likely to improve. Ablations themselves may cause&#xD;
      complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged&#xD;
      practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the&#xD;
      patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms&#xD;
      due to a lack of rigorous evidence about potential outcomes and the decision aids necessary&#xD;
      to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, the investigators propose to use&#xD;
      &quot;real-world evidence&quot; drawn from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize&#xD;
      post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support&#xD;
      SDM. In this project, the investigators will first use natural language processing (NLP) and&#xD;
      machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. The&#xD;
      investigators will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator's post-doctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the&#xD;
      clinical trial, the investigators will evaluate the feasibility of implementing these&#xD;
      interactive decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice. The specific aim of the&#xD;
      clinical trial is to evaluate the feasibility of putting the visualizations into clinical&#xD;
      practice (n=75). The hypothesis is that patients will report low decisional conflict and&#xD;
      decision regret and high satisfaction with their decision about whether to undergo an&#xD;
      ablation or not.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-group feasibility study evaluating decision aid visualizations which&#xD;
      display common post-ablation symptom patterns as a tool for shared decision-making. The study&#xD;
      design and sample size align with a recent feasibility study of a shared decision-making&#xD;
      intervention focused on anticoagulant selection in AF. The primary outcomes of the study are&#xD;
      decisional conflict, satisfaction, and regret. Secondary outcomes include health-related&#xD;
      quality of life and reduction of symptoms. The investigators will measure symptoms both by&#xD;
      patient report via mobile health application and by provider report via electronic health&#xD;
      record. First, the investigators will recruit and enroll patients (n=75) who are scheduled&#xD;
      for a consultation with an electrophysiology (EP) practice at NYP about undergoing ablation&#xD;
      for atrial fibrillation. The investigators will screen eligible patients ahead of the&#xD;
      scheduled consultation visit using electronic health records. Pending permissions from EP&#xD;
      practice providers and IRB approval, the investigators will contact them prior to the visit&#xD;
      to gauge interest, and ask them to arrive one hour early if interested. They will obtain&#xD;
      informed consent upon arrival at the visit. Patients will first be screened for severe&#xD;
      cognitive impairment prior to providing written informed consent. They will collect the&#xD;
      following baseline surveys: demographics (including socioeconomic status), health literacy,&#xD;
      subjective numeracy, graph Literacy, patient preferences for participation (Control&#xD;
      Preference Scale), decision conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale), Medical Communication&#xD;
      Competence Scale-Patient version, and Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT)&#xD;
      scale. Patients will also complete a baseline survey of their current symptoms using&#xD;
      validated symptom scales (Canadian Cardiovascular Society-Severity of Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      Symptoms scale, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales). All&#xD;
      surveys will be collected using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure web&#xD;
      application for building and managing online surveys and databases. The investigators will&#xD;
      introduce the decision aid visualizations after consultation with clinical staff at the EP&#xD;
      practice. After completing the clinical visits, participants will be invited to a private,&#xD;
      quiet space in the practice to view the interactive decision aid visualizations displaying&#xD;
      expected symptom patterns after ablation based on the patient's personal characteristics. The&#xD;
      exact characteristics used to tailor visualizations will be determined during previous&#xD;
      symptom pattern analyses. For example, if cluster analyses determine that symptom patterns&#xD;
      differ by age group, the investigators will creating tailoring within symptom visualizations&#xD;
      based on the patient's age group. Interactive visualizations will be developed in a secure&#xD;
      web application and displayed on a tablet. Patients will be allowed to view and discuss&#xD;
      decision aid visualizations for as long as they would like. Then, they will be equipped with&#xD;
      the KardiaÂ® device, which records highly-accurate, single-lead ECGs and transmits to&#xD;
      healthcare providers. The investigators will develop a thorough clinical protocol for&#xD;
      monitoring and responding to potentially dangerous ECG strips that are transmitted through&#xD;
      Kardia when the R00 application is finalized in Year 2 of the study. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete the same validated symptom scales that they initially completed at baseline during&#xD;
      the follow-up period using a mobile application developed by our team, &quot;mi.Symptoms.&quot; This&#xD;
      mobile application also runs through the REDCap infrastructure. They will be asked to&#xD;
      self-monitor symptoms once per week using mi.Symptoms, and self-monitor heart rate and rhythm&#xD;
      4-7 times per week using Kardia. They will be asked to self-monitor for 12 weeks. After 12&#xD;
      weeks, participants will complete follow-up surveys using REDCap: Satisfaction with Decision&#xD;
      Scale, Decision Regret Scale, and AFEQT questionnaire. They will also be invited to&#xD;
      participate in exit interviews (30-60 minutes) to discuss their experiences. Interviews will&#xD;
      be guided by the following constructs from the widely-used implementation science framework&#xD;
      &quot;RE-AIM&quot;: reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Interviews will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. All materials will be kept in a locked cabinet or&#xD;
      stored on an encrypted hard drive in my locked office at WCM. Quantitative data will first be&#xD;
      assessed using standard, descriptive statistics. In addition to evaluating decision&#xD;
      satisfaction and regret 12 weeks after initial ablation consultation, the investigators will&#xD;
      evaluate changes in symptoms over time, using multiple growth models with random effects&#xD;
      among intercepts and slopes, and identify clusters of symptom patterns using latent classes&#xD;
      analysis. They will evaluate concordance between symptoms and heart rhythm to better&#xD;
      understand associations between specific symptoms, or lack thereof, and heart rhythm, which&#xD;
      is poorly understood in the literature currently. They will also evaluate decisional conflict&#xD;
      and health-related quality of life (AFEQT) pre- and post-decision aid. Qualitative data will&#xD;
      be analyzed using a general inductive approach. They will use the collected quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data to complete an implementation analysis of predisposing, enabling, and&#xD;
      reinforcing factors of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice&#xD;
      using RE-AIM. Finally, they will take advantage of patient-reported (mHealth) and&#xD;
      provider-reported (i.e., EHR) symptoms collected simultaneously in this study to measure&#xD;
      agreement between the two sources. The investigators will seek to identify whether&#xD;
      differential EHR documentation patterns exist for underserved patient groups, which may be&#xD;
      associated with disparities in symptom management.&#xD;
