      Main aim of this study will be the evaluation of the neurophysiological techniques of&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) via electroencephalography (EEG) co-registration&#xD;
      (TMS-EEG) with the study of TEPs (TEP: transcranial evoked potentials) as surrogates of white&#xD;
      matter and grey matter functional integrity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Data&#xD;
      will be compared with those obtained from a group of healthy control subjects. Secondary aim&#xD;
      will be the longitudinal evaluation of these neurophysiological parameters in MS patients&#xD;
      during routine clinical and radiological evaluations, performed according to clinical&#xD;
      practice, for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this aim a longitudinal multicenter study will be carried out, interventional (for&#xD;
      neurophysiological techniques) and observational (for clinical and radiological evaluations),&#xD;
      which involves the enrollment of 64 patients diagnosed with MS. Patients will keep their&#xD;
      usual therapeutic regimen and their usual clinical-radiological checks according to clinical&#xD;
      practice. The control group will consist of 64 healthy subjects, enrolled with prior written&#xD;
      informed consent, age and sex-matched with MS patients and selected among the caregivers of&#xD;
      the patients. Healthy subjects will only undergo neurophysiological assessment at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurophysiological evaluation will include the study of the propagation of potentials&#xD;
      induced by stimulation. This method allows the study of cortical responses in terms of time&#xD;
      domain and frequency, obtaining a measurement of interhemispheric connectivity and of&#xD;
      microstructural and functional integrity of white matter. In the same way, these methods&#xD;
      allow the assessment of grey matter integrity through the study of intracortical&#xD;
      excitability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) whose&#xD;
      pathogenesis involved both demyelinating events and neurodegeneration. It is on of the most&#xD;
      frequent cause of disability in young adults. It is characterized by different clinical&#xD;
      phenotypes: currently, the relapsing-remitting form (RR), the most common, and the&#xD;
      progressive forms of MS (primary progressive -PP, secondary progressive -SP) are recognized.&#xD;
      The relapsing-remitting form is characterized by the presence of acute/subacute onset of&#xD;
      clinical events, the appearance of new lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or the&#xD;
      uptake of gadolinium by a new or pre-existing lesion. The progressive forms, on the other&#xD;
      hand, present with a slow accumulation of disability from the onset (PP-MS), or following a&#xD;
      relapsing-remitting trend (SP-MS). The clinical scale mainly used for evaluating patients&#xD;
      with MS is the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Currently, there are several&#xD;
      treatments available for the control of the disease and the identification of the correct&#xD;
      therapeutic choice can lead to an important slowdown, up to stabilization, of the clinical&#xD;
      course of the disease. It is therefore essential, given the existence of different&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies, to recognize early those patients who respond in a sub-optimal manner&#xD;
      to therapy. To date, the evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment is based on&#xD;
      clinical and radiological data. Several studies have tried to identify new markers of&#xD;
      disability, but none of these have entered the routine clinical use. In this context, the&#xD;
      possible role of neurophysiology in early identify markers of inflammatory/ degenerative&#xD;
      disease activity is outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the neurophysiological methods potentially able to identify the inflammatory or&#xD;
      neurodegenerative phase of the disease, the most promising results were obtained with&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). These methods,&#xD;
      already widely used in the clinical setting, are characterized by being reproducible,&#xD;
      non-invasive and low-cost. Thanks to the development of EEG systems compatible with magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation, it is possible to study the cortical potentials evoked by TMS (TEPs). The TEPs&#xD;
      constitute a sensitive and reproducible experimental index of intracortical excitability and&#xD;
      allow the identification of specific alterations of different neurological conditions. The&#xD;
      study of TEPs offers a better performance than that obtainable using the single techniques,&#xD;
      TMS and EEG, separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological estimates of white matter integrity Several evidence have confirmed that&#xD;
      the EEG indices of functional connectivity are influenced by the degree of myelination of the&#xD;
      white matter. Among these indices of EEG connectivity, cortico-cortical coherence is a linear&#xD;
      correlation index between the oscillatory signal of two cortical areas and has been shown to&#xD;
      be a sensitive index of the myelination state of the brain in physiological conditions and in&#xD;
      various neurological pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distinct EEG oscillations in the different frequency bands revealed many robust relationships&#xD;
      to behavioral, cognitive, and clinical states in several studies. Spatial-temporal&#xD;
      oscillatory dynamic patterns recorded by EEG are important brain state-dependent measures of&#xD;
      neocortical dynamics, including functional connectivity. Myelin is critical for sustaining&#xD;
      oscillatory neural activity and entrainment between &quot;generators&quot; (e.g., cell assemblies or&#xD;
      networks at multiple scales) in brain regions separated by substantial conduction delays.&#xD;
      Functional connectivity as assessed by scalp EEG at large scales is believed to be strongly&#xD;
      influenced by white matter tracts, especially the cortico-cortical projections. The standard&#xD;
      Fourier transform-based multi-channel signal measure coherence is a squared correlation&#xD;
      coefficient expressed as a function of frequency; it can provide robust measures of cognitive&#xD;
      state and white matter (WM) maturation or disease. WM integrity determines propagation delays&#xD;
      (i.e. the timing) of synaptic inputs in a determined brain network thus allowing phase&#xD;
      synchrony of local oscillations. Relatively small changes in conduction delays can have&#xD;
      significant effects on oscillatory coupling and phase synchrony between distant brain&#xD;
      regions. Disruption in brain synchronization contributes to dysfunction in many neurological&#xD;
      and psychiatric disorders. Compared to scalp EEG, high-resolution EEG (HR-EEG) methods employ&#xD;
      computer algorithms (e.g., Laplacian or dura image) to provide estimates of brain or dural&#xD;
      surface potentials at roughly the 2-3 cm scale. HR-EEG functional connectivity measures, like&#xD;
      narrow band (e.g., 1 Hz) alpha and theta coherence, has been linked to cortico-cortical&#xD;
      signal propagation via (mostly) myelinated axons. The propagation time between hemispheres is&#xD;
      about 30 ms through myelinated callosal fibers and 150-300ms through unmyelinated fibers. An&#xD;
      investigation of scalp-registered inter-hemispheric coherence between the left and right&#xD;
      sensorimotor hand areas using HR-EEG revealed a superposition of both bilaterally coherent&#xD;
      and incoherent rhythmic activities within the alpha band. Synaptic integration can be&#xD;
      expected to be strongly influenced by the degree of myelination of intercallosal axons.&#xD;
      Combined EEG and HR-EEG can provide complementary functional connectivity estimates that are&#xD;
      maximally sensitive to large/global (~5-10 cm) and intermediate/local {-2-3 cm) spatial scale&#xD;
      source regions, respectively. White matter integrity is important for cortico-cortical&#xD;
      connections and is critical to these functional connectivity estimates, especially scalp&#xD;
      oscillatory coupling and distant sources phase coherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain-stimulation technique. By&#xD;
      producing high-intensity magnetic pulse, TMS induces brief electric currents that can excite&#xD;
      or inhibit a small area of the cerebral cortex. This activating property is classically used&#xD;
      on the primary motor cortex (M1) to produce action potentials along the cortico-spinal bundle&#xD;
      and evoke a motor potential (MEP, motor evoked potential) in the contralateral musculature.&#xD;
      In MS patients, EEG and TMS are widely used as diagnostic tools to prove demyelination by&#xD;
      means of abnormal conduction time along white matter tracts, even in subjects with normal MRI&#xD;
      scans. Furthermore, when the magnetic stimulus is delivered during voluntary muscle&#xD;
      contraction of the stimulation target muscle, the TMS of M1 can generate a brief interruption&#xD;
      of voluntary electromyography (EMG) activity both contralateral (CSP: contralateral silent&#xD;
      period) and ipsilateral (the &quot; ipsilateral silent period&quot; -IpSP). lpSP is a measure of&#xD;
      interhemispheric motor inhibition that has been found to be altered in patient with MS and&#xD;
      callosal lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to the separate recording of the EEG signals and those generated by the TMS, the&#xD;
      simultaneous execution of the two methods - TMS-EEG - allows the recording directly from the&#xD;
      scalp of the potentials (TEP) evoked by the TMS. The recording of TEPs from areas distant&#xD;
      from the stimulation site allows to obtain information about the connectivity of the&#xD;
      stimulated cortex. The &quot;interhemispheric signal propagation&quot; (ISP) is a measure of&#xD;
      interhemispheric connectivity based on the propagation of TMS-EEG responses from the&#xD;
      stimulated hemisphere to the contralateral. The ISP correlates with the microstructural&#xD;
      integrity of the callosal microfibers and with the hand dexterity during motor development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological estimates of grey matter Integrity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding gray matter (GM) pathology, evidences obtained from TMS and EEG studies have&#xD;
      contributed to unveil the role of cortical dysfunction in MS. Alterations in EEG oscillations&#xD;
      considered important in sensorimotor integration and motor control have been associated with&#xD;
      clinical disorders and radiological changes in patients with MS. Furthermore, paired-pulse&#xD;
      TMS protocols have shown alterations in M1 excitability in MS patients and that these&#xD;
      alterations correlate with clinical disability. Among the measures of TMS-EEG, the locally&#xD;
      recorded TEPs reflect the excitability and activation state of the stimulated cortex and&#xD;
      therefore the degree of integrity of the cortical gray matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, EEG and TMS-EEG measures are powerful tools to assess WM and GM functional&#xD;
      integrity in patients with MS. As such, EEG and TMS-EEG also provide a potential objective&#xD;
      framework to systematically assess the efficacy of Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aims and hypotheses Main aim of this study is the evaluation of TMS-EEG&#xD;
      neurophysiological measures as surrogates of functional integrity of both gray and white&#xD;
      matter in MS patients. The data obtained will be compared with those of a group of healthy&#xD;
      subjects comparable for sex and age. Healthy subjects will be identified as those with normal&#xD;
      neurological examination and negative medical history for morbidity. By combining the&#xD;
      neurophysiological variables with the clinical ones, an attempt will be made to identify&#xD;
      neurophysiological markers expressing the degree of disability of patients with MS (primary&#xD;
      objective). The secondary objective is to identify the neurophysiological variables that may&#xD;
      play a predictive role in the clinical or radiological relapses of the pathology and of the&#xD;
      long-term clinical-radiological status. To this aim, the neurophysiological TMS-EEG&#xD;
      measurements will be repeated longitudinally in the patients participating in the study and&#xD;
      correlated with the clinical and radiological according to clinical practice. The&#xD;
      neurophysiological markers identified may offer support in identifying patients in clinical&#xD;
      deterioration or with a sub-optimal response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment: To guarantee an adequate number of study participants and obtain data that are&#xD;
      more traceable to real-life conditions, the investigators will collaborate in recruiting with&#xD;
      other MS Centers (list with the relevant Managers attached). All neurophysiological&#xD;
      evaluations will be performed at our Department and our Center will be the coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of the neurophysiological evaluation The selected neurophysiological methods are&#xD;
      non-invasive procedures, widely used and based on tools currently in use in clinical&#xD;
      practice. These methods are painless and therefore easily implemented in a large population&#xD;
      of subjects as they are safe and free of side effects.&#xD;

    <description>EMG will be recorded from the Abductor pollicis brevis muscle (APB) with surface electrodes. EEG will be recorded with a 32-channel elastic cap via a TMS compatible system. TMS will be performed using a Magstim 200 stimulator with a 90 mm figure-of-eight coil localized on motor and non-motor areas using a neuronavigation system together with an optical tracking system. Coordinates for neuronavigation will be calculated in the MNI space and fit of each participant's anatomical MRI. Three minutes of continuous-EEG will be recorded with subjects at rest. Single-pulse neuronavigated TMS (sp-TMS) will be delivered at rest below the resting motor threshold intensity (RMT) over the APB hotspot on M1 during concurrent EEG recording. In a final block, the subject will maintain a voluntary muscle contraction (50% of the maximal voluntary contraction) of the left APB, and sp-TMS will be delivered at 130% RMT over the ipsilateral APB hotspot in order to record the lpSP.</description>
