  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infective endocarditis (IE) is a severe condition associated with high mortality. Due to the&#xD;
      relative low prevalence of IE, prospective data are lacking and current guidelines are mostly&#xD;
      based on expert consensus with low level of evidence. IE is also associated with severe&#xD;
      complications especially strokes that occur in about one third of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve the management and the prognosis of IE, clinical data from larges&#xD;
      prospective cohort studies are needed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will take place at the Cardiology institute of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital. All&#xD;
      patients referred to this tertiary care center for IE management will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The characteristics of the patients (demographics, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data) at&#xD;
      the time of IE diagnosis and during the follow-up will be collected. The patients will be&#xD;
      followed up to 10 years after inclusion.&#xD;
