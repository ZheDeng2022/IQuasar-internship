    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is a critical intervention for newborn babies. Laryngoscopy is the&#xD;
      crucial part of endotracheal intubation. Traditionally, operators use a standard laryngoscope&#xD;
      to view the larynx by looking directly into the mouth (direct laryngoscopy). More recently&#xD;
      videolaryngoscopes that have a video camera mounted at the tip of the laryngoscope blade have&#xD;
      been developed, Rather than look directly into the mouth, the operator looks at a screen that&#xD;
      displays the view acquired by the camera (indirect laryngosocpy). Videolaryngoscopes have&#xD;
      been demonstrated to be useful for teaching trainees direct laryngoscopy. However, it may be&#xD;
      that all clinicians are more successful with videolaryngoscope. We will compare whether&#xD;
      clinicians who are randomly assigned to intubate newborn infants using a videolaryngoscope&#xD;
      are more successful in intubating newborn infants at the first attempt compared to clinicians&#xD;
      who are randomly assigned to intubate newborn infants using a standard laryngoscope.&#xD;

      Endotracheal intubation is a critical intervention for newborn babies. Proficiency at&#xD;
      intubation has declined markedly in recent decades such that fewer than half of babies are&#xD;
      successfully intubated at the first attempt. Laryngoscopy is the crucial part of endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Traditionally, operators use a standard laryngoscope to view the larynx by&#xD;
      looking directly into the mouth (direct laryngoscopy). More recently videolaryngoscopes that&#xD;
      have a video camera mounted at the tip of the laryngoscope blade have been developed, Rather&#xD;
      than look directly into the mouth, the operator looks at a screen that displays the view&#xD;
      acquired by the camera (indirect laryngosocpy). Videolaryngoscopes have been demonstrated to&#xD;
      be useful for teaching trainees direct laryngoscopy, i.e. a senior colleague can coach them&#xD;
      during the procedure. However, it may be that all clinicians are more successful with&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope. We will compare whether clinicians who are randomly assigned to intubate&#xD;
      newborn infants using a videolaryngoscope are more successful in intubating newborn infants&#xD;
      at the first attempt compared to clinicians who are randomly assigned to intubate newborn&#xD;
      infants using a standard laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study newborn infants who are undergoing intubation at the discretion of their&#xD;
      treating clinicians in delivery room or in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).Term and&#xD;
      preterm infants of any gender will be eligible to participate. babies with upper airway&#xD;
      anomalies will be ineligible. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      &quot;VIDEO&quot; or &quot;&quot;STANDARD&quot; group. Intubation success will be determined in both groups using an&#xD;
      exhaled carbon dioxide detector or flow sensor. Caregivers and outcome assessors will not be&#xD;
      masked to group assignment. We will study 214 babies.&#xD;
