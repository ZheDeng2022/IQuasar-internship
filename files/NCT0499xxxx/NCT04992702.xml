  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a brief web-based educational&#xD;
      intervention on improving Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury prevention comprehension&#xD;
      and implementation feasibility among coaches of athletes participating in landing and cutting&#xD;
      sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, football, etc.). The two main hypotheses are that, compared&#xD;
      to both an active and placebo control group, the brief animated video will produce greater&#xD;
      improvements in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall comprehension of ACL injury risk and mitigation: placebo control group &lt; active&#xD;
           control group &lt; intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Feasibility of utilizing ACL injury prevention strategies: placebo control group &lt;&#xD;
           active control group &lt; intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory hypothesis: The brief animated video will produce greater improvements in various&#xD;
      subcomponents of comprehension-specifically: basic ACL knowledge, risk knowledge, prevention&#xD;
      knowledge and severity knowledge compared to both active and placebo control group&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a computer-based, three-arm pre-post randomized control design trial.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized into an intervention group, active control group or passive&#xD;
      control group on a 1:1:1 ratio by a computer-generated algorithm embedded within the&#xD;
      Qualtrics software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). Sports coaches of youth and adolescent athletes in&#xD;
      various landing and cutting sports (e.g., soccer, basketball, volleyball, etc.) in the United&#xD;
      States were recruited and invited through Qualtrics' panelists. The intervention group was&#xD;
      shown a three-minute animated video consisting of various information components aimed at&#xD;
      improving capability, motivation and opportunity to implement ACL injury prevention&#xD;
      strategies. The active control group received commonly accessed information from a WebMD&#xD;
      web-based article on ACL injury prevention. The placebo control group intervention received&#xD;
      an educational video from the CDC about concussions that is comparable in duration to that of&#xD;
      the ACL video. Overall ACL comprehension-composed of basic ACL knowledge, risk knowledge,&#xD;
      prevention knowledge, and severity knowledge-as well as implementation feasibility were all&#xD;
      measured prior to and immediately following the interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Items that measure ACL knowledge were gathered from peer reviewed, published articles. The scale consisted of 15 multiple choice items that assessed individuals knowledge about diverse issues with ACL injury such as risk, prevention, and consequences of the injury.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average implementation feasibility measured by the feasibility of the intervention scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately following intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the intervention measure was used to assess the likelihood that the coach would successfully implement evidence-based prevention strategies. The 4 items consisted of the root phrase: &quot;An ACL injury prevention program seems&quot; followed by (1) implementable, (2) possible, (3) doable and (4) easy to use. The items were rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from completely disagree to completely agree. The average of the 4 items was used for the analysis.</description>
