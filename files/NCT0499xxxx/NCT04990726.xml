    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the immune related toxicity and symptom burden in chronic cancer&#xD;
      survivors with melanoma who are receiving adjuvant immunotherapy with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors. Information collected in this study may help doctors to learn more about the side&#xD;
      effects caused by immunotherapy, and to learn if there are any relationships between these&#xD;
      side effects and immune and genetic biomarkers found in the blood that may be related to&#xD;
      patient's reaction to immunotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the detailed clinical characterization including timing, severity, and phenotype&#xD;
      of immune related adverse events (irAEs) in chronic survivors with melanoma from initiation&#xD;
      of adjuvant checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) therapy through 24 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Longitudinally assess patients-reported outcomes (PROs) that measure symptom burden (such&#xD;
      as fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance) and quality of life (QOL) in those patients,&#xD;
      compared to patients with similar disease stage who opt for active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Longitudinally evaluate the correlation of changes in immune analysis (immune cells and&#xD;
      cytokines) in peripheral blood samples with timing, severity, and phenotype of irAEs, symptom&#xD;
      burden, and QOL in those patients, compared to patients with similar disease stage who opt&#xD;
      for active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine whether specific immune-related genetic polymorphisms are associated with the&#xD;
      development of irAEs and symptom burden in melanoma patients receiving adjuvant CPI therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo medical assessments and blood sample collection, and complete questionnaires&#xD;
      at baseline, 1 (optional), 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Will determine the detailed clinical characterization including timing, severity, and phenotype of immune related adverse events (irAEs) in chronic survivors with melanoma from initiation of adjuvant checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy through 24 months of follow-up. The primary end point will be at 12 months, but patients will be followed for up to 24 months. Will estimate the incidence rates of any de novo grade 2 or higher irAEs at 12 months post treatment initiation along with 95% confidence interval within the case group. Will also summary irAEs by their onset time in relation to treatment initiation (acute irAE vs late irAE) and by CPI type. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize results.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients-reported outcomes (PROs)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will compare PROs at 12 months between the case (with and without irAEs) and control groups. To compare differences between cases and controls, will use logistic regression to adjust for age, gender, ethnicity, tumor stage and type of CPI therapy. The primary outcome measures include quality of life, depression, and fatigue. Will compare each of the three primary outcomes at a significant level of 0.017 (0.05/3) using Bonferroni multiple comparison adjustment. Will use linear mixed effect models to fit the longitudinal PRO assessments to study the change of PROs over time taking the intra-patient correlation into account and to determine the effect of each of the covariates (relevant patient's demographic, irAEs, clinical and treatment characteristics) on the outcomes.</description>
