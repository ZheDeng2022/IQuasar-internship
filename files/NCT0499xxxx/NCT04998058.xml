      This study aims to evaluate bone formation in grafts in terms of its quality (density),&#xD;
      quantity (volume) and maturation obtained with the application of a tissue-engineered bone&#xD;
      grafting compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-culture medium (CM) and a synthetic&#xD;
      bone substitute. The present study was designed as an experimental prospective split-mouth&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical trial. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics&#xD;
      Committee, a total of 20 consecutive participants in need of maxillary reconstruction aiming&#xD;
      implant-supported oral rehabilitation will be invited to join the study. To collect&#xD;
      autogenous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), an outpatient lipoplasty&#xD;
      procedure at the abdominal area of each patient will be performed. To isolate and expand&#xD;
      hASCs from the lipoaspirate, specific cell culture protocols will be followed, resulting in&#xD;
      cultured viable cells and their conditioned medium (CM). Cells and CM will be then separated&#xD;
      by a sequence of filters and centrifugation, and isolated CM will be frozen. ELISA will&#xD;
      analyze the presence of chemokines and their concentration in CM before grafting. Following&#xD;
      pre-op surgical planning, both maxillary sinuses of each patient will be grafted internally&#xD;
      applying a lateral window to each sinus. The bony floor of the test maxillary sinus will be&#xD;
      augmented with synthetic bone substitute (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM&#xD;
      (test). The control site will receive bone substitute with saline. Lateral windows in both&#xD;
      sinuses will be then closed with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide™). After 6 months, first-stage&#xD;
      implant surgery will be performed placing 6 implants in each patient. Registration of implant&#xD;
      stability by manual torque wrench will be performed. Also, bone biopsies from each drilled&#xD;
      implant site will be collected for histology, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (RT-PCR). Tomographic evaluation of the bone formation will include cone beam computed&#xD;
      tomographies (CBCTs) at pre-operative [Baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2 = implant placement]&#xD;
      days for bone 3D image analysis.&#xD;

      1. Aims and Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based in previously reported studies and following a translational approach, a&#xD;
           hypothesis that the paracrine effect linked to cultured autogenous growth factors and&#xD;
           cytokines at physiologic concentrations acting locally in grafted sites might promote a&#xD;
           faster and/or more efficient cell response and consequently induce a more&#xD;
           significant/faster bone formation was considered. The presence of these molecules added&#xD;
           to synthetic bone substitutes might act positively in terms of local cell recruitment&#xD;
           (chemotaxis), proliferation, differentiation and bone protein synthesis. Also, recurrent&#xD;
           biological hazards involved in conventional tissue-engineered cellular graft compounds,&#xD;
           usually linked to the ex vivo manipulation of cells in terms of tumorigenicity,&#xD;
           immunogenicity and the previously reported cell dedifferentiation phenomenon would be&#xD;
           mitigated by the exclusion of the cell element of this process, as they are considered&#xD;
           by some reports to present unpredictable mitotic behavior once artificially cultured.&#xD;
           The present study aims to further extend this translational investigation following&#xD;
           preclinical studies by the principal investigator, proposing a prospective randomized&#xD;
           controlled clinical trial on the possible benefits associated with the application of a&#xD;
           tissue-engineered bone graft compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-cultured&#xD;
           medium (CM) and an hydroxylapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate-based synthetic bone&#xD;
           substitute (HP/β-TCP ceramic). Specific aims include analyses on the density of the&#xD;
           newly formed calcified tissue by computed tomography (CBCTs), expression of specific&#xD;
           immunohistochemical bone formation markers (RT-PCR) and histomorphometric bone quantity&#xD;
           evaluation. In a split-mouth study model, the resultant bone formation after HP/β-TCP&#xD;
           grafting with and without CM will be analyzed, compared and quantified at different time&#xD;
           points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1- Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was chosen as study design for&#xD;
      the present investigation. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee and&#xD;
      registration at the clinical trials.gov platform, following CONSORT guidelines, 20&#xD;
      consecutive patients who seek maxillary oral rehabilitation at the Department of Prosthetic&#xD;
      Dentistry of the School of Health and Life Sciences - PUCRS, Brazil, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the present investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 - Lipoplasty and human adipose stem cells (hASCs) harvesting/culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For hASCs harvesting, an abdominal lipoplasty procedure will be proposed and performed&#xD;
      following a signed informed consent. Under intravenous sedation and supplementary oxygen&#xD;
      release with an oral catheter, along with local anesthesia, a standard surgical lipoplasty&#xD;
      technique will be performed. As previously described, from this liposuction material, 25 to&#xD;
      30 ml of fat will be transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube. The fat will be then washed by&#xD;
      centrifugation (430Å~g 10 min), being the upper fat layer transferred into a new Falcon tube,&#xD;
      where an equal volume of collagenase solution will be added to the mixture and incubated at&#xD;
      37°C in a water bath. After centrifugation, the upper fat layer will be discarded and the&#xD;
      supernatant removed. The remaining cell pellet containing the hASCs will be resuspended with&#xD;
      15 ml of culture medium. After adding 15 ml of warm culture medium, the cell suspension will&#xD;
      be transferred into a T175 culture flask. The hASCs will be incubated in a humidified&#xD;
      environment at 37°C and 5% CO2. Then, the cell pellet will be resuspended in warm culture&#xD;
      medium and seeded into new cell culture flasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 - Concentrated culture medium (CM) preparation and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stem cell culture and CM preparation will be performed at a GMP certified facility for&#xD;
      regenerative medicine products. At first, the surface antigen profiles of isolated hASCs at&#xD;
      third passage will be characterized by flow cytometry. The presence of CD73, CD90, CD105 and&#xD;
      CD44 markers and the absence of CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR will be assessed to&#xD;
      confirm the desired cell phenotype as recommended by protocols of the International Society&#xD;
      of Cellular Therapy.[ Then, a sample of these cells will be also characterized by staining&#xD;
      (Alizarin Red S) in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell expansion and CM will&#xD;
      be generated following standard stem cell culture protocols. Before clinical use, CM will be&#xD;
      examined not only for contamination with bacteria, fungi, or mycoplasmas but also for&#xD;
      infection with viruses including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency and human T-cell&#xD;
      leukemia viruses. Then, CM will be properly cool-stored and sent to clinical application (up&#xD;
      to 6 hours), to avoid long-term denaturation/inactivation of present signalling molecules, as&#xD;
      previously suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 - Maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under IV sedation and supplementary oxygen release with an oral catheter, along with local&#xD;
      anesthesia, the maxillary bone will be grafted internally by drilling an access in the&#xD;
      lateral maxillary sinus wall. Sinus membrane dissection with careful release and elevation&#xD;
      will be also performed. Preoperative randomizing by computer-generated random numbers will be&#xD;
      used to determine test and control sinuses for each patient. The bony floor of the maxillary&#xD;
      sinus on the test site will be augmented with 4 to 5g of a synthetic bone substitute&#xD;
      (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM. The control site will receive similar&#xD;
      amount of bone substitute embedded in 10 to 15 ml of saline solution. Patients will be&#xD;
      released from hospital facility 2h after surgery. They will be instructed in postoperative&#xD;
      hygiene and eating behavior. All patients will receive postoperative antibiotic and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 - Implant placement and bone biopsies harvesting&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months of healing, implant placement will follow routine surgical protocols as&#xD;
      recommended by the implant manufacturer. Under local anesthesia, a mid-crestal linear&#xD;
      incision and full-thickness flap will be performed with releasing incisions whenever&#xD;
      necessary. Then, with a 16:1 contra-angle attached to a surgical unit and a trephine bur (Ø&#xD;
      3mm), the grafted area correspondent to the 2nd premolar, 1st and 2nd molar regions will be&#xD;
      biopsied at both right and left sides of the maxilla (n=06 sites per patient), guided by a&#xD;
      previously made acrylic resin surgical stent. Bone biopsies will be then divided in two&#xD;
      segments, where one will be stored in 4% formaldehyde solution for histologic analysis and&#xD;
      the other in Eppendorf vials with RNALater for RT-PCR analysis. Then, the sequence of implant&#xD;
      surgical burs as recommended by the manufacturer will be followed for the placement of 6 to 8&#xD;
      implants per patient. Registration of primary stability at insertion will be done by both&#xD;
      manual torque wrench and classified into three groups. A healing abutment will be then&#xD;
      placed, and wound closure will be conducted with non-resorbable suture material A 6-month&#xD;
      one-stage healing protocol will be adopted for all implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 - CBCT image analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-resolution CBCT images will be obtained at three different time-points as part of the&#xD;
      treatment protocol, meaning at pre-operative bone graft [baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2] days&#xD;
      (implant placement pre-operative), aiming both pre-op surgical planning and post-op&#xD;
      evaluation of the bone formation. The morphometric bone parameters will be calculated in 3D&#xD;
      analysis according to the recommendations of the American Society for Bone and Mineral&#xD;
      Research (ASBMR) as previously proposed, and statistical analysis will be used to identify&#xD;
      the best parameter combinations aiming to differentiate trabecular bone into three bone&#xD;
      categories: (i) sparse-related to a loose bone structure, (ii) intermediate-related to a&#xD;
      well-structured trabecular bone, and (iii) dense bone types-related to a massive bone area&#xD;
      with little space between the trabeculae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.7 - Histologic and histomorphometric analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following removal of graft biopsies at implant placement, bone blocks containing the control&#xD;
      and test bone sites will be shaped and decalcified with 5% HNO3. The blocks will dehydrate in&#xD;
      a graded alcohol series, clarify with xylene and be embedded in resin. Then, the resin will&#xD;
      be polymerised in a UV light chamber for 10h. Using a diamond micro saw, a total of three&#xD;
      3-μm-thick slices from each block will be ground transversely to each specimen long axis at&#xD;
      50, 100, and 150μm from their external portion. After this, routine staining with&#xD;
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Azur II and Pararosaniline will be done aiming to differentiate&#xD;
      between HP/β-TCP particles and newly formed bone. Microscopic analysis will be performed at&#xD;
      24X magnification using an optical stereo microscope connected to a digital camera. Image&#xD;
      analysis will be performed using the ImageJ® software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.8 - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the preparation of the collected graft biopsies for RNA extraction, real-time&#xD;
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis will be applied to quantify&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, Osteonectin, Osteopontin and type 1&#xD;
      collagen.&#xD;
