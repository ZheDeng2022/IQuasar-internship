      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      engineered natural killer (NK) cells containing deleted TGF-betaR2 and NR3C1 (cord blood&#xD;
      [CB]-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1-) in treating patients with glioblastoma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent). CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- cells are genetically changed immune cells that may&#xD;
      help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of off-the-shelf&#xD;
      CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), occurrence of dose&#xD;
      limiting toxicities (DLTs) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Group 1) II. To&#xD;
      evaluate the immunological phenotype and anti-tumor function of NK cells in resected tumor&#xD;
      tissue after treatment with CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- in the surgical expansion group. (Group&#xD;
      2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine response as measured by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO),&#xD;
      duration of clinical response, progression free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP),&#xD;
      and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Monitoring immune responses following CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- dosing, in vivo persistence&#xD;
      and expansion of CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- during treatment, characterization of immune cell&#xD;
      subpopulations in the peripheral blood, serum analysis of immune correlates, alloreactivity&#xD;
      characterization, and anti-HLA antibody analysis, and CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- trafficking in&#xD;
      tumor microenvironments in the surgical expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Tumor tissue from surgical resection will be further analyzed for immune infiltrates,&#xD;
      fibrosis, and tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study. Patients are&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 1: Patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10 minutes weekly&#xD;
      for up to 8 doses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP 2: Patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10 minutes on days&#xD;
      0, 7, and 14. Patients undergo standard of care surgical resection on day 15. Beginning 2&#xD;
      weeks after surgery, patients receive CB-NK-TGF-betaR2-/NR3C1- intratumorally over 5-10&#xD;
      minutes weekly for up to 5 doses (total of 8 doses) in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7, 30, and 90 days.&#xD;
