      To improve secondary school students' positive attitudes towards older adults with physical&#xD;
      disabilities via a Promoting an incLUsive Society towards older adults with physical&#xD;
      disabilities through disability simulation education (PLUS) project.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pretest-posttest and qualitative study design will be adopted. 1,000 junior secondary&#xD;
      students will be recruited from six secondary schools in Hong Kong by convenience sampling to&#xD;
      participate in a 3-day PLUS Convention. Changes in students' attitudes towards older adults&#xD;
      with physical disabilities and satisfaction with life, and their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      disability simulation experience will be assessed. Semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with students, facilitators, teachers, and older adults with physical disabilities&#xD;
      to gain further feedback.&#xD;

    <description>The 47-item Students' Attitudes toward People with a Disability Scale will be used. It was developed locally in the Baseline Survey of Students' Attitudes towards People with a Disability, a study conducted by the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong. It encompasses four attitude sub-scales, namely social acceptance, behavioural misconceptions, pessimism-hopelessness, and optimism-human rights. Participants will rate their agreement with each item on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Strongly agree&quot; - 4 = &quot;Strongly disagree&quot;). The four attitude sub-scale scores will then be converted along a scale between 1-100. A higher score will indicate a more positive attitude towards people with a disability. All sub-scales had Cronbach's Alpha scores ranging from 0.69 to 0.85, which support their respectable reliability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the participants' level of life satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to immediately after completion of the intervention (2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-item Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) will be adopted. Participants will rate their overall judgement of their life on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; - 7 = &quot;Strongly agree&quot;). The total score ranges from 5 to 35 points, with a higher score indicating a higher satisfaction with life. The SWLS has a Cronbach's Alpha score of 0.87, supporting its internal consistency and reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The participants' level of satisfaction with the disability simulation workshop</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after completion of the disability simulation workshop (within 1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The 18-item Satisfaction with Disability Simulation Experience Scale (SDSES) will be used. Participants will rate their extent of agreement with the simulations using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; - 5 = &quot;Strongly agree&quot;) to indicate their satisfaction with them. A higher score will indicate higher satisfaction with the simulation experience. The survey will have one open-ended question asking students to provide additional comments about their simulation experience. The scale's internal consistency reliability is supported as its whole Cronbach's coefficient values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88.</description>
