             or use effective contraceptive methods from signed ICF to at least 6 months following&#xD;
             the last dose of the study intervention. Effective contraceptive methods include&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established physical contraception and&#xD;
             copper intrauterine devices (IUDs).&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as cardiovascular&#xD;
             diseases, nervous system diseases, respiratory system diseases, urinary system&#xD;
             diseases, digestive system diseases and endocrine diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Current treatment for active systemic infection, or history of recurrent serious&#xD;
             infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known active or suspected autoimmune diseases, requiring systemic immunosuppressive&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Known allergy to any component of the study intervention or history of allergy to&#xD;

             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. In the Investigator's judgment, there is evidence of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of&#xD;
             the results of the study or render the participant at high risk for treatment&#xD;
             complications, or other conditions considered not amenable to this study.&#xD;
