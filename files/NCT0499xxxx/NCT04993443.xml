    <textblock>
      This is Phase I first-in-human trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics of LQ036 via inhalation and IV infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 3 parts: Single Ascending Dose, Multiple Ascending Dose, and&#xD;
      Intra Venous with a target of 88 healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      Single Ascending Dose(SAD)/ Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study of dose escalation cohorts&#xD;
      evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK of LQ036 after administration via&#xD;
      inhalation and intravenous (IV) infusion in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into 3 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three parts will be completed sequentially or with partial overlapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A - SAD Cohorts (A1 to A5):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule will be followed, for each cohort: 2 sentinel subjects (1 active&#xD;
      and 1 placebo) will be dosed and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed no sooner than the&#xD;
      next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts will be dosed sequentially in an ascending fashion. There will be at least 14 days&#xD;
      between dosing of each dose level. Following completion of each dose level, a safety review&#xD;
      committee (SRC) composed by at least the Investigator, a Sponsor representative, and an&#xD;
      Independent Medical monitor will review the safety and tolerability data, as well as&#xD;
      available PK and immunogenicity data up to Day 15, for at least 6 subjects in the respective&#xD;
      cohort, as well as available PK and immunogenicity data. Decisions from the SRC may include&#xD;
      whether to escalate to the next dose level, continue with a more conservative approach&#xD;
      (slowing the increase in dose or repeating a dose level), suspending dose escalation until&#xD;
      further review of study data, stopping dose escalation, or terminating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B - MAD Cohorts (B1 to B4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B can be initiated only following review of the safety, tolerability, and PK data&#xD;
      following dosing of the SAD Cohort 3 or 4, if deemed acceptable by the SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule may be used for the first dose level, including 2 sentinel&#xD;
      subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) initiating dosing first and the remaining 6 subjects&#xD;
      initiating dosing no sooner than the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts will be dosed sequentially in an ascending fashion. There will be at least 14 days&#xD;
      between dosing of each dose level. Following completion of each dose level, a SRC composed of&#xD;
      at least the Investigator, a Sponsor representative, and an Independent Medical monitor will&#xD;
      review the safety and tolerability data up to Day 15, for at least 6 subjects in the&#xD;
      respective cohort, as well as available PK and immunogenicity data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decisions from the SRC may include whether to escalate to the next dose level, continue with&#xD;
      a more conservative approach (slowing the increase in dose, repeating a dose level, or&#xD;
      exploring an alternative dosing regimen), suspending dose escalation until further review of&#xD;
      study data, stopping dose escalation, or terminating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C - IV Cohorts (C1 and C2) Part C can be initiated only following review of the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK data following dosing of the SAD Cohort 3 or 4, if deemed acceptable by&#xD;
      the SRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered dosing schedule will be followed for each cohort: 2 sentinel subjects (1 active&#xD;
      and 1 placebo)will be dosed first and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed no sooner than&#xD;
      the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts will be dosed sequentially in an ascending fashion. There will be at least 14 days&#xD;
      between dosing of each dose level. Following completion of each dose level, a SRC composed by&#xD;
      at least the Investigator, a Sponsor representative, and an Independent Medical monitor will&#xD;
      review the safety and tolerability data up to Day 15, for at least 6 subjects in the&#xD;
      respective cohort, as well as available PK and immunogenicity data. Decisions from the SRC&#xD;
      may include whether to escalate to the next dose level, continue with a more conservative&#xD;
      approach (slowing the increase in dose or repeating a dose level), suspending dose escalation&#xD;
      until further review of study data, stopping dose escalation, or terminating the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some alterations from the currently outlined dose and/or dosing regimen may be performed, but&#xD;
      the dose to be administered in a given cohort will not exceed the one currently outlined in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;
