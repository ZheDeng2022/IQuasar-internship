  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of pressure injuries mainly comes from disabled patients who are bedridden for&#xD;
      a long time. According to a report from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, about one-tenth&#xD;
      of chronic patients need to be bedridden for a long time, and pressure injuries account for&#xD;
      the most in the comorbidities of bedridden for a long time. The main cause of pressure injury&#xD;
      is the natural aging of the patient's body and long-term bed rest so that it is difficult to&#xD;
      detect physical stress and cannot change the posture within an effective time to reduce the&#xD;
      pressure, which is prone to pressure injury. The prevalence rates of stress injuries in&#xD;
      various countries are 13-23% in the Netherlands, 10-15% in the United States, and 8-23% in&#xD;
      Europe. In addition, studies have also shown that the prevalence of stress injuries in the&#xD;
      elderly in the UK is 0.31-0.70%. The incidence rate is 0.18-3.36% and these two indicators&#xD;
      are increasing year by year; in Taiwan, related surveys show that the prevalence rate of&#xD;
      pressure injury in hospitalized patients is 7.53%, and the incidence rate of pressure injury&#xD;
      in bedridden patients is 36.8%. According to a National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP)&#xD;
      survey, the prevalence rate of stress injuries in acute wards ranges from 0.1% to 17%, and&#xD;
      the incidence rate is 0.4% to 38%. The prevalence of intensive care units The prevalence rate&#xD;
      is higher than 41%, the incidence rate is higher than 33%, the prevalence rate of long-term&#xD;
      care is 2.3% -28%, the prevalence rate is 2.2%-23.9%, the prevalence rate of nursing homes is&#xD;
      0% -29%, and the prevalence rate is 0%- 17%. In addition, NPUAP estimates in 1989 show that&#xD;
      the average medical cost for each stress injury case ranges from 2,000 to 30,000 US dollars,&#xD;
      while the medical cost for each stress injury patient in Taiwan is about NT 7,000 to 80,000.&#xD;
      If the knowledge of stress injury prevention can be improved, the number of outpatient visits&#xD;
      will be reduced, and the occurrence of stress injury will also be reduced. In summary, under&#xD;
      the trend of aging development, stress injury management and care are important issues of&#xD;
      medical quality.&#xD;

      The purpose of this research is to integrate the past education that affects nursing staff to&#xD;
      receive care for stress injuries and to explore the intervention of different education&#xD;
      measures, including conventional education methods and digital flipped education methods, to&#xD;
      measure nursing staff Effectiveness in learning about the knowledge, attitude, self-awareness&#xD;
      and self-efficacy of pressure injury management.&#xD;
