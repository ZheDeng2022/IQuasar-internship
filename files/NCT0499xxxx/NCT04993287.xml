  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study proposal is to deploy a wearable solution that predicts physiological perturbation&#xD;
      comparable to invasive devices and to perform continuous remote patient monitoring; this will&#xD;
      be connected to a structured, cascading, escalation pathway involving home health nurses,&#xD;
      advanced practitioner providers, and heart failure specialists, and has the potential to&#xD;
      transform heart failure management in the post-discharge period, where patients are the most&#xD;
      vulnerable for readmission. This feasibility study will contribute to the understanding of&#xD;
      post-discharge heart failure continuous remote patient monitoring, promote patient self-care,&#xD;
      and has the potential of improving patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a leading cause of hospital readmission. It results in significant&#xD;
      mortality, morbidity, and health care utilization. Effective continuous remote patient&#xD;
      monitoring (CRPM) can reduce readmissions, but it has only been realized via invasive&#xD;
      monitoring. The study will focus on non-invasive heart failure CRPM through a structured&#xD;
      cascading and escalating alert system. In this feasibility study, the study team will use a&#xD;
      wearable biosensor and collect ambulatory physiological data that are analyzed by machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms, potentially identifying physiological perturbation in heart failure&#xD;
      patients. Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform&#xD;
      management by the home health team via a structured protocol. The escalation pathway will&#xD;
      engage home health, advanced practitioner providers, and heart failure specialists. In the&#xD;
      first aim, the study team will perform a soft launch on five patients with an extensive&#xD;
      evaluation to assess feasibility for the pilot trial. In aim 2, the study team will implement&#xD;
      the feasibility pilot study. In aim 2a, the study team will conduct surveys and&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with both providers and patients. The surveys and interviews will&#xD;
      be applied at three time points (initiation, maintenance, and post-study) to evaluate&#xD;
      perceptions, acceptance, and experience of this CRPM solution. In aim 2b, the investigators&#xD;
      will leverage temporal data mining, feature extraction, and patient clustering methods to&#xD;
      identify valid patterns associated with the pathophysiological events of interest, using&#xD;
      continuous physiological data, patient reports, and electronic health record data. The study&#xD;
      team will also compare outcome and process measures from our pilot study to a retrospective&#xD;
      cohort matched for key demographics and disease severity. This feasibility study will provide&#xD;
      key learning for a larger efficacy clinical trial to evaluate if this non-invasive&#xD;
      telemonitoring solution tied to structured patient management via cascading and escalating&#xD;
      alert pathways can improve outcomes and reduce heart failure readmission.&#xD;
