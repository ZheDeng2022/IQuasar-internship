      This prospective, open-label, single-center, one-arm clinical trial aims at evaluating the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of avatrombopag in Chinese adult ITP patients with autoantibodies fail&#xD;
      (due to intolerance or resistance) to eltrombopag or herombopag treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects include ITP secondary to connective tissue diseases (including but not limited&#xD;
      to systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis), primary ITP&#xD;
      with positive antinuclear antibody but not up to the diagnostic criteria of connective tissue&#xD;
      diseases, primary Evans syndrome, Evans syndrome secondary to connective tissue diseases, and&#xD;
      primary ITP with positive Coomb's test but not up to the diagnostic criteria of Evans&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-two eligible subjects will be enrolled in this study. The dose will be adjusted&#xD;
      according to the platelet count during the period from week 1 to week 12.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects will receive avatrombopag treatment with an initial dose of 40mg once a day. Platelet counts will be obtained weekly during the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until week 12 after treatment. The dose adjustment range is 20 mg per week to 40 mg per day to maintain the platelet level between 30×10^9/L and 200×10^9/L. If the platelet count does not reach to 30×10^9/L after taking avatrombopag 40mg once a day for 4 consecutive weeks, the treatment will be stopped.</description>
