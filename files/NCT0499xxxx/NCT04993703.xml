  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) which is defined as a symptomatic compression neuropathy of the&#xD;
      median nerve at the level of the wrist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of splints are used for improving the function and decreasing the pain&#xD;
      intensity and symptoms in the rehabilitation of patients with CTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However effectiveness of treatment by taping has never been investigated in physiotherapy and&#xD;
      rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effect of conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      only, and also kinesio taping and night splinting in patients with CTS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) which is defined as a symptomatic compression neuropathy of the&#xD;
      median nerve at the level of the wrist.It is considered as the most common disabling&#xD;
      neuromuscular condition of the upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Night splints are used in conjunction with the conservative intervention to improve the&#xD;
      function and decrease the pain intensity and paresthesia in the rehabilitation of patients&#xD;
      with carpal tunnel syndrome. However effectiveness of treatment by kinesiotaping has never&#xD;
      been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effect of conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      only, and also kinesio taping and night splinting in addition to conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      in the rehabilitation of patients with CTS.&#xD;

    <time_frame>functional impairment will be recorded at baseline and 8-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>functional impairment will be assessed by using Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire. The score consisted of two sub-scales; The Symptom Severity Scale including 11 questions and The Functional Capacity Scale including 8 questions. Each scale score is calculated by the average values of the questions. The scores vary between &quot;1-point&quot; to &quot;5-point&quot;. High score indicates severe symptoms and impaired functional capacity.</description>

    <description>pain intensity will be assessed by using Visual Analog Scale at rest, activity and at night.&#xD;
All patients were asked to mark their pain level that corresponds to their pain intensity on the line between &quot;0=no pain&quot; and &quot;100=the worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <description>A total of 21 sessions physiotherapy sessions including hot pack, ultrasound therapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and a home exercise program (tendon and nerve gliding, hand and wrist exercises=2 times per day 3sets of ten repetitions) will be applied.&#xD;
Additionally for this group, kinesiotaping will be applied by using carpal tunnel technique including button hole and I band technique of space correction; and with 25-50% tension in center of tape over dorsal carpal tunnel at the end of the each session. Patients will request to keep kinesiotaping at nights throughout the study.</description>
