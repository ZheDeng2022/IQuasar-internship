  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To study the clinical effect of arthroscopic treatment in patients with hip disease, a&#xD;
      retrospective study was conducted on 600 patients with hip disease from January 2011 to&#xD;
      January 2016. All patients underwent preoperative examinations. These included preoperative&#xD;
      supine anteroposterior hip radiographs, cross-lateral radiographs, computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      and magnetic resonance imaging.Preoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS), international hip prognostic instrument-12 (IHOT-12), and&#xD;
      modified Harris hip score (MHHS), were evaluated at 1, 2, and 5 years after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Use epidural anesthesia or general anesthesia. The patient lies on the orthopedic traction bed to protect the perineum and perform traction of the lower limbs on the surgical side. Under arthroscopy, check the labrum, acetabular articular surface and femoral head cartilage, and round ligament in turn. The acetabular labrum with tear degeneration was treated with labrum suture or labrum revision surgery according to the injury. Perform femoral head and neck plastic or acetabular plastic surgery, osteoid osteoma debridement, etc.</description>
