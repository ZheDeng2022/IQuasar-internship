  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of Alectinib as a first-line&#xD;
      treatment for advanced NSCLC with ALK rearrangement positive mutation in the real world. On&#xD;
      the basis of the hypothesis that the 5' partner influences the intrinsic properties of the&#xD;
      fusion protein, immune surveillances that impact oncogenic potential, and sensitivity to ALK&#xD;
      TKIs, we investigated the clinical impact of the detection of non-reciprocal/reciprocal ALK&#xD;
      translocations in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients receiving alectinib as first- or&#xD;
      subsequent-line therapy. We also performed whole transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing&#xD;
      and translated proteins identification by proteomics using tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      non-reciprocal/reciprocal ALK translocations and 3'-ALK fusion to identify certain&#xD;
      differentially expressed genes or proteins and their signaling pathways.&#xD;

      This is a research project involving patients in Medical Oncology Department of Affiliated&#xD;
      Cancer Hospital of Xiangya School of Medicine Central South University. Retrospective study&#xD;
      of 427 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using ALK-TKI ALK&#xD;
      rearrangement positive mutation was conducted to observe the efficacy and safety of alectinib&#xD;
      regimen in the real world.Exploratory research contents are as follows: 1.we investigated the&#xD;
      clinical impact of the detection of non-reciprocal/reciprocal ALK translocations in&#xD;
      ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients receiving alectinib as first- or subsequent-line therapy. 2. We&#xD;
      also performed whole transcriptomic analysis by RNA sequencing and translated proteins&#xD;
      identification by proteomics using tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      non-reciprocal/reciprocal ALK translocations and 3'-ALK fusion to identify certain&#xD;
      differentially expressed genes or proteins and their signaling pathways.&#xD;
