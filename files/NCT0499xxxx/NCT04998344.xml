  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually influenza is a leading cause of severe disease and mortality particularly in young&#xD;
      children &lt;5 years old and pregnant women in the low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and&#xD;
      both groups are prioritised for vaccination by the World Health Organisation (WHO). In&#xD;
      Bangladesh, influenza is responsible for 10% of all childhood pneumonias and 9% of all death.&#xD;
      Maternal influenza is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation and foetal&#xD;
      malformation. Influenza is a vaccine preventable disease, however, in most LMICs influenza&#xD;
      vaccination is not part of the vaccination programme. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine against influenza illness among pregnant women&#xD;
      and children in Bangladesh. Influenza vaccine has not yet been studied as combined&#xD;
      immunization strategy in a cluster randomized trial. This study is a community-based&#xD;
      randomised trial in both pregnant women and young children to assess the impact of&#xD;
      inactivated influenza vaccine in preventing influenza in the community as well as population&#xD;
      level impact by both direct and indirect effect of vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will be conducted in rural Matlab, Bangladesh, covered by a Maternal,&#xD;
      Child Health and Family Planning intervention program (named MCH-FP area). Twenty villages in&#xD;
      the Maternal, Child Health and Family Planning intervention program area will be randomized&#xD;
      at a 1:1 ratio to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or the control&#xD;
      inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Recruitment, randomization and vaccination of healthy&#xD;
      pregnant women at 28 to 34 weeks of gestation period and children 6 to 59 months old at the&#xD;
      time of enrolment will be carried out from fixed site clinics working in the MCH-FP area.&#xD;
      Vaccines will be administered as a single dose regimen for the pregnant women and two doses&#xD;
      for children at 28-days interval as recommended by the vaccine manufacturers. All pregnant&#xD;
      women in the third trimester of pregnancy (n~300), and children 6 to 59 months old in 20&#xD;
      villages in the MCH-FP area of Matlab will be eligible for vaccination (n~3500) for the&#xD;
      study. In addition, all residents of study villages will be included in the influenza&#xD;
      surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All vaccinated pregnant women and parents of vaccinated children 6 to 59 months old will be&#xD;
      asked to inform the study team by phone of any respiratory illnesses or to visit the Matlab&#xD;
      hospital. Also, all residents of the study villages will be asked to visit the Matlab&#xD;
      hospital/fixed site clinic for any respiratory illness. Participants will receive regular SMS&#xD;
      messages to remind them to report cases of influenza like illness (ILI). At the hospital, the&#xD;
      medical officer will examine the sick patient and decide if the criteria of the ILI case&#xD;
      definition are met. ILI is defined as an acute respiratory infection with: measured fever of&#xD;
      ≥ 38 C° and cough; with onset within the last 10 days for adults; and in case of children as&#xD;
      measured axillary temperature ≥ 38.0°C with onset within the last 10 days and at least one of&#xD;
      the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, earache or ear&#xD;
      discharge. In medically confirmed ILI cases, the trial will collect nasopharyngeal and throat&#xD;
      swabs for confirmation of the aetiology of the infection, as well as collect serum samples&#xD;
      from vaccinated participants Passive surveillance will continue for 18 months following&#xD;
      completion of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence, prevalence, seasonality and clinical descriptions of :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Influenza infection including clinical pneumonia in child (fever, cough and&#xD;
                respiratory difficulties)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Influenza infection including clinical pneumonia in mother (fever, cough and&#xD;
                respiratory difficulties)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HAI antibody titres to calculate the rate of reduction of risk of influenza infection or&#xD;
           disease in influenza vaccination pregnant women and children as well as reduction of flu&#xD;
           infection in population of intervention and control villages&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of simple sample collection methods in children to assess Influenza specific&#xD;
           antibody responses in DBS and saliva sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Clinical and demographic risk factors associated with illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Comparisons of pregnancy outcomes and post-delivery illness/complication&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Clinical and laboratory confirmation of influenza and other respiratory virus in sick&#xD;
           individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Economic evaluation of influenza vaccination in pregnant women and children&#xD;
