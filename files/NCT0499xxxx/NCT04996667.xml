    <textblock>
      A single center study to evaluate the effect of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) on pulmonary&#xD;
      dynamics in patients presenting with imaging confirmed intermediate/submassive or massive&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism (PE). The target enrollment is 20 subjects at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical&#xD;
      Center. PE patients undergoing catheter-based intervention will be administered iNO during&#xD;
      their intervention and pulmonary hemodynamic measurement will be measured before, during, and&#xD;
      after iNO administration (Invasive Cohort). Patients who are not undergoing catheter-based&#xD;
      intervention will also be administered iNO and will have pulmonary hemodynamics, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart rate measured non-invasively (Non-Invasive Cohort).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study to evaluate patients presenting with imaging confirmed&#xD;
      intermediate/submassive or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). The investigators anticipate to&#xD;
      enroll a total of 20-25 subjects at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, the subject will proceed under one of two study&#xD;
      intervention arms depending on his or her treatment plan. If the patient requires invasive&#xD;
      treatment such as interventional thrombectomy or catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT), the&#xD;
      participant will be enrolled in the interventional radiology arm (invasive cohort). If the&#xD;
      patient requires non-invasive treatment such as anticoagulation therapy, deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      (DVT) thrombectomy, or inferior vena cava (IVC) filter, the participant will be enrolled in&#xD;
      the non-intervention arm (non-invasive cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional Radiology Arm (Invasive Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedure will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional radiology (IR) will perform a right heart catheterization (RHC) as part of a&#xD;
      planned IR procedure. Patient arrives in the IR suite and is positioned flat with head of bed&#xD;
      between flat and 45 degrees. O2 amount and modality, blood pressure, pressor name, dose, and&#xD;
      rate will be recorded. If the patient is intubated, the sedation/analgesia drug name(s),&#xD;
      dose(s), and rate(s) will be recorded. If the patient is not intubated, name and dose amount&#xD;
      of sedation will be recorded. Arterial blood gas will be obtained if an A-line is placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bedside apical 4 chamber view (RV:LV ratio) will be recorded using an ultrasound device, and&#xD;
      noninvasive RV data will be obtained with Edwards ClearSight system and Edwards EV1000&#xD;
      clinical platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edwards ClearSight system and Edwards EV1000 clinical platform is a finger probe worn with a&#xD;
      supportive forearm strap. Hemodynamic measurements from the finger cuff will be recorded at&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel non-invasive methods of estimating stroke volume and associated cardiac output have the&#xD;
      potential to revolutionize PE risk stratification and care. Non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      (NIBP) monitors can even measure stroke volume beat to beat, allowing for continuous&#xD;
      evaluation of cardiac function. NIBP systems are typically composed of a finger cuff with an&#xD;
      inflatable bladder, pressure sensors, and light sensors. An arterial pulse contour is formed&#xD;
      using the volume clamp method of blood pressure measurement combined with calibration and&#xD;
      brachial pressure reconstruction algorithms. The stroke volume with each heart beat can be&#xD;
      estimated as the area under the systolic portion of the blood pressure curve divided by the&#xD;
      afterload. A limitation of using NIBP monitors to measure stroke volume is their relative&#xD;
      inaccuracy, as they are calculations of an indirect measurement. However, NIBP monitors¬ may&#xD;
      improve clinical care of PE because they allow for assessment of dynamic cardiac changes in&#xD;
      real time. Detection of worsening stroke volume in acute PE could inform providers of&#xD;
      impending cardiac collapse, and improvement of stroke volume may function as a positive&#xD;
      prognostic factor or marker of therapeutic success. Use of NIBP monitors during acute PE to&#xD;
      identify clinically significant changes in cardiac function may advance both PE&#xD;
      prognostication and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Butterfly iQ+ (one possible ultrasound device which may be used) is a single-probe,&#xD;
      whole-body ultrasound device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial measurements, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) will be administered at 30 ppm for 3&#xD;
      minutes. The same measurements will be obtained/calculated before, during iNO administration,&#xD;
      and after iNO has been withheld for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All major changes in pressures, sedation, vital signs, and major events will be recorded&#xD;
      throughout the RHC procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iNO is scheduled to be weaned off post RHC but the IR/anesthesia team may choose to keep the&#xD;
      patient on iNO at their clinical discretion. The patient will then proceed to their standard&#xD;
      of care IR procedures with planned intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-intervention Arm (Non-invasive Cohort):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitals including O2 amount and modality, blood pressure, pressor name, dose, and rate will be&#xD;
      recorded. If the patient is intubated, the name, dose, and rate of sedation and analgesia&#xD;
      will be recorded. If the patient is not intubated, name and dose amount of sedation will be&#xD;
      recorded. Arterial blood gas will be obtained if an A-line is placed. Bedside apical 4&#xD;
      chamber view will be recorded (RV:LV ratio) with an ultrasound device, and noninvasive RV&#xD;
      data will be obtained with Edwards ClearSight system and Edwards EV1000 clinical platform.&#xD;
      This data will be obtained before, during iNO administration, and after iNO has been withheld&#xD;
      for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject initially enrolled in the Non-intervention Arm (Non-invasive Cohort) needs an&#xD;
      invasive procedure, they will be removed from the study.&#xD;
