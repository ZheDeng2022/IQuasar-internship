  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Adipose tissue fibrosis denotes excessive pathological accumulation of&#xD;
      extracellular matrix (ECM) in adipose tissue and is a marker of dysfunction. Growth hormone&#xD;
      (GH) activates adipose tissue lipolysis and stimulates collagen synthesis in lean tissues.&#xD;
      Intriguingly, we have novel pilot data to suggest that GH excess (acromegaly) also induces&#xD;
      reversible fibrosis in vivo and potently activates the expression of fibroblast activation&#xD;
      protein alpha (FAPα).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: GH induces adipose tissue fibrosis by increased FAPα expression together with&#xD;
      proliferation and fibrogenic differentiation of fibro-adipogenic progenitor (FAP) cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To unravel the mechanisms underlying GH-induced adipose tissue fibrosis with emphasis on&#xD;
      FAPα expression and proliferation of FAP cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods: In a single blinded, randomized, double-dummy crossover design, 10&#xD;
      adult, moderately overweight individuals will be subjected to one week of GH and GH receptor&#xD;
      blockade (Pegvisomant). We will use single-cell technologies, fluorescence-activated cell&#xD;
      sorting (FACS), RNA sequencing, and cell culture studies on adipose tissue samples, combined&#xD;
      with in vivo assessment of adipose tissue turnover and metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: Understanding fibrosis formation in human models may identify new targets for&#xD;
      treatment of obesity-associated disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and preliminary data: Adipose tissue is a multicellular tissue surrounded by an&#xD;
      extracellular matrix, which undergoes continuous remodeling. Pertubations in the remodeling&#xD;
      processes may cause accumulation of excess extracellular matrix protein and hence fibrosis.&#xD;
      Adipose tissue fibrosis is recognized as a component of the metabolic syndrome together with&#xD;
      insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and obesity, and fibrosis is likely to play a causative role&#xD;
      (1,2). In this context, it is fascinating that prolonged GH exposure in vivo induces insulin&#xD;
      resistance despite a concomitant mobilization and reduction of fat mass (3). This effect of&#xD;
      GH is expressed in patients with a GH-producing pituitary tumor (acromegaly) (4). Moreover,&#xD;
      GH is a potent activator of collagen turnover and it also promotes fibrosis in human tendons&#xD;
      and skeletal muscles (5-7). Increased AT fibrosis has been reported in a GH transgenic mice&#xD;
      model (8) and we have preliminary data showing AT fibrosis in patients with active&#xD;
      acromegaly, which reverses after disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the mechanisms underlying GH-induced fibrosis, but recent evidence&#xD;
      points to a potential involvement of FAPα, an enzyme that is highly expressed in mouse AT FAP&#xD;
      cells (9). Moreover, we have recently reported that human skeletal muscle FAP cells&#xD;
      upregulate FAPα (DPP4) during fibrogenic differentiation (19). FAPα is a subunit of a&#xD;
      heterodimeric proteinase complex attached to the cell membrane in addition to a soluble form&#xD;
      also present in the circulation (10). Several proteins are recognized as FAPα substrates,&#xD;
      including collagen type I (11) and III (12), and FAPα appears to play a significant role in&#xD;
      hepatic tissue remodeling (13) and in lung fibrosis (14). We have recently recorded elevated&#xD;
      circulating levels of FAPα in active acromegaly, which correlates with collagen turnover&#xD;
      reverses after disease control (15). Fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells are mesenchymal&#xD;
      progenitors with the intrinsic potential to differentiate into either collagen-producing&#xD;
      fibroblasts or adipocytes. They have been studied in murine cardiac and skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      where they contribute to either fibrosis or fat deposition during muscle-impaired&#xD;
      regeneration or degeneration (16-18). We have recently demonstrated that a subset of FAP&#xD;
      cells drives the accumulation of ECM protein and adipocytes in the muscle from patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes and likely contributes to the poor metabolic and mechanical muscle function&#xD;
      (19). Whether GH affects adipose tissue FAP cell proliferation and differentiation is&#xD;
      unknown, but FAP cell proliferation is regulated by IGF-I (16), which is a strongly&#xD;
      GH-dependent peptide. Increased FAP proliferation has also been reported to contribute to&#xD;
      intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) in several conditions, and we have observed IMAT after&#xD;
      treatment in acromegaly (unpublished data). Furthermore, we have preliminary data from&#xD;
      FACS-isolated adipose tissue FAP cells incubated with serum from acromegaly patients, which&#xD;
      suggest GH-dependent increased FAP cell proliferation and fibrogenic appearance.&#xD;
      Collectively, these findings suggest that GH promotes a pro-proliferative and fibrogenic FAP&#xD;
      phenotype at the expense of adipogenic differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: Growth hormone: 1) Activates FAPα protein expression, 2) Increases proliferation&#xD;
      and fibrogenic differentiation of FAP cells, and 3) Induces reversible fibrosis in adipose&#xD;
      tissue in humans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and methods: In a single blinded, randomized, double-dummy crossover design, 10&#xD;
      adult, moderately overweight individuals will be subjected to one week of GH and GH receptor&#xD;
      blockade (Pegvisomant). Pegvisomant is a modfied GH molecule that selectively blocks the GH&#xD;
      receptor and is a licensed drug for the treatment of acromegaly. We include Pegvisomant as an&#xD;
      'active control' in order to suppress endogenous GH actions. The participants will receive&#xD;
      daily subcutaneous injections of growth hormone, 0.6-2.0 mg depending on age, for 7 days in&#xD;
      the GH intervention. In the control intervention, the participants will receive daily&#xD;
      subcutaneous injections of either Pegvisomant or saline. Pegvisomant in a dose of 30 mg is&#xD;
      given two times, in the beginning and in the end of the control intervention, whereas saline&#xD;
      is given on the other 5 days of the control intervention period. The two intervention periods&#xD;
      are separated by a wash out period of 1-4 months. The participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either start with the GH intervention and next be subjected to the control intervention, or&#xD;
      start with the control intervention and next be subjected to the GH intervention. The&#xD;
      participants will meet at the hospital daily for the injections and a small blood sample.&#xD;
      Each intervention period is initiated by an initiation day where there will be taken blood&#xD;
      samples, adipose tissue and muscle samples, be performed temperature measurements and&#xD;
      bioimpedance, and be administered heavy water and the first injection of intervention either&#xD;
      GH or control intervention. On the first initiation day a DXA scan will be performed for&#xD;
      assessment of body composition. Each intervention period will be terminated with a study day&#xD;
      where there will be taken blood samples, adipose tissue and muscle samples, be performed&#xD;
      temperature measurements, indirect calorimetry, palmitate tracer kinetics and bioimpedance,&#xD;
      and be administered the last injection of intervention either GH or control intervention. The&#xD;
      participants will be fasting for the initiation and study days, and during the intervention&#xD;
      periods, they will log their intake of food and beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: FAP cell function, FAPα protein expression and markers of fibrosis in AT biopsies&#xD;
      obtained before and after intervention. In particular, we will perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACS to quantify and isolate cell populations, including quantification of FAP cells in&#xD;
           adipose tissue, and in vitro determination of proliferation and fibro-/adipogenic&#xD;
           differentiation potential&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FAPα expression in blood and adipose tissue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Markers of fibrosis in adipose tissue assessed by light microscopy and&#xD;
           immunohistochemically, RNA sequencing and heavy water labeled connective tissue turnover&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: to study the impact of GH exposure on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating biomarkers of collagen turnover (PINP, PIIINP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whole body energy metabolism and fatty acid turnover (indirect calorimetry and palmitate&#xD;
           tracer kinetics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Connective tissue turnover in muscle tissue (heavy water (D2O) labeling)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: Comparison between groups will be performed using standard&#xD;
      statistical methods (t-test or equivalent nonparametric test). Within group comparison will&#xD;
      be performed using paired t-test of equivalent nonparametric test. Moreover, ANOVA (repeated&#xD;
      measures) will be used. A p-value less than 0.05 will be regarded as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective and relevance: This is the first study to investigate GH effects on adipose&#xD;
      tissue fibrosis in humans, which has implications beyond GH pathophysiology. A deeper&#xD;
      understanding of the pathways controlling fibroblast and adipocyte balance in fat tissue is&#xD;
      essential groundwork and may unravel new targets for combating adipose tissue dysfunction and&#xD;
      related disorders. As recently demonstrated in type 2 diabetic patients these progenitor&#xD;
      cells are key mediators of tissue plasticity and function in humans (19).&#xD;
