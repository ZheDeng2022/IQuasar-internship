  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study designed to evaluate if experimental anti-TIGIT/anti-PD-1&#xD;
      bispecific antibody, AZD2936 is safe, tolerable and efficacious in participants with Advanced&#xD;
      or Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human (FTIH), open-label, multicenter, multi-part, dose-escalation&#xD;
      and dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      efficacy of AZD2936 in adult participants with stage III unresectable or stage IV NSCLC. The&#xD;
      study includes 4 parts: Part A (dose escalation) and Parts B-D (dose expansion).&#xD;
