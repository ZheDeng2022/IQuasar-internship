      This study is a randomized and controlled phase Ⅳ clinical trial in population aged ≥ 18&#xD;
      years. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine (Vero cell), Inactivated co-administration with quadrivalent influenza vaccine and&#xD;
      23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.The COVID-19 vaccine was manufactured by&#xD;
      Sinovac Research &amp; Development Co., Ltd,and the quadrivalent influenza vaccine and 23-valent&#xD;
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine(PPV23) were manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co.A total of&#xD;
      1320 subjects will be enrolled, with 660 aged 18~59 years and 660 aged 60 years and&#xD;
      above.Subjects in each age group will be randomly divided into 3 groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:&#xD;
      Group 1 is the combined immunization group, which will receive the first dose of COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine and quadrivalent influenza vaccine on day 0, and the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine&#xD;
      and PPV23 on day 28;Group 2 is the immune group of the COVID-19 vaccine, which will receive&#xD;
      the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on day 0 and the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on day&#xD;
      28.Group 3 is the immune group of quadrivalent influenza vaccine /PPV23 ,wich will receive&#xD;
      quadrivalent influenza vaccine on day 0 and PPV23 on day 28.&#xD;
