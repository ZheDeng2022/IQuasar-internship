    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to optimize the traditional treatment scheme and explore the&#xD;
      cure scheme for the elderly by combining the existing mature treatment technology. The&#xD;
      primary aim of this innovative immunotherapy using WT1/hTERT/Survivin-loaded DCs is to&#xD;
      determine whether this novel DC vaccination is safe and can significantly prevent clinical&#xD;
      relapse and increase survival of MDS patients.&#xD;

      Objective Myelodysplastic syndrome (Myelodysplasticsyndromes,MDS) is a highly age-related&#xD;
      malignant clonal disease of the hematological system, which is characterized by pancytopenia&#xD;
      and transformation to leukemia. In China, the median age of onset of MDS is 70 years old, and&#xD;
      the incidence increases with age. It is the most common malignant tumor in the elderly, which&#xD;
      seriously threatens the health and survival of the elderly. The 3-year survival rate of&#xD;
      traditional combination chemotherapy or demethylation therapy is less than 20%.&#xD;

Collection of PBMC for preparation of DC cells for patients with autologous DC cells, patient PBMC was collected 10-16 weeks before administration for the preparation and large-scale culture of DC cells. For the patients with matched DC cells, a small amount of peripheral blood was taken for HLA typing 4 weeks before administration, and then the matched DC cells were cultured on a large scale.</description>
