      This study is a preliminary clinical study about safety of artificial salivary containing&#xD;
      cumin and ginger extract in 21 healthy volunteers. The volunteers will be divided into 3&#xD;
      groups which are artificial salivary containing 0.3% cumin and 0.05%ginger extract group,&#xD;
      artificial salivary containing 0.3%cumin and 0.1%ginger extract group, and artificial&#xD;
      salivary containing 0.3%cumin and 0.15%ginger extract group. The volunteers will be evaluated&#xD;
      salivary volume by Schirmer test, salivary acid and base value by strip test, dry mouth by&#xD;
      questionnaire, and adverse effects before and after using the artificial salivary for 30 min.&#xD;
      After the preliminary clinical study, safety of artificial salivary containing cumin and&#xD;
      ginger extract in 112 healthy volunteers. The volunteers will be divided into 2 groups which&#xD;
      are artificial salivary containing cumin and ginger extract group and commercial artificial&#xD;
      salivary. The volunteers will be evaluated salivary acid and base value by strip test and&#xD;
      adverse effects by World Health Organization Oral Mucositis Grading Scale and questionnaire&#xD;
      before and after using the artificial salivary (3 times/day) for 3 and 6 days. Then, the&#xD;
      volunteers will stop using the artificial salivary for 7-10 days. After that, the volunteers&#xD;
      will be used the artificial salivary for 3 days. All evaluation will be tested.&#xD;
