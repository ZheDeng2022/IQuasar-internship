  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of&#xD;
      AN4005 in patients with advanced tumors. This study is a first-in-human, dose escalation&#xD;
      study with the objective to establish the MTD and/or RP2D of AN4005.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for Dose Level 0 (50 mg), a traditional &quot;3 + 3 design&quot; will be utilized for dose&#xD;
      finding with dose escalation and/or de-escalation as appropriate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, one sentinel patient will be dosed at 50 mg first, then increasing doses of&#xD;
      AN4005 will be administered to cohorts of 3 subjects, at doses ranging from 100 mg twice&#xD;
      daily (BID) to 600 mg BID (see the table below). The proposed starting dose, 50 mg BID, has&#xD;
      been selected based on integrated data from nonclinical studies. If 50 mg BID for one cycle&#xD;
      is deemed to be tolerable upon review of safety data, the dose of AN4005 will be escalated to&#xD;
      100 mg BID in a cohort of 3 patients, and further dose escalations will be performed in&#xD;
      separate cohorts based on review of data from all preceding cohorts. The dose escalation will&#xD;
      be conducted in a sequential manner. Intermediate dose levels (decrement) may be explored.&#xD;
      Decisions with regard to dose escalation to next dose level will be made jointly by the&#xD;
      investigators and the sponsor. AE data collected for approximately 90 days following the end&#xD;
      of exposure will also be used to inform the final dose and schedule. A minimum of 6 patients&#xD;
      will be treated at the MTD/RP2D.&#xD;

                  patients with well documented Gilbert's Syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is defined&#xD;
                  as presence of episodes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with normal results&#xD;
                  from cells blood count (including normal reticulocyte count and blood smear),&#xD;

                  breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential Women are considered post-menopausal and&#xD;
                  not of child-bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age&#xD;

                  oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks prior to&#xD;
                  Screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status&#xD;
                  of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment, is she&#xD;
                  considered not of child-bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Woman of childbearing potential who agrees to follow contraceptive guidance&#xD;
                  during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
                  treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             patient. (Periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female sterilization: When the female study patient has had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks&#xD;
             before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the&#xD;
             absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female study patients, the vasectomized male&#xD;
             partner should be the sole partner for that patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Using a combination of any two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), and&#xD;

                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hormonal contraception methods (e.g., oral, injected, implanted).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  12. A male participant must agree to use contraception during the treatment&#xD;
                  period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have been discontinued treatment due to a Grade 3 or higher immune-related AE (irAE)&#xD;
             from prior anti-PD-1or anti-PD-L1 therapy, or with an agent directed to another&#xD;
             stimulatory or co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g., CTLA-4, OX 40, CD137).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have received prior systemic anti-cancer therapy including investigational oncology&#xD;
             agents within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Participants must have recovered from all AEs due to previous therapies to ≤&#xD;
             Grade 1 or returned to baseline. Participants with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia&#xD;
             may be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 6 weeks must have elapsed since CAR-T infusion and subjects must have&#xD;
             experienced disease progression, and not have residual circulating CAR-T cells in&#xD;
             peripheral blood (based on local assessment). Any encountered treatment-related&#xD;
             toxicities must have resolved to Grade ≤1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have received prior palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study&#xD;
             treatment. Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not&#xD;
             require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout is&#xD;
             permitted for palliative radiation (≤ 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central nervous&#xD;
             system (CNS) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Uncontrolled tumor-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
             Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,&#xD;
             mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus&#xD;
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection&#xD;
             are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza&#xD;
             vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed. Non live&#xD;
             COVID vaccinations or boosters should not occur within 30 days prior to the first dose&#xD;

             (including oral anticoagulation). Patients who meet the following criteria should be&#xD;
             excluded: a) A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated&#xD;

             medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval.&#xD;
