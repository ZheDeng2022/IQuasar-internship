      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ocrelizumab in the breastmilk of lactating&#xD;
      women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or multiple sclerosis (MS) [in line with the&#xD;
      locally approved indications] treated with ocrelizumab, by assessing the concentration of&#xD;
      ocrelizumab in mature breastmilk, as well as the corresponding exposure and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      effects (blood B cell levels) in the infants.&#xD;
