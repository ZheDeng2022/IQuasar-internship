      This is a phase 2, open-label, single-arm trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in combination with pembrolizumab following&#xD;
      disease progression after two prior lines of standard therapy in unresectable metastatic&#xD;
      stage IV breast cancer&#xD;

      This study will enroll subjects who are female aged &gt; 18 years at the time of informed&#xD;
      consent with histologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer (unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      stage IV breast cancer). Subjects must have measurable disease and be a candidate for&#xD;
      palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Subjects must have Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0, 1, or 2 and adequate hematologic, hepatic,&#xD;
      renal, and coagulation function. Subject must also have received two prior lines of&#xD;
      FDA-approved therapy. Triple negative patients must have had prior exposure to taxane therapy&#xD;
      either in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant or metastatic setting. ER + positive patients must have&#xD;
      had prior cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor therapy. Her2 overexpressed patients&#xD;
      must have had prior therapy with trastuzumab and ado-trastuzumab (TDM-1).&#xD;

    <description>Stereotactic radiation therapy will be delivered using either linac-based SBRT using 10x flattening filter-free (FFF) photons or Cyberknife Pencil Beam Technology utilizing 6X photons. Treatment will be delivered in 1-5 fractions. Fractionation and total dose (1500 - 3000 cGy) will depend on the site of disease, previous radiation treatment, and patient symptomatology.&#xD;
Pembrolizumab is supplied as pembrolizumab 100 mg/4 mL vials (25 mg/mL) solution for intravenous infusion. Pembrolizumab at a dose of 200 mg will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks (± 3 days).</description>
