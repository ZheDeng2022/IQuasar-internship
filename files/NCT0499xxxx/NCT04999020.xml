    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2/3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group,&#xD;
      multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of ravulizumab in adult participants with dermatomyositis (DM).&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in 2 parts: Part A (Phase 2) and Part B (Phase 3). There will be&#xD;
      3 periods in both Part A and Part B of this study: Screening Period, Randomized Controlled&#xD;
      Period, and Open-Label Extension Period.&#xD;
