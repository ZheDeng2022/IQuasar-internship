      Recent pre-clinical studies strongly suggest that due to dysfunctional vasculature and&#xD;
      blunted sympathetic constriction in the tumor, tumor blood flow is increased even by 200%&#xD;
      compared to resting values. However, to the best of our knowledge these blood flow aspects&#xD;
      have never been addressed clinically. Therefore, this research aims at investigating tumor&#xD;
      blood flow response to exercise in human cancer patients. To address this goal, in total&#xD;
      twenty (20) newly diagnosed breast cancer and eight (8) lymphoma patients will be recruited&#xD;
      for the present acute exercise and tumor perfusion clinical trial. To study the effect of&#xD;
      acute physical exercise on tumor blood flow and its heterogeneity, 30 minute bicycle exercise&#xD;
      will be used to exercise these patients. Tumor blood flow will be measured by positron&#xD;
      emission tomography at rest before and after the exercise. If the hypothesis of increased&#xD;
      blood flow in response to exercise will be detected, this project has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the basic physiological and mechanistic understanding of tumor microvasculature&#xD;
      function in humans, which is also clinically highly relevant and can have long-lasting&#xD;
      influences in the field in the future. Thus, the results from the project can be a&#xD;
      breakthrough for cancer treatment, its mechanistic arguments, and thus renewal of&#xD;
      evidence-based medicine and patient care.&#xD;

      In regards to cancer, it would be reasonable to assume that also cancer behaves like all&#xD;
      other inactive tissues in a body during exercise, meaning that also blood flow in the tumor&#xD;
      environment is reduced particularly when exercise intensity increases. However, recent&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies suggest that due to dysfunctional vasculature and blunted sympathetic&#xD;
      constriction in the tumor, tumor blood flow is increased even by 200% compared to resting&#xD;
      values (6; 18; 19) as increased cardiac output and blood pressure enhance perfusion pressure&#xD;
      in the tumor. This improves its oxygenation (6; 18; 19), which is important as tumor hypoxia&#xD;
      negatively affects the efficacy of treatment (27). Tumor hypoxia is promoted by heterogeneous&#xD;
      blood flow in the tumor, but according to these pre-clinical studies exercise reduces the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of tumor perfusion. However, it is not currently known if this is the case in&#xD;
      patients, and it might be that tumor perfusion is actually decreased during exercise, but&#xD;
      increased post-exercise, but this has never been addressed in clinical patients and is&#xD;
      therefore the aim of the present study. Importantly, advanced imaging methods are available&#xD;
      to investigate whether these pre-clinical findings can be extended to humans to serve as an&#xD;
      evidence based proof-of-concept for the possible inclusion of exercise in the treatment of&#xD;
      cancer during chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important objective of this directly translatable and highly inter- disciplinary&#xD;
      imaging, physical activity, health and medical research in the acute exercise study setting&#xD;
      is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether acute moderate intensity exercise increases tumor blood flow&#xD;
&#xD;
      -It is hypothesized and expected that exercise increases tumor blood flow, documented as&#xD;
      perfusion increase after acute exercise&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Each subject will serve their own control (tumor blood flow at rest vs. blood&#xD;
      flow after exercise). Tumor blood flow will be measured with positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET). To study the effect of acute physical exercise on tumor blood flow and its&#xD;
      heterogeneity, bicycle exercise before PET scan will be used to exercise breast cancer and&#xD;
      lymphoma cancer patients. These experiments are additional measurements to their normal&#xD;
      treatments, and no new interventional approaches will be conducted in this study.&#xD;
