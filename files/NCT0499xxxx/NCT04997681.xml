      Background: Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) may be possible&#xD;
      for persons with subjective (SCI) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal cognition and&#xD;
      risk factors. Physical exercise and cognitive training have been shown to enhance cognitive&#xD;
      function and mobility in MCI when delivered in a research facility. The feasibility of&#xD;
      delivering interventions in the home of older adults at risk for developing ADRDs is not&#xD;
      known. What preferences the participants have for these interventions are also unknown. The&#xD;
      primary goals are: 1) assess feasibility of a home-based delivery of exercise and cognitive&#xD;
      interventions 2) evaluate the relationship between participants' intervention preferences and&#xD;
      adherence. Secondary objectives focus on cognition, frailty, mobility, sleep, diet and mental&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: SYNERGIC@Home is a randomized control trial (using a 2 x 2 factorial&#xD;
      design) with a 16-week home-based intervention program of physical exercises with cognitive&#xD;
      training. Sixty-four participants will be randomized in blocks of four: 1) combined exercise&#xD;
      (aerobic and resistance) + cognitive training (NEUROPEAK™); 2) combined exercise + control&#xD;
      cognitive training (web searching); 3) control exercise (balance and toning) + cognitive&#xD;
      training; and 4) control exercise + control cognitive training. It will be implemented&#xD;
      virtually through video conferencing. Baseline, 4- and 10-month post-intervention will&#xD;
      include measures of cognition, frailty, mobility, sleep, diet, and psychological health.&#xD;
      Feasibility outcomes include recruitment and retention. Preference will be used to determine&#xD;
      the relationship between preference adherence. Secondary outcomes will evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      the interventions on cognitive, mobility, and general well-being.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Nearly half a million Canadians live with Alzheimer's Disease and Related&#xD;
      Dementias (ADRDs), and approximately one third of those cases could have been prevented with&#xD;
      early intervention. Physical exercise and cognitive training are emerging interventions that&#xD;
      have the potential to enhance cognitive function and mobility in older adults at risk for&#xD;
      developing dementia. The SYNERGIC trial (SYNchronizing Exercises, Remedies in GaIt and&#xD;
      Cognition), a large multi-site randomized control trial, showed promising preliminary data&#xD;
      that individuals in an active exercise intervention combining aerobic exercise with&#xD;
      progressive resistance training (AE+RT) and in a cognitive training program (NEUROPEAKTM) had&#xD;
      better cognitive outcomes than a balance and toning control (BAT) intervention paired with a&#xD;
      control cognitive intervention consisting of website searching and watching a simple video&#xD;
      (WS+V). While these interventions were provided face to face in a research facility, little&#xD;
      is known about the feasibility of delivering these multi-domain interventions at home in&#xD;
      older adults at risk for developing ADRDs. Thus, the primary goal of the present trial-the&#xD;
      SYNERGIC@Home trial-is to establish the feasibility of delivering a combined multimodal&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive training intervention program for 16 weeks to 64 older adults at home&#xD;
      using video-conferencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: Based on the success of the SYNERGIC trial, we expect that SYNERGIC@Home will&#xD;
      follow suit and yield high recruitment, retention, and adherence rates-particularly in light&#xD;
      of the fact that SYNERGIC@Home eliminates any of the natural inconveniences of in person&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: SYNERGIC@Home is a randomized control trial (RCT) with a 16-week home-based&#xD;
      intervention program of combined physical exercises with cognitive training. Sixty-four&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to one of the following four arms: 1) combined exercise&#xD;
      (AE+RT) + cognitive training (NEUROPEAKTM); 2) combined exercise (AE+RT) + control cognitive&#xD;
      training (WS+V); 3) Control exercise (BAT) + cognitive training (NEUROPEAKTM) ; and 4)&#xD;
      Control exercise (BAT) + control cognitive training (WS+V). SYNERGIC@Home will be implemented&#xD;
      entirely virtually through video and phone conferencing. Baseline, immediate&#xD;
      post-intervention follow-up, and 6-month post-intervention follow-up assessments will include&#xD;
      measures of cognition, frailty, mobility, sleep, diet, and psychological health. For primary&#xD;
      feasibility objectives, we will obtain measures of recruitment and retention rates. For&#xD;
      primary analytic objectives, we will examine the distribution of preference ratings and&#xD;
      determine if there is a relationship between preference for a given intervention and&#xD;
      subsequent adherence. A series of secondary analytic outcomes examining the potential effect&#xD;
      of the individual and combined interventions on cognitive, mobility, and general well-being&#xD;
      will be measured at both baseline and follow-up. If we find a relatively equal split in sex&#xD;
      our sample, we will conduct gender-based analyses as additional, exploratory research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The SYNERGIC@Home trial will establish the feasibility of a&#xD;
      combined multimodal intervention program delivered at home in older adults. Similarly, it&#xD;
      will estimate the frequency and strength of participant preference for different&#xD;
      interventions and delineate the relationship between intervention preference and subsequent&#xD;
      adherence. It will also build capacity for and pilot the delivery of multi-domain&#xD;
      interventions using an entirely home-based protocol with individuals at risk for ADRDs. The&#xD;
      SYNERGIC@Home trial will inform future larger scale studies on the feasibility and success of&#xD;
      implementing home-based interventions for individuals at risk for ADRDs. Insights gained from&#xD;
      this feasibility trial will be instrumental in developing various other at home, remote, and&#xD;
      virtual intervention programs for community-dwelling older adults.&#xD;

Next, 6 strength training exercises (that progressively increase in resistance intensity over time) will be completed followed by a break. Aerobic exercises that safely increase the participant's heart rate will follow for 30 minutes followed by a break and a set of cool down exercises for 5 minutes. In total the AE + RT exercise session is approximately 65 minutes.</description>

    <description>NeuropeakTM is a program which will be completed by participants remotely using a tablet or computer. It consists of cognitive training including dual-task training that requires participants to maintain and prepare for many response alternatives (working memory) and to share attention between two concurrent tasks (divided attention). Difficulty of cognitive training is tailored to their individual functioning level. During each session, participants perform one of two different visuo-motor tasks, which include sets of visual stimuli (e.g., letters, numbers, animals, vehicles, fruits, celestial bodies) and respective hand-button correspondences (i.e., keys that are to be tapped on either the right or the left side of the screen). Participants are instructed to perform these tasks as fast as possible, while maintaining accuracy. Training also includes online feedback and a histogram of daily performance to encourage improvement. NeuropeakTM takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>During the WS + V task, participants alternate between 2 different tasks (touristic searching using internet and video watching). For the touristic searching using internet, participants are required to find 3 hotels, 3 touristic places, and 3 restaurants of their own preference in a city assigned by the instructor (a new city will be selected each session). They will also need to include the respective addresses of those places on their log sheet. For the video watching task, participants watch a National Geographic video on YouTube selected by the instructor with a different video selected for each session. They will watch the video for 20 minutes and during the remaining 5 minutes they will answer the following questions on their log sheet: 1) What is the video about? 2) What is the most important information in your opinion? 3) Create a question based on the video and answer your own question. WS + V sessions take approximately 30 minutes to complete.</description>
