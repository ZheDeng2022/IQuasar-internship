  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the interobserver agreement for FAPI PET/CT&#xD;
      interpretations of representative cancer types and compare findings among readers with&#xD;
      different levels of experience.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is expressed by many cancer-associated fibroblasts,&#xD;
      having a pivotal role in many desmoplastic tumor histotypes (sarcoma, pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer). 68Ga-FAPI inhibitor (FAPI) is a promising novel molecular imaging tracer&#xD;
      for positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT), with favorable initial&#xD;
      results in different tumor entities. Compared to 18F-FDG, 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT shows a similar&#xD;
      biodistribution, with less background tracer uptake in the brain, oral mucosa and liver, thus&#xD;
      making this tracer potentially suitable to detect tumor lesions in these regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the FAPI ligand contains a DOTA peptide which makes it appropriate also for&#xD;
      therapeutic options if linked with 177Lutetium or 90Yttrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing number of trials aimed to assess the efficacy and the clinical impact&#xD;
      of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT. Therefore, the inter-observer agreement and variability with 68Ga-FAPI&#xD;
      PET/CT need to be established.&#xD;

        Each recruited observer will be asked to review 50 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT scans of patients with&#xD;
        different types of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Observers will be blinded to clinical data except of the following patient information:&#xD;
        sex, age (years), weight (Kg), injected dose (MBq), uptake time (min), type of cancer and&#xD;
        PET/CT indication (e.g. staging, re-staging after surgery, evaluation after therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Each observer will be also asked to record maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for&#xD;
        one exemplary lesion for each tissue (organ, node, bone).&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Nuclear medicine physicians or radiologists with a prior experience with 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT&#xD;
        from high-volume centers (Essen, Germany; Bologna, Italy; Los Angeles, USA; Munich,&#xD;
        Germany, MÃ¼nster, Germany ) will be prospectively recruited as research observers. Each&#xD;
        observer will be asked to report the number of previous clinical 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT scans and&#xD;
        then will be classified on the basis of the experience in these three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low experience (&lt; 30 prior 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT studies);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intermediate experience (30 to 300 studies);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High experience (&gt; 300 studies) At least three observers will be needed for each&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        No prior PET/CT experience.&#xD;
