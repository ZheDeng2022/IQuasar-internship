    <textblock>
      Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis (UC) patients with moderate to severe disease activity at high&#xD;
      risk of colectomy. Early use of biologic agents will likely be more effective. But there were&#xD;
      no studies identified that compared a strategy of upfront biologic-based therapy versus&#xD;
      gradual step-up therapy. In our study, newly diagnosed moderate to severe pediatric UC&#xD;
      patients (6-18 years old) will be randomly divided into infliximab (IFX) treatment group (Top&#xD;
      down group, TD) and corticosteroids (CS) treatment group (Step-up group, SU). Mucosal healing&#xD;
      rate at week 12 will be compared between the two groups. The relapse rates and sustained&#xD;
      durations of remission within one year will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) is typically more extensive and has a more active disease&#xD;
      course than adult UC. Pediatric UC patients with moderate to severe disease activity at high&#xD;
      risk of colectomy. Rapid disease control may improve the prognosis of the disease and reduce&#xD;
      the rate of surgery. Early use of biologic agents will likely be more effective. But there&#xD;
      were no studies identified that compared a strategy of upfront biologic-based therapy versus&#xD;
      gradual step-up therapy. In our study, newly diagnosed moderate to severe pediatric UC&#xD;
      patients (6-18 years old) will be randomly divided into infliximab (IFX) treatment group (Top&#xD;
      down group, TD) and corticosteroids (CS) treatment group (Step-up group, SU). A decrease of&#xD;
      pediatric ulcerative colitis activity index (PUCAI) at least 20 points were defined as&#xD;
      Clinical response. Clinical response will be evaluated at week 2 in SU group and week 6 in TD&#xD;
      group. For no-responder, treatment plan will be changed. Clinical remission rate at week 10&#xD;
      and mucosal healing rate at week 12 will be compared between the two groups. The relapse&#xD;
      rates and sustained durations of remission within one year will also be evaluated.&#xD;
