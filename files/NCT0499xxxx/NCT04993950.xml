  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to find out the effects of Mulligan SNAGs along with thoracic&#xD;
      postural correction techniques on patients with chronic cervicogenic headache. Patients&#xD;
      suffering from cervicogenic headache are often associated with muscle imbalance. This study&#xD;
      will be significant in determining the effects of SNAGs along with thoracic postural&#xD;
      correction techniques to improve pain, level of disability and functional status in patients&#xD;
      of cervicogenic headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be Randomized controlled trial study design Data will be collected from Lady reading&#xD;
      Hospital Peshawar Purposive sampling, group randomization using lottery method will be used&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headaches are a common condition affecting 47% of the global population,1,2 with cervicogenic&#xD;
      headaches (CGHs) accounting for 15-20% of all chronic and recurrent headaches. The&#xD;
      International Headache Society has classified a cervicogenic headaches as a secondary&#xD;
      headache with 'pain referred from a source in the neck and perceived in one or more regions&#xD;
      of the head and/or face. In the case of cervicogenic headache, the cause is a disorder of the&#xD;
      cervical spine and its component bone, disc and/or soft tissue elements. The term&#xD;
      cervicogenic headache is commonly misused and does not simply apply to a headache associated&#xD;
      with neck pain; many headache disorders, including migraine and tension-type headache, can&#xD;
      have associated neck pain/tension. Rather, there must be evidence of a disorder or lesion&#xD;
      within the cervical spine or soft tissues of the neck, known to be able to cause a headache&#xD;
      (1). It is often worsened by neck movement, sustained awkward head position or external&#xD;
      pressure over the upper cervical or occipital region the symptomatic side (2). The prevalence&#xD;
      of Chronic headache has been reported to be between 0.4 and 20 % of the headache population&#xD;
      (3). In recent years, there has been an increasing knowledge in the pathogenesis and better&#xD;
      management of chronic headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current scientific evidence supports the role of manual therapies in the management of&#xD;
      tension type and cervicogenic headache (4). Individuals with Chronic headache are frequently&#xD;
      treated with spinal manipulative therapy including both mobilization and manipulation. Spinal&#xD;
      mobilization consists of slow, rhythmical, oscillating techniques (5) Cervical sustained&#xD;
      natural apophyseal glides (SNAGs) are 'mobilization with movement' technique in which a&#xD;
      sustained accessory facet glide is applied together with active physiological movement. The&#xD;
      therapist may apply the glide over the spinous process (central SNAGs) or over the articular&#xD;
      pillar on one side (unilateral SNAGs). SNAGs have been advocated for the treatment of neck&#xD;
      pain and range of movement (ROM) restriction. SNAGs have been shown to be effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of neck pain, cervicogenic headaches, and cervicogenic dizziness (6).mobilization&#xD;
      with movement utilize the dual role of bot therapist force (accessory glides) and patient&#xD;
      effort (active physiological or functional movement) and techniques are often carried out in&#xD;
      a variety of weight bearing positions, with treatment belts, and either additional therapist,&#xD;
      assistant or patient applied overpressure A thorough clinical examination is performed and&#xD;
      appropriate level is identified, the glide is then performed parallel to the perceived facet&#xD;
      plane and the degree of glide is determined by patient's active movement response (8). Many&#xD;
      studies on the short-term effectiveness and manual therapy to the cervical spine&#xD;
      (mobilization and manipulative therapy) have found it beneficial in reducing headache pain or&#xD;
      disability, intensity, frequency, and duration.&#xD;
