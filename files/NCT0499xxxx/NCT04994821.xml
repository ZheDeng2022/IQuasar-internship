      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation in&#xD;
      which low level electrical currents are applied to the scalp in order to alter brain&#xD;
      function. In a prior Phase-I study, the research team demonstrated feasibility of&#xD;
      self-administration of a home-tDCS prototype in 14 patients that applied 15 sessions for each&#xD;
      patient at an outpatient center.&#xD;

      The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a portable neuromodulatory intervention to&#xD;
      reduce craving in cocaine addiction. This proposed project is in response to NIH/NIDA's&#xD;
      solicitation titled &quot;Development of Portable Neuromodulatory Device for the Treatment of&#xD;
      Substance Use Disorders (SUDs).&quot; The present study aims to increase the efficacy of repeated&#xD;
      administration of tDCS to reduce drug craving in individuals with cocaine addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substance use disorders present a treatment challenge for clinicians, as well as a&#xD;
      socioeconomic burden on individuals and society at large. Cocaine use disorder occurs when&#xD;
      someone experiences clinically significant impairment caused by the recurrent use of cocaine,&#xD;
      including health problems, physical withdrawal with discontinuation of use,&#xD;
      persistent/escalating use, and failure to meet major personal, occupational, or educational&#xD;
      responsibilities. At present, no FDA approved medicines are available to treat cocaine&#xD;
      dependence, and behavioral therapy may be used to treat this addiction, though with limited&#xD;
      efficacy. Drug craving (strong obsessions about and/or irresistible urges or compulsions to&#xD;
      consume a drug) is a central driving force for perpetuation of substance use and subsequent&#xD;
      addiction, as well as relapse after abstinence. Currently, no treatments exist that are&#xD;
      targeted at reducing drug craving, which is intrusive and distressing to patients. The&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role inhibiting these intrusive cravings. However,&#xD;
      decades of data have shown that PFC activity is impaired in addictions. In this study, our&#xD;
      goal is to increase PFC activity with non-invasive neuromodulation. Given the role of the PFC&#xD;
      in the processing and regulation of craving behavior, this brain region is a key target for&#xD;
      brain stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit individuals with a diagnosis of cocaine use disorder (per DSM-5&#xD;
      criteria) who are receiving treatment for their substance use disorder at Samaritan Daytop&#xD;
      Village (SDV) and other similar treatment facilities (e.g., Phoenix House, Mount Sinai's&#xD;
      network of hospitals and clinics). Patients will be randomly assigned into three groups:&#xD;
      active (real-tDCS), real-tDCS and Cognitive Reappraisal (CR), or sham (placebo) tDCS.&#xD;
      Participants will receive 20 minutes of stimulation per tDCS day, three days per week for&#xD;
      five weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews and neuropsychological testing will be conducted, and self-reported drug craving&#xD;
      and addiction severity questionnaires will be used. Follow up cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted over a period of 12 months post tDCS stimulation. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to perform EEG, cognitive tasks, and collection of a blood sample&#xD;
      to assess genetic/epigenetic patterns&#xD;

    <description>Craving for cocaine will be assessed with a brief scale composed of 5 items (1, 2, 4, 5, and 13) from the Obsessive-Compulsive Cocaine Scale (OCCS; Vorspan et al., 2012).</description>

    <description>An abbreviated instrument of cross-culturally valid assessment of quality of life of the World Health Organization (WHOQOL-BREF) with 26 questions (WHOQOL Group, 1998; Skevington et al., 2004) yields 4 domains (physical health, psychological, social relationships, and environment) and 2 individually scored items regarding overall perception of quality of life (Q1) and health (Q2). The 4 domain scores are scaled in a way that higher scores stand for higher quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-tDCS), post-tDCS sessions (approx. week 6), Follow-up (1 month, 3 month)</time_frame>
    <description>The Late Positive Potential (LLP), also known as the Late Positive Wave, is an Event Related Potential (ERP) that is formed approximately 400 ms after exposure to a stimulus and continues until about 2 s after the exposure. Higher LPP amplitude has been shown to indicate a higher level of cocaine craving (Parvaz 2016). We will present images of cocaine-related tasks to subjects and measure the amplitude of the LPP using a 64-electrode EEG cap. We will compare the LPP amplitude at each testing session to baseline amplitude.</description>
