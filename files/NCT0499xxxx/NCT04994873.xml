  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-Implementation design. Specifically, this study&#xD;
      proposes to test the effectiveness of STEP in reducing suicidal events and ideation in 216&#xD;
      adolescents, admitted to inpatient psychiatric care due to suicide risk. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized to either STEP or ETAU. STEP involves 4 in-person sessions (3 individual, 1&#xD;
      family) focused on psychoeducation regarding positive and negative affect, mindfulness&#xD;
      meditation, gratitude, and savoring. Mood monitoring prompts and skill reminders will be sent&#xD;
      daily for the first month post-discharge and three times a week for the following two months.&#xD;
      The ETAU condition will receive reminders to log into a safety resource app, matched in&#xD;
      frequency to the STEP group. Effectiveness aspects of the design include using clinical staff&#xD;
      as interventionists and having very few exclusion criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      216 participants and their families (across two sites) will be randomized to either STEP or&#xD;
      ETAU (as described in the research strategy). Aims and hypotheses are below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the effectiveness of STEP in reducing suicidal events (attempt or emergency&#xD;
      intervention to intercede attempt), active SI (with intent or plan), and depression at&#xD;
      6-month f/u (primary) and suicidal events at 12-month follow-up (f/u). H1: It is hypothesized&#xD;
      that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have lower rates of suicide events&#xD;
      (H1A), active SI (H1B), and depression (H1C) over the 6-month follow-up period; H1D: It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have lower rates of&#xD;
      suicidal events at the 12-month, long term f/u.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine engagement of the hypothesized mechanisms at the 3- and 6-month f/u. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that those randomized to STEP, compared to ETAU, will have: H2A: higher&#xD;
      attention to positive affect, assessed by implicit tasks; H2B: higher gratitude and&#xD;
      satisfaction with life, assessed by self-report; H2C: lower negative affect, assessed by&#xD;
      implicit tasks and self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine whether hypothesized mechanisms mediate reduction of suicidal events and&#xD;
      ideation. H3: Changes in attention to positive affect, gratitude, satisfaction with life, and&#xD;
      negative affect at 3-month f/u will be related to improvements in suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      suicidal events at the 6-month f/u.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim Examine elements supporting external validity. Acceptability, appropriateness,&#xD;
      and feasibility of STEP to patients, parents, clinicians, and administrators will be assessed&#xD;
      by: 1) a survey consisting of brief, standardized measures of these items, and 2) qualitative&#xD;
      interviews to further explore these perceptions. These findings will be used to: 1) modify&#xD;
      STEP to address potential barriers, and 2) develop implementation strategies designed to&#xD;
      overcome these challenges, for testing in a future Hybrid Type III&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial.&#xD;
