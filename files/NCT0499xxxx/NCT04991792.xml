  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, controlled, exploratory clinical&#xD;
      trial is conducted to assess the positive effect of feeding a formula containing synbiotics&#xD;
      (pre- and probiotics) on the composition of the gut microbiota in caesarean section (CS) born&#xD;
      healthy term infants within the first 6 months of life.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since caesarean section (CS)-born infants show dysbiotic microbial colonization during the&#xD;
      first weeks of life, exclusive breastfeeding is the feeding mode of choice for these infants.&#xD;
      However, since CS births are often associated with breast-feeding difficulties, it is of&#xD;
      importance to feed an microbiota-supportive infant formula. This study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate whether an infant formula supplemented with synbiotics positively affects the&#xD;
      microbial composition, gastrointestinal characteristics and the proper function of the immune&#xD;
      system in CS-born infants, compared to feeding a standard infant formula without synbiotics&#xD;
      in either CS- and vaginal-born infants during the first 6 months of life. The growth of the&#xD;
      infants as well as tolerance, infectious diseases and allergies will also be assessed. In&#xD;
      order to investigate the effect of different birth modes and feeding conditions on the&#xD;
      microbiota, the study population will include healthy term infants, born either by CS or by&#xD;
      VD, additional groups receive human milk or formula with prebiotics only.&#xD;
