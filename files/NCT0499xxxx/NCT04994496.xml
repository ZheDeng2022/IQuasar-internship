    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a web-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention promoting mental health in adolescents. We will examine whether this&#xD;
      intervention improves positive affect, reduces stress and alleviates negative affect and&#xD;
      depressive symptoms in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. We will also investigate the rates of&#xD;
      adherence among the adolescents who use this web-based intervention and the acceptability of&#xD;
      the intervention with adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of mental health problems including depression rises during adolescence.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, young people often have little knowledge about mental health problems and&#xD;
      conditions, such as depression, and how they can be prevented. Besides limited knowledge,&#xD;
      concerns about social stigma, confidentiality and limited access to mental health services&#xD;
      are some of the main barriers to seek help. Therefore, highly acceptable and easily&#xD;
      accessible services promoting mental health, such as knowledge about mental health conditions&#xD;
      and effective self-help strategies to prevent them, are urgently needed for adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a website, which provides evidence-based information about depressive disorders&#xD;
      in youth (e.g., identification, etiology, treatment, and prevention of depression) and will&#xD;
      be launched in autumn 2021. Furthermore, the website provides information about self-help&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., reducing stress, doing exercise, undertaking positive activities), which&#xD;
      are meant to serve as an addition to professional treatments of depression or to promote&#xD;
      mental health in adolescents. Target groups of the website are adolescents aged 12 to 18&#xD;
      years seeking help for depression, as well as healthy adolescents seeking information about&#xD;
      mental health promotion or prevention of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the acceptability of the website and the engagement of young people, the website&#xD;
      will integrate continuously updating content consisting of short exercises based on&#xD;
      principles of positive psychology. This web-based self-help intervention is thought to&#xD;
      provide a mode of delivery (the combination: &quot;online&quot; &amp; &quot;positive psychology&quot;), which is&#xD;
      acceptable and engaging to youth, and might effectively promote mental health in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the website targets two different groups, we will evaluate the web-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention accordingly:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target group 1: Adolescents with a major depressive disorder (acute or remitted) Target group&#xD;
      2: Healthy Adolescents (no mental health condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will focus on target group 2. A study focusing on target group 1 can be&#xD;
      found in a separately registered clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      web-based self-help intervention to improve positive affect, reduce stress, alleviate&#xD;
      negative affect and depressive symptoms in adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating young people will be randomized to either the web-based intervention group or a&#xD;
      web-based control group (i.e. sham intervention / comparator). All participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at pre-, post-intervention, and at a two-week follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants in the web-based intervention group will report a significant&#xD;
      decrease of negative affect, depressive symptoms and perceived stress compared to&#xD;
      participants in the web-based control group. Participants in the web-based intervention group&#xD;
      will report a significant increase of positive affect compared to participants in the&#xD;
      web-based control group&#xD;
