  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pocket colposcope has 510k FDA clearance and has been successfully used in almost 1500&#xD;
      unique patients globally in Duke and non-Duke protocols to date. 400 women who are&#xD;
      HPV-positive and planned to undergo treatment at 6 Ministry of Health-supported outpatient&#xD;
      clinics in Kisumu County will be recruited to the study. After providing informed consent,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized 1:1 to either standard-of-care visual inspection or&#xD;
      colposcopy with the Pocket Colposcope&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women randomized to the standard-of-care arm will undergo VIA followed by Visual Inspection&#xD;
      with Lugol's Iodine (VILI). Women randomized to the Pocket Colposcope arm will undergo&#xD;
      Pocket-Assisted VIA (PA-VIA), green light imaging, and VILI using the Pocket Colposcope.&#xD;
      Women in both arms will have biopsies taken of any suspicious lesions, or two biopsies taken&#xD;
      in random locations if no lesions are visible. The locations of the biopsies will be based on&#xD;
      provider impression. After their study-exams and biopsies are taken, women who are eligible&#xD;
      for ablative treatment will be immediately treated in the clinic. Those with larger lesions&#xD;
      or lesions concerning for invasive cancer will be referred to the local hospital for an&#xD;
      excisional procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA): First, the cervix should be wiped with a cotton swab to remove any preexisting mucous and/or blood. A 3-5% acetic acid solution will be applied to the cervix using a spray bottle or fox swab. After approximately 1-minute, any changes to the cervix using the naked eye will be noted. Acetic acid may be reapplied if acetowhitening diminishes during visual inspection.&#xD;
Visual Inspection with Lugol's Iodine (VILI): After imaging with Acetic acid, Lugol's iodine will be applied using a fox swab noting any yellow or non-staining areas. Lesion location(s) will be noted on a clock-face diagram and used to direct biopsy if a lesion is present or random biopsies will be obtained from two quadrants in the absence of a visible lesion.</description>

    <description>Pocket-Assisted Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (PA-VIA): The cervix should be wiped with a cotton swab to remove any preexisting mucous and/or blood. A 3-5% acetic acid solution will be applied using a spray bottle or fox swab. After approximately 1-minute, using the Pocket Colposcope any changes to the cervix will be noted. Using the Calla Health image acquisition software, both white and green images of the cervix will be captured at low-resolution. High-resolution green light images will be obtained at the provider's discretion. Acetic acid may be reapplied between white and green imaging at the provider's discretion if acetowhitening diminishes.&#xD;
Pocket-Assisted Visual Inspection with Lugol's Iodine (PA-VILI): After imaging with AA, Lugol's iodine will be applied using a fox swab noting any yellow or non-staining areas. Images will be acquired. A biopsy will be obtained using the pocket. Random biopsies will be obtained from 2 quadrants in the absence of a visible lesion.</description>
