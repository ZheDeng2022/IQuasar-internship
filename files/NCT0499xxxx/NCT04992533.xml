  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to correlate functional outcomes and perioperative complications&#xD;
      with tourniquet use during high tibial osteotomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourniquet is widely used in orthopedic surgery, but its effect and safety in high tibial&#xD;
      osteotomy have not been studied. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of tourniquets&#xD;
      by comparing different timing of use.Investigators aimed to quantify the effect of tourniquet&#xD;
      use on reducing blood loss and to evaluate the impact of tourniquet use on functional and&#xD;
      clinical outcome.&#xD;
