  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      belzutifan (MK-6482) following a single oral 120 mg dose in participants with end stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD) before and after hemodialysis (HD) to each other and also to that of healthy&#xD;
      matched control participants. This study will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      single oral 120 mg dose of belzutifan in participants with ESRD and the extent of belzutifan&#xD;
      removed by HD.&#xD;
