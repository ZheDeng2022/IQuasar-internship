  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of cerebral palsy is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.&#xD;
      Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique that aims to reduce spasticity in the&#xD;
      lower limbs and improve motor function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the current study is designed to assess the effectiveness of Selective dorsal rhizotomy on&#xD;
      motor function in ambulant children with spastic diplegia. therefore, A convenient sample of&#xD;
      ambulant children with spastic diplegia will be allocated to two groups of equal numbers&#xD;
      (control and experimental)&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment is 4 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The pediatric balance scale; modified form of the Berg Balance Scale; is a valid and reliable used to assess functional balance in children with CP. The assessment will be conducted in accordance with the manual detailed instructions. The scale takes about 15 minutes to assess the child's functional performance in 3 dimensions representing sitting, standing, and postural change activities. It comprises a 14-items; each item was graded from 0 to 4 points giving a maximum total score 56 points, with a higher score representing a better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment is 4 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The gross motor function measure-88; a valid and reliable criterion referenced instrument; is currently used to evaluate the motor function over time in individuals with CP (Pal. It consists of 5 sections including; A) lying and rolling, B) sitting, C) crawling and kneeling, D) standing; E) walking, running, jumping. Each item was scored on a four-point scale as 0, 1, 2 or 3 with higher scores representing a better performance. The scoring key was; 0=does not initiate, 1=initiates the task (&lt;10%), 2=partial completion of the task (10% to &lt;100%), 3=task completed (100%). If an item was not tested it was marked as not tested.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy cost of walking</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment is 4 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The energy expenditure index (beats/meter) can be calculated as; walking heart rate (beats/min) minus resting heart rate (beats/ min) on walking velocity (meters/min). Each child will be instructed to avoid food intake for at least two hours before the test to avoid thermo genic effect of food on energy expenditure, and to wear comfortable clothes. Then, resting heart rate will be obtained for each child during comfortable sitting position for 5 minutes by using pulse oximeter. Walking heart rate and speed will be obtained immediately following a walking test (with a comfortable speed) for duration of 5 minutes in a walkway. Energy expenditure index is then calculated from the following equation: walking heart rate /resting heart rate /walking speed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>period of the treatment is 4 successive months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-minute walking test is an inexpensive, simple, practical, reliable, and valid measure of submaximal exercise capacity in children with and without disabilities. Children are instructed to walk around a marked hallway, 20 meters in length, as fast as possible for 6 minutes without stopping at a self-chosen walking speed. The time was recorded with a stopwatch, and the time was called every min. The total distance covered was measured in meters.</description>

    <description>Children of this group will receive a regular exercise rehabilitation program. Exercises are prescribed on an individual basis per the functional goal for each child. It primarily focuses on inhibition of abnormal movement patterns, enhancement of postural reactions, promotion of the development of postural mechanisms, building up a normal walking pattern, and preservation of the flexibility and functional joint mobility. Neurodevelopmental training, balance training, functional training, range of motion exercises and functional stretching exercises are basically used to achieve the goals. The program will be conducted by six licensed pediatric physical therapists for one hour/session, 3 times/week, and four successive months.</description>

    <description>A custom-made articulating ankle foot orthosis with a hinge at the level of the medial malleolus of the ankle is fabricated for each child from the same copolymer thermoplastic mold after casting with the subtalar joint in neutral position. The orthosis extended distally to the tip of the toes and proximally on the posterior surface of the leg to about 5 cm below the knee and secured to the foot by three straps across the forefoot, the front of the ankle, and to the anterior upper tibial portion. It is fabricated to permit free ankle dorsiflexion and lock the plantar flexion at 0 dorsiflexion. The splinting schedule started gradually for 2 h/day in the first month, 4 h/day in the second month to the entire wake-up time of the day in the third and fourth months to accommodate children to the orthosis.</description>

    <description>All SDRs were performed by a single neurosurgeon through an osteoplastic laminotomy from L2 to L5 that left the facet joints intact. After opening the dura, the posterior nerve roots of L2 to S1 were identified and divided into 3 to 6 rootlets. At L2, from 30% to 50% of the posterior nerve rootlets were sectioned without selective stimulation. Selective electric stimulation of each nerve rootlet was performed from L3 to S1. The percentage of rootlets sectioned at each level (table 3) was determined by the surgical team based on the electromyographic results obtained intrasurgically and knowledge of the presurgical assessment results. The laminae were replaced on the completion of the rootlet stimulation and secured with sutures in the yellow ligament and the supraspinous ligament.</description>
