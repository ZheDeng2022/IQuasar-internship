      Pilot study enrolling obese post HSCT (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) patients at&#xD;
      the hematology/oncology clinic at the Mattel Children's Hospital, University of California,&#xD;
      Los Angeles. Parameters include percent over the 95th percentile (%BMIp95), zBMI, fasting&#xD;
      metabolic metrics, addictive eating habits, and motivation for change.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study enrolling obese patients, age 13-30, in an addiction model based&#xD;
      smartphone mobile health (mHealth) weight loss intervention with coaching at a minimum of 100&#xD;
      days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients will be screened and enrolled by&#xD;
      the study coordinator, who will collect/submit biospecimens in addition to patient&#xD;
      demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes. At the initial visit and enrollment,&#xD;
      equipment will be disbursed to patients along with a schedule that outlines the 4-month&#xD;
      intervention plan. After the initial visit, participants will participate in two additional&#xD;
      in-clinic visits at 2 months and at the conclusion of the study at 4 months. Participants&#xD;
      will also be involved in weekly phone calls and daily weekday texts to discuss their status&#xD;
      for the 4 month duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will then correlate the results in change of BMI with patient characteristics,&#xD;
      adherence to intervention, changes in metabolic parameters, physical activity levels, and&#xD;
      addictive eating behaviors. Investigators are aiming to recruit a total of 20&#xD;
      adolescents/young adults total. No pilot group is necessary since the feasibility of this&#xD;
      intervention has been validated in prior published studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed model of delivery makes it possible to: 1) intervene with the participant and&#xD;
      provide autonomy, 2) deliver the material over an extended period of time in a more&#xD;
      convenient platform for the participant and families, 3) reduce many access barriers common&#xD;
      in conventional outpatient obesity interventions, such as transportation or missed days of&#xD;
      school and work, and 4) help youth develop skills to overcome their addictive eating&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients ≥ 13 and ≤ 30 years old with a history of HSCT of any type, at least 100 days&#xD;
             post-transplant at initial consultation of the study, will be eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both male and female patients will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must classify as obese, represented as Body mass index [BMI] ≥85th percentile&#xD;
             for age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must also be able to read English since the app intervention is only&#xD;
             available in English form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are ≤ 13 or ≥ 30 years old are not eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are &lt; 100 days post-transplant at initial consultation will not be&#xD;
             eligible for the study, but may become eligible if they are &gt;100 days post-transplant&#xD;
             at their next consultation that falls within the enrollment window.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose BMI does not fall under the obese category will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No patients will be excluded for any specific underlying medical condition, but&#xD;
             decisions will be made on a case by case basis if a patient's functioning is deemed to&#xD;
             significantly interfere with intervention participation.&#xD;
