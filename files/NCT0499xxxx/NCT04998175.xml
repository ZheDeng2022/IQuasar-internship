  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is designed to study the prognostic factors of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt&#xD;
      for iNPH by multi-omics research&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative T1-MRI, functional MRI and diffusion MRI imaging data of iNPH patients were&#xD;
      collected. The clinical assessment was performed before/after the lumbar puncture test and 6&#xD;
      months after VP shunt. Clinical assessment included Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE),&#xD;
      gait scores, Kiefer score, and Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The cerebrospinal fluid was&#xD;
      collected by tap-test, and 6 months after surgery by puncturing in the VP device pump.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods- The primary methods used are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The cerebrospinal fluid proteomic analysis of iNPH patients before and after VP shunt&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The structral and functional MRI analysis of iNPH patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The clinical assessment of MMSE, gait scores, Kiefer score, and mRS. Objective- To study&#xD;
           the prognostic factors of VP shunt for iNPH.&#xD;
