    <textblock>
      Recent research in strength training physiology revealed that implementation of occlusion&#xD;
      garments around the proximal aspect of the lower limbs in combination with low load strength&#xD;
      training causes a reduced blood flow and thus providing a high metabolic stimulus, causing a&#xD;
      training effect similar to high load training. This study will investigate the added effect&#xD;
      of BFR focussing on functional outcome, pain-management and lower limb strength in patients&#xD;
      with knee osteoarthritis. Therefore, 234 patiens will be divided into three equal groups&#xD;
      (n=78), (control group, sham group and BFR-group) which will be subjected to a 12-week during&#xD;
      standard strength training program, 2 times a week for 60 minutes. The first group, which&#xD;
      will be submitted to low load resistance training commonly used in contemporary physiotherapy&#xD;
      for OA, will serve as a control group whereas both the BFRT and Sham groups will objectify&#xD;
      the additional value of implementing vascular occlusion in respective low load resistance&#xD;
      training protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Recent research in strength training physiology, revealed that implementation of occlusion&#xD;
      garments around the proximal aspect of the segment submitted to strength training (i.e. the&#xD;
      upper thigh, in case of lower limb and knee joint training) results in significant increments&#xD;
      in metabolic and mechanical muscle loading, facilitating neuromuscular responses in terms of&#xD;
      muscle fiber recruitment and muscle fiber hypertrophy/gains in muscle mass, even at fairly&#xD;
      low training dosages (&lt;50% of 1RM). As a consequence, BFR guided resistance training at low&#xD;
      training intensities renders a training response similar to what can be expected from high&#xD;
      intensity strength training. Occlusion at the proximal site of the segment submitted to&#xD;
      strength training, reduces both vascular in- and outflow. This reduced blood flow is thought&#xD;
      to induce an ischemic/hypoxic environment that enhances the training effect in the exercising&#xD;
      muscle, leading to increased muscle mass and strength. In accordance with this theoretic&#xD;
      framework, results of a recent study which compared the training effects between High&#xD;
      Intensity Resistance Training (HIRT), Low Intensity Resistance Training (LIRT) and Low&#xD;
      Intensity Resistance Training with BFR (BFRT), demonstrated that both the HIRT and the BFRT&#xD;
      resulted in similar significant improvements in 1RM knee extension strength, functional&#xD;
      performance and Quadriceps Cross Sectional Area (CSA), whereas no differences were found&#xD;
      after a 12 week period of LIRT. On the contrary, pain scores objectified by means of the&#xD;
      Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) significantly reduced&#xD;
      in the BFRT, whereas this was not the case for the HIRT group in which 4 patients were also&#xD;
      excluded due to the onset of exercise-induced knee pain. Although previous scientific&#xD;
      research has already provided a quite solid proof of concept by assessing the short term&#xD;
      results of BFR training in small sample sizes of patients at risk of or suffering from knee&#xD;
      OA, ready-to-use guidelines and specific implementation instructions of BFR-based physical&#xD;
      therapy and strength training are non-existent at present. With this TBM project, it is our&#xD;
      intention to reinforce the scientific evidence regarding the substantial benefits and&#xD;
      significant added value of BFR-guided low intensity resistance training in both the&#xD;
      stabilization and rehabilitation of knee osteoarthritis, as well as to provide the clinicians&#xD;
      ((para)medics and trainers) in hospital, clinical practice and fitness/training settings with&#xD;
      specific guidelines with regard to practical implementation of respective exercise protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done using a large scale Randomized Clinical Trial Design in which a&#xD;
      standardized strength training protocol will be implemented for functional rehabilitation&#xD;
      purposes in a population of 234 participants diagnosed with knee OA, using three different&#xD;
      loading categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (n=78) Low Load Resistance Training (Control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (n=78) Blood Flow Restricted Low Load Resistance Training (BFRT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  (n=78) Low Load Resistance Training with sham BFR component (Sham). The first group,&#xD;
           which will be submitted to low load resistance training commonly used in contemporary&#xD;
           physiotherapy for OA, will serve as a control group whereas both the BFRT and Sham&#xD;
           groups will objectify the additional value of implementing vascular occlusion in&#xD;
           respective low load resistance training protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a 12 week during standardised strength program, 2 times a week&#xD;
      for 60 minutes. To evaluate and objectify any training effect, patient overall Quality of&#xD;
      Life (QoL) and knee function, 4 screening moments are planned; at baseline (week 0), after 6&#xD;
      weeks, post intervention (13 weeks) and a follow-up screening after 6 months to assess the&#xD;
      retention effect and thus, the sustainability of this training modality.&#xD;
