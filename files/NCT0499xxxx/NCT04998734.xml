    <textblock>
      The Swedish version of ASI-SR has shown good feasibility in assessment of addiction patients&#xD;
      functioning compare to long and time-consuming ASI, which is upp to date golden standard in&#xD;
      Sweden. This study investigate if ASI-SR is suitable instrument for the assessment of the&#xD;
      chronic pain patient addicted to opioids. The validation process is designed according to the&#xD;
      COSMIN guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results are expected by December 2022.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of opioids in treatment of chronic non- cancer pain (CNCP) has increased during the&#xD;
      past decades in most parts of the western world. Use of prescription opioids can lead to&#xD;
      problematic opioid use which can be life-threatening with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Studies have found that 21-29% of CNCP patients receiving chronic opioid therapy&#xD;
      (COT) ( receiving opioids for &gt; 90 days) have problematic opioid use. Individuals with&#xD;
      chronic pain and co-occurring substance use disorders and/or mental health disorders, have&#xD;
      increased risk for problematic use of prescribed opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several screening instruments and strategies have been introduced in recent years for&#xD;
      identifying patients not suitable for opioid therapy. Even so, there is no single test or&#xD;
      instrument that can reliably identify those patients at risk for developing problematic&#xD;
      opioid use or opioid use disorder if opioid therapy is initiated, or identify those who need&#xD;
      increased monitoring during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addiction Severity Index (ASI) is a standardized semi-structured interview used for assessing&#xD;
      severity and need of treatment in seven functional domains associated to substance use&#xD;
      disorders; physical health, employment/support status, alcohol use, drug use, legal status,&#xD;
      family/social functioning and psychiatric health. The ASI was developed in the US. by&#xD;
      McLellan and colleagues and is widely used all over the world, both in research and for&#xD;
      clinical assessment and treatment evaluations . The ASI could be a useful instrument for a&#xD;
      multidimensional assessment of patients with chronic non-cancer where opioid treatment is&#xD;
      considered, and it could also be used for evaluation of ongoing opioid therapy . However, the&#xD;
      ASI interview is a time consuming instrument. To conduct an interview takes between 45-60&#xD;
      minutes and is followed by 20-25 minutes of administrative work. In the year of 2000 Rosen et&#xD;
      al tested a short self-report form based the items used to calculate the ASI composite scores&#xD;
      that asses current function and problem severity. This questionnaire was translated by our&#xD;
      research group and tested on a sample of individuals referred to the Addiction clinic at&#xD;
      Uppsala University Hospital. The study suggested that a self-administered questionnaire based&#xD;
      on the subscales of the ASI composite scores is a feasible alternative to the ASI interview&#xD;
      for assessing patient functioning in the different domains and screen for current problematic&#xD;
      alcohol- or drug use .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A validated screening tool that provides both an effective method of assessing patients and&#xD;
      identifying problems in several different life domains, and identify substance use related&#xD;
      problems if they should arise, would be beneficial in clinical practice when deciding what&#xD;
      treatment to offer. Such an instrument could potentially decrease the risk of iatrogenic&#xD;
      opioid use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose and aims The main objective with this study is to test the psychometric properties of&#xD;
      the ASI-SR in a population of CNCP patients. 'Secondary aim is to describe differences&#xD;
      between subjects treated within the substitution therapy program and those who are treated&#xD;
      within the pain clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Participants for this study will be recruited from outpatient pain clinic and&#xD;
      addiction clinic at Uppsala University Hospital, and Linköping University Hospital Sweden.&#xD;
      Eligible for participation are persons &gt;18-65 years of age with current CNCP and ongoing&#xD;
      treatment at the facilities. Estimated number of participant needed is about 200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are severe cognitive impairment, illiterate in Swedish, and inability to&#xD;
      give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Eligible participants will be approached and asked if they can consider to&#xD;
      participate in the study by clinical staff at the facilities. If they accept, they will&#xD;
      receive an e-mail with a link to the questionnaires and to written information about the&#xD;
      study. If they decide to participate they will give informed consent by signing a digital&#xD;
      consent form. A digital battery of questionnaires containing the ASI-SR and a validity&#xD;
      battery will then be provided to the participants to fill out. The validity battery will&#xD;
      consist of self-report forms. To participants that do not respond to the questionnaires and&#xD;
      have not declined participation, reminders will be sent out by text-messages, e-mail and&#xD;
      mail. Four days after the participants have completed the questionnaires they will receive an&#xD;
      e-mail with a link the ASI-SR form to fill out once more to test re-test reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that do not want to or do not have access to the digitalized versions of the&#xD;
      questionnaires will be offered to fill out paper versions of the questionnaires sent to them&#xD;
      by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures ASI-SR is a 38 question self-administered form based on the items used to calculate&#xD;
      the ASI's composite scores, measuring current problems and severity in seven domains . The CS&#xD;
      ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validity battery consist of self-administered questionnaires that correspond to six out&#xD;
      of seven of the ASI-SR's domains. These questionnaires will be used as concurrent validity&#xD;
      measures for all the ASI-SR composite scores (CS) except the CS for legal situation. The&#xD;
      participants will fill out questions about current pain intensity and pain interference, the&#xD;
      Rand 36 for multidimensional health related quality of life , pain related disability Pain&#xD;
      Disability Index (PDI) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) which measures disability across&#xD;
      domains of work/school, social life, and family life/home responsibilities . The Alcohol Use&#xD;
      Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) will be used for assessment of problematic alcohol use&#xD;
      and the Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT) for assessment of problematic illicit&#xD;
      drug use . PHQ9 will assess depressive symptoms and the GAD 7 will be used for assessment of&#xD;
      anxiety symptoms . Patient global impression of change (P-GIC) will be used to evaluate if&#xD;
      the participants experienced any changes in global health between test-retest of the ASI-SR.&#xD;
      P-GIC is gold standard for measuring change in CNCP patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Statistical analyses will be done using SPSS (Version 23, IBM SPSS Statistics for&#xD;
      Windows, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Calculation of the CS follow standard procedure . Consistency&#xD;
      of CS between the interview and the self-report will be evaluated on the individual basis by&#xD;
      interclass correlation analysis (ICC) and at group level with paired t-test or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed rank test if data is not normally distributed. ICC coefficient is considered to be&#xD;
      poor if it is less than 0.40, fair between 0.40-0.59 , good between 0.60-0.70 and excellent&#xD;
      between 0.75-1.00 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability and internal consistency will be evaluated using Cronbach's α. The α coefficient&#xD;
      is considered acceptable if it is above 0.70 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concurrent validity of each score will be assessed with suitable correlation analyses&#xD;
      between the ASI-SR composite score(s) and the external validity measure(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess discriminant validity of the ASI-SR composite scores and external validity&#xD;
      measures, an intercorrelation matrix between ASI-SR composite scores, and composite scores&#xD;
      and external measures will be computed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For evaluating factor structure principal component analyses (PCA) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance for the field Opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain has emerged as a&#xD;
      problematic treatment and the evidence is scarce for its effectiveness . However, there are&#xD;
      some individuals that seem to benefit from opioid therapy and most guidelines propose an&#xD;
      individual approach to management, beginning with a comprehensive patient evaluation,&#xD;
      focusing on factors that may indicate potential substance use disorder. When opioids are&#xD;
      used, clinicians should closely monitor patients for loss of response, adverse effects or&#xD;
      aberrant behavior, and assess treatment outcome . There is a need for a multi-dimensional&#xD;
      instrument that can assess problems related to increased risk for developing problematic&#xD;
      opioid use, i.e. opioid use disorder, psychiatric co-morbidity and social problems. The&#xD;
      ASI-SR could be an effective way of screening for current problems in different life domains&#xD;
      and to monitor and evaluate ongoing treatment and identify problems if they would arise.&#xD;
      Additional measures include urine or saliva drug testing, prescription practice, opioid&#xD;
      treatment agreements, and universal precautions in conjunction with opioid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study will be sent to the Regional Ethical Review Board in&#xD;
      Uppsala. Participants will be anonymous and all data will be coded before processed.&#xD;
