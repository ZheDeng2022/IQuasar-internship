  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the concentrations of casirivimab and&#xD;
      imdevimab in serum over time after a single subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of SC or IM single administration of casirivimab&#xD;
           and imdevimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the occurrence of adverse events of special interest (AESIs), defined as grade&#xD;
           ≥3 injection site reactions and grade ≥3 hypersensitivity reactions, in participants&#xD;
           treated with SC or IM doses of casirivimab and imdevimab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the immunogenicity of casirivimab and imdevimab&#xD;

             SARS-CoV-2 infection, including convalescent plasma, convalescent sera, hyperimmune&#xD;
             globulin, or other monoclonal antibodies (eg, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, sotrovimab)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has initiated vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 with an investigational or approved vaccine,&#xD;
             but has not completed the vaccine schedule as recommended by the vaccine manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Plans to receive an investigational or approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine within 90 days&#xD;
             after study drug administration, or per the recommended time frame from the current&#xD;
