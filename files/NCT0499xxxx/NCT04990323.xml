  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cord blood (CB) transplants are an option for patients lacking an HLA identical donor but are&#xD;
      hampered by low cell dose, prolonged aplasia and high transplant related mortality. UM171, a&#xD;
      novel and potent agonist of hematopoietic stem cell self renewal could solve this major&#xD;
      limitation, allowing for CB's important qualities as lower risk of chronic GVHD and relapse&#xD;
      to prevail. In previous trials (NCT02668315, NCT03913026, NCT04103879, and NCT03441958), the&#xD;
      CB expansion protocol using the ECT-001-CB technology (UM171 molecule) has proven to be&#xD;
      technically feasible and safe in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UM171 expanded CB was associated with a prompt (D+17), robust (98%) and durable neutrophil&#xD;
      recovery. Amongst patients who received a single UM171 CB transplant with a median follow-up&#xD;
      of 18 months, risk of TRM (10%), grade 3-4 acute GVHD (13%) and moderate-severe chronic GVHD&#xD;
      (2%) was low at 1 year post-transplant. Incidence of severe viral and bacterial infections&#xD;
      was reduced and immunosuppression could be discontinued in 77% of patients at 1 year. Thus,&#xD;
      PFS and GRFS were very promising, 72% and 59% at 12 months, 69% and 53% at 24 months,&#xD;
      respectively, in particular accounting for a large proportion of very high-risk patients. By&#xD;
      a 10-fold increase of CB accessibility, ECT-001-CB allowed access to smaller, better HLA&#xD;
      matched CBs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new study seeks to test a similar strategy in a group of pediatric and young adult&#xD;
      patients with high risk myeloid malignancies. 12 patients will be enrolled in the first stage&#xD;
      of this 2-stage design protocol. If intervention is considered promising (&lt;= 3 relapses in&#xD;
      the first 12 patients), this study will open multicenter and be extended to a second stage&#xD;
      (16 additional patients for a total accrual 28).&#xD;
