  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to gain more insight in the immunological characteristics and immune response&#xD;
      on a local level (the nose) and systemic level (the blood) of healthy people vaccinated with&#xD;
      the current available COVID-19 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA; BNT162b2) and viral vector&#xD;
      based (ChAdOx1) vaccines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunological assays that will be performed on blood include immunophenotyping, serologic&#xD;
      testing and cytokine analysis. Deep characterization of patients' immune profile offers a&#xD;
      unique opportunity for comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccination. The investigators will study&#xD;
      immunological functions on the level of both adaptive and innate immunity by performing&#xD;
      extensive immunophenotyping, cytokine analysis and RNA sequencing analysis. Biomarker&#xD;
      analysis will be performed on protein and on RNA single cell level. Infectivity of different&#xD;
      cell types including macrophages will performed. These analyses will be performed at the&#xD;
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Cure Research Center (HCRC) laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal fluid: The investigators will compare the immune response and immunoglobulin production&#xD;
      in nasal secretions before and after SARS-CoV2 vaccination. The investigators aim to compare&#xD;
      the local versus the systemic (blood/serum) response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination. Further,&#xD;
      patients that had a proven SARS-CoV2 infection will be compared with patients that never had&#xD;
      COVID-19 symptoms nor antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire: a questionnaire will be filled in by the individual to assess if the&#xD;
      individual went through a previous SARS-CoV2 infection and experienced symptoms post&#xD;
      vaccination. The questionnaires are available as supplementary documents.&#xD;
