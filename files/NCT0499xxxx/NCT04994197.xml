  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetron Uro V1 perform mutation detection of 17 genes and methylation detection of 1 gene by&#xD;
      using urine samples and tumor tissue samples. It is a urine liquid biopsy method that has a&#xD;
      great supplementary effect on the existing clinical differential diagnosis technology. The&#xD;
      main aim of this study is to compare the test results of Genetron Uro V1 with the standard&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis results, and analyze the performance of Genetron Uro V1 in the diagnosis&#xD;
      and recurrence diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma is mainly based on imaging examination, urine&#xD;
      examination and endoscopy. Imaging examinations include ultrasound, CT, MRI, etc., which have&#xD;
      limited clinical value when used alone, and are difficult to meet the demand for qualitative&#xD;
      research on tumors. The current common methods are urine exfoliated cytology and fluorescence&#xD;
      in situ hybridization (FISH). Urine exfoliative cytology is one of the main methods for&#xD;
      diagnosis of urothelial cancer and follow-up after surgery. But the sensitivity of urine&#xD;
      exfoliated cytology is about 13%-75%, and the specificity is 85%-100%. FISH can detect&#xD;
      chromosomal abnormalities in urine exfoliated cells, and combined with urine exfoliated&#xD;
      cytology can greatly improve the sensitivity of diagnosis, but the increased cost of multiple&#xD;
      examination methods limits its use in diagnosis and each postoperative follow-up. Endoscopy&#xD;
      includes cystoscopy and ureteroscopy. Cystoscopy is the most reliable way to diagnose bladder&#xD;
      cancer, and some patients with upper urinary tract urothelial cancer also have bladder&#xD;
      cancer. Therefore, cystoscopy is almost the &quot;gold standard&quot; method for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      urothelial cancer. For most upper urinary tract urothelial cancers, ureteroscopic biopsy is&#xD;
      the only method that can be used to pathological diagnosis before surgical resection.&#xD;
      However, endoscopy is an invasive examination, which will cause additional pain and&#xD;
      complications to the patient, and the resulting local adhesions or trauma will also increase&#xD;
      the risk of postoperative recurrence. The characteristics of urothelial cancer are prone to&#xD;
      recurrence. Therefore, there are strict follow-up time and standards after surgery. Endoscopy&#xD;
      examination is required every three months or six months, which also increases the pain and&#xD;
      expense of patients. Based on the above considerations, finding an accurate, non-destructive&#xD;
      and economical urine biopsy diagnosis method is an urgent problem in the clinical research of&#xD;
      urothelial cancer. Genetron Uro V1 has sensitivity, specificity, and NPV of the&#xD;
      pre-diagnostic test for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma reached 92.2%, 91.9%, and&#xD;
      94.1%, respectively. Another urine biopsy method based on low-coverage whole-genome&#xD;
      sequencing to detect copy number variation (CNV) in patients with urothelial tumors reported&#xD;
      its application performance in the diagnosis of urothelial cancer, and its total sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity reached 80.4% and 94.9%, respectively. This project is to optimize new liquid&#xD;
      biopsy methods (Genetron Uro V1 and LC-WGS)that will bring greater benefits to the clinic&#xD;
      through more standard and larger clinical trials.&#xD;
