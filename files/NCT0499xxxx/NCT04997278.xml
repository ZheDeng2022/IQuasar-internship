  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether a new spinal cord stimulation paradigm, called&#xD;
      Coordinate Reset (CR) Stimulation, can provide equivalent or better pain relief with reduced&#xD;
      energy requirements. The investigators will test this new stimulation paradigm in patients&#xD;
      who are already undergoing spinal cord stimulation surgery. The investigators will also study&#xD;
      whether there are changes in electroencephalography (brain waves) associated with this new&#xD;
      stimulation paradigm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope to learn whether CR stimulation can provide equivalent or better pain&#xD;
      relief with reduced energy requirements. They also hope to learn whether there are changes in&#xD;
      brain function with effective CR stimulation compared to conventional stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be testing a specific stimulation paradigm in people who have already&#xD;
      consented to have spinal cord stimulation performed for treatment of their chronic pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will be identified from the pool of candidates for spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      (SCS) therapy at Stanford University. Subjects will have undergone a successful trial of&#xD;
      Boston Scientific spinal cord stimulation and will either be candidates for permanent&#xD;
      stimulator implantation, or will have already undergone implantation. Ten subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited over a one year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, subjects will be assessed to assure that they meet the criteria&#xD;
      for study entry. All subjects will undergo SCS implantation and will be optimized on standard&#xD;
      SCS (sSCS) settings using the standard clinical protocol, including paresthesia mapping,&#xD;
      threshold finding, and adjustment of stimulation parameters to provide reduction in pain.&#xD;
      Therapeutic sSCS will be maintained for a minimum of one month prior to baseline assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments will be conducted following discontinuation of SCS for 24 hours. This&#xD;
      assessment battery includes a physical and neurological exam, visual analog scale (VAS)&#xD;
      score, Oswestry Disability Index, SF-12 and Global Assessment of Functioning, as well as EEG&#xD;
      recordings (spontaneous EEG recording + dedicated pain-related evoked response recording).&#xD;
      Following this baseline assessment, sSCS will be delivered for one month. Stimulation&#xD;
      parameters will be held constant for the last 7 days of this period. During this time,&#xD;
      subjects will use the CamNtech Pro-Diary wrist-worn data entry system to rate their back&#xD;
      pain, leg pain and overall pain (3 questions), 3 times per day (morning, afternoon evening).&#xD;
      The Pro-Diary allows for configurable, portable data entry as well as actigraphy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full assessment battery will be repeated, and the stimulator deactivated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a washout period of three hours, VAS and EEG recordings will be performed. CR-SCS&#xD;
      will be enabled by means of a firmware upgrade. Personnel from Boston Scientific will perform&#xD;
      this upgrade. The stimulator will then be programmed to deliver CR-SCS. At the end of one&#xD;
      month of CR-SCS (with stimulation parameters similarly held constant for the last 7 days),&#xD;
      the assessment battery will be repeated, and VAS and EEG recordings will again be performed&#xD;
      after a three hour washout period. Finally, a firmware downgrade will be performed by Boston&#xD;
      Scientific Personnel, and patients will be treated with sSCS at their previous settings.&#xD;

    <description>Abnormal neuronal synchrony in terms of enhanced 4-9 Hz theta oscillations in EEG/MEG recordings appears to be an important pathophysiological finding in patients with neurogenic pain. To specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchrony, we here set out to perform Coordinated Reset (CR)-Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS). CR stimulation (Tass, 2003) aims at an anti-kindling, i.e. an &quot;unlearning&quot; or resetting of abnormal neuronal synchrony and abnormal synaptic connectivity, and, hence, long-lasting, sustained therapeutic effects that persist following cessation of stimulation (Tass &amp; Majtanik, 2006).</description>
