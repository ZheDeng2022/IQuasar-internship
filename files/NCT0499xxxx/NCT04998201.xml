  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants who have met all protocol eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment (ARO-APOC3 or placebo) in a double-blind fashion and will be evaluted for safety&#xD;
      and efficacy over 48 weeks. Participants will be counseled to remain on a specified diet&#xD;
      throughout the study, as recommended by the Investigator in accordance with local standard of&#xD;
      care. After week 48, participants will be eligible and invited to consent and continue in an&#xD;
      open-label extension study. All placebo participants who opt to continue will switch to&#xD;
      active drug (ARO-APOC3) during the extension study.&#xD;
