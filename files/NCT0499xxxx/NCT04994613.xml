    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to prospectively examine the preoperative anxiety scores of&#xD;
      ASD patients in an adaptive sensory environment. Additionally, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      determine the relationship of severity of sensory integration in ASD patients and their&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety scores. The study will also study the family satisfaction with tailored&#xD;
      care of their ASD child in the peri-operative environment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Dayton Children's, all patients with autism or other developmental delays are called prior&#xD;
      to the day of surgery by child life specialists to obtain a coping plan to be entered into&#xD;
      the EHR. Those patients that meet the criteria will be approached via telephone call 24-48&#xD;
      hours prior to procedure by the research team to describe the study and gauge interest in&#xD;
      participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study will recruit a total of sixty patients in two parallel groups randomized to&#xD;
      1:1 allocation: control group (standard practice with no sensory adaptive environment) or&#xD;
      intervention group (sensory adaptive environment). Patients will be randomized in varying&#xD;
      block sizes using a random number generator to ensure equal numbers in each group. The random&#xD;
      allocation, block sizes, and block sequences will be concealed from study personnel and each&#xD;
      patient until the time a patient is assigned to a group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the preoperative area of main campus perioperative services there are three dedicated&#xD;
      adaptive sensory friendly rooms for patients to await surgery. For the sensory adaptive&#xD;
      environment, the room will be set up in accordance with the patient's coping plan and&#xD;
      individual needs regarding sound, light, activity level, and other stimuli. The equipment may&#xD;
      include a portable popcorn tube with fiberoptic cart, handheld marble panel, color changing&#xD;
      floor tiles, other sensory friendly objects, and individual sensory toys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After registration and informed consent, the patient will be placed in either a standard&#xD;
      preoperative room (control) or the dedicated sensory rooms (intervention) in the preoperative&#xD;
      surgery area based on prior randomization. The patient's behaviors will be recorded by a&#xD;
      research assistant at three time points (registration, nursing intake in preoperative room,&#xD;
      and immediately prior to transition to operating room) by utilizing the validated modified&#xD;
      Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS). The mYPAS is the most widely used tool for assessing&#xD;
      preoperative anxiety in children. The total score on the mYPAS will be the primary outcome&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the mYPAS measurements, the patient will be evaluated in the operating room&#xD;
      utilizing the validated Child Induction Behavioral Assessment Scale (CIBA). The CIBA is a&#xD;
      3-category behavioral assessment for documenting children's behavioral responses to induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia. The 3 categories, Smooth, Moderate, and Difficult have associated behavioral&#xD;
      descriptions that are scored at the time of anesthesia induction. The CIBA will be evaluated&#xD;
      by the assigned anesthesia staff and documented in the EHR, as current standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the patient is in the procedure, families will fill out two questionnaires in the&#xD;
      waiting room. The first is a 23-item questionnaire (Patient Experience Study Survey)&#xD;
      regarding the patient preoperative experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second questionnaire is the Short Sensory Profile 2 (SSP-2), which assesses the patient's&#xD;
      sensory processing abilities. The SSP-2 score will be used as a surrogate for the severity of&#xD;
      sensory sensitivity in the study patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the SSP-2, the following independent variables will be extracted from the&#xD;
      medical record: patient demographics (sex, age, weight), ASA score designated by&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, diagnosis and health history, procedure, home medications, preoperative&#xD;
      medications including dose and route, intraoperative medications, event times and durations&#xD;
      (including preoperative wait time, transport to OR time, induction to anesthesia ready, case&#xD;
      length, &amp; recovery time), and first recovery room pain score (documented by PACU RN via FLACC&#xD;
      score).&#xD;

    <description>The validated modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) will be utilized to assess anxiety and behaviors at three time points in the preoperative process, to include registration in the surgery lobby, preoperative nurse intake in the individual room, and immediately prior to transition to operating room.mYPAS consists of 5 items; 4 of the items (Activity, Emotional Expressivity, State of Apparent Arousal, and Use of Parent) are rated on scales of 1-4, and 1 item (Vocalizations) is rated on a scale of 1-6. The total score is determined by dividing each item rating by its highest possible rating, summing the results, dividing by 5, and then multiplying by 100. Total scores can range from 23.33 to 100, with higher scores representing greater anxiety.</description>

    <description>is the Short Sensory Profile 2 (SSP-2), which assesses the patient's sensory processing abilities. The SSP-2 score will be used as a surrogate for the severity of sensory sensitivity in the study patient. The SSP-2 consists of 34 behavioral items measured on 5-point Likert scales from 1 = almost never to 5 = almost always. Items are divided into 4 quadrants for scoring, Seeking (7 items), Avoiding (9 items), Sensitivity (10 items), and Registration (8 items) based on Dunn's Sensory Processing Framework. Two subscale scores, Sensory Processing and Behavioral Responses Associated with Sensory Processing, as well as total scores are also determined. Raw scores are compared to a normal curve and Sensory Profile 2 Classification System developed from a normative sample.</description>

    <description>Patient's primary caregiver will document on a 23-item questionnaire (Patient Experience Study Survey) regarding the patient preoperative experience. The first section includes yes/no questions regarding parent's discussions with Dayton Children's Child Life prior to the day of surgery in developing the coping plan. The second and third sections use positively worded statements measured on 5-point Likert scales from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. These two sections discuss the preoperative holding room and environment on the day of surgery (9 items), and how the perioperative team related to the patient (5 items). Total scores across all items will be determined, as well as scores within each of the 3 sections. A final item will ask the family to rate the overall experience on a 10-point scale from 1 = very dissatisfied to 10 = very satisfied.</description>
