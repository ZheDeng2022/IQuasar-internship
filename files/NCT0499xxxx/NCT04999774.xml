  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently committed to promote the control of&#xD;
      strongyloidiasis within 2030 targets for STH control programmes. A specific target is to&#xD;
      establish by 2030 an efficient strongyloidiasis control programme in school aged children&#xD;
      (SAC), envisaging ivermectin preventive chemotherapy (PC) of SAC at risk of morbidity due to&#xD;
      strongyloidiasis. The monitoring of such ambitious PC activity strictly requires appropriate&#xD;
      diagnostic tools, but fundamental gaps exist in this field. Indeed, until now at the moment&#xD;
      no consensus method for the diagnosis of S. stercoralis infection is recommended and the&#xD;
      absence of a gold standard test limits capacity for effective diagnosis, surveillance and&#xD;
      disease control. The aim of this project is to provide fundamental information on the&#xD;
      performance and applicability of diagnostic methods for the assessment of S. stercoralis&#xD;
      infection to inform the forthcoming WHO global strongyloidiasis control program to be&#xD;
      implemented as a part of the WHO 2030 disease control targets. ESTRELLA is a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study in an area of high prevalence of strongyloidiasis (San Lorenzo, Esmeraldas, Ecuador).&#xD;
      The study will have a school-based approach, and each enrolled SAC will be asked to supply&#xD;
      fecal and blood samples for testing with different methods for the diagnosis of S.&#xD;
      stercoralis infection.&#xD;

      Aim and objectives The aim of this project is to provide fundamental information on the&#xD;
      performance and applicability of diagnostic methods for the assessment of S. stercoralis&#xD;
      infection to inform the forthcoming WHO global strongyloidiasis control program to be&#xD;
      implemented as a part of the WHO 2030 disease control targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the accuracy of selected diagnostic methods currently available for the&#xD;
           diagnosis of S. stercoralis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate acceptability of each test and related sample collection method by the&#xD;
           target population;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the feasibility of each assay for the deployment as a field-based diagnostic,&#xD;
           and as a monitoring and evaluation tool in endemic areas&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods A cross-sectional study in an area of high prevalence of strongyloidiasis, based on&#xD;
      previously-collected, preliminary data. The study will have a school-based approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study area and participants The study will be conducted in Ecuador, in San Lorenzo,&#xD;
      Esmeraldas province. Administratively, San Lorenzo is divided into 12 rural parishes (Alto&#xD;
      Tambo, Ancón de Sardinas (Palma Real), Calderón, Carondelet, 5 de junio, Concepción, Mataje,&#xD;
      San Javier de Cachavíì, Santa Rita, Tambillo, Tululbíì- Ricaurte, Urbina), two of which can&#xD;
      only be reached by sea (Tambillo which is an island, and Ancon de Sardinas or Palma Real&#xD;
      located on the shores of the ocean).&#xD;
&#xD;
      San Lorenzo health district has its headquarters in the capital city where there is a&#xD;
      hospital with 75 beds and 4 basic specialties (medicine, paediatrics, gyneco-obstetrics and&#xD;
      surgery), and a 24-hour health center for outpatient visits, laboratory tests, vaccinations,&#xD;
      minor surgery and assistance with uncomplicated birth. In addition, there are 12 health&#xD;
      centers in several localities, all recently renovated and equipped with electricity. In each&#xD;
      health centre there is a team composed by a physician doctor, a nurse, a dentist, a midwife&#xD;
      and a first-level health care worker. Health care is free, including medicines. However,&#xD;
      supplies are often lacking. Community epidemiology activities and basic health care-training&#xD;
      have been coordinated for years by the Cecomet team (Esmeraldas Center for Community&#xD;
      Epidemiology and Tropical Medicine). Each health center covers variable number of villages,&#xD;
      which receive a visit every 2/3 months from the health team. The latter carries out&#xD;
      preventive activities, monitors chronic patients and specific groups at risk. Some health&#xD;
      promoters, belonging to different ethnic groups, have been working on the territory for years&#xD;
      as volunteers, with the role of community health supervisors and coordinators between teams&#xD;
      and communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every month, promoters and teams participate in a meeting coordinated by Cecomet with the aim&#xD;
      to monitor the activities, discuss clinical cases and report the deaths. Participants are&#xD;
      invited to discuss possible measures to prevent morbidity and mortality, and plan the next&#xD;
      month's visits to the villages. The prevailing pathology reflects the epidemiological&#xD;
      transition underway in many countries of the southern hemisphere: alongside the persistence&#xD;
      of infectious / parasitic diseases such as malaria, Chagas disease, dengue, chikungunya,&#xD;
      tuberculosis, and leishmaniasis, chronic degenerative pathology, especially hypertension and&#xD;
      diabetes, has now considerable epidemiological importance. Intestinal parasites, given the&#xD;
      scarcity or non-existence of basic services (safe water and sanitation) continues to be a&#xD;
      major issue for children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in 5 of the 12 rural parishes of San Lorenzo, in the primary&#xD;
      schools of 7 villages (Calderon, Carondelet, Ricaurte, S.Rita, S.Francisco del Bogotà, La&#xD;
      Boca, Tambillo) mainly inhabited by Afro-descendants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Informative and educational meetings will be held in each community to&#xD;
      inform the population about strongyloidiasis, the objectives of the study and the methodology&#xD;
      for collecting samples. In this regard, educational leaflets, and audiovisual media adapted&#xD;
      to the local population culture will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dates for intervention will be planned in agreement with the communities, the local&#xD;
      authorities and the school managers. Informed consent from parents/guardians of the children&#xD;
      will be sought before study implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of the study, each participant will be invited to supply faeces and blood (from&#xD;
      finger prick) samples for the testing procedures, and will be treated (as PC) with ivermectin&#xD;
      200 mcg/Kg single dose and albendazole 400 mg single dose according to the international&#xD;
      standards and local protocols. A Case Report Form (CRF) will be used to collect information&#xD;
      on relevant symptoms and other relevant characteristics concerning the levels of sanitation.&#xD;
      Each CRF will be marked with an anonymized ID code, which will link the CRF to the samples&#xD;
      supplied by each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Faecal samples will be tested with Ritchie's formol-ether technique (for STH), Baermann&#xD;
      method (specific for S. stercoralis), and with a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)&#xD;
      for S. stercoralis. For the latter test, part of the stool will be preserved in ethanol for&#xD;
      transportation to the Laboratory of the Central University of Quito. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      obtained by finger prick, and will be collected on filter papers for subsequent analysis with&#xD;
      two ELISA assays (one based on crude antigen and one on a recombinant antigen) and a rapid&#xD;
      dipstick test (RDT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be carried out in the same country where samples are collected, in compliance&#xD;
      with what required by a test to be used in control programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Fecal tests Baermann method will be carried out according to the procedures described in&#xD;
      the &quot;Bench aids for the diagnosis of intestinal parasitosis&quot;, by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PCR is a real-time assay based on Verweji's method. Briefly, for DNA extraction, about&#xD;
      200 mg of feces are suspended in 200 µL of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2%&#xD;
      polyvinylpolypyrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich) and frozen overnight at -20 °C until the extraction.&#xD;
      After thawing and boiling, the samples are run by an automated extractor instrument&#xD;
      (Magnapure LC.2, Roche). The real-time assay is performed as described previously. The&#xD;
      amplification target is the small-subunit rRNA gene sequence for S. stercoralis. Appropriate&#xD;
      positive and negative controls are included in all the experiments. As control for PCR&#xD;
      inhibitors and amplification quality, the PhHV-1 control DNA is amplified with the&#xD;
      appropriate primers/probe mix in the same reaction as S. stercoralis in multiplex PCR. The&#xD;
      reactions, detection and data analysis are performed with the CFX96 detection system (Bio-Rad&#xD;
      Laboratories). In a previous retrospective study the method demonstrated a sensitivity of&#xD;
      56.8% (95%CI 41.0-71.6)[10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serological tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The InBios Strongy Detect TM IgG ELISA detects specific IgG antibodies to Strongyloides&#xD;
           recombinant antigens NIE and SsIR in serum. A previous kit included only NIE antigen,&#xD;
           and the addition of SsIR aims at improving the performance of the test, which consists&#xD;
           of an enzymatically amplified sandwich-type immunoassay. Positive and negative control&#xD;
           samples are provided in the kit. The test will be run and interpreted according to the&#xD;
           manufacturer's instruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bordier ELISA detects Strongyloides IgG antibodies by using somatic antigens from larvae&#xD;
           of Strongyloides ratti. A previous retrospective study estimated its sensitivity and&#xD;
           specificity at 90.8% (95%CI 85.8-95.7) and 94.0% (95%CI 91.2-96.9)[12], respectively.&#xD;
           The test is performed as per manufacturer's instructions. However, as the cut-off varies&#xD;
           between runs, we use a normalized Optical Density (OD) ratio to compare the results&#xD;
           obtained in different sessions. A ratio ≥1 defines positive results. The test is widely&#xD;
           available and deployed for routine screening and diagnostic activities across Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The RDT is a rapid dipstick test implemented by the Institute for Research in Molecular&#xD;
           Medicine (INFORMM) of the University Sains Malaysia, Malaysia. A previous study reported&#xD;
           sensitivity and specificity of 91.3% and 100%, respectively. The test result is&#xD;
           qualitative, based on the appearance/absence of a colored test band 15 minutes after&#xD;
           addition of the sample in the designated well. The presence of The test result two red&#xD;
           colored lines (test and control lines) is interpreted as positive, whereas the dipstick&#xD;
           that shows only one red line (control line) is interpreted as negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sample size calculation, sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic tests to be&#xD;
      evaluated were considered as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST Sensitivity Specificity Baerman 0.5 0.98 ELISA Bordier 0.9 0.93&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELISA NIE 0.7 0.91&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCR 0.6 0.95&#xD;
&#xD;
      RDT 0.9 1.0&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering an estimated prevalence of S. stercoralis infection of 50%, based on&#xD;
      previous preliminary evaluations, 800 people is the sample size needed to estimate&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of all tests with a 95% Confidence Interval of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints and Foreseen Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and clinical data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, measures of&#xD;
      variability and precision and plots. Statistical tests will be used based on type of&#xD;
      variables, tests assumptions and sample dimension. All parameters will be reported with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A) The sensitivity and specificity of the serologic assays and of the rapid test will be&#xD;
           first calculated against the results of Baermann and PCR, both considered virtually 100%&#xD;
           specific for the study purpose. Hence, the accuracy of each test will be calculated as&#xD;
           the proportion of positive results over all positive (for sensitivity) and negative (for&#xD;
           specificity) samples to Baermann and/or PCR. Uncertainty will be quantified by 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B) Considering that Baerman and PCR may have lower sensitivities than the other tests,&#xD;
           which may result in misevaluation of (too low) specificity of the other tests, the&#xD;
           sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value&#xD;
           (PPV) of all tests will be calculated also against a composite reference standard[16].&#xD;
           This will be based on a combination of the results of all tests, specifically: cases of&#xD;
           strongyloidiasis will be identified as participants with positive PCR AND/OR Baermann&#xD;
           AND/OR a positive serologic test plus the RDT OR two positive serologic tests. Moreover,&#xD;
           in the latent class analysis (LCA) probabilistic models will be fitted in order to&#xD;
           classify subjects as diseased or not diseased&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The acceptability of the activity will be assessed as a) the number of people consenting&#xD;
           to participate out of the whole target population to which participation to the study&#xD;
           will be offered; b) the actual provision of the required faecal/blood samples by each&#xD;
           consenting participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The feasibility of each technique will be evaluated a) calculating the number of samples&#xD;
           for which a result of each technique will be available out of all suitable samples&#xD;
           collected; when a result is not available, the reason (for instance problems with&#xD;
           material transfer/ preservative/other technical reasons) will be collected b)&#xD;
           investigating possible issues with a questionnaire administered to the laboratory&#xD;
           personnel&#xD;
