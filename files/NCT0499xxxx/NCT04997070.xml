  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study has been organised to investigate whether microfluidic technology may be&#xD;
      considered as a new procedure for routine sperm preparation during assisted reproduction.&#xD;
      This is a technique that is already used in other centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Microfluidic Sperm Sorting (MSS) technology reduces the time of sample preparation while&#xD;
      selects a sperm population with better motility and less DNA fragmentation as compared to&#xD;
      routine procedures. This med-ical device is already CE marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having the intention to implement this technology in our department, we conduct this study to&#xD;
      investigate whether the use of MSS has at least the same impact, if not better, on&#xD;
      fertilization and embryo quality as compared to standard sperm selection procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To perform ICSI, the best spermatozoa are selected based on their motility. This is done&#xD;
      using a standard procedure which is time-consuming and involves centrifugation steps known to&#xD;
      induce sperm DNA damage. Just before ICSI, the selection of the sperm cell that will be&#xD;
      injected into the egg is based on morphological assessment (at 400x inverted phase contrast&#xD;
      microscopy). However, the spermatozoa with DNA damage cannot be identified using microscopic&#xD;
      procedures and therefore cannot be excluded for ICSI. It was reported that the sperm cells&#xD;
      with DNA damage have a negative impact on embryo development and are correlated with&#xD;
      increased miscarriage rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A more &quot;close to nature&quot; approach is now available due to the microfluidic sperm sorting&#xD;
      (MSS) technology that is using FERTILE series devices (FERTILE and FERTILE PLUS, Koek EU,&#xD;
      GmbH). The method is based on the principle of natural sperm selection in a passage through&#xD;
      micro-barriers imitating natural environment of female reproductive system (fallopian tubes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This chemical-free technology does not require any pretreatment of the semen sample, while&#xD;
      the sorted sperm shows high motility and low levels of DNA damage. At the day of pick up, the&#xD;
      husband provides the semen sample. The sample obtained will be divided in 2 fractions: one&#xD;
      fraction will be subject to Microfluidic technology (fraction 1) and the other fraction will&#xD;
      represent the control (conventionally prepared sperm; fraction 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This device was tested in our laboratory on diagnostic semen samples and proved to select the&#xD;
      best sperm population when compared to the standard method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the encouraging results, we intend to apply microfluidic as the routine procedure for&#xD;
      sperm preparation in our department. This procedure will increase the chance of using sperm&#xD;
      cells without DNA damage during ICSI and therefore we expect better embryological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study has been organised to determine if the embryo quality on day 5 will be&#xD;
      similar or better when using microfluidic technology compared to standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment of ICSI, half of the eggs of good quality (mature) will be inseminated with&#xD;
      sperm from fraction 1 and the other half with sperm from fraction 2. The decision of which&#xD;
      fraction will be used to inject the first half of the oocytes is random and is based on a&#xD;
      list generated by the computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrieved oocytes will follow the normal lab procedure after injection: the embryos&#xD;
      available on day 3 or day 5/6 that meet our criteria for transfer or cryopreservation will be&#xD;
      used for transfer or cryopreservation, no matter from which fraction the sperm was used.&#xD;
