  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients admitted to the general intensive care unit suffer from pain, whether acute or&#xD;
      chronic. Those patients include post-operative patients, multi trauma, acute pancreatitis and&#xD;
      patients with multiple rib fractures. Most patients in the intensive care unit, whether&#xD;
      intubated and ventilated or not, are treated with systemic analgesic drugs, usually given&#xD;
      intravenously, enterally, or trans dermally (fentanyl patches).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous epidural anesthesia has been shown in several studies to have an advantage over&#xD;
      systemic analgesia in specific conditions, such as pancreatitis, multiple rib fractures and&#xD;
      upper abdominal surgeries. Some of its benefits include improved gastrointestinal motility&#xD;
      (reduction of ileus rates), decreased thromboembolic events (DVT) and better quality of pain&#xD;
      control. In intubated and ventilated patients, continuous epidural anesthesia may reduce the&#xD;
      amount of required systemic sedation. Reducing the amount of sedation may contribute to a&#xD;
      decrease in delirium rates, shortening the time to extubation and reducing other adverse&#xD;
      effects associated with high requirements of sedation drugs (such as a decrease in blood&#xD;
      pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies comparing systemic analgesia to epidural analgesia examined a population&#xD;
      of patients hospitalized in the surgical ward, post breast, abdominal or orthopedic surgeries&#xD;
      of the pelvis and lower extremities, or due to other conditions such as pancreatitis or&#xD;
      multiple rib fractures. There are almost no studies that have examined the effectiveness of&#xD;
      epidural analgesia in patients admitted to the intensive care unit, including sedated and&#xD;
      ventilated patients, compared with systemic analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2011 until today, our intensive care unit has admitted about 300 patients who were&#xD;
      treated with continuous epidural analgesia. In this study we would like to compare them to&#xD;
      another group of patients (about 300 patients as well), who were admitted to the unit for&#xD;
      similar etiologies (post-operative, multi- trauma, pancreatitis, etc.), and to observe&#xD;
      differences between the groups. We would like to examine differences in mortality within 28&#xD;
      days, as well as differences in morbidity, such as the level of analgesia and delirium rates&#xD;
      between groups.&#xD;
