  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with unconsciousness and analgesia, use a muscle relaxant (Neuromuscular blocking agent&#xD;
      NMBA) is now part of the classic triad of anesthesia. In surgery or interventional procedure&#xD;
      under general anesthesia, NMBA is needed to relax the muscles of the whole body. Its purpose&#xD;
      is to assist the placement of the endotracheal tube, avoid the participant's injury due to&#xD;
      involuntary movements, and also enables the surgeon to have a better surgical vision, etc.&#xD;
      Once the operation or procedure is completed, anesthesiologist will reverse the NMBA and&#xD;
      participants are recovered from general anesthesia. It is crucial to maintain hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability during this period. The participant's vital signs are unstable during this period&#xD;
      because the participant is gradually recovered from anesthesia and they feel throat&#xD;
      discomfort from endotracheal tube. Immediate extubation is encouraged in the operating&#xD;
      theatre and full recovery of neuromuscular function must be achieved prior to extubation of&#xD;
      the endotrachea tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI, such as neostigmine, pyridostigmine,&#xD;
      edrophonium) is used to reverse the efficacy of NMBA and stabilize the participants's vital&#xD;
      signs. However, the reversal of acetylcholine ester inhibitors is slow, the curative effect&#xD;
      has a ceiling effect, and the need to use anticholinergics (anticholinergics) to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of adverse reactions and other issues. In addition, traditional muscle relaxants&#xD;
      may also cause complications, such as postoperative residual curarization (PORC). PORC is&#xD;
      associated with weakness of upper airway muscles and increased risk of hypoventilation and&#xD;
      hypoxemia, as well as risk for aspiration and postoperative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugammadex is a new selective relaxant-binding agent that quickly and effectively reverses&#xD;
      the effects of steroidal NMBAs, especially rocuronium and vecuronium. Compared with&#xD;
      neostigmine, sugammadex more substantially reduces PORC, but its effects on postoperative&#xD;
      complications require further investigation. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the&#xD;
      effects of sugammadex and neostigmine during emergence and extubation after general&#xD;
      anesthesia in non-cardiac surgery and interventional procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will include 100 participants for both groups(Suggammadex and Neostigmine)&#xD;
      During anesthesia induction, the same drugs will be administered intravenously (propofol,&#xD;
      fentanyl, lidocaine and rocuronium). Rocuronium, a muscle relaxant,is part of the classic&#xD;
      triad of anesthesia. In surgery or interventional procedure under general anesthesia, NMBA is&#xD;
      needed to relax the muscles of the whole body. Its purpose is to assist the placement of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube, avoid the participants injury due to involuntary movements, and also&#xD;
      enables the surgeon to have a better surgical vision, etc. Once the operation or procedure is&#xD;
      completed, Investigators will reverse the NMBA and participants are recovered from general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Group A will be administered acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI, such as&#xD;
      neostigmine, pyridostigmine, edrophonium), AChEI is used to reverse the efficacy of NMBA and&#xD;
      stabilize the participants's vital signs. Group B will be administered sugammadex, a new&#xD;
      selective relaxant-binding agent that quickly and effectively reverses the effects of&#xD;
      steroidal NMBAs. Both drug should given on the time of train of four[TOF] count 4.&#xD;
      Investigators will collect the data include: Blood pressure(extubation, one minute, two&#xD;
      minutes and five minutes and ten minutes after), Heart rate, Saturation, extubation time and&#xD;
      BIS.&#xD;
