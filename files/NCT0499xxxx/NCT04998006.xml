  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study aims to improve our understanding of how legal market cannabis use&#xD;
      impacts acute and long-term alcohol use, the microbiota-gut-brain-axis (MGBA), and&#xD;
      neurobehavioral alcohol use phenotypes such as impulsivity, impaired cognitive functioning,&#xD;
      and craving, among individuals who regularly use both alcohol and cannabis. Over a period of&#xD;
      one month, subjects will participate in this three-visit study. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected to allow for the assessment of inflammatory markers and cannabinoids, a fecal&#xD;
      sample will be collected to allow for the analysis of the gut microbiome, and participants&#xD;
      will complete cognitive and impulsivity tasks and provide craving ratings during the course&#xD;
      of an alcohol self-administration procedure. Subjects will also participate in two 14-day&#xD;
      daily diary data collection periods between lab sessions. Daily diary data collection will be&#xD;
      used to assess the effects of cannabis use on alcohol use and craving longitudinally.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, the consumption of alcohol and alcohol use disorder (AUD) constitute a public&#xD;
      health crisis. Due to the neurobiological complexity of AUD, the development of new&#xD;
      treatments requires a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying etiology&#xD;
      and course of AUD. This includes the degree to which cannabis use may reduce or enhance harms&#xD;
      of alcohol consumption through cannabinoid influence on gut and immune functions. One&#xD;
      potential mechanism through which cannabinoids may exert beneficial effects in heavy drinkers&#xD;
      is through their role in modulating the gut microbiome and immune system, which have been&#xD;
      found to be disrupted by alcohol. However, it is also possible that cannabinoids,&#xD;
      specifically delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), may confer harms in heavy drinkers by&#xD;
      enhancing the intoxicating effects of alcohol. The current study will be the first to explore&#xD;
      the acute and long-term effects of cannabis on alcohol use and neurobehavioral phenotypes,&#xD;
      including alcohol craving, impulsivity, and impaired cognition, as well as the impact of&#xD;
      cannabinoids on the microbiota-gut-brain-axis (MGBA) in human non-treatment-seeking,&#xD;
      regular-cannabis-using heavy drinkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study examines the effects of legal market cannabis on acute and long-term alcohol use,&#xD;
      (specifically the effects of alcohol and cannabis use on gut microbiome and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers in the blood) in a 4-week, observational design using both traditional and mobile lab&#xD;
      settings, as well as self-report, daily diary methodology. Participants will complete two&#xD;
      Phases (A and B) following by two visits to our mobile laboratory (Visits A and B), the order&#xD;
      of which will be counterbalanced across participants so that half of participants will&#xD;
      complete phase A/visit A first, and the other half will complete Phase B/Visit B first. Phase&#xD;
      A involves 2 weeks of no cannabis use followed by a mobile lab session (Visit A), involving&#xD;
      biological sample collection, neurobehavioral testing and an alcohol self-administration&#xD;
      task. Phase B involves 2 weeks of ad lib use of participant preferred cannabis product,&#xD;
      followed by a session in the mobile lab session (Visit B) in which participants will complete&#xD;
      the same neurobehavioral tasks, biological sample collection, and alcohol self-administration&#xD;
      task immediately following acute ingestion of preferred cannabis strain in participant homes.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The investigators will submit all de-identified individual level phenotypic human subjects data from this project to the NIAAA data archive. The project also involves collection of human specimens (fecal samples) which will generate non-human genomic data. Specifically, the investigators plan to generate 122 (61 subjects x 2 timepoints) human gut microbiota metagenomes (i.e., gut microbiome). Deidentified genomic data from microbiome assays (and relevant phenotypic data) will be submitted to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP).</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Human phenotypic data will be uploaded at least twice a year. Non-human genomes from fecal samples will be shared within 3 months of processing and genotyping all meta-genomes</ipd_time_frame>
