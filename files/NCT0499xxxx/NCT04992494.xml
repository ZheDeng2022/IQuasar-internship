  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using treatment fidelity guidelines from NIH's Behavioral Change Consortium, we will&#xD;
      administer 8-sessions of MBCT either by telephone (MBCT-T) or video (MBCT-V) at the NYULH&#xD;
      study site for a total of 2 groups with 8 subjects per group (total n=16). Quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative feedback from patients and facilitators will be used to optimize both MBCT-T and&#xD;
      MBCT-V treatment quality (e.g., patient comprehension) and delivery via iterative adaption&#xD;
      and development of treatment manuals, facilitator training protocols, and fidelity measures&#xD;
      [MBCT-T/V Adherence &amp; Competence Scales (MBCT-TACS) and Session Fidelity Checklists].&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to set the stage for a future definitive large-scale Phase III trial in&#xD;
      patients with migraine and depressive symptoms. This first phase is aimed at fidelity&#xD;
      optimization of MBCT-T and MBCT-V in people with migraine (defined by the International&#xD;
      Classification of Headache Disorders - 3) and depressive symptoms (defined by empirical&#xD;
      cut-offs on the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9).&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Treatment Session Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment Session Adherence is a measure of treatment feasibility. This measure will be assessed through electronic monitoring of the attendance logs of each treatment session. The number of MBCT-T/V treatment sessions attended will be recorded. A treatment arm will be considered feasible if participants attended/read 75% of sessions on average.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of participants with greater than or equal to 95% of treatment components on Fidelity Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fidelity Checklist has 30 treatment components. Each component is marked yes or no. If &gt; 28 components are marked yes, it would be reported as greater than equal to 95%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Scores on MBCT-T/V Adherence &amp; Competence Scales (MBCT-TACS) that are on average greater than or equal to 2.5.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The scale has two components: formal components and teaching goals. The scores per session are recorded between 0-3 and averaged to get the total score. The total range of score is 0-3; the higher the score, the better.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Homework assignment adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Homework assignment adherence is another measure of treatment feasibility. During the intervention period, participants in the MBCT groups will be asked to record the amount of assigned home-based practice they completed each week.</description>

The program involves a commitment of 1 hour per week for 8 weeks. During the sessions, subjects will learn cognitive and mindfulness skills to help manage and cope with depression. Each weekly session consists of: check-in, instruction, skill building, discussion, and a home-based practice assignment.</description>
