  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat advanced solid cancers including head and&#xD;
      neck cancer, lung cancer and bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some people with cancer a protein called Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) can prevent&#xD;
      immune cells from fighting tumor cells. The study drug, BAY 2416964, is a small molecule&#xD;
      which blocks the AhR allowing the body to use its immune response against the cancer cells.&#xD;
      Researchers think that BAY 2416964 given together with a cancer treatment called&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may help shrink tumors in people with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aims of this study are to find for BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how safe this drug combination is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how it affects the body (also referred to as tolerability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the highest amount of BAY 2416964 that can be given in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
           without too many side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will also study the action of BAY 2416964 in combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      against the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this study will get BAY 2416964 and pembrolizumab. BAY 2416964 will be&#xD;
      given in tablet form by mouth. Pembrolizumab will be given as an intravenous (IV) infusion.&#xD;
      An IV infusion is given through a needle into a vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will have two parts. The first part will help find the most appropriate dose that&#xD;
      can be given in the second part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant of the first, so called dose escalation part, will be assigned to one&#xD;
      specific dose group for BAY 2416964. The amount of BAY 2416964 that is given increases&#xD;
      step-wise from one group to the next. The dose of pembrolizumab will always be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of the second, so called dose expansion part, will receive the most&#xD;
      appropriate dose of BAY 2416964 found in the first part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will receive the treatment in 3-week periods called&#xD;
      cycles. In each cycle, the participants will in general get pembrolizumab once and BAY&#xD;
      2416964 in a daily schedule. These 3-week cycles will be repeated throughout the trial. The&#xD;
      participants can take the study treatment until their cancer gets worse, until they have&#xD;
      medical problems, or until they leave the trial. Participants will have around 4 visits in&#xD;
      each cycle. Some of the visits can also be done via phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the study doctors and their team will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check if the participants' cancer has spread using computed tomography scans or magnetic&#xD;
           resonance imaging scans of the participants' tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' overall health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they&#xD;
           are having.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep&#xD;
      track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse&#xD;
      events might be related to the study treatments.&#xD;
