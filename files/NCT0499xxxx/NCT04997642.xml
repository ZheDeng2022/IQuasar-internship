      The research database contains demographic and family history information, longitudinal&#xD;
      information on the clinical symptoms, neuropsychological profile and treatments, stored&#xD;
      biological samples, and brain images of patients with Parkinson's disease and related&#xD;
      disorders receiving care at the Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorders Center (PDMDC) and&#xD;
      the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research database is to have a comprehensive source of data that can be&#xD;
      used for educational, research and patient care projects at the PDMDC. These data may be used&#xD;
      for any study examining the relationship between treatment and clinical symptoms of patients&#xD;
      with PD and related disorders. The main uses of the data are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the long term effects of Parkinson's disease and related conditions, including&#xD;
           predictors of its motor and non-motor symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify genetic and other neurobiological factors related to the risk of developing&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease and related disorders and their course&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve our understanding of how best to identify, diagnose, and manage motor and&#xD;
           non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease and related conditions Evaluate biological&#xD;
           markers of disease or response to therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify patients who may be candidates for participation in trials of new medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify patients who may be interested in participating in educational or developmental&#xD;
           activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are seen annually for the first 4 years, biennially thereafter. The participants&#xD;
      continue in the study until study end, withdrawal, or death on study.&#xD;

      Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid obtained with patient's consent. Biological samples including&#xD;
      blood and spinal fluid may be collected from each database participant. Each participant will&#xD;
      be given the option of allowing the collection of none, some, or both of the biological&#xD;
      samples. Samples will be stored in a secure facility at the University of Pennsylvania&#xD;
      Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. If the subject consents, approximately 20 ml&#xD;
      (4 teaspoons) of blood will be collected, and 25 ml (2 tablespoons) of spinal fluid will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
