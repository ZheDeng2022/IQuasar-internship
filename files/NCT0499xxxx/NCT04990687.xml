      The purpose of this study is to 1) explore whether vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) using a&#xD;
      hand- held non-invasive device (gammaCore™) works to treat depression and 2) to confirm&#xD;
      gammaCore™'s safety profile.&#xD;

      The study will be up to 14 visits, which will occur for up to a 1 year period. The first&#xD;
      visit is a screening visit, which will take about one hour to determine eligibility. If&#xD;
      participants are eligible, participants will be scheduled for a baseline visit and 12 monthly&#xD;
      visits to determine the antidepressant effects and possible side effects.&#xD;

    <description>Calculated by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): Each item has a severity scale from 0 to 6, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Ratings can be added to form an overall score (from 0 to 60). Snaith, Harrop, Newby, and Teale (1986) proposed the following cut-offs: scores of 0-6 indicate an absence of symptoms; 7-19 represent mild Depression; 20-34 moderate; 35-60 indicate severe Depression.</description>

    <description>gammaCore (nVNS) activates the vagus nerve with patented, gentle electrical stimulation.&#xD;
To assess potential changes in cognition, three computerized tests of cognition will the administered at baseline, Week 8, and Week 12. The Relational &amp; Item Specific Encoding task (RISE) will probe any potential neural abnormalities. The Probabilistic Learning Task will be used to examine neural circuits related to reward processing in major depression disorder. For the working memory task, participants will be shown two images with objects and asked to decide whether the two images differ or not.</description>

    <description>Treatment effects will be measured using standard rating scales including the HDRS-17, MADRS, SF-36, CSSR-S, CGI-I, CGI-S, which will be completed at each visit. The following scales will be completed at every other visit following the screening visit: Social Anhedonia Scale, the Motivation and Energy Inventory and the Physical Anhedonia Scale. At each study visit safety assessments including vital sign assessment and adverse event assessment will be completed. Subjects will also undergo physical examination and an ECG for safety during screening, after 8 weeks of treatment and at the end of 12 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>Implantable VNS (iVNS), the electrical stimulation of the nervous system to modulate or modify function, has been FDA approved in the United States since the late 1990s. Implantable VNS therapy has been approved for use in epilepsy and depression.&#xD;
When treating major depression with implanted VNS, the widely held belief is that chronic stimulation is required for therapeutic effect. In trials of implantable VNS in major depression, more patients respond at 12 months than at 3 months. Once depressed patients respond to VNS, the effects have been demonstrated to continue for up to five years with continued stimulation. This finding suggests that VNS gradually changes brain function through neuroplasticity.</description>
