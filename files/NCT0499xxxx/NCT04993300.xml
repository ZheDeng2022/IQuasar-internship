      The study aims to test whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) improves the craving,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety and cognitive function during the abstinent period of methamphetamine&#xD;
      users.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disease burden of methamphetamine (MA) use is a critical issue in public health, while&#xD;
      the abusers increased rapidly in recent years. The effect of medical intervention for MA&#xD;
      addiction is still limited, and the cost of psychotherapy is high. In Taiwan, the MA&#xD;
      defendant would be sent to the district inspection after the police confirmed the MA abuse.&#xD;
      The prosecutor could assess the case to replace the penalty of imprisonment with a suspended&#xD;
      sentence, which included one year of addiction treatment in the designated hospital. However,&#xD;
      the insufficient treatment of MA addiction resulted in a subsequent high rescinded rate of&#xD;
      suspended sentence cases and led people to doubt these medical intervention programs. Hence,&#xD;
      the primary mission is to improve the treatment efficacy within the treatment program.&#xD;
      Growing evidence has suggested the effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      in improving craving, affective symptoms, and cognitive impairment. However, the majority of&#xD;
      the studies were conducted in China. Under China's legal system, researchers designed intense&#xD;
      TMS treatment programs for MA users, which was not entirely applicable within Taiwan's&#xD;
      system. Therefore, the current proposal aims to design a new TMS treatment and evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability, efficacy, and sustained effect of Taiwanese MA users within the suspended&#xD;
      sentence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators applied a case-only follow-up study and divided the study into two phases.&#xD;
      Fifteen MA users within the suspended sentence who are under the outpatient-based MA abuse&#xD;
      treatment program will be recruited. In Phase 1, 15 subjects will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      TMS intensity groups (80% and 100%). After one TMS treatment session, subjects will be&#xD;
      interviewed with the visual analog scale and the tolerability questionnaire to detect their&#xD;
      side-effect and the primary effect of craving reduction. After evaluating the side-effect&#xD;
      rate and the craving reduction effect, the investigators will select the subsequent TMS&#xD;
      treatment program's intensity. In Phase 2, all subjects undergo a four-week TMS treatment&#xD;
      program. In Week 1, subjects will attend continuously five daily TMS sessions. In Week 2 to&#xD;
      Week 4, subjects are treated once a week. After 8 TMS sessions, the investigators will follow&#xD;
      up one month and three months later. The investigators apply the Visual analog scale, Beck&#xD;
      depression inventory, Beck anxiety inventory, and Continuous performance test in each&#xD;
      intervention and follow-up time point to measure the efficacy and sustain effect of improving&#xD;
      craving, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment.&#xD;
