  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cardiovascular disease with a prevalence of 1.7% of the&#xD;
      total population in Korea, associated with 25% of ischemic stroke and 30% of heart failure,&#xD;
      and is a major cardiovascular disease that doubles the risk of dementia. AF catheter ablation&#xD;
      (AFCA) is an effective procedure that lowers the risk of heart failure mortality and cerebral&#xD;
      infarction and improves cognitive or renal functions. However, the recurrence rate after the&#xD;
      procedure is relatively high, especially in patients with long-standing persistent AF in&#xD;
      which atrial remodeling has already progressed. Research on the prediction of treatment&#xD;
      efficacy using artificial intelligence (AI) is being actively conducted around the world. We&#xD;
      predicted the AFCA poor responders who will progress to permanent AF despite AFCA among a&#xD;
      total of 3,372 patients included in the Yonsei AF Ablation cohort and the 2nd independent&#xD;
      cohort with a long-term follow-up through AI with area under curve (AUC) 0.943. Therefore, in&#xD;
      this prospective randomized clinical study, the difference between the patient selection for&#xD;
      AFCA using AI algorithm and the clinical guidelines-based decision will be compared and&#xD;
      evaluated in terms of long-term rhythm outcome.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective randomization (AI-based patient selection group vs. conventional&#xD;
           guidelines-based patient selection group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target number of subjects 340 patients (170 people in each group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhythm follow-up schedule: 2012 American College of Cardiology(ACC)/American Heart&#xD;
           Association(AHA)/European Society of Cardiology(ESC) guidelines (basal, 3 months, then&#xD;
           every 6 months Holter, ECG when symptomatic)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticoagulant therapy follows 2020 ESC guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluation of all adverse events occurring in each group and comparative evaluation of&#xD;
           hospitalization rates, major cardiovascular attacks, and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process of Patient Selection A guideline-based appropriate candidate for AFCA Randomization&#xD;
      for AI-guide group vs. Clinical guideline-based group Poor responder selection by AI at the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic AI-prediction outcomes should be noticed in AI-guided groups, but not in&#xD;
      the clinical guideline-based group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendation of rate control for AI-predicted poor responders All-comer ablation in&#xD;
      guideline-based group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progress and rhythm/ECG tracking&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Implemented according to 2012 American College of Cardiology(ACC)/American Heart&#xD;
           Association(AHA)/Heart Rhythm Society(HRS) guidelines for AF management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Outpatient follow-up 1 to 2 weeks after the start of the procedure or drug treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up every 3 months after the procedure, and every 6 months thereafter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the patient complains of arrhythmia symptoms, conduct an electrocardiogram at any&#xD;
           time and follow the rhythm with a Holter or an event recorder.&#xD;
