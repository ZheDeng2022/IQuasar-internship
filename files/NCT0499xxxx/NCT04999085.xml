  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the United States. Myeloma most&#xD;
      commonly affects older adults. While some younger individuals do get myeloma, the average age&#xD;
      when people are first diagnosed with myeloma is around 69 to 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with having a higher risk for myeloma, older adults have an increased chance of&#xD;
      developing other health problems or issues. However, not everyone ages in the same way. Some&#xD;
      older adults experience major changes in health or degree of independence at relatively&#xD;
      younger ages, while others remain quite healthy for many years. The specific issues that&#xD;
      develop with age can also vary from person to person. One older adult may face difficulties&#xD;
      with vision or hearing, while another may develop memory problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, cancer doctors have not done a very good job identifying these non-cancer&#xD;
      issues. As a result, research has focused on better ways to systematically pick up on issues&#xD;
      that may impact cancer outcomes or quality of life. The outgrowth of this research is&#xD;
      assessments and questionnaires referred to as &quot;comprehensive geriatric assessments,&quot; which&#xD;
      evaluate the health and functionality of older adults thoroughly but efficiently. In both&#xD;
      myeloma and other types of cancer, problems identified through geriatric assessments have&#xD;
      been shown to predict how likely people are to develop side effects of cancer treatment and&#xD;
      predict how long people are likely to live with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior research has not addressed how best to help with the issues picked up through a&#xD;
      geriatric assessment among patients undergoing treatment for myeloma, although a number of&#xD;
      effective interventions have been shown to benefit older adults with similar problems in&#xD;
      other settings. Therefore, the current study will test a strategy of systematically screening&#xD;
      older adults undergoing myeloma treatment for geriatric-assessment-related deficits and&#xD;
      referring participants to appropriate services and resources. The geriatric assessment in&#xD;
      this study includes tests of mobility, memory, vision, hearing, and nutrition as well as&#xD;
      questions about symptoms and social support. Individuals who have deficits in one of these&#xD;
      areas will be referred to relevant services and resources such as physical therapy, a&#xD;
      pharmacist, or the cancer center support program. They will then repeat the same assessment&#xD;
      three months later, and the results will be compared to their original assessment to see if&#xD;
      the deficit has improved, with particular attention to mobility and social support.&#xD;

      STUDY OUTLINE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants complete a baseline Geriatric Assessment and European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life of Cancer Patients (QLQ) Core 30&#xD;
      (C30) and Myeloma supplement (MY20) questionnaires, either at the time of enrollment or as&#xD;
      part of previous research studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these assessments, an intervention strategy is developed by Study Team. These&#xD;
      interventions largely consist of referrals to relevant specialists and existing services.&#xD;
      These recommendations are communicated to the study participant, and participant-approved&#xD;
      intervention referrals are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an initial appointment with these specialists, further follow-up will be determined&#xD;
      based on the subject and specialist without input from the Study Team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At three months from enrollment, study participants will be asked to complete a follow-up&#xD;
      geriatric assessment, repeat EORTC questionnaires, and a satisfaction /feedback survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients referred to specialists as above, the duration of treatment or care with the&#xD;
      specialist will be determined based on an agreement between the specialist and study&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this study, participants will only be followed through the three-month follow-up&#xD;
      assessment described above. For subjects participating in or recruited from other research&#xD;
      studies, follow-up according to those other protocols will continue.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will be referred to specialists and/or supportive care interventions based on issues/deficits identified on a baseline geriatric assessment. These interventions will be selected based on deficits or problems identified on baseline assessments. These include referral to physical/occupational therapy for those with physical deficits (Activities of Daily Living impairment, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living impairment, Timed Up and Go, or falls), to optometry/ophthalmology (for visual impairment), to audiology (for hearing impairment), to pharmacist (for polypharmacy), and to cancer center support program (for Mental Health Index 13 criteria).</description>
