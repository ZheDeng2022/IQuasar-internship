      This is a multicenter study testing the effect of bread containing beta-glucan on glycemic&#xD;
      control in participants with intermediate hyperglycemia. The main hypothesis of the study is&#xD;
      that bread enriched with beta-glucan will have a positive effect on blood glucose control&#xD;
      (HbA1c) in persons with intermediate hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bread (intervention and control) will be produced by Nofima (Ås, Norway) using food-grade&#xD;
      beta-glucan from oat and barley and shipped to the study centers (Bergen (N), Gothenburg (S),&#xD;
      Paderborn, and Leipzig (D)) and there distributed for free to the participants of the study.&#xD;
      The study will last for 16 weeks with measurements at baseline, after 8 weeks and after 16&#xD;
      weeks. Blood and urine samples will be taken, anthropometry and body composition measured,&#xD;
      and questionnaires on health status and socio-economic status, physical activity, nicotine&#xD;
      use, alcohol habits, chronotype, quality of life, and consumer acceptance of the study bread&#xD;
      will be filled in.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrates are the main source of energy in most European countries with intakes ranging&#xD;
      from 40-60% of total energy. Consequently, the role of its quality and quantity for the&#xD;
      development of metabolic diseases is the focus of substantial debate. Notwithstanding,&#xD;
      replacing processed carbohydrates with unprocessed carbohydrates is regarded as a major&#xD;
      strategy to improve public health. This is to a substantial degree based on strong&#xD;
      observational evidence that higher intakes of dietary fiber (cereal grains containing the&#xD;
      same relative proportions of bran, germ, and endosperm as the intact caryopsis) are&#xD;
      associated with lower risks of total mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality, type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) incidence and cancer mortality. Nonetheless, data from medium- to&#xD;
      long-term intervention studies among adults are less conclusive regarding the benefits of&#xD;
      whole-grain consumption on glycemic control, bodyweight and serum lipids. In fact, benefits&#xD;
      may be largely confined to whole grains stemming from oats or barley, calling for explicit&#xD;
      consideration of these whole grains and/or its mechanistically relevant component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adding complexity, many commonly consumed whole grains or products rich in dietary fiber are&#xD;
      characterized by a high glycemic index (GI&gt;70), in fact, a high dietary fiber content will&#xD;
      not predict a low glycemic response. The GI describes the glycemic potency of the available&#xD;
      carbohydrates in a food, is measured under defined conditions and is used to calculate the&#xD;
      glycemic load (GL: GI x amount of available carbohydrates). Preferred consumption of high GI&#xD;
      grain products is of concern since a higher dietary GI and GL may be causally linked to a&#xD;
      substantial increase in T2DM risk and may translate into a considerable health burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In European societies, T2DM prevalence is increasing as a result of higher overweight and&#xD;
      obesity rates and increases in longevity. Efforts are hence needed to develop&#xD;
      carbohydrate-based food items that are both rich in fiber and whole grain and have a low GI&#xD;
      and tailored to the dietary habits of middle-aged adults with insulin resistance (also called&#xD;
      'pre-diabetes' or intermediate hyperglycemia defined by intermediately increased HbA1c&#xD;
      levels). This stage precedes clinical T2DM and affects up to 30% of adults in Western&#xD;
      societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrichment with selected fibers, e.g. beta-glucan from oat and barley, may offer an&#xD;
      alternative to whole grain kernel breads, which may not meet consumer preferences and is also&#xD;
      endorsed by EFSA health claims. Preliminary small-scale studies indicate acute, short- and&#xD;
      longer-term benefits of such bread for glycemic and/or insulinemic responses among persons&#xD;
      with T2DM or at risk of T2DM. However, these studies suffer, besides the small sample sizes,&#xD;
      from high amounts of test food (8 servings per day = 320 g bread) and use of white bread as a&#xD;
      comparator. The present study will test whether habitual consumption of a bread containing&#xD;
      oat bran concentrate and meeting the high beta-glucan content of the EFSA claim (4.3 g&#xD;
      beta-glucan per 30 g available carbohydrate) compared to normal wheat bread high in whole&#xD;
      grain but without kernels will affect glycemic control over a period of 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis The main hypothesis of the study is that bread enriched with beta-glucan will&#xD;
      have a positive effect on blood glucose control (HbA1c) in persons with intermediate&#xD;
      hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Main objective: Establish whether replacement of habitual bread intake with a low&#xD;
      GI bread containing beta-glucan improves glycemic control among persons at risk for T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: Examine the effects of the intervention on capillary blood glucose,&#xD;
      body composition and serum lipid levels, and address consumer acceptance of the intervention&#xD;
      bread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures This is a multicenter study testing the effect of bread containing&#xD;
      beta-glucan on glycemic control in participants with intermediate hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breads (intervention and control) will be produced by Nofima (Ås) using food-grade&#xD;
      beta-glucan from oat and barley and shipped to the study centers (Bergen (N), Gothenburg (S),&#xD;
      Paderborn and Leipzig (D)) and there distributed for free to the participants of the study.&#xD;
      The study will last for 16 weeks with measurements at baseline, after 8 weeks and after 16&#xD;
      weeks. Blood and urine samples will be taken, anthropometry and body composition measured,&#xD;
      and questionnaires on health status, chronotype, lifestyle, and acceptance of the breads will&#xD;
      be filled in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants Each study site is responsible for the recruitment of the planned&#xD;
      numbers of participants. Potential participants will be recruited through flyers and&#xD;
      information to local General Practitioners, advertising in local newspapers, central and&#xD;
      local social media announcements (websites of universities, Facebook). Potentially eligible&#xD;
      participants will be invited to a screening visit and checked for eligibility and exclusion&#xD;
      of undiagnosed 2TDM.&#xD;
