      Autophagy is considered an important component of Heart failure progression. Deubiquitination&#xD;
      enzymes play an important role in autophagy. An important regulatory process within the&#xD;
      autophagy pathway is ubiquitination. Ubiquitination targets proteins for degradation. On the&#xD;
      contrary, de-ubiquitinating proteins (such as UCHL1) reverses this process. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated deubiquitination to be linked to certain pathological processes, such as heart&#xD;
      failure. UCHL1 will be examined as a potential marker of disease progression in acute&#xD;
      decompensated heart failure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among US Veterans.&#xD;
      Epidemiologic data points to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) as a leading cause of&#xD;
      hospitalizations in the VA system. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the progressive&#xD;
      deterioration of cardiac function remain poorly understood. Autophagy is an evolutionarily&#xD;
      conserved pathway that targets cytoplasmic contents to the lysosome for degradation in the&#xD;
      cell. In mammals, autophagy has been classified into three different types depending on the&#xD;
      means by which the target is delivered into lysosomes for final degradation: (i)&#xD;
      macroautophagy, (ii) microautophagy, (iii) chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Both&#xD;
      macroautophagy and CMA may participate in degradation of damage proteins; however, only&#xD;
      macroautophagy could clear the damage organelles in the cells. Among them, macroautophagy&#xD;
      (thereafter and other parts of this proposal referred to as autophagy) is the best&#xD;
      characterized. It can be induced by nutrient deprivation and various stress conditions; in&#xD;
      these circumstances, autophagy is essential for the maintenance of cell homeostasis by its&#xD;
      promotion of the removal of damaged components including long-live and dysfunctional proteins&#xD;
      and damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, as well as by its provision of energy and&#xD;
      biomolecules to cells including cardiomyocytes. Thus, autophagy is increasingly recognized to&#xD;
      play an important role in protecting the heart against various pathological stress-induced&#xD;
      damage and dysfunction. In contrast, it has also been proposed that autophagy may be&#xD;
      detrimental to the heart in some specific settings. However, the precise reason for such&#xD;
      discrepancies is poorly understood. In particularly, the regulatory mechanisms for selective&#xD;
      control of autophagy-mediated cardiac protection or dysfunction are unclear. The therapeutic&#xD;
      approach targeting autophagy to cardiac disease and heart failure remains to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An important regulatory process within the autophagy pathway is ubiquitination.&#xD;
      Ubiquitination targets proteins for degradation. On the contrary, de-ubiquitinating proteins&#xD;
      reverses this process. Studies have demonstrated deubiquitination to be linked to certain&#xD;
      pathological processes, such as heart failure. Ubiquitin carboxyhydrolase L1 (UCHL1) has been&#xD;
      identified by the co-investigator (Dr. Taixing Cui) in mouse models of pressure-overload&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. More data is required to identify UCHL1 as a significant marker in humans&#xD;
      with HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart failure biomarkers play an important role in heart failure care. In general, despite&#xD;
      significant overlaps, these biomarkers are loosely arranged into the following categories: 1)&#xD;
      myocardial stress/injury, 2) neurohormonal activation, 3) remodeling and 4) comorbidities.&#xD;
      None of current biomarkers alone or in combination may fulfil the need regarding screening,&#xD;
      diagnosis, prognosis and therapy guidance. Therefore, it is important to find out novel&#xD;
      biomarkers of cardiac disease and heart failure, especially those which reflect in important&#xD;
      pathophysiologic pathway involved in heart failure disease process and help clinical&#xD;
      judgement for understanding diagnosis, prognosis, or management of heart failure. As a&#xD;
      result, the novel biomarkers will supplement traditional clinical and laboratory testing to&#xD;
      improve understanding of the complex disease processes of heart failure and possibly achieve&#xD;
      personalized care for heart failure patients. Human studies of circulating UCHL1 have&#xD;
      identified it as a having diagnostic or prognostic value in this pathological settings.&#xD;
      However, whether it is applicable to cardiovascular disease has not been studied. This gap&#xD;
      will be filled in part by this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To explore the diagnostic and/or prognostic value of circulating exosomal UCH-L1 in VA&#xD;
      HF patients. We will translate findings from animal models to bed side by a&#xD;
      proof-of-principal study to demonstrate that circulating UCH-L1, particularly the exosomal&#xD;
      UCH-L1 is higher during acute decompensation than when compensated in VA HF patients.&#xD;
