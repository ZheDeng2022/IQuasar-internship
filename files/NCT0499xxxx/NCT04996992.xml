  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the neural mechanism of Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS)&#xD;
      Pallidothalamic Tractotomy in Parkinson's disease through multi-model MRI, and identify&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers for triaging candidates and predicting the clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most progressive neurodegenerative disease with many&#xD;
      motor and non-motor symptoms, which brings heavy burden to the family and the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRgFUS pallidothalamic tractotomy allows to address all symptoms of PD without skull opening&#xD;
      and with very limited tissue ablation, but with varying effectiveness. The unknown&#xD;
      pathogenesis of PD has greatly contributed to this variance. Therefore, in order to optimize&#xD;
      the clinical application of MRgFUS pallidothalamic tractotomy, it is important to reveal the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease by using multiple modality MRI methods, and identify&#xD;
      imaging biomarkers to triage suitable candidates and predict clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Treatment scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will first receive uni- or bilateral MRgFUS PTT. As to bilateral interventions,&#xD;
      the second one will take place at least 6 months after the first PTT. Patients with&#xD;
      unilateral intervention will be followed to 1 year. Patients with bilateral interventions&#xD;
      will be followed to 1 year after the second intervention. Baseline clinical demographics,&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), treatment parameters (energy, power, duration&#xD;
      time, temperature, target location) , associated adverse effects were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2; T2 Flair; DWI; ESWAN; MRS; 3D ASL 2.0s; 3D-T1; DTI; rs-functional MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lesion appearance and volume are measured by T2, T2 Flair, DWI, ESWAN, 3D-T1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ESWAN and MRS manifests the changes of iron deposition and metabolism, respectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ASL shows regional cerebral blood flow associated with the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DTI demonstrates the destruction of white matter integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rs-functional MRI reflects alterations of resting-state brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRgFUS pallidothalamic tractotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI + clinical evaluation: Baseline, 3-day, 1-week, 1-month, 3-months, 6-months,12-months&#xD;
