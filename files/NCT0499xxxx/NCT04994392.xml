  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative complications, especially intraoperative adverse events (iAEs), carry&#xD;
      significant potential for long-term sequelae in a patient's postoperative course. Without&#xD;
      consistent and homogenous reporting, these events represent a substantial gap in contemporary&#xD;
      surgical literature and clinical practice. By definition, an iAE is any unplanned incident&#xD;
      related to a surgical intervention occurring between skin incision and skin closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the availability of multiple intraoperative classification systems, the reporting of&#xD;
      intraoperative adverse events remains exceedingly rare. Further, while most studies report&#xD;
      postoperative adverse events, only a fraction of surgical publications report intraoperative&#xD;
      complications as outcomes of interest. Many reasons could be related to this dearth in iAE&#xD;
      reporting, ranging from a lack of clear iAE definitions to a fear of litigation. Broadly&#xD;
      speaking, iAEs are negative outcomes, which, on the whole, epitomize a paradoxically&#xD;
      well-documented bias in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators performed an umbrella review and meta-analysis of prior systematic reviews&#xD;
      of complication reporting in a number of key urologic surgical domains. The investigators&#xD;
      have since worked with academic surgeons to produce a set of iAE reporting guidelines known&#xD;
      as the Intraoperative Complication Assessment and Reporting with Universal Standards (ICARUS)&#xD;
      Guidelines. These reporting criteria were developed using the reporting guidelines using the&#xD;
      framework outlined by the EQUATOR Network (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health&#xD;
      Research; www.equator-network.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of a prospective effort to evaluate the utility of these new guidelines, the&#xD;
      investigators are performing a study of surgeons, anesthesiologists,s and nurses perceptions&#xD;
      regarding iAE reporting and the global applicability of the new iAE reporting guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part one of this study, a series of survey questions will be used to better elucidate&#xD;
      surgeon perceptions underlying the contemporary deficit in iAE reporting. In part two of this&#xD;
      study, a set of assessments to representatives within various surgical specialties to assess&#xD;
      the global applicability of the newly developed iAE reporting guidelines.&#xD;

        The study team will identify corresponding authors who have published articles at any point&#xD;
        during 2019-2021 in key American and European scientific surgical journals. The study team&#xD;
        plans to email up to 1500 authors from each of these journals - though, many of these&#xD;
        journals will not likely have substantially fewer corresponding authors. Specifically,&#xD;
        these journals will be associated with one or more of the following specialties:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anesthesiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Interventional Radiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiothoracic surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
