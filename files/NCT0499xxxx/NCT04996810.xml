      This study will be conducted in Phase I/II clinical trials. In Phase I, subjects with&#xD;
      moderate to severe glabellar lines are enrolled and those who are judged to be eligible for&#xD;
      this study will be injected with the &quot;PROTOXIN&quot; at a total of 20U(4U/0.1mL each) in five&#xD;
      sites of the glabellar lines. Safety is assessed after 12 weeks. In Phase II, subjects with&#xD;
      moderate to severe glabellar lines are enrolled and will be injected the &quot;PROTOXIN&quot; or the&#xD;
      &quot;BOTOX®&quot; at a total of 20U(4U/0.1mL each)in five sites of the glabellar lines. Thereafter,&#xD;
      efficacy and safety are assessed by comparing with BOTOX®.&#xD;
