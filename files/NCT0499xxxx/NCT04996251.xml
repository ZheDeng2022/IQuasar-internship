      Pelvic organ prolapse is becoming more common as women's life expectancy is increasing and&#xD;
      the prevalence of obesity is rising. Many women undergo pelvic reconstructive surgery to&#xD;
      treat their prolapse and improve their quality of life. The incidence of pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse is 1.5-1.8 surgeries per 1,000 women years. Approximately 300,000 pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgeries are performed each year in the United States. There is a wide&#xD;
      variety in surgical approaches and procedures for prolapse. One such procedure is a&#xD;
      sacrocolpopexy in which the cervix or vaginal cuff is lifted to the anterior longitudinal&#xD;
      ligament overlying the sacrum via a mesh graft. This can be done in a minimally invasive&#xD;
      fashion with a laparoscopic or robotic approach or in an open abdominal approach. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have shown this procedure to have a high success rate and long-term durability. As&#xD;
      robotic/laparoscopic approach to surgery has shown shorter hospital-stays and improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes, the robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy has been rapidly incorporated into&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, surgery causes a release of painful chemical mediators which has led to increased&#xD;
      narcotic use, increased narcotic addiction, and number of pills prescribed. Most individuals&#xD;
      who undergo surgery will require narcotics postoperatively to control their pain and some&#xD;
      individuals have to extend their hospital stay until adequate pain control is achieved. Our&#xD;
      study is aimed to reduce narcotic use, decrease hospital stay due to pain issues and&#xD;
      determine if timing of adjunct pain medication improves pain scales for patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As postoperative pain after minimally invasive surgery is complex, specialists suggest that&#xD;
      the effective analgesic treatment should be a multimodal approach. Use of local anesthetic&#xD;
      with bupivacaine at robotic/laparoscopic trocar sites is the standard of care, however, there&#xD;
      is no standard as to optimal timing that is most beneficial for patients to decrease pain.&#xD;
      Currently, bupivacaine is used by providers at the trocar sites at either the beginning of&#xD;
      the case or at the end of the case. From clinical observation, it appears that postoperative&#xD;
      pain levels reported from patients receiving either at the beginning of surgery (pre-) or end&#xD;
      (post-incision) of the surgery are similar. This study aims to examine the difference in&#xD;
      postoperative day one pain levels reported by patients between the two infiltration methods&#xD;
