  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most difficult areas of forensic science is identifying individuals. Accurate sex&#xD;
      estimation based on measurements of dimorphic dimensions in unknown human remains is a&#xD;
      crucial first step toward making individual identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the most accurate approach to determine sex by bone size is based on os coxae or skull. After&#xD;
      natural disaster their presence can never be guaranteed, therefore the development of methods&#xD;
      of sex determination using other skeletal elements is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scapula is a paired short bone that will be researched in this study. The decision to&#xD;
      focus on the scapula was made in the first place because of its minor morphological&#xD;
      alterations after growing is complete. Second, short and flat bones appear to be better&#xD;
      maintained than lengthy bones, which are frequently fractured, scattered, and mixed together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scapular muscle attachments provide protection to the bone making it difficult to fracture or&#xD;
      break .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative studies on different populations have shown population-specific results in the&#xD;
      discriminant function equations for sex estimation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is significant population variation due to sexual dimorphism in the growth rate and&#xD;
      developmental process of human beings. Genetics play an important role in this variation.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, environmental factors, nutrition, secular changes and diseases also play an&#xD;
      important role in sexual dimorphism .&#xD;

      One of the most difficult areas of forensic science is identifying individuals. Accurate sex&#xD;

      developmental process of human beings. Genetics play an important role in this variation.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, environmental factors, nutrition, secular changes and diseases also play an&#xD;
      important role in sexual dimorphism. The first study that used the scapula in sex estimation&#xD;
      was conducted by Dwight in 1894.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dwight measured the height of the glenoid fossae and maximum scapular length of 123 patients&#xD;
      (84 males and 39 females),Dwight's method showed that the scapular height had a high&#xD;
      predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, Dabbs and Moore-Jansen applied the 23 parameter method to 803 individuals of the&#xD;
      Hamann-Todd collection in their study and showed that the overall accuracy of this method was&#xD;
      95.7%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      studies reveal that the use of Computed tomography (CT) images increases accuracy and&#xD;
      reproducibility over traditional methods in establishing a biological profile .&#xD;
&#xD;
      even though there is evidence of sexual dimorphism in the scapula according to several&#xD;
      published studies, the validity of scapula for sex estimation has not been explored in depth&#xD;
      in modern population where a general lack of contemporary osteometric databases noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in this paper , this study is presented in order to test the efficacy of scapula to serve as&#xD;
      sex indicator for forensic purposes.&#xD;
