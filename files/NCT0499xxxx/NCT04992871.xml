    <textblock>
      The Swiss-CP-Reg is a national patient registry that collects information on diagnosis,&#xD;
      symptoms, treatment and follow-up of patients with cerebral palsy (CP) in Switzerland. It was&#xD;
      first implemented in 2017 in the paediatric clinics in Basel, Bellinzona, Bern, Geneva,&#xD;
      Lausanne, St. Gallen and Zurich. It will be extended to all Swiss clinics and medical&#xD;
      practices and adults will be invited to join the register in the coming years. The registry&#xD;
      provides data for national and international monitoring and research. It supports research on&#xD;
      CP in Switzerland and the exchange of knowledge between clinicians, researchers and&#xD;
      therapists, with the goal to improve the treatment of children and adults with CP and&#xD;
      optimizing their health and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to chronic movement and postural disorders. It results&#xD;
      from a non-progressive lesion or brain malformation that occurs during the prenatal,&#xD;
      perinatal, or postnatal period (e.g. ischemic lesions of the neonatal brain or genetic&#xD;
      predispositions leading to brain malformation). Besides motor dysfunction, persons with CP&#xD;
      suffer from a wide variety of comorbidities, such as epilepsy, speech, hearing or vision&#xD;
      disorders, cognitive dysfunction, behavioral disorders, and secondary musculoskeletal&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP is the most common cause of physical disability in children in Switzerland and it is&#xD;
      important that the investigators gain a better understanding of its prevalence, risk factors,&#xD;
      current clinical profile and the needs of those affected and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cantonal Ethics Committee of Bern approved the Swiss-CP-Reg project (project ID:&#xD;
      2017-00873, observational study, risk category A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The overall objective of the Swiss-CP-Reg is to improve future care and thus&#xD;
      well-being of CP individuals. The development of a national registry for the collection of&#xD;
      representative, complete and longitudinal data from children, adolescents and adults with CP&#xD;
      in Switzerland serves to achieve this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of the Swiss-CP-Reg projects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Establish a representative population-based Swiss cohort of children, adolescents and&#xD;
           adults with CP&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Provide epidemiological data to investigate the incidence, prevalence, risk factors,&#xD;
           spectrum of diagnosis, survival rates and mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide a platform for clinical research:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Answer questions in the following areas: health, health care, education, social&#xD;
                aspects and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Offer a resource to recruit patients for nested observational and intervention&#xD;
                studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provide a platform for communication:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Promote the exchange of knowledge between clinics, researchers, therapists and&#xD;
                national and cantonal health authorities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Facilitate international collaborations, in particular with the &quot;Surveillance of&#xD;
                Cerebral Palsy of Europe&quot; (SCPE), and benchmarking of used therapeutic approaches&#xD;
                with international partners&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria: all children, adolescents and adults diagnosed with CP who are&#xD;
      born, treated or living in Switzerland. The SCPE decision tree is used for&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion. Patients with pure muscular hypotonia, neurometabolic diseases (e.g.&#xD;
      neuronal storage diseases, leukodystrophies) and other progressive neurological diseases&#xD;
      (e.g. spinocerebellar ataxias, hereditary spastic paraplegia, Rett syndrome, epileptic&#xD;
      encephalopathy) are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: After a CP diagnosis of a child, the treating physician informs the family during&#xD;
      a consultation in a clinic or practice in writing and orally about the Swiss-CP-Reg. Families&#xD;
      who wish to participate sign the consent form and the children are registered in the&#xD;
      Swiss-CP-Reg. If families do not wish to participate, only a minimal anonymous data set is&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from questionnaires for patients and families&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data from links to routine statistics and medical registries&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data (report of new cases and follow-up reports): CP Classification; Perinatal&#xD;
      history; Diagnosis information; Possible CP causes; Neuroradiological examinations;&#xD;
      Classification of motor skills (mobility, manual ability); Comorbidities, e.g. epilepsy,&#xD;
      visual impairment, pain; Development and learning difficulties; Communication and nutrition;&#xD;
      Hip and spinal pathologies (e.g. scoliosis); Treatments and therapies e.g. physiotherapy, hip&#xD;
      surgery, medication; Socio-economic resources of the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire data: Personal information; Health-related quality of life; Participation in&#xD;
      daily life; Medical care and medication; Communication and dietary problems; Comorbidities;&#xD;
      Treatments; Aids; Education and social environment; Family needs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine data and linkages: Communities; Federal Statistical Office (e.g. the birth register,&#xD;
      cause of death statistics, hospital statistics); SwissNeoNet (register for premature and&#xD;
      at-risk children).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current status: From 2017-2021, the investigators have included 580 persons diagnosed with CP&#xD;
      (Status May 31 2021; from birth year 1998)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Swiss-CP-Reg contact new diagnosed persons with CP at regular intervals, and continuously&#xD;
      analyse and publish data and findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding: Swiss Foundation for the Cerebrally Palsied Child, Anna Mueller Grocholski&#xD;
      Foundation, Swiss Academy of Childhood Disability SACD, Hand in Hand Anstalt, Ostschweizer&#xD;
