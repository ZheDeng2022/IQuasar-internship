  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) overwhelmed the health care&#xD;
      system and ICU admission was maximized with increased work load of ICU physicians. Invasive&#xD;
      line procedures are inserted with a dedicated team to ensure safe and perfect performance.&#xD;
      Frequent requests for arterial line insertion were observed during the second wave follow up&#xD;
      of COVID-19 bound patients. High rates of thrombosis were found in those critically ill&#xD;
      patients which was associated with thrombotic complications. Many factors are contributed for&#xD;
      reduction of arterial line patency, including morbidities of patients, technique of&#xD;
      insertion, and criteria of the operating health care skilled personnel. In response of our&#xD;
      ICU management committee to increase incidence of thrombosis and pulmonary embolic events in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the second wave of the epidemic, they recommended&#xD;
      the use of systemic anti coagulation of ICU admitted patients since 21 March 2021.&#xD;

      1. Introduction / Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU admission for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been increased and it&#xD;
      was observed that this epidemic is associated with high rates of thrombosis which augmented&#xD;
      its consequences for those critically ill patients [1], [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      During peak admission of patients with COVID-19 to ICU, we initiated a dedicated invasive&#xD;
      procedure team from anesthetists to provide a multidisciplinary, safe service for invasive&#xD;
      vascular procedures, moreover, endotracheal intubations and rapid response team (RRT) for&#xD;
      quick assessment of deteriorating patients in ward which in need for ICU admission which was&#xD;
      reported before at USA institute [3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic monitoring and management in patients undergoing high risk surgery used the&#xD;
      invasive vascular access particularly in ICU admitted patients [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods used to reduce the incidence of arterial line failure as the use of&#xD;
      heparinized solutions [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Their main aim was to augment the median patency duration of 5-10 days [6]. The arterial line&#xD;
      occlusion was reported when it was inserted for longer than 2-3 days [7]. A temporary&#xD;
      arterial obstruction occurs frequently as a common complication [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      During COVID crisis, we noticed increased requests for arterial line insertions either in&#xD;
      newly admitted or already present ICU patients. The repeated insertions of arterial lines may&#xD;
      challenge the ICU provider as well as it increases risk of ischemic thrombosis and infectious&#xD;
      events in the patient's limbs. However, there were few reports about risk factors associated&#xD;
      with arterial lines obstructions in patients with COVID -19 admitted to ICU [9] .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response of our ICU management committee to increase incidence of thrombosis and pulmonary&#xD;
      embolic events in patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the second wave of this epidemic,&#xD;
      they recommended the use of systemic anti coagulation of ICU admitted patients since 21 March&#xD;
      2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this observational study to investigate the impact of systemic anti coagulation on the&#xD;
      arterial line patency and incidence of arterial line failure comparing patients before&#xD;
      implementation of systemic anti coagulation versus patients after its implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome will identify risk factors which associated with impaired arterial line&#xD;
      patency in both groups.&#xD;
