  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Transdiagnostic Intervention&#xD;
      for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (TranS-C) in adults with poor sleep and excess weight.&#xD;
      Additionally, the study will explore if TranS-C improves sleep health and cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      Aim 1 (Primary): Examine the feasibility and acceptability of TranS-C among adults with poor&#xD;
      sleep health and excess weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Exploratory): Explore the effect of TranS-C on the sleep health of adults with poor&#xD;
      sleep and excess weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Exploratory): Explore the effect of TranS-C on the cardiometabolic health of adults&#xD;
      with poor sleep and excess weight.&#xD;

    <description>Change in composite measure of sleep health which is the sum of scores on 6 sleep dimensions. Each dimension will be dichotomized as either 'good (1)' or 'poor (0)' based on clinically and scientifically relevant rationales and added together. Score will range from 0-6 with higher scores representing better sleep health.</description>

    <description>TranS-C will be provided in eight weekly, one-on-one 50-minute sessions delivered remotely by two-way video conferencing. Each week will include goal setting and homework assignments which will be reviewed in the following session.&#xD;
The sessions will include information on sleep and circadian rhythms, behavioral change and motivation, and goal setting. The topics covered in the sessions include establishing regular sleep-wake times, learning a wind-down route, learning a wake-up routine, improving daytime functioning, correcting unhelpful sleep-related beliefs, and maintenance of behavior change.</description>
