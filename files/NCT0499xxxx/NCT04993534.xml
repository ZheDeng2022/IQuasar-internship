      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation and (cost-)effectiveness of&#xD;
      the culturally and contextually adapted Doing What Matters in times of stress (DWM) and&#xD;
      Problem Management Plus (PM+) stepped-care programs amongst asylum seekers, refugees, and/or&#xD;
      migrants living in Italy. Outcomes include mental health, resilience, wellbeing, health&#xD;
      inequalities, and costs to health systems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has a major and potentially long-lasting effect on&#xD;
      mental health and wellbeing across populations worldwide. Vulnerable groups, such as asylum&#xD;
      seekers, refugees and migrants, are disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      There is a high need for psychosocial interventions that can target the most prevalent mental&#xD;
      health problems as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing the needs of many people in&#xD;
      a way that maximizes the use of resources. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed&#xD;
      two scalable, low-intensity psychological interventions: Doing What Matters in times of&#xD;
      stress (DWM; a self-help intervention) and Problem Management Plus (PM+; a face-to-face&#xD;
      intervention). DWM and PM+ can be delivered by paraprofessionals, are applicable to a variety&#xD;
      of mental health problems (depression, anxiety and PTSD), and can be adapted to different&#xD;
      populations, cultures and languages. Both DWM and PM+ have been proven to be effective on&#xD;
      their own. In this study, DWM and PM+ will be combined into a stepped-care intervention. This&#xD;
      study is part of the larger EU H2020-RESPOND project, which aims to improve the preparedness&#xD;
      of the European mental health care system in the face of future pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective is to evaluate the implementation and (cost-)effectiveness of&#xD;
      the culturally and contextually adapted DWM/PM+ stepped-care programs amongst asylum seekers,&#xD;
      refugees, and/or migrants living in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of mental&#xD;
      health outcomes, resilience, wellbeing, health inequalities, and costs to health systems. The&#xD;
      main hypothesis is that the stepped-care DWM/PM+ intervention together with psychological&#xD;
      first aid (PFA) in addition to care-as-usual (CAU) will be more effective in decreasing&#xD;
      psychological distress and symptoms of mental health problems than PFA and CAU alone. We aim&#xD;
      to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of the&#xD;
      stepped-care DWM/PM+ intervention, and to identify (a) barriers and facilitators to treatment&#xD;
      engagement and adherence and (b) opportunities for scaling up the implementation of the&#xD;
      DWM/PM+ intervention within the existing health care system in Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: pragmatic implementation trial with a single-blinded, randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group design. The final phase of the trial will consist of a qualitative process&#xD;
      evaluation with individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative phase will include some participants in the randomized trial who completed&#xD;
      DWM (n=2/4;), who completed PM+ (n=2/4), who dropped-out during DWM (n=2/4), and who&#xD;
      dropped-out during PM+ (n=2/4); (b) local stakeholders (n=10/15) (c) facilitators of the DWM&#xD;
      and PM+ intervention (both helpers and trainers/supervisors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult asylum seekers, refugees or migrants with self-reported elevated&#xD;
      psychological distress (K10 &gt;15.9) (n=212).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All participants (in both the treatment and the comparison group) will receive&#xD;
      Psychological First Aid (PFA) and CAU. In addition to PFA and CAU, the treatment group will&#xD;
      receive the stepped-care intervention (DWM with or without PM+). The stepped-care&#xD;
      intervention consists of DWM (step 1), and conditionally PM+ (step 2) if participants still&#xD;
      meet criteria for psychological distress (K10 &gt;15.9) 2 weeks after having received DWM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DWM, i.e. a self-help book with pre-recorded audios, has been adapted as an online&#xD;
      intervention (phase 1). PM+ consists of five sessions and will be delivered by trained&#xD;
      peer-support helpers in person or via teleconferencing in individual or group format. In&#xD;
      addition to PFA, the comparison group will receive CAU which ranges from community care to&#xD;
      specialized psychological treatments, according to the needs and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      interviewer-administered, inperson or through (video) calls. For all participants, online&#xD;
      assessments will take place at baseline, at 2 weeks after having received DWM, at 1 week and&#xD;
      at 2 months after having received PM+. The primary outcome will be the decrease in symptoms&#xD;
      of anxiety and depression from baseline to two-month follow-up, measured through the sum&#xD;
      score of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7),&#xD;
      i.e. the PHQ-Anxiety and Depression Score (PHQ-ADS). We expect to detect a Cohen's d effect&#xD;
      size of 0.3 in the DWM/PM+ group at 2 months post-treatment. Additional health outcomes&#xD;
      include level of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9), symptoms of posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PCL-5), resilience (Mainz Inventory of Microstressors, MIMIS), quality of life&#xD;
      (5-level EQ-5D version, EQ-5D-5L), and cost of care (Client Service Receipt Inventory, CSRI).&#xD;
      Additional study parameters will include demographic data, COVID-19 related (exposure)&#xD;
      variables, treatment fidelity, satisfaction and acceptability of the intervention program,&#xD;
      and implementation indicators (such as reach, dose, resource use, intervention-related&#xD;
      costs). Through FGDs and interviews at the end of the trial, the feasibility of scaling-up&#xD;
      the implementation on the stepped-care DWM/PM+ intervention within asylum seekers, refugees,&#xD;
      and migrants in Italy.&#xD;

The DWM program has been developed by WHO and collaborators working in the humanitarian field. DWM was designed to be relevant for large segments of adversity-affected populations: it is intended to be transdiagnostic, and easily adaptable to different cultures and languages.&#xD;

    <description>The DWM program consists of a self-help guide that is complemented with pre-recorded audio exercises. The audio material imparts key information about stress management and guides participants through individual exercises. Additionally, participants are guided by a briefly trained helper. DWM includes five sections (or modules), each of which focuses on a specific skill. In this study, the DWM program will be delivered as an online intervention. The DWM intervention, i.e. both the audios and the self-help guide, have been adapted for use on a smartphone or other device with internet access.&#xD;
PM+ is a new, brief, psychological intervention program based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. The manual involves the following empirically supported elements: problem solving plus stress management, behavioral activation, facing fears, and accessing social support.</description>
