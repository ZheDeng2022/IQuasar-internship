    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see how effective the drug niraparib is against cancer that&#xD;
      has metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study involves the study drug niraparib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      niraparib in treating cancer that has metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved niraparib for cancer&#xD;
      metastasized to the central nervous system (CNS) but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niraparib is a type of drug called a &quot;PARP inhibitor&quot;, which blocks DNA (the genetic material&#xD;
      of cells) damage from being repaired or may prevent damage from occurring in the first place.&#xD;
      In cancer treatment, inhibiting PARP may help kill cancer cells by not allowing the cancer&#xD;
      cells to repair its DNA damage or prevent DNA damage associated with your diagnosis from&#xD;
      occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drug for up to 2 years or until their disease worsens,&#xD;
      they have unacceptable side effects, or they meet one of the criteria to be removed from the&#xD;
      study. Participants will then be followed every 4 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GlaxoSmithKline, a pharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing&#xD;
      funding for the study, including the study drug.&#xD;
