    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to determine the efficacy of a tablet-based educational&#xD;
      intervention at improving orthopaedic health literacy amongst families of pediatric patients&#xD;
      treated for fractures in an outpatient setting.&#xD;

      This project aims to reduce knowledge disparity amongst caregivers of patients presenting for&#xD;
      pediatric fracture care. At our institution, many patients presenting with fractures do not&#xD;
      have easy access to either technology or the internet, preventing caregivers from benefiting&#xD;
      from educational tools such as POSNA's OrthoKidsÂ®. We are planning to increase access and&#xD;
      improve health literacy through a simple intervention of providing tablet-based access to&#xD;
      POSNA's Orthokids while families are waiting for their physician. Families will be randomized&#xD;
      to either standard waiting room experience vs. tablet-based educational intervention to limit&#xD;
      selection bias. A brief pre-visit questionnaire will be completed by all caregivers to assess&#xD;
      fracture and cast care knowledge as well as the highest educational degree obtained by the&#xD;
      caregiver.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group of the RCT will be given tablet-based education. The first clinic follow-up visit will consist of screening for consent, providing a QR code for Orthokids, and conducting the pre-intervention questionnaire. The pre-intervention questionnaire has two sections with questions pertaining to demographics and orthopedic knowledge. The second clinic follow-up visit will be provided with the tablet for repeat education, with Orthokids and the post-intervention questionnaire will be distributed. The post-intervention questionnaire has two sections with questions pertaining to orthopedic knowledge and satisfaction with care.</description>
