  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningiomas are known to be the most frequent intracranial neoplasms and account for approx.&#xD;
      25-33% of all intracranial tumours.Targeted radionuclide therapy with radiolabelled&#xD;
      somatostatin analogues, also called Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), has proven&#xD;
      to be an effective treatment in metastatic intestinal neuroendocrine tumours and is currently&#xD;
      used in advanced, recurrent or progressive meningiomas with promising results. In this study,&#xD;
      the therapeutic index of a standard and newly developed radiolabelled somatostatin antagonist&#xD;
      will be evaluated and compared in PRRT. In a second step, safety and efficacy of the latter&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sstr2) has been identifies as a peptide hormone receptor&#xD;
      that is highly expressed in 70 - 100% of meningiomas representing an attractive target for so&#xD;
      called &quot;theranostic&quot; applications combining molecular imaging and targeted radionuclide&#xD;
      therapy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues.The newly developed radiolabelled&#xD;
      somatostatin antagonist 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 has been shown to exert a high binding affinity to&#xD;
      sstr2 suggesting a higher efficacy in the treatment of advanced meningiomas than the&#xD;
      currently available somatostatin analogues (e.g. 177Lu-DOTATOC, 177Lu-DOTATATE).Therefore,&#xD;
      the hypothesis has been postulated that 177LuDOTA-JR11 has an improved therapeutic index&#xD;
      (tumour-to-dose limiting organ dose ratios) compared to 177Lu-DOTATOC, and that it can be&#xD;
      safely used for PRRT in patients with advanced, recurrent or progressive meningiomas. The aim&#xD;
      of this 2-step Phase 0 / Phase I/II study is to a) evaluate in the same meningioma patients&#xD;
      the therapeutic index (tumour-to-dose limiting organ dose ratios) of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 in&#xD;
      comparison to 177Lu-DOTATOC and b) based on the previous results, to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of PRRT with 177Lu-DOTA-JR11.&#xD;
