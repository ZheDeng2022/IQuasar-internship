  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the available studies that are relevant to motor rehabilitation for children with&#xD;
      dyskinetic type of cerebral palsy are few and are comprised of small numbers of children.&#xD;
      Further researches are necessary to explore new conservative therapeutic protocols and&#xD;
      techniques that should contribute to control disorganized movement, handle postural&#xD;
      asymmetry, maintain postural stability, and improve gait performance. Therefore, the&#xD;
      objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of soft orthosis and strapping&#xD;
      system on balance, and gait performance in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyskinetic type of cerebral palsy typically results from extrapyramidal and basal ganglia&#xD;
      damage. The most common dyskinetic movement disorders are choreoathetosis and dystonia. Their&#xD;
      clinical features include fluctuation of muscle tone, involuntary and in-coordinated&#xD;
      movement, and posture instability. These features have significant negative impacts on the&#xD;
      children's quality of life and performance of daily activities. Management strategy for&#xD;
      children with dyskinesia requires both medical and rehabilitative treatment. Most of the&#xD;
      available studies that are relevant to their motor rehabilitation are few and comprised of&#xD;
      small numbers of children. The therapeutic modalities currently used for their rehabilitation&#xD;
      require more evidence to certain their efficacy. Moreover, further researches are necessary&#xD;
      to explore new conservative therapeutic protocols and techniques that should correct postural&#xD;
      instability and improve the poor mobility of these children The objective of this study was&#xD;
      to examine the effectiveness of an orthotic undergarment which is (TheraTog orthosis), and&#xD;
      its strapping system on balance and gait performance in children with dyskinetic cerebral&#xD;
      palsy.&#xD;

    <description>The Biodex Balance System was used to assess the Change in the Overall Stability Indices of the Postural Stability Test. The test includes measurement of the following indices: overall stability index, anteroposterior index and mediolateral index which represents the children's ability to control their postural balance stability in all directions. High values % represent less stability and the children had difficulty in balance control. On the other hand lower values were indicative of a better balance control.</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Balance Scale is a valid and reliable test to assess and re-assess balance deficits in children with mild and moderate motor disabilities. The test includes fourteen tasks that evaluate balance abilities and motor performance in children. 0-4 is the rating score for each item, where zero is the lowest score and 56 is the highest possible score for all tasks that indicate the best balance and motor performance ever.</description>
