  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The individualized treatment of tumors has always been an urgent problem in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Organoids-on-a-chip can reflect the heterogeneity of tumors and is a good model for&#xD;
      in vitro anticancer drug screening. In this study, surgical specimens of patients with&#xD;
      advanced colorectal cancer will be collected for organoid culture and organoids-on-a- chip.&#xD;
      Use organoids-on-a-chip to screen tumor chemotherapy drugs, compare the results of patients'&#xD;
      actual medication regimens, and study the guiding role of organoids in the formulation of&#xD;
      precise tumor treatment plans. The investigators will compare the response of organoids to&#xD;
      drugs in vitro with the patient's response to actual chemotherapy and targeted drugs and&#xD;
      explore the feasibility and accuracy of organoids-on-a-chip based drug screening for advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. The project will establish a screening platform for chemotherapeutic drugs&#xD;
      and targeted drugs based on colorectal cancer organoids to quickly and accurately formulate&#xD;
      personalized treatment plans for clinical patients.&#xD;

      1. Establish and identify colorectal cancer organoid chip culture system: collect tumor&#xD;
           tissues and normal tissues from patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Culture&#xD;
           primary organoids, and organoids derived from normal mucosal tissues as controls.&#xD;
           Validate tumor organoids and organoid chips by morphology (HE, immunohistochemical&#xD;
           staining) and gene sequencing (target-seq) methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After each enrolled patient undergoes MDT discussion, chemotherapy is given to the&#xD;
           patient according to the existing clinical guidelines and clinical pathways for&#xD;
           colorectal cancer. Meanwhile, in vitro drug screening based on colorectal cancer&#xD;
           organoid chips is conducted. Collect target gene sequencing results and common clinical&#xD;
           medication plans. Local recurrence rate, disease progression-free survival rate and&#xD;
           overall survival rate will be followed up for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare the patient's response to the actual medication regimen and organoids in vitro&#xD;
           drug screening based on organoids-on-a-chip, and evaluate the accuracy, specificity and&#xD;
           sensitivity of organoids-on-a-chip for in vitro drug screening.&#xD;
