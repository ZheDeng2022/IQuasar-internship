  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of our study is to understand the effects of Covid-19 disease on vascular&#xD;
      inflammation and coagulation cascade, and secondarily, to investigate its utility in&#xD;
      predicting disease prognosis by analyzing serum PAI-1 levels in patients with different&#xD;
      severity. The study is planned as a prospective, cross-sectional study that will include&#xD;
      patients admitted to Covid-19 services between January 18, 2021, and August 30, 2021. A total&#xD;
      of 80 volunteers will be enrolled in the trial whose age, gender, and BMI are planned to be&#xD;
      matched.The study will be conducted on four groups. Group 1 (n=20; with mild symptoms), Group&#xD;
      2 (n=20; with moderate symptoms), Group 3 (n=20; with severe symptoms) and Group 4 (n=20;&#xD;
      Control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who accepted the study will have their sociodemographic data, medical&#xD;
      history, and vital signs (respiratory rate, saturation, temperature, and blood pressure&#xD;
      values) recorded at the start of the study. The pulmonologist in the study will also classify&#xD;
      the patient group's chest X-ray and chest tomography findings and the thymus gland&#xD;
      dimensions. After all four groups of patients have given their consent for the study, a&#xD;
      sample of 5cc blood will be obtained once for the PAI-1 analysis.&#xD;

      The study is planned as a prospective, cross-sectional study that will include patients&#xD;
      admitted to Covid-19 services between January 18, 2021, and August 30, 2021. A total of 80&#xD;
      volunteers will be enrolled in the trial whose age, gender, and BMI are planned to be&#xD;
      matched. The study will be conducted on four groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (n=20; with mild symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Covid positive patients with mild symptoms who required to be hospitalized,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptomatic (fever, cough, weakness, joint pain, etc.) new patients who apply to the&#xD;
           Covid clinic for the first time,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with stable vital signs and/or SpO2 ≥92% in room air, no radiological signs of&#xD;
           lung involvement or mild pneumonia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not been started on steroid therapy and who have not yet received&#xD;
           anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=20; with moderate symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are positive for Covid 19 and admitted to the covid clinic for the first&#xD;
           time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiologically moderate pneumonia findings and/or SpO2=88-92% in room air,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not been started antiviral, steroid, and anticoagulant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (n=20; with severe symptoms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are currently hospitalized in the Covid clinic,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with radiological findings of severe pneumonia or ARDS and/or high FiO2&#xD;
           requirement due to respiratory failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of this group may have received antiviral, anticoagulant, and/or steroid and/or&#xD;
           biologic agent treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 (n=20; Control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control group will be composed of healthy adult individuals applying to adult&#xD;
           allergy outpatient clinics on a voluntary basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have not been previously diagnosed with Covid-19 and have not vaccinated&#xD;
           against Covid-19,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control patients will be matched with the study groups according to age, gender, and&#xD;
           BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who accepted the study will have their sociodemographic data, medical&#xD;
      history, and vital signs (respiratory rate, saturation, temperature, and blood pressure&#xD;
      values) recorded at the start of the study. The pulmonologist in the study will also classify&#xD;
      the patient group's chest X-ray and chest tomography findings, as well as the thymus gland&#xD;
      dimensions. After all four groups of patients have given their consent for the study, a&#xD;
      sample of 5cc blood will be obtained once for the PAI-1analysis. The sample will be&#xD;
      centrifuged for around 5 minutes at 3000 rpm before being frozen at -70 degrees. The blood&#xD;
      sample will be dissolved under proper conditions after a sufficient number of participants&#xD;
      has been reached. The researchers will provide the ELISA kits for the study, and laboratory&#xD;
      services will be purchased from outside the hospital. Due to Covid-19 disease, white blood&#xD;
      cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, LDH), sodium,&#xD;
      total protein, albumin, aPTT, PTZ, INR, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen levels will be recorded in&#xD;
      the patient case report form, as well as CRP, IL-6, and ferritin levels, which are routinely&#xD;
      requested from patients during their hospitalization. No treatment other than the treatments&#xD;
      specified in the Covid-19 guidelines of the Ministry of Health will never be applied to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
