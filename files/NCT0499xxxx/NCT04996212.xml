  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The syndrome characterized by the persistence of symptoms typical of COVID-19, beyond 4 weeks&#xD;
      after discharge, is called long COVID. Long COVID affects a high percentage of patients who&#xD;
      have suffered from COVID-19, regardless of its severity. The various symptoms present in that&#xD;
      patients affect the functionality and physical, mental and psychological capacities of&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, it is necessary to implement therapeutic programs, based on exercises&#xD;
      and techniques of physiotherapy, to help affected people to resume their work, family, social&#xD;
      and sports activities; prior to illness. Given the context in which these programs must be&#xD;
      developed, telecare is positioned as the most recommended care method to carry out the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of these patients. The general objective of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a cardiorespiratory tele-rehabilitation program in persistent COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. Study participants (n = 120) will be randomly assigned to one of four intervention&#xD;
      groups. Group 1 will receive a health education dossier; group 2 will perform breathing&#xD;
      exercises; group 3 will combine breathing exercises with aerobic exercise; and group 4 will&#xD;
      perform functional exercises, in addition to respiratory physiotherapy. All participants will&#xD;
      be evaluated at the beginning of the intervention, at the end of it and 3 months later as a&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline PostCovid-19 Functional Satatus Scale at five months (PCFSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCFS items assess the functional limitations that post-COVID-19 patients encounter when carrying out their usual daily activities. The scale also makes it possible to objectify the disabilities of each individual by assigning a grade between 0, absence of limitation and 4, severe functional limitations.&#xD;
The PCFS, therefore, is a useful tool to assess and quantify the severity of the consequences that COVID-19 has generated on the functional status of all subjects who have suffered it.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (EQ-5D-3L)</measure>
    <time_frame>It will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a short and simple scale consisting of 2 parts. In the first of the pages, a total of 5 questions allow evaluating five different dimensions: mobility, self-care, habitual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression. In the second part, through a Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), the patient can quantify, from 0 to 100, her perceived health status at the time of evaluation</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 10 items through which the fatigue experienced by the subject can be assessed at two levels: physical and mental.&#xD;
Participants in this study must answer how often the situations described in each item on the scale occur. To do this, they must quantify each statement with a number from 1 to 5, where 1 is never; and 5, always.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale (LCADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The LCADL was designed with the purpose of assessing the level of dyspnea, reported by patients with pulmonary pathology, during the performance of ADL. The LCADL scale therefore makes it possible to assess and adequately monitor the functional deterioration that patients experience as a consequence of their dyspnea. Throughout its development, this scale explores 4 different dimensions: self-care, home activities, physical activity and leisure activities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS scale is a widely used instrument to assess the degree of emotional distress suffered by people with pathology. The scale consists of 14 items that consider cognitive, affective and behavioral aspects; but not somatic. The original version of the HADS has been validated and translated into different languages, including Spanish</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS allows evaluating the level of stress perceived by patients during the last month It is made up of 14 items that explore the thoughts and feelings of the respondent that can be related to high levels of stress. The higher the score, the higher the level of perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-2, through its 21 items, aims to help the health professional to identify and measure the severity of symptoms, typical of a depressive process, in the adult population</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise tolerance. Thirty Seconds Sit-To-Stand</measure>
    <time_frame>it will be evaluated in three moments: Pre intervention: before starting the exercise program Post intervention: after 8 weeks of physiotherapy intervention Follow-up: 3 months after completing the physiotherapy program.</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise tolerance will be assessed using the Thirty Seconds Sit-To-Stand test (30stst), as it has proven to be a useful test to evaluate the strength and endurance of the lower limbs and determine the patient's tolerance to physical activity</description>

They will be provided, via email, a dossier with updated information on COVID-19 and persistent covid; as well as some general recommendations on the management of COVID-19 and its sequelae. Participants will be asked to fill out a physical activity diary, in which the exercise performed each week is recorded. Each individual must write down the number of exercise sessions performed; its duration; the type of activity carried out (aerobic or strength exercise); the intensity of work; and the degree of perceived exertion</description>
