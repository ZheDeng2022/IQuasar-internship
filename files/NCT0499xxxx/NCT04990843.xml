  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vans are the fastest-growing category of licensed road vehicle in the UK with growing carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (CO2) emissions. The proposed research into how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and&#xD;
      land logistics systems can be combined and managed will provide fundamental new understanding&#xD;
      into the impacts of regulation and operating criteria on energy efficiency and costs. Medical&#xD;
      logistics could be the first domain to utilise UAVs on a commercial scale, with preliminary&#xD;
      analysis on pathology logistics within Southampton indicating that UAVs would significantly&#xD;
      reduce CO2 emissions. With the National Health Service (NHS) spending an estimated £2.5&#xD;
      billion annually on pathology logistics and with patient numbers rising, there is a need to&#xD;
      re-think how logistics costs could be reduced whilst improving bleed-to-diagnosis times for&#xD;
      patients and energy demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research vision is to examine the energy reduction potential of logistics solutions&#xD;
      involving UAVs operating alongside sustainable last-mile delivery solutions (cargo cycles and&#xD;
      walking porters via micro-consolidation points).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This involves understanding UAV operations in airspace shared with manned aircraft. The&#xD;
      project focuses on a case study and trials based around NHS pathology sample transportation&#xD;
      in the Solent and Dorset region. The key research objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the collective transport and energy impacts of current 'business-as-usual'&#xD;
           NHS pathology logistics across the Solent region;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop new simulation tools to quantify the energy consumption of UAVs and land&#xD;
           logistics systems resulting from new types of traffic regulation for shared airspace and&#xD;
           the operating requirements of UAVs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the impact on air space and energy use of a large scale take-up of UAVs for&#xD;
           medical logistics across the Solent region;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Understand stakeholder concerns about UAVs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Understand the regulatory and governance needs associated with UAV interventions that&#xD;
           will lead to energy benefits in logistics.&#xD;
