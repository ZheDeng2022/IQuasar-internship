      The objectives of this study are to collect the long-term safety and effectiveness data of&#xD;
      performing thalamotomy for tremor dominant Parkinson's Disease (TDPD) using the Exablate&#xD;
      Neuro system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post-approval registry which is required by of the approval under PMA P150038/S006&#xD;
      for the ExablateÂ® Model 4000 (Exablate Neuro) Type 1.0 and Type 1.1 for unilateral&#xD;
      thalamotomy in the treatment of medication refractory Tremor Dominant Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      (TDPD). Subjects participating in this registry will have received a unilateral thalamotomy&#xD;
      (ventralis medius) prior to enrollment using the commercially available Exablate Neuro for&#xD;
      the treatment of Essential tremor and TDPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments will be collected at Baseline,1, 3, 6, and 12 months post Exablate&#xD;
      procedure and annually thereafter for 5 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse Events (AEs) (does not apply to Baseline Visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication usage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tremor/motor scores (Parts A and B) of the CRST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Posture/rest components (Part A) of the CRST&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of disability (Part C) of CRST&#xD;
