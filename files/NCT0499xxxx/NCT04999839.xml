    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose&#xD;
      study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NDI-034858 in subjects&#xD;
      with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This study will also evaluate the plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of NDI-034858 and explore the immune response to NDI-034858 in subjects with&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 250 male and female subjects, aged 18 to 70 years (inclusive) will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study. Subjects will be randomized to receive either one of the four doses of&#xD;
      NDI-034858, or placebo on Day 1. The goal is to have approximately 50 subjects randomized per&#xD;
      treatment group (1:1:1:1:1 ratio) on Day 1. During the treatment period, NDI-034858 or&#xD;
      placebo will be orally administered QD for 12 weeks. The 12 week treatment period will be&#xD;
      followed by a 4-week safety follow-up period.&#xD;

    <description>The Psoriasis Areas and Severity Index (PASI) is a measurement tool used to assess the severity of psoriasis, monitor the progression of the condition, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. It is calculated using the redness, thickness, and scaring of psoriasis plaques and the surface area of the body affected by the plaques. The score ranges from 0-72, with higher scores indicating greater severity of psoriasis.</description>

    <description>The Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a scale used to assess the severity of psoriasis, monitor the progression of the condition, and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.

             contraceptive method from at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 until at least 4 weeks after&#xD;
             the last study product administration. Highly effective contraceptive methods include&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (eg, combined oral contraceptive, patch, vaginal ring,&#xD;
             injectable, or implant), intrauterine devices or intrauterine systems, vasectomized&#xD;
