  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study developed an online counseling program called &quot;EASE Online&quot; for Hong Kong people&#xD;
      with social anxiety disorder. The program effectiveness was evaluated by a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in reducing social anxiety and improving quality of life of the&#xD;
      participants. The 3- and 6-month maintenance effects were also tested.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, is one of the most common mental&#xD;
      disorders worldwide. In Hong Kong, the 12-month prevalence of SAD is 3.2% (Lee, Lee &amp; Kwok,&#xD;
      2005) with more than 230,000 sufferers. However, only 8.7% of SAD sufferers have sought&#xD;
      medical treatment in Hong Kong (Lee et al., 2005), which means that most of the sufferers are&#xD;
      undiagnosed and untreated. One of the most effective treatments for SAD is cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT), and internet-based CBT has shown promise in reducing general and&#xD;
      social anxieties, as well as improving the quality of life of those with SAD (e.g. Carlbring&#xD;
      et al., 2007; Tillfors et al., 2011). However, few studies have been conducted in this field&#xD;
      in Hong Kong. This project aims to develop an online CBT program (including both an online&#xD;
      platform and mobile application) for Hong Kong people with SAD, as well as evaluate its&#xD;
      effectiveness in reducing anxiety symptoms and psychological distress, and improving quality&#xD;
      of life at post-treatment and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      design was adopted for program evaluation.&#xD;
