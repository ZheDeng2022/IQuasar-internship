      Background: The present study is conducted to introduce a common disease of abdominal wall&#xD;
      which has received less attention in scientific resources. In traditional medicine sources&#xD;
      Some scholars believe that this condition occurs due to the movement of the abdominal muscle&#xD;
      near the umbilicus or nave laterally movement of nave.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A case series study Method: This study was a case series study. The study population&#xD;
      was all patients who following repeated hospital visits did not improve, and for their last&#xD;
      try, they visited a traditional clinic, and were diagnosed with umbilical hernia during a&#xD;
      period of 5 months.&#xD;
