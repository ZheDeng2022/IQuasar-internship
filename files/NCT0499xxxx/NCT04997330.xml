  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) over dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could correct defective executive functions over the hyperactive&#xD;
      reward circuit through the meso-fronto-limbic connections. The restored cortical inhibitory&#xD;
      control over compulsive alcohol use, could improve abstinence after withdrawal. The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of HF-rTMS over DLPFC in AUD patients with executive&#xD;
      dysfunction after withdrawal.&#xD;

      PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with AUD (moderate to mild according to Alcohol Dependance Scale) with executive&#xD;
      dysfunctions will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter pilot double blind randomized controlled trial. After at least&#xD;
      seven days of alcohol residential detoxification, executive dysfunctions's participants will&#xD;
      be tested. 64 of them with executive dysfunctions will be randomized either in the active&#xD;
      rTMS group or in the sham rTMS group. TMS will be performed during hospitalisation over 10&#xD;
      days. rTMS are proposed as an add on to the usual treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 rTMS (twice a day) will be performed 10 consecutive working days. The target of the rTMS&#xD;
      will be the DLPFC (left side in the morning, right side in the afternoon). During each rTMS&#xD;
      sessions (active and sham), alcohol related pictures from the Geneva Appetitive alcohol&#xD;
      Pictures will be presented.In the active arm, rTMS will be performed with high frequency&#xD;
      (20hz, 1500 pulses per session, 110% of motor threshold).In the control group, sham rTMS will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be follow up to three months after the end of rTMS treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of patients with continuous complete abstinence up to one month after the end of the rTMS treatment.&#xD;
The abstinence will be assessed using the Alcohol-Time Line Follow Back tool (TLFB).

    <time_frame>1 month after the end of rTMS sessions</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol dependence severity will be evaluated with the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS). The ADS is a self-administrated 25-items questionnaire (requiring 5 minutes) assessing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, impaired control over drinking, awareness of compulsive drink, increased tolerance and salience of drink-seeking behavior. ADS is initially used to assess a past 12-month period, its instructions can be modified for different time-frame. The ADS will be assessed on previous 4 weeks. This scale is scored out of 47, higher scores are considered worse.</description>
