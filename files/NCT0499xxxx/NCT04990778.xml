  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates the effect of venetoclax and eprenetapopt in treating&#xD;
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or dose not respond to&#xD;
      treatment (refractory). Chemotherapy drugs, such as venetoclax and eprenetapopt, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy (overall response rate) of the eprenetapopt plus venetoclax&#xD;
      combination in relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients (with/without TP53&#xD;
      aberrations).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of the eprenetapopt plus venetoclax combination in&#xD;
      relapsed refractory MCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the overall survival and progression-free survival of the eprenetapopt plus&#xD;
      venetoclax combination in relapsed refractory MCL patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive eprenetapopt intravenously (IV) over 6 hours on days 1-4 and venetoclax&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
