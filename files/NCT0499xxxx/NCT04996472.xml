    <textblock>
      This broad aim of this clinical study is to assess the hypothesis that morphological and&#xD;
      phonological deficits are linked by a broader deficit in sequential pattern learning. This&#xD;
      hypothesis applies to learning in general, but is especially critical as an avenue for&#xD;
      developing earlier assessments and more powerful interventions for children with&#xD;
      developmental language disorder (DLD; AKA specific language impairment). Other populations,&#xD;
      such as at-risk toddlers, may also benefit from this new approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The developmental approach taken here combines what researchers already know about&#xD;
      morpho-syntactic deficits in DLD with recent developments in the fields of linguistics and&#xD;
      language acquisition. First, it is possible to divide phonological and morphological patterns&#xD;
      into three pattern types (Single Feature, OR/Disjunction, Family Resemblance/Prototype), with&#xD;
      these types having a long history of study in visual pattern learning. Importantly, children&#xD;
      with DLD appear to have maximum difficulty with morpho-syntactic patterns of the OR type&#xD;
      (e.g., regular past tense; add a &quot;t&quot; if the final consonant is voiceless OR a &quot;d&quot; if the&#xD;
      final consonant is voiced). In contrast, studies using artificial grammars show that infants&#xD;
      who are typically developing are highly adept at learning Single Feature and OR pattern&#xD;
      types; Family Resemblance patterns may be weaker. Family resemblance patterns relate to&#xD;
      similarity, and may be more closely tied to the lexicon than to grammar (e.g., beagles and&#xD;
      terriers are similar and they are both dogs; the words &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;boat&quot; are similar).&#xD;
      Typical adults are adept at Single Feature and Family Resemblance patterns, but appear to be,&#xD;
      at least superficially, more like children with DLD in their performance on the OR pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these intriguing findings as a starting point, the proposed research links phonological&#xD;
      and morphological sequence learning in children with developmental language disorder (DLD).&#xD;
      In the studies focused on children, we ask if 4- to 6-year-olds who are typically developing&#xD;
      as well as those with DLD (both with and without co-occurring speech sound deficits) and&#xD;
      speech sound disorder (SSD; without co-occurring morpho-syntactic deficits) are sensitive to&#xD;
      input examples that fit one of these three patterns. Our hypothesis is that, consistent with&#xD;
      their long-documented morpho-syntactic deficit, children with DLD will have particular&#xD;
      difficulty with the OR pattern. Consistent with their intact morpho-syntactic skills,&#xD;
      children with SSD should show no deficits in the OR pattern, revealing a link between OR&#xD;
      pattern learning, phonology, and morpho-syntax. Our endpoint measure is that children with&#xD;
      DLD (both with and without an accompanying SSD) do not show sensitivity to the OR pattern, as&#xD;
      measured by sound pattern (e.g., phonetic accuracy, syllable sequence stability) and motor&#xD;
      learning (e.g., articulatory and acoustic variability) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis is assessed by indexing the learning trajectory across the training period&#xD;
      and during generalization to new nonwords that are consistent or inconsistent with the&#xD;
      training pattern. In the generalization phase, children are asked to name new novel words&#xD;
      that are either consistent (i.e., that fit the training rule) or inconsistent (i.e., that do&#xD;
      not fit the training rule) nonwords. It is predicted that children with TD and SSD, who are&#xD;
      still in a period of language learning plasticity (they can still learn the sound patterns&#xD;
      and grammar of a second language) will be sensitive to all three patterns. However, children&#xD;
      with DLD (both with and without accompanying SSD) are predicted to show sensitivity to the&#xD;
      family resemblance and single feature patterns, but not to the critical OR pattern-the one&#xD;
      associated with sound pattern and grammatical learning, This would reveal an important&#xD;
      connection between sound pattern and grammatical learning, which could lead to earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis (phonological patterns emerge earlier than grammar) and to more general&#xD;
      intervention practices that focus on sequential pattern learning rather than specific&#xD;
      language goals may be efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim explores whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue facilitates&#xD;
      learning the OR pattern. The hypothesis is that children with DLD (as well as typical adults)&#xD;
      who initially are predicted to have the most difficulty with the OR pattern, will show&#xD;
      increases in sensitivity following the addition of a semantic category cue (e.g., animals for&#xD;
      the voiced consonant rule OR tools for the voiceless consonant rule). This result would be&#xD;
      especially important for learners with DLD, as it may provide a pathway for intervention of a&#xD;
      core learning deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically, these studies are developmental in nature. In the adult component of this&#xD;
      research, the investigators ask if adults are sensitive to input examples that fit one of&#xD;
      these three patterns. Our hypothesis, based on previous findings from the Gerken lab, is that&#xD;
      adults, like children with DLD, do not show sensitivity to the OR pattern. However, adults&#xD;
      are sensitive to single feature and Family Resemblance patterns. Adults still learn words&#xD;
      readily and are sensitive to family resemblance prototype relationships. For adults,&#xD;
      perceptual measures index sensitivity. Similar to the children with typical development, DLD&#xD;
      and SSD, the investigators explore whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue&#xD;
      facilitates learning the OR pattern in adults. The hypothesis is that all learners, including&#xD;
      adults, will show increases in sensitivity following the addition of a semantic category cue&#xD;
      (e.g., animals for voiced rule OR tools for voiceless rule). The findings from adults&#xD;
      contribute to a dynamic developmental framework. Because of the dramatic developmental&#xD;
      changes in sensitivity to phonological sound patterns and the presumed linkage of such&#xD;
      patterns to morpho-syntax, the data from adults are essential in identifying the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism(s) of DLD and to suggesting possible intervention strategies, such as employing&#xD;
      semantic cues to the OR pattern and strengthening lexical organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous work, the investigators know that infants are sensitive to the OR rule. In the&#xD;
      studies focused on toddlers, the investigators ask if dependence on the associatively&#xD;
      organized lexicon can account for the infant-to-adult developmental changes observed for the&#xD;
      OR pattern (which is not associatively organized) and thereby explores the possibility that&#xD;
      children with DLD rely on their lexicons to compensate for their sequential pattern learning&#xD;
      deficit. The hypothesis is that 20-month-old children, who are just entering a period of&#xD;
      rapid vocabulary learning, will show increased sensitivity (based on looking time to words&#xD;
      that are consistent vs. inconsistent within the training set) in the family resemblance&#xD;
      condition when a visual referent (i.e., semantic cue) is added, but decreased sensitivity in&#xD;
      the OR condition when a visual referent is added. These results will also be related to&#xD;
      vocabulary size as reported on the CDI, with the prediction that robust patterns are smaller&#xD;
      for children who received referents or who have smaller vocabularies for the OR pattern and&#xD;
      greater for children who received referents or who have larger vocabularies for the family&#xD;
      resemblance pattern. The results from toddlers, who are just entering a period of rapid&#xD;
      vocabulary learning, provide an essential framework for understanding how different types of&#xD;
      phonological patterns apply to lexical and morpho-syntactic learning, The results of the&#xD;
      proposed study provide a critical developmental framework for identifying the underlying&#xD;
      mechanism(s) of DLD. These findings will also lead to the development of intervention&#xD;
      strategies, such as strengthening lexical organization, to support problematic aspects of&#xD;
      sequential pattern learning.&#xD;
