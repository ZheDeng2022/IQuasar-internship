      Case series design with participants with psychosis with a history of interpersonal&#xD;
      trauma/abuse and current distressing auditory verbal hallucinations and dissociative&#xD;
      experience. Participants were offered up to 24 therapy sessions over a 6-month intervention&#xD;
      window.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: Previous studies have suggested that dissociation might represent an important&#xD;
      mechanism in the maintenance of auditory verbal hallucinations (i.e., voices) in people who&#xD;
      have a history of traumatic life experiences. This study investigated whether a cognitive&#xD;
      behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for psychosis augmented with techniques specifically&#xD;
      targeting dissociative symptoms could improve both dissociation and auditory hallucination&#xD;
      severity in a sample of voice hearers with psychosis and a history of interpersonal trauma&#xD;
      (e.g., exposure to sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 19 service users with psychosis were offered up to 24 therapy sessions&#xD;
      over a 6-month intervention window. Participants were assessed four times over a 12-month&#xD;
      period using measures of dissociation, psychotic symptoms severity, and additional secondary&#xD;
      mental-health and recovery measures.&#xD;

    <description>Sessions 1-4 were focused on engagement, assessment of presenting problems, identification of treatment goals and normalization/ psychoeducation. Sessions 5- 14, focused on techniques to manage dissociative responses and/or increase perceived controllability of dissociation. Although further work on dissociation and/or trauma was encouraged, the targets for intervention in subsequent sessions (15-22) and the strategies selected depended on individual formulation of clients' difficulties and negotiation with the client. This could include re-appraisals on negative beliefs about dissociative experiences, cognitive and/or behavioural change strategies targeting core appraisals of voices leading to related distress, trauma-related techniques (e.g., imagery techniques,), or consolidation of a developmental/longitudinal psychological formulation of the client's difficulties. The final two sessions focused on plans for relapse prevention and maintenance of gains.</description>
