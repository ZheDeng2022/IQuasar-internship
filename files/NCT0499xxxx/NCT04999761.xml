             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator. (eg, paresis&#xD;
             of intestine, intestinal obstruction, unable to receive 5% dextrose in water [DW] in&#xD;
             patients with diabetes mellitus, respiratory failure, renal failure, hepatic failure,&#xD;
             cerebrovascular disorder, gastrointestinal ulcers that require transfusion or are&#xD;
             hemorrhagic, and wounds/bone fractures associated with neovascularization during the&#xD;
             healing process, accumulation of pleural within 2 weeks prior to enrollment, ascitic,&#xD;
