  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      profile of BIA 5-1058 after a single dose in healthy subjects.&#xD;

      Single-centre, open-label, randomised, single-dose, three-way crossover, three-part study in&#xD;
      54 healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprised a screening evaluation between 2 and 28 days before the first IMP&#xD;
      (Investigational Medicinal Product) administration and 3 treatment periods of approximately 4&#xD;
      days, separated by wash-out periods of at least 7 days. A follow-up visit was performed&#xD;
      approximately 7 days after discharge from the last period or early discontinuation. For each&#xD;
      subject, the full duration of the participation in the study was approximately 9 weeks.&#xD;
