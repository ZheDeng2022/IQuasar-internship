  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this regard, the present research project aims to compare dexamethasone PK in&#xD;
      normal-weight versus obese patients treated for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will include patients hospitalized at HUG (Division of General&#xD;
      Internal Medicine) with COVID-19 and treated with oral DEX. This study will include 2 groups&#xD;
      of patients according to their body mass index (BMI) (normal weight with a BMI of 18.5-25.0&#xD;
      kg/m2; obese/ morbidly obese with a BMI ≥30). The primary outcome will be the assessment of&#xD;
      the differential impact of weight on DEX PK. Finally, the data generated will be used to&#xD;
      build a physiologically based PK (PBPK) model for DEX and in different sub-groups. The model&#xD;
      will aim to predict the effect of BMI in virtual populations with different drugs and in&#xD;
      different scenarios. This should allow prospective dose adjustment of DEX based on patient&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;

      Before starting the study, COVID-19 patients receiving dexamethasone as part of their&#xD;
      hospital management and meeting the criteria of inclusion and non-exclusion will have an&#xD;
      information session with an investigator as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study session, capillary blood samples will be taken during a total of 8 hours,&#xD;
      time starting just before DEX administration, and at the following times after the dose: time&#xD;
      of the drug intake, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours. The capillary&#xD;
      blood sample will be obtained by pricking the fingertip using contact-activated lancet (BD&#xD;
      Microtainer). A total of five blood drops (10 μL each) will be collected by a micropipette&#xD;
      and will be dropped off on the blotting paper 903 S&amp;S (Whatman). After a 45-minute drying&#xD;
      time at room temperature, dried blood samples (DBS) samples will be packed in sealable&#xD;
      plastic bags containing a desiccant and stored at - 80°C until analysis. Drugs will be&#xD;
      extracted from DBS using methanol. DEX quantification in capillary DBS will be performed&#xD;
      using reverse-phase- HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometer (MS/MS). In addition to this,&#xD;
      an EDTA tube (3 ml) of blood will be collected and preserved in the biobank (-80°C) and will&#xD;
      be used whether further analysis should be performed on the samples. In this aim an&#xD;
      authorization to reuse the samples will be requested from each patient during the consent&#xD;
      signature.&#xD;
