  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized prospective multi center study is designed to confirm a new diagnostic&#xD;
      pathway in primary diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer by combination of&#xD;
      serum levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), digitorectal examination (DRE), and&#xD;
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Men at the age of 50 to 75 with an&#xD;
      elevated PSA (&gt;= 4 ng/ml) and /or suspicious DRE receive an upfront multi parametric MRI.&#xD;
      Only men with MRI results suspicious of clinically significant prostate cancer will be&#xD;
      biopsied. Those will be randomized into arm A and arm B. Arm A undergoes only targeted MRI/US&#xD;
      fusion-guided biopsies (= TB with a maximum of 3 targets and 2 cores per target). Arm B&#xD;
      receives systematic biopsies (= SB with 12 biopsy cores) and TB. Men with normal mpMRI will&#xD;
      be observed in a structured manner but will not be biopsied (arms C and D). The primary&#xD;
      objective comprises the demonstration of non-inferiority of the detection clinically&#xD;
      significant prostate cancer (ISUP grade group 1) of TB (arm A) compared to TB+SB (arm B).&#xD;
      Overall, our study aims to improve patient care by reducing the number of patients biopsied,&#xD;
      by reducing the number of biopsy cores per patient, and by lowering the risk of overdiagnosis&#xD;
      of indolent prostate cancer. The results of this study will directly influence clinical&#xD;
      practice, will have a positive impact on patients' lives, and will lower the financial burden&#xD;
      due to reduced overdiagnosis and over treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men at the age of 50 to 75 years with an elevated PSA (≥ 4ng/ml) and/or suspicious DRE&#xD;
      receive a multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and will be stratified based on MRI results. Only men&#xD;
      with suspicious MRI, PI-RADS 4/5, and PI-RADS 3 in conjunction with high PSA density (PSAD &gt;&#xD;
      0.15) are biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be randomized into arms A nd B. While patients in arm A undergo only targeted&#xD;
      MRI/US fusion-guided biopsies (TB), patients in the &quot;combined&quot; arm B receive systematic&#xD;
      biopsies (SB) and TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority in detecting clinically significant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (ISUP grade group ≥ 2) and superiority in avoiding detection of clinically&#xD;
      insignificant prostate cancers (ISUP grade group 1) of TB (arm A) compared to TB+SB (arm B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions that are conducted within the PRIMA trial include PSA testing, digital rectal&#xD;
      examination of the prostate (DRE), multiparametric prostate MRI, systematic and MRI/US&#xD;
      fusion-guided biopsies as well as MRI inbore biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms A + B: Men with PI-RADS 4/5 and PI-RADS 3 in conjunction with PSAD &gt; 0.15 will be&#xD;
      randomized into arm A or arm B and biopsied as explained above. Men with PI-RADS 3 and PSAD &gt;&#xD;
      0.15 with negative biopsy results will receive a follow-up MRI annually and PSA every 6&#xD;
      months for 3 years. In case of upgrade to PI-RADS 4/5, men will be re-biopsied. Men with&#xD;
      PI-RADS 4/5 without cancer diagnosis or with clinically insignificant cancer in the&#xD;
      subsequent biopsy will be offered an additional MRI inbore biopsy. If MRI inbore biopsy is&#xD;
      negative or with clinically insignificant cancer in men with PI-RADS 4/5, men will be&#xD;
      followed-up with MRI annually and PSA every 6 months for 3 years. In the case of persistent&#xD;
      PI-RADS 4/5, men will be re-biopsied. Men with an upgrade to PI-RADS 4/5 or an increase in&#xD;
      PSAD will be randomized for biopsy into arms A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm C: Men with PI-RADS 3 and PSAD &lt;= 0.15 will be classified as arm C with MRI annually and&#xD;
      PSA every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm D: Men with unsuspicious findings on MRI (PI-RADS 1 or 2) will be assigned to arm D with&#xD;
      PSA every 6 months for 3 years. A control MRI will be performed after 3 years. At any time, a&#xD;
      follow-up can be performed in case of clinical suspicion of PCa or a relevant PSA increase (&gt;&#xD;
      1.0 ng/ml/a).&#xD;

    <description>mpMRI acquisition and reporting will be performed according to the current version of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). MpMRI will be performed at the different study centers on a 3 Tesla MR scanner using multi-phased array surface coil. MpMRI includes T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE-MRI). Hyoscine butyl bromide will be administered to optimize image quality. Prostate imaging quality will be assessed by the prostate imaging quality score (PI-QUAL). In case of contraindications to MRI contrast agents, DCE will be omitted. In case of contraindications to hyoscine butyl bromide, it will be omitted. Lesions with a PI-RADS score of ≥ 4 and 3 with PSAD &gt; 0.15 will considered suspicious for csPCa.</description>
