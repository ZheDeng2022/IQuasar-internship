  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis (CP) affects up to 90% of patients during the course&#xD;
      of their disease, and response to currently available therapies is suboptimal and&#xD;
      unpredictable. The proposed clinical trial will evaluate the predictive capability of&#xD;
      Pancreatic Quantitative Sensory Testing (P-QST) - a novel assessment of neurosensory&#xD;
      phenotyping- for improvement in pain in patients with CP who are undergoing&#xD;
      medically-indicated invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      P-QST has been shown to be able to phenotype patients with CP into nociceptive patterns&#xD;
      according to degree of central sensitization. As a tool to identify baseline nociceptive&#xD;
      pattern in patients with painful CP, P-QST will be performed at baseline prior to planned&#xD;
      invasive treatment with endoscopic therapy or decompressive surgery. We will evaluate the&#xD;
      ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive treatment for painful CP, and to develop a&#xD;
      predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo pre-procedure P-QST testing before undergoing scheduled invasive&#xD;
      treatment as directed by their treating gastroenterologist. The date of first endoscopic&#xD;
      therapy or surgery will be used to calculate follow-up timepoints, which will be scheduled at&#xD;
      3, 6, and 12 months after the first endotherapy session or surgery. At each follow-up time&#xD;
      point, patients will answer questions about their pain. In addition, patients will complete&#xD;
      patient reported outcome tools (HADS, PCS instruments) and the Patient Global Impression of&#xD;
      Change. Serum and urine samples will be obtained at baseline and at 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      timepoints.&#xD;
