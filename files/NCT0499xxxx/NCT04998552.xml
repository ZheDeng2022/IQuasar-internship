  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesize that SBRT will limit or reverse tumor growth and thereby convert the&#xD;
      borderline resectable disease or locally advanced disease in to a resectable tumor.&#xD;
      Furthermore, we want to assess whether SBRT leads to an improved quality of life compared to&#xD;
      IMRT.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, longitudinal, prospective randomized, superiority clinical trial.&#xD;
      The protocol applies to patients with confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
      pancreatic protocol CT scan showing borderline resectable disease or locally advanced disease&#xD;
      as per the NCCN guidelines (See addendum, NCCN Guidelines 2021, PANC-3 and PANC-4). All cases&#xD;
      will be discussed at the multidisciplinary GI cancer conference (tumor board). Cases will&#xD;
      continue to be reviewed at different milestones of their treatment as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with borderline resectable or locally advanced pancreatic cancer will&#xD;
      receive standard of care and neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to NCCN guidelines and&#xD;
      protocols followed by radiation therapy. The radiation therapy will start 4 weeks after&#xD;
      ending the chemotherapy, thereby creating a wash-out period. At the start of the radiation&#xD;
      therapy subjects will be consented and randomized into either receiving the IMRT protocol or&#xD;
      the SBRT protocol. Baseline measurements will be collected at the start of the radiation&#xD;
      treatment. At the completion of the radiation therapy the subject's progress and condition&#xD;
      will be evaluated by the tumor board and a multidisciplinary consensus agreement will be&#xD;
      reached to decide the course of further treatment, which could be chemotherapy (if deemed&#xD;
      unresectable) or proceed with surgery (if deemed resectable). Irrespective the decision,&#xD;
      patients will be asked to return for follow up every 3 months to obtain CT scans, assess&#xD;
      quality of life and provide a biological sample (blood) for up to 12 months after the&#xD;
      initiation of the radiation therapy.&#xD;
