  <brief_title>Comparing Hypo-fractionated Intensity- Modulated Radiation Therapy to Standard- Fractionated IMRT Along With Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized Phase II Trial of Hypo-fractionated Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) Utilizing 2.5 Gy/Fraction Versus (VS) Standard-Fractionated IMRT, Concurrent With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel and Followed by Consolidation Durvalumab, for Subjects With Stage 2A/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this study is that hypofractionated IMRT to 62.5 Gy in 25 fractions (2.5&#xD;
      Gy/fraction) with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by maintenance durvalumab&#xD;
      will improve locoregional control at 18 months by 10% compared to standard-fractionated&#xD;
      chemo-IMRT/durvalumab. A modest improvement in locoregional control (LRC) was selected as a&#xD;
      target which could merit further study of this hypofractionated IMRT regimen in a Phase III&#xD;
      trial&#xD;
