  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection. Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with septic shock and&#xD;
      acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains high&#xD;
      and approximates 50-60%. Sepsis is the leading etiology for AKI and CRRT requirement in ICU&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In septic shock, the dysregulated host response to infectious pathogens leads to a cytokine&#xD;
      storm with uncontrolled production and release of humoral pro-inflammatory mediators. These&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines exert cellular toxicity and promote the development&#xD;
      of organ dysfunction and increased mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treating AKI, CRRT techniques can be employed for adsorption of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators extracorporally using specially developed adsorption membranes, hemoperfusion&#xD;
      sorbent cartridges or columns. Several methods and devices, such as Oxiris®-AN69 membrane,&#xD;
      CytoSorb® cytokine hemoadsorption and polymyxin B (Toraymyxin) endotoxin adsorption and&#xD;
      plasmapheresis have been evaluated in small study series but to date the data on outcome&#xD;
      benefits remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA380 (Jafron Biomedical Co , Ltd, Zhuhai, China) is a CE-labeled hemoadsorption cartridge&#xD;
      developed to treat patients with septic shock. It contains hemo-compatible, porous polymeric&#xD;
      beads that adsorp cytokines and mid-molecular weight toxins on their surface. The cytokines&#xD;
      absorved using this cartridge are IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 in addition to TNF-α8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to examine the potential effects of cytokine adsorption using&#xD;
      HA380 in addition to hemodiafiltration with the Oxiris®-AN69 membrane on ICU- and 90-day&#xD;
      mortality in patients with septic shock and AKI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host&#xD;
      response to infection and carries a risk for lethality, considerably exceeding that of a mere&#xD;
      infection. Intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with septic shock and acute kidney&#xD;
      injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains high and&#xD;
      approximates 50-60% despite recent technical advancements in patient care. Sepsis is the&#xD;
      leading etiology for AKI and CRRT requirement in ICU patients and almost half of the&#xD;
      critically ill patients with sepsis develop AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In septic shock, the dysregulated host response to infectious pathogens leads to a cytokine&#xD;
      storm with uncontrolled production and release of humoral pro-inflammatory mediators. These&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines exert cellular toxicity and promote the development&#xD;
      of organ dysfunction and increased mortality. Septic shock is defined according to the&#xD;
      Sepsis-3 consensus criteria as sepsis with a vasopressor requirement to maintain a mean blood&#xD;
      pressure (MAP) ≥65 mm Hg, despite adequate fluid resuscitation, and a serum lactate level &gt;2&#xD;
      mmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treating AKI, CRRT techniques can be employed for adsorption of inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators extracorporally using specially developed adsorption membranes, hemoperfusion&#xD;
      sorbent cartridges or columns. The aim of these techniques is to decrease the early&#xD;
      deleterious effects of the cytokine storm and high endotoxin levels during the first hours&#xD;
      and days of treatment of septic shock to benefit the patient. Several methods and devices,&#xD;
      such as Oxiris®-AN69 membrane, CytoSorb® cytokine hemoadsorption and polymyxin B (Toraymyxin)&#xD;
      endotoxin adsorption and plasmapheresis have been evaluated in small study series or are&#xD;
      under evaluation for improving patient outcomes in septic shock. However, to date the data on&#xD;
      outcome benefits remains controversial. Previous study series have shown a decrease in&#xD;
      cytokine levels, improved hemodynamics and diminished need for vasopressor in patients&#xD;
      treated using these methods. However, mortality benefit remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HA380 (Jafron Biomedical Co , Ltd, Zhuhai, China) is a CE-labeled hemoadsorption cartridge&#xD;
      developed to treat patients with septic shock. It contains hemo-compatible, porous polymeric&#xD;
      beads that adsorp cytokines and mid-molecular weight toxins on their surface. The cytokines&#xD;
      absorved using this cartridge are IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 in addition to TNF-α8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to examine the potential effects of cytokine adsorption using&#xD;
      HA380 in addition to hemodiafiltration with the Oxiris®-AN69 membrane on ICU- and 90-day&#xD;
      mortality in patients with septic shock. To study patients with the highest degree of&#xD;
      morbidity the study will recruit only septic shock patients with a high vasopressor&#xD;
      requirement before CRRT initiation.&#xD;
