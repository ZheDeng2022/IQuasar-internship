  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a brief,&#xD;
      10-session Behavioral Activation intervention delivered via teletherapy to increase physical&#xD;
      activity and treat depressive symptoms.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-site, two-phase study that will use an initial group of individuals between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 64 who have moderate to severe depressive symptoms and exercise less than 90&#xD;
      minutes a week. In both phases, participants will complete a total of 8 behavioral activation&#xD;
      teletherapy sessions used to increase physical activity, followed by two biweekly booster&#xD;
      sessions, for a total of 10 sessions. Participants will also complete weekly assessments&#xD;
      remotely for both phases of the study. The screening visit and final intervention session&#xD;
      will be in-person, and all other visits will be via telehealth. Participants will have the&#xD;
      option to come to the clinic if they prefer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the initial phase (n = 15), participants who completed the intervention will have the&#xD;
      option to participate in a focus group, and participants who partially completed the&#xD;
      intervention will have the option to participate in a semi-structured interview. The total&#xD;
      duration of phase one is 14 weeks. This initial phase will allow the researchers to refine&#xD;
      and optimize the intervention to be delivered in the second phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second/pilot phase (n = 50), participants will complete a one-month and a two-month&#xD;
      follow-up after the 10 intervention sessions. The total duration for phase two is 22 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants for both phases of the study will wear a Fitbit during the duration of their&#xD;
      study participation, in order to record step count.&#xD;

    <description>Testing whether the physical activity to depression reduction pathway is mediated by changes in (a) positive and negative affect; (b) anhedonia, (c), fatigue, (d) self-esteem, (e) overall depressive symptoms and (f) emotion regulation. For each potential mediator, both a direct and indirect pathway will be tested. First, the mediational model should meet the goodness of fit criteria (e.g., a non-significant X2, fit indices greater than .90 and significant path coefficients) and second, when a direct effect path is added to the model this path is either non-significant or adds little improvement in the overall predictive value of the model (i.e., increase in R2).</description>
