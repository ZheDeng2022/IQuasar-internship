  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of integrated&#xD;
      ambulatory supportive care visits with standard nephrology outpatient visits for six months&#xD;
      in patients with advanced CKD. The study team hypothesizes that patients in the integrated&#xD;
      care arm will trend towards improved symptom burden, improved quality of life scores and more&#xD;
      engagement in advance care planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives: To test the impact of integrated ambulatory supportive care in nephrology&#xD;
      care on symptom burden. Secondary: To test the impact of integrated ambulatory supportive&#xD;
      care on quality of life and engagement in advance care planning and to demonstrate study&#xD;
      feasibility.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Integrated Palliative Outcome Score-Renal (IPOS-Renal) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The scoring will include 11 questions on the degree of impact kidney-specific symptoms have had on patients over the past week, plus additional items on concerns beyond symptoms, such as information needs, practical issues, and family anxiety. This includes one question that has 15 sub-questions asking about specific physical symptoms. All scores are on a scale of 0-90, with lower scores representing less problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The KDQOL is a 36-item quality of life survey that includes five domains: Physical Component Summary (PCS), a Mental Component Summary (MCS), Burden of Kidney Disease Score, Symptoms and Problems of Kidney Disease Score, and Effect of Kidney Disease Score. All scores are on a scale of 0-100, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement in Advance Care Planning</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Advance care planning will be measured by total number of advance care planning conversations held + number of documents such as surrogate decision makers, health care proxies, or treatment limiting directives.</description>
