  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a modality that is increasingly utilized to&#xD;
      treat various haematological disorders with a varying degree of success. From 2006 to 2019&#xD;
      use of HSCT worldwide has increased from 50,417 to an estimated 1.5 million. Disease relapse,&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infections are the leading causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with HSCT. Pulmonary complications, in particular, are common in&#xD;
      patients with HSCT, and the diagnostic approach and management of these complications remain&#xD;
      a challenge. FOB is one of the standard and least invasive diagnostic modality for these&#xD;
      patients. However, the diagnostic yield and change in clinical decision making in those&#xD;
      studies have been variable. Furthermore, all these studies were retrospective, with one&#xD;
      exception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a prospective observational study to understand the rate of change&#xD;
      in clinical decision making following Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB). The investigators also&#xD;
      looked at the yield of FOB and characteristics associated with a positive diagnostic yield.&#xD;

      Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is a modality that is increasingly utilized to&#xD;
      treat various hematological disorders with a varying degree of success. From 2006 to 2019 use&#xD;
      of HSCT worldwide has increased from 50,417 to an estimated 1.5 million. Disease relapse,&#xD;
      graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infections are the leading causes of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in patients with HSCT. Pulmonary complications, in particular, are common in&#xD;
      patients with HSCT, and the diagnostic approach and management of these complications remain&#xD;
      a challenge. Reasons for this possibly include a broad spectrum of etiologies, subtle and&#xD;
      insidious clinical manifestations, non-specific radiological features, and limited&#xD;
      biomarkers. On the other hand, surgical procedures to obtain lung biopsy, which is the&#xD;
      ultimate diagnostic tool, are often contraindicated or present high risks to the patients. In&#xD;
      this context, less invasive testing such as fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) deserves further&#xD;
      consideration. Previous studies showed that the yield of FOB, a low-risk procedure, may&#xD;
      provide helpful information in the post HSCT patient with pulmonary infiltrates. However, the&#xD;
      diagnostic yield and change in clinical decision making in those studies have been variable.&#xD;
      Furthermore, all these studies were retrospective, with one exception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stem cell transplant activity in Saudi Arabia has increased exponentially in recent&#xD;
      times, with more than 6000 stem cell transplants performed by 2016. Furthermore, the patient&#xD;
      population is different regarding specific genetic and immunologic characteristics,&#xD;
      underlying disorders and prevalent opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, this study was&#xD;
      designed to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic value of FOB in those patients presenting&#xD;
      with pulmonary infiltrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a prospective observational study of all patients who had HSCT and pulmonary&#xD;
      infiltrates that required bronchoscopy. Data for demographics, clinical presentation, CT scan&#xD;
      characteristics, FOB dates and details, microbiology, virology, cytology, histology, change&#xD;
      in clinical decision making before and after FOB and 6 months outcome following bronchoscopy&#xD;
      were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rate of change in clinical decision making following FOB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical characteristics associated with a positive yield in FOB CT scan characteristics&#xD;
      associated with a positive yield in FOB Six month outcome of patients following FOB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for continuous variables were reported as mean Â± standard deviation,&#xD;
      and categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. The median and&#xD;
      interquartile range (IQR) was used where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables were compared by independent Student's t-test/ANOVA or non-parametric&#xD;
      (Mann Whitney U/Kruskal Wallis) test as appropriate, while categorical variables were&#xD;
      compared by Chi-square test. Fisher's exact probability test was applied when examining&#xD;
      variables of low incidence. Logistic regression was used to test the association between&#xD;
      dependent and independent variables. The level of significance was set at a p-value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
