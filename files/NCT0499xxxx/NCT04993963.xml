  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the impact of prehabilitation on quality of recovery in heart valve surgery. To&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of Mild to moderate valvular diseases with Newyork Heart Association&#xD;
      (NYHA) grade I and II . Previous studies were designed to target on Coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      graft surgery (CABGs) patients no specifically heart valve surgery patients was studied so&#xD;
      this study cover this aspect as well so from the outcomes of this study we will determine the&#xD;
      prehabilitation effects on valvular surgery patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A review stated that &quot; the concept of prehabilitation has entered the forefront which&#xD;
      encompasses multidisciplinary interventions to improve health and lessen the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the previous study held in pre-operative assessment clinic between March 2016 and August&#xD;
      2016, evaluated that PREHAB programme for frail patients undergoing CABG or Valve surgery may&#xD;
      be able to improve functional ability and reduce hospital length of stay for those patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      previous other studies, parental study which is PREQUEL study recruitment started in July&#xD;
      2018 expect patient recruitment and 3 months of follow-up will be completed in June 2022 then&#xD;
      their analysis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve functional and enhance the resources and postoperative recovery, prehabilitation&#xD;
      plays a very cardial role. In some studies, it has been noticed that preoperative improvement&#xD;
      in physical fitness, improve functional capacity all this is the part of the model for&#xD;
      improving post-surgery recovery, this could play a vital role.&#xD;

    <description>15-item Quality of Recovery (QoR-15) is one of the standardized outcomes for assessing patient comfort after surgery. The QoR-15 score includes the items measuring pain, physical comfort, physical independence, psychological support, and emotional state. The QoR-15 score runs from 0 to 150. Higher scores indicate better Quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Frailty Score</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 weeks, 1 month after CABG</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is a valid and clinically important construct that is recognizable by physicians. Clinical judgments about frailty can yield useful predictive information. Initial Clinical Frailty Scale assessment had access to diagnoses and assessments related to these variables and other measures of comorbidity, function, and associated features that inform clinical judgments about the severity of frailty. It was modified to a 9-point scale to include very severely frail and terminally ill. It evaluates specific domains, including comorbidity, function, and cognition, to generate a frailty score ranging from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill).</description>
