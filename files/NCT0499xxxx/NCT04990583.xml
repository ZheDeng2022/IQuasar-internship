    <textblock>
      If taken every day, PrEP is an effective method for preventing HIV. However, many prescribed&#xD;
      PrEP in the U.S. do not take it every day, as prescribed. The goal of this study is to&#xD;
      develop and test an intervention, facilitated by a mobile app, meant to improve adherence to&#xD;
      PrEP. To that end, 60 individuals prescribed PrEP who do not take their PrEP every day as&#xD;
      prescribed will be recruited. Participants will complete an initial research interview,&#xD;
      receive a one-on-one PrEP adherence session with an adherence coach, and complete follow-up&#xD;
      interviews at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. In addition, some participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive access to a mobile app and adherence coaching via the app for 12-months. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is self-reported adherence to PrEP. This study will examine whether this intervention&#xD;
      is effective at improving adherence to PrEP, is feasible to use, and found acceptable by&#xD;
      those who use it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), involves the use of antiretroviral (ART) medications&#xD;
      (Truvada or Descovy) by persons uninfected with HIV to prevent HIV acquisition. The efficacy&#xD;
      of PrEP for preventing HIV acquisition is highly impacted by one's medication adherence.&#xD;
      Within the U.S., adherence to PrEP is suboptimal. Commonly cited barriers to PrEP adherence&#xD;
      include forgetfulness, low HIV risk perception, stigma, and cost. There is a need for&#xD;
      interventions that improve adherence to PrEP, are readily disseminable, and that make&#xD;
      efficient use of resources. To that end the current project will examine the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an intervention tailored for PrEP adherence,&#xD;
      facilitated by mHealth. Individuals prescribed PrEP (n = 60) who report taking, on average,&#xD;
      fewer than 6 doses per week in the past month will be recruited. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention (Carium) or control condition. Data collection will&#xD;
      consist of a baseline interview and follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is PrEP adherence. PrEP adherence will be measured via self-report, pill counts, and use of a&#xD;
      urine test developed by UrSure. The urine test is for research use only and will only be used&#xD;
      to detect the presence of PrEP in urine if participants self-report taking PrEP in the last&#xD;
      48 hours. It is expected that participants in the Carium condition, relative to control, will&#xD;
      report better adherence to PrEP.&#xD;
