      Multi-center, open-label, Phase I/II dose escalation and expansion trial of TTI-621 in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable or metastatic high-grade leiomyosarcoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted in 2 phases: Phase I (Dose Escalation of TTI-621 in combination&#xD;
      with doxorubicin) and Phase II (Dose Expansion of TTI-621 in combination with doxorubicin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (Dose Escalation of TTI-621 in combination with doxorubicin) will enroll patients&#xD;
      with soft-tissue sarcomas including leiomyosarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma,&#xD;
      myxofibrosarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, angiosarcoma or epithelioid sarcoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II (Dose Expansion of TTI-621 in combination with doxorubicin) will include 2 cohorts:&#xD;
      Cohort A and Cohort B. The lower selected dose of TTI-621 will be studied in Cohort A while&#xD;
      the higher dose of TTI-621 will be studied in Cohort B. Patients with leiomyosarcoma will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
