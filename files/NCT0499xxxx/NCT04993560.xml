  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is potentially a deadly disease caused by severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that targets the lung mainly, resulting in&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections in humans. It has developed into a pandemic with serious global&#xD;
      public health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research has shown that the new SARS-CoV-2 variants reduces the efficacy of the&#xD;
      vaccinations and are predominantly more transmissible or infective. A few countries namely&#xD;
      Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Turkey have recently started introducing a booster dose&#xD;
      following primary two doses of the COVID-19 immunization series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to identify which booster dose is more effective; taking a booster dose from&#xD;
      the same vaccine initially taken or a booster dose from a different vaccine than initially&#xD;
      taken.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization COVID-19 Dashboard, the coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      pandemic, has caused over 181 million infections and more than 3 million deaths worldwide as&#xD;
      of July 1, 2021. COVID-19 is potentially a deadly disease caused by severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that targets the lung mainly resulting in respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections in humans. This has become a serious concern for public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines in the Kingdom of Bahrain, BBIBP-CorV&#xD;
      (inactivated virus) vaccine and BNT162b2 (mRNA vaccine) is being administered to the&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inactivated vaccines have been extensively studied. In a phase 1/2 trial, the BBIBP-CorV&#xD;
      vaccine has shown to be generally safe against COVID-19 and induce antibody responses.&#xD;
      However, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) experts have summarized information&#xD;
      from clinical trials in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, and China indicating&#xD;
      that individuals with comorbidities and older adults (≥60 years) who received 2 doses of&#xD;
      BBIBP-CorV have low confidence in the efficacy of preventing COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical trials have played a key role in the approval of different COVID vaccines&#xD;
      based on their efficacy data, however, there is still uncertainty regarding the duration of&#xD;
      protection from these vaccines towards the COVID -19 virus. Recent evidence has shown that&#xD;
      the new SARS-CoV-2 variants reduces the efficacy of the vaccinations and are predominantly&#xD;
      more transmissible or infective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few countries namely Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and Turkey have recently started&#xD;
      introducing a booster dose following primary two doses of the COVID-19 immunization series.&#xD;
      The enhanced humoral response has been seen in homologous vaccination. Heterologous&#xD;
      vaccination has shown to significantly induce more immunogenicity than homologous vector&#xD;
      boost, and higher or comparable to the homologous mRNA regimens. Strong humoral and immune&#xD;
      response has also been induced by heterologous vector-mRNA boosting with an acceptable&#xD;
      reactogenicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there has been no research conducted to date on the reactogenic and&#xD;
      immunogenetic response of a COVID-19 booster dose after completing the primary two doses of&#xD;
      the COVID-19 immunization series. This study will compare the reactogenic and immunogenetic&#xD;
      response of heterologous BNT162b2 booster dose after completing two doses of BBIBP-CorV&#xD;
      vaccination versus homologous BBIBP-CorV booster after completing two doses of BBIBP-CorV&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
