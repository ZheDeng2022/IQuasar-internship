  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy of Study AG348-C-008, an observational, longitudinal, multicenter, global&#xD;
      registry that aims to better understand the longitudinal clinical implications of pyruvate&#xD;
      kinase deficiency (PK deficiency). The primary purpose of this study is to describe the&#xD;
      cognition of participants with PK deficiency, as objectively measured by the Cogstate Brief&#xD;
      Battery (CBB).&#xD;

    <measure>Change Over Time in Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>CBB is a series of brief computerized assessments used to evaluate 4 major cognitive domains: psychomotor speed, attention/vigilance, visual learning, and working memory. If the CBB score falls between -10 to +10, it is considered normal. In Cogstate scoring 0 could be considered as performing in the average range, a negative score means below-average performance, and a positive score means above-average performance. A positive change in scores indicates slightly better performance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CBB Scores of Participants as Compared to the Scores of Age-Matched Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>CBB is a series of brief computerized assessments used to evaluate 4 major cognitive domains: psychomotor speed, attention/vigilance, visual learning, and working memory. An age-standardized score of ≤-1 on a test will be defined as abnormal. Cognitive impairment on the day of testing will be defined as ≥2 tests with abnormal performance.</description>

        Participants with PK deficiency will be enrolled in at least 3 sites also participating in&#xD;
        Study AG348-C-008. If any participants are unable to complete the Day 0 CBB assessments,&#xD;
        additional participants may be enrolled.&#xD;
