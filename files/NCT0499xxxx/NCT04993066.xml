    <textblock>
      Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the GentleMax Pro Plus™ laser system for its intended&#xD;
      uses: hair removal including pseudofolliculitis barbae (PFB), clearance of pigmented and/or&#xD;
      vascular lesions, temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis and&#xD;
