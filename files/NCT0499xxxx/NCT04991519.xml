  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strokes often cause a loss of communication ability, referred to as aphasia, as well as&#xD;
      cognitive difficulties. Each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses&#xD;
      in communication and cognition, and a unique course of recovery. The BUILD study aims to&#xD;
      understand the brain basis of these individual differences in stroke outcome. Participants&#xD;
      with stroke as well as controls matched in age, educational background, race, and sex are&#xD;
      examined using a combination of standardized and in-house tests of language and cognition to&#xD;
      provide a detailed profile of strengths and weaknesses. Each participant will have between&#xD;
      three and six sessions, including an MRI to measure details of the structure, function, and&#xD;
      connections in the brain. The data are analyzed to test how patterns in the stroke lesion&#xD;
      explain the patterns of communication and cognitive difficulties, and how patterns in the&#xD;
      uninjured parts of the brain explain resilience and recovery from the stroke. Ultimately, we&#xD;
      hope that BUILD will guide us toward new targets for brain stimulation treatments or other&#xD;
      biologically based treatments that improve language and cognitive abilities after stroke.&#xD;

        Participants are survivors of left hemisphere stroke with or without aphasia, or people&#xD;
        with aphasia due to strokes in other parts of the brain. We recruit participants primarily&#xD;
        from the Washington, DC region, but some participants may travel from farther away to&#xD;
        participate in the study. We aim for our participants to be fully representative of the&#xD;
        diversity of individuals with stroke in the general population. Control participants are&#xD;
        matched to stroke survivors on age, gender, race, educational background, and stroke risk&#xD;
        factors.&#xD;
