  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension became the leading risk factor of death globally as well as in Bangladesh.&#xD;
      Uncontrolled hypertension is the key challenge for the success of a hypertension control&#xD;
      programs. According to the last national STEPS Survey in Bangladesh, hypertension control&#xD;
      rate is only 11%. World Health Organization promoted the HEARTS technical package for the&#xD;
      hypertension control programs to improve the control scenario. National Heart Foundation of&#xD;
      Bangladesh is implementing a hypertension control program in selected Upazilas&#xD;
      (sub-districts) of Bangladesh in collaboration with Non-Communicable Disease Control (NCDC)&#xD;
      Program of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Resolve to Save Lives, USA.&#xD;
      Proposed quasi experimental study will be conducted in collaboration with NCDC of DGHS,&#xD;
      Resolve to Save Lives, USA and Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore with an objective of to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of HEARTS package on the rate of hypertension control in primary health&#xD;
      care centers in Bangladesh. In this study equal number of hypertensive adult patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in Upazila Health Complexes of control and intervention groups with a hypothesis&#xD;
      of, implementation of HEARTS technical package in primary health care centers can reduce the&#xD;
      blood pressure significantly. After obtaining informed written consent, respondents' basic&#xD;
      demographic information, history of antihypertensive medication intake and related&#xD;
      comorbidities will be taken. Blood pressure measurements data will be recorded also. All of&#xD;
      these data will be collected via a secured mobile application, Simple App. Collected data&#xD;
      will be preserved in a secured cloud based database. After six months of enrolment, and&#xD;
      end-line data will be collected at the community setup, preferably at the home of&#xD;
      respondents, following standard techniques of BP measurement by experienced Field Research&#xD;
      Assistants. During whole of the study procedure, every ethical right of the participants will&#xD;
      be preserved with an utmost priority. De-identified data will be shared with the partner&#xD;
      organizations for further scientific analysis. This study will generate robust evidence for&#xD;
      use of HEARTS technical packages in low-and middle-income countries, like Bangladesh,&#xD;
      especially at low-level health facilities and provide guidance for designing and&#xD;
      implementation of other hypertension control programs.&#xD;
