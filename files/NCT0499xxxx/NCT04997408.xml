  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains one of the leading causes of acute mortality and chronic disability worldwide.&#xD;
      The annual incidence of stroke is 795,000 in the United States and the absolute numbers of&#xD;
      people suffering from stroke and the global burden of stroke are increasing. Stroke survivors&#xD;
      experienced a variety of neurological symptoms and recovery can be slow and incomplete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only 25% of stroke patients return to the functional status of everyday participation. Early&#xD;
      and continuous rehabilitation facilitates the functional recovery and prognosis of stroke&#xD;
      patients. Performance of the appropriate rehabilitation program is now one of the important&#xD;
      accreditation criteria for stroke centers. Adherence to post-acute stroke rehabilitation&#xD;
      guideline is associated with improved outcome. Early intervention and continuous practice of&#xD;
      rehabilitation training, including functional tasks, is reported to be positively correlated&#xD;
      with prolonged recovery of functional improvement after stroke. However, underutilization of&#xD;
      rehabilitation after stroke has been reported, because of work overload of therapists and&#xD;
      maldistributed centers and therapist workforce, transportation to the overcrowded&#xD;
      rehabilitation units in the hospitals or clinics, insufficient funding of community-based&#xD;
      programs and time limitation of caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several innovative interventions have been introduced beside the conventional rehabilitation&#xD;
      because of increasing awareness of the brain's regenerative potential and advances of&#xD;
      technology by utilizing visual feedback, transcranial magnetic stimulation and robotics. An&#xD;
      alternative way of delivering post-stroke rehabilitation, telerehabilitation, has been&#xD;
      proposed by information and communication technologies. The devices could detect, store and&#xD;
      upload their physical activity recorded in the sensor-embedded mobile devices of smart&#xD;
      watches and smartphones, with connection to the internet and get real-time feedback by the&#xD;
      computation. The market penetration of smart mobile devices is rapidly rising in every&#xD;
      industrial sector and professional field. The smartphone software applications (apps) are&#xD;
      becoming increasingly popular for both health care consumers and providers. The investigators&#xD;
      designed a customizable, sensor-driven, internet-based rehabilitation system consisting of a&#xD;
      sensing watch, smartphone, a web server and database and users' interface for medical staff.&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to determine if the poststroke rehabilitation motion could be&#xD;
      performed and recorded precisely with the smartphones or watches-based system. The&#xD;
      investigators successfully implement the system developed in the project into three&#xD;
      hospitals. Researchers recruited totally 100 subjects with acute stroke until 13, Oct, 2017&#xD;
      including 50 in the study and 50 in the control group. There were 60 male (60%) and 40&#xD;
      females (40%) with mean age 57.9Â±8.7 years. Researchers used the questionnaire of Unified&#xD;
      Theory of Acceptance &amp; Use of Technology, UTAUT) to 8 determine the acceptance of the system&#xD;
      by the users. There was no difference between the study and control groups. In the 3-month&#xD;
      implementation period, the scores of each sections of UTAUT increased significantly in the&#xD;
      study group. The effects of the system were determined by five scales of rehabilitation:&#xD;
      modified Rankin scale (MRS), Barthel index (BI), Stream Wolf Motor Function Test (SWMFT),&#xD;
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Berg Balance. In all scales, both study and control&#xD;
      groups got significant improvement in the 3-month study period. The significantly improvement&#xD;
      of function was also revealed in the subgroup analysis in the study group, including 23&#xD;
      subjects with smartphones and 16 with smart watches. There was no difference between two&#xD;
      subgroups. No significant difference was shown in the comparison of the scores of five&#xD;
      rehabilitation scales of 30 days and 90 days in the study and control groups. The&#xD;
      investigators had focus groups interviews by inviting the stakeholders of the proposed&#xD;
      systems and learned from the common and different viewpoints. And investigators proposed&#xD;
      business models &quot;hospital-to-patients&quot; for implementation of the mobile device-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation outside hospitals. The costs and effectiveness were compared to the&#xD;
      traditional in-person rehabilitation in the hospitals and institutes.&#xD;
