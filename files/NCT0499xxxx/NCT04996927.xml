  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a diagnostic study. Subjects were enrolled from clinical stage IIIB or IV NSCLC&#xD;
      patients who received standard first-line chemotherapy combined with PD-1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      immunotherapy and received 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging before treatment, after 2 courses of&#xD;
      treatment, and at the time of disease progression.At the same time, the blood routine, liver&#xD;
      and kidney function, inflammatory indexes and other laboratory data of the subjects&#xD;
      participating in the study were collected. Based on 18F-FDG PET Ipercist standard and&#xD;
      comprehensive laboratory indicators, the subjects were evaluated for tumor biological&#xD;
      characteristics prediction and clinical staging, PD-1 immune efficacy monitoring and&#xD;
      evaluation, tumor recurrence monitoring and re-staging. At the same time, the systemic immune&#xD;
      response and immune-related adverse events during the treatment process were evaluated in&#xD;
      order to establish a better evaluation standard and system for the comprehensive evaluation&#xD;
      of PD-1 immunotherapy.This study plans to set the sample size as 50 cases.&#xD;

        Staging Manual, Edition 7. IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology. The patient's tumor&#xD;
        must lack an EGFR-sensitive mutation (i.e. exon 19 deletion, or exon 21 L858R, exon 21&#xD;
        L861Q, exon 18 G719X, or exon 20 S7681 mutation) and ALK rearrangement.Patients must&#xD;
        provide a biopsy for PD-L1 testing. The World Health Organization (WHO)/ Eastern&#xD;
        Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) physical status score was 0 or 1 at the time of&#xD;
        enrollment. At least 1 lesion (no previous radiotherapy) whose longest diameter â‰¥10mm was&#xD;
        accurately measured by CT or MRI at baseline. Must have a life expectancy of at least 12&#xD;
