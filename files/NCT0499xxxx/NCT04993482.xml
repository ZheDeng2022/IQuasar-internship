  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A healthy lifestyle has proved beneficial health effects in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (T2DM). Important lifestyle behaviors, i.e. sleep, sedentary time (SB), and physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) subdivided into light physical activity (LPA) and moderate to vigorous physical activity&#xD;
      (MVPA), have shown an impact on T2DM disease-specific characteristics (e.g. glycemic&#xD;
      control). However, these behaviors have often been investigated separately. Therefore, a&#xD;
      recent shift in research emphasizes the importance of considering these behaviors as part of&#xD;
      a 24-hour day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since T2DM patients can benefit from an optimal 24-hour composition as part of a healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle, it may be interesting to investigate the 24-hour movement composition among these&#xD;
      T2DM patients over time. Moreover, exploring associations with different personal&#xD;
      determinants, environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers will provide meaningful&#xD;
      insights in developing recommendations and creating an intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims (1) to conduct a longitudinal observational study over two years to&#xD;
      explore 24-hour movement behavior composition patterns among T2DM patients in comparison with&#xD;
      a healthy control group and (2) to examine associations between these movement behaviors and&#xD;
      personal and environmental determinants, and cardiometabolic markers. This study's primary&#xD;
      endpoint is to develop insights into the 24-hour movement composition combined with T2DM&#xD;
      patients' characteristics, determinants, and health profile to set the groundwork with the&#xD;
      aim to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention in a future randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial&#xD;

    <description>During their visit to Ghent University hospital, participants will receive a wGT3X-BT ActiGraph accelerometer that will objectively measure their 24-hour movement behaviors (PA, SB, and sleep). The participants will wear the accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Additionally, this accelerometer data will be supplemented with a diary to validate sleep time and (non)wear time. Furthermore, the individuals will subjectively report on their PA, SB, and sleep (duration and quality) through an online questionnaire based on international standardized PA (IPAQ), SB (SIT-Q-7d), and sleep questionnaires (Munich Chronotype questionnaire, Pittsburg sleep quality index, and Sleep Hygiene Index) (IPAQ, Sit-7Q, Munich Chronotype questionnaire, and Pittsburg sleep quality index, Sleep Hygiene Index). By collecting the same variable on three timepoints, it is possible to determine if this outcome will change or remain stable over time.</description>

    <description>A new questionnaire has been developed and is currently at the final stage of testing the test-retest reliability. Physical environmental factors include questions regarding walkability, neighborhood, work environment, sleep environment, and electronic devices at home. A higher score means a physical environmental factors that positively relates to the health behavior. Furthermore, the cut-off point for the physical environmental factors will be determined by the cumulative percentage. In addition, by collecting the same variable on three timepoints, it is possible to determine if this outcome will change or remain stable over time.</description>

    <description>This project contains a longitudinal observational study design. The investigator will collect data out of a group with type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and out of group with control adults on three time points (baseline, follow-up after one year, and follow-up after two years). Therefore, the investigator will only collect observational data and the participants will not be exposed to a certain intervention.</description>

        The main focus of this project is to explore 24-hour movement behavior among type 2&#xD;
        diabetes mellitus patients. However, the control group will be included because of lacking&#xD;
        evidence on the 24-hour movement pattern in the general Belgian population.&#xD;
