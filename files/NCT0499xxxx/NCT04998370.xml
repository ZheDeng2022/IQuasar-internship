      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the association between hemoglobin levels&#xD;
      in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-Hb) and the occurrence of secondary brain injury in patients&#xD;
      after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH-SBI) during the first 14 days after bleeding.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an international multicentre observational study to validate cerebrospinal fluid&#xD;
      hemoglobin (CSF-Hb) as a monitoring biomarker for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage related&#xD;
      secondary brain injury (SAH-SBI). It is hypothesized that there is an association between the&#xD;
      concentration of CSF-Hb and the occurrence of SAH-SBI during the first 14 days after the&#xD;
      bleeding (post-SAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the association between ventricular CSF-Hb&#xD;
      and SAH-SBI during the first 14 days post-SAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between ventricular CSF-Hb and angiographic vasospasms (aVSP), delayed&#xD;
           cerebral ischemia (DCI) and delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND) during the&#xD;
           first 14 days post-SAH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the accuracy of ventricular CSF-Hb to monitor for aVSP, DCI and DIND during the first 14&#xD;
           days post-SAH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between lumbar CSF-Hb and SAH-SBI, aVSP, DCI and DIND during the first&#xD;
           14 days post-SAH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the accuracy of lumbar CSF-Hb to monitor for aVSP, DCI and DIND during the first 14 days&#xD;
           post-SAH,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between baseline measures and CSF-Hb (ventricular and lumbar during the&#xD;
           first 14 days post-SAH),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between CSF-Hb (ventricular and lumbar during the first 14 days&#xD;
           post-SAH) and co-interventions/complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between CSF-Hb (ventricular and lumbar during the first 14 days&#xD;
           post-SAH) and chronic hydrocephalus at 12 weeks follow-up,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the association between CSF-Hb (ventricular and lumbar during the first 14 days&#xD;
           post-SAH) and functional outcome at 12 weeks follow-up,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exploratory CSF proteome/metabolome analyses to assess Hb toxicity, inflammation,&#xD;
           neuronal, or vascular damage.&#xD;

    <measure>Cerebrospinal fluid hemoglobin</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to day 14 after the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage</time_frame>
    <description>CSF sampling: CSF sampling will be performed via EVD or LD, depending on the patient's access to the CSF space. The decision regarding the insertion of an EVD or LD is made independently of this study and according to the clinical standard of care. 2ml of CSF will be sampled on a daily basis at approximately the same time in the morning.&#xD;
CSF centrifugation and storage: Immediately after sample collection, the CSF will be centrifuged at 1500 G for 15 minutes. The cell-free CSF supernatant will be stored at -80°C until analysis.&#xD;
Spectrophotometric cerebrospinal fluid hemoglobin (CSF-Hb) measurements: Absorption spectra in the visual range between 350 and 650 nm of all CSF samples will be measured. Quantification of oxyhemoglobin in CSF (CSF-Hb) will be performed using spectral deconvolution.</description>
