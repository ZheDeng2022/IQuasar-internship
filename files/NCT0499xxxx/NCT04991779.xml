      A diagnostic accuracy study on Artificial intelligence assisted continue EEG diagnostic tool&#xD;
      is to carried out comparing with manually EEG interpretation as the golden standard for&#xD;
      neonatal seizure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of neonatal seizures may be the first, and perhaps the only, clinical sign of&#xD;
      a central nervous system disorder in the newborn infant. The incidence of neonatal seizures&#xD;
      is variable based on gestational age. The etiology of seizures may indicate the presence of a&#xD;
      potentially treatable etiology and should prompt an immediate evaluation to determine the&#xD;
      cause and to initiate etiology-specific therapy. Importantly, the earlier treatment of&#xD;
      seizures positively affects the infant's long-term neurological development. However, even&#xD;
      when continue electroencephalogram (cEEG) monitoring is available, the availability of&#xD;
      on-site expertise to interpret cEEG signals is limited and in practice, the diagnosis is&#xD;
      still based only on clinical signs. The previous study indicated that the reliable seizure&#xD;
      detection was as little as 10% of seizure events. Therefore, an early automated seizure&#xD;
      detection tool has been developed based on machine learning. The lack of an automated seizure&#xD;
      detection tool has been validated in the external neonatal seizures cohort. The evidence on&#xD;
      the utility of the automated seizure detection tool remains uncertain. This is a prospective,&#xD;
      continuous double-blind designed diagnostic accuracy study. The study aims to validate the&#xD;
      accuracy of the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool comparing the&#xD;
      manually cEEG interpretation as the golden standard of neonatal seizure in neonatal intensive&#xD;
      care units. Analysis of sensitivity and specificity is to evaluate the accuracy of&#xD;
      AI-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool.&#xD;

Sensitivity is defined as: The proportion of neonates with seizures is successfully screened out by AI-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool.&#xD;
Specificity is defined as: The proportion of neonates without seizures who are not recognized as seizures by AI-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool.</description>

    <description>The neonates with suspected seizures or high risk of seizures are monitored by continuous electroencephalogram (cEEG) at least 12 hours since admission. The cEEG will be interpreted by AI-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool at the end of cEEG monitoring. At the same time, the same cEEG will be manually reported according the reference standard.</description>

    <description>This study is an observational study to evaluate the accuracy of AI-assisted cEEG diagnostic tool with routine care. All patients from the cohort accept cEEG monitoring and AI-assisted cEEG detection tool.&#xD;
The tool included a quantitive EEG neural signal processing pipeline to extract features from the original signal datasets, machine learning models based on gradient boosted model for prediction.&#xD;
The reference standard is the electrographic seizures interpreted by 3 clinicians who had attended the uniformly training program and were certified by the Chinese Anti-Epilepsy Association.</description>
