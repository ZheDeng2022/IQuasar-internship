    <description>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a combined clinical/functionality and secondary safety endpoint, reflects the degree of disability or dependence in activities of daily living among treated patients. Though listed and classified separately, in multiple publications, as a functionality or clinical endpoint and because of its prominent and unique value in stroke trials, mRS should be considered first among key safety parameters in subjects who complete the 90-day evaluation.&#xD;
A successful endpoint will be defined as follows: &quot;at 90± 14 days' post-treatment, the frequency of mRS scores ≤2 or a post-treatment decrease in mRS score of ≥2, relative to the baseline determination&quot;. Patients who die, between thrombectomy initiation and 90-Days, will be given an mRS value of 6 in this analysis.</description>
