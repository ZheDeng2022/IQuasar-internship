  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients initiating Liraglutide for weight management, the objective is to compare the&#xD;
      effect of Med diet, high protein/low carbohydrate (HP/LC) diet and low fat (LF) control diet&#xD;
      on CV parameters, namely arterial stiffness, measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity&#xD;
      (cfPWV), and visceral adipose tissue, in addition to other metabolic indicators.&#xD;

      This is a 6-month open label pilot RCT that will be conducted on Lebanese participants with&#xD;
      obesity, upon the initiation of Liraglutide for medical weight management, as recommended by&#xD;
      their physician. Patients will be randomized to 3 treatment arms: Mediterranean (Med) diet,&#xD;
      high protein/ low carbohydrate (HP/LC) diet, and control low fat (LF) diet. While both Med&#xD;
      diet and LF diet will be both hypocaloric, allowing the same energy restriction, of 500&#xD;
      Kcal/d, the HP/LC diet will be ad libitum. Participants will be recruited from the Endocrine&#xD;
      clinics at AUB-MC (in Building 23 and at the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Unit), and from&#xD;
      satellite clinics next to AUB- MC. Brochures and posters of the trial will be available in&#xD;
      the clinic waiting areas. Patients of both participating and non-participating physicians&#xD;
      will be recruited in the study.&#xD;

    <allocation>Randomized</allocation>
    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>A computer-generated allocation sequence will be used, with a permuted block randomization (1:1:1). The biostatistician (MB) will generate the randomization sequence and will share it with a trial coordinator (MR) who is independent of the study team. Upon the recruitment of every participant, the study RA will contact the independent trial coordinator to receive the randomization code, in an opaque and sealed envelope.&#xD;
Randomization will take place at 1-30 days after starting Liraglutide. Treatment allocation will be in batches at the end of each month, and therefore allows for group sessions.</intervention_model_description>
