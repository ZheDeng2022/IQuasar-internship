      Subjects can be classified into two groups, Group 1 include non-cirrhotic patients, Group 2&#xD;
      include cirrhotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients will be received prophylactically TAF for 4 weeks before using SOF/VEL once&#xD;
      daily for 12 weeks. In total, Group 1 patients will be discontinued TAF once daily therapy at&#xD;
      the end of week 28 if no HBV reactivation occurs during treatment , Group 2 patients will be&#xD;
      received TAF once daily for 64 weeks. In this study, after week 64, Group 2 patients will&#xD;
      continue NUC treatment but pay by themselves. For those who is GT3 cirrhosis patients, RBV&#xD;
      added simultaneously with SOF/VEL for 12 weeks. For patients weighing &lt; 75 kg, the dose is&#xD;
      500 mg twice; for patients weighing ≥ 75 kg, the dose is 600 mg twice.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To evaluate efficacy and safety of SOF/VEL in HBsAg-positive patients with HCV (GT1-6)&#xD;
      co-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of subjects with HBV reactivation during the treatment and&#xD;
           after cessation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the proportion of subjects with virologic failure (virological breakthrough/&#xD;
