      This is a retrospective, observational (non-interventional), single-arm, single-centre,&#xD;
      post-market clinical investigation designed to verify clinical performance and safety of&#xD;
      Mepilex Border Post-Op when used according to clinical practice for post-operative wounds in&#xD;
      a large and broad population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will consist of a retrospective medical record review, which will&#xD;
      be completed with data from up to 450 female and male adult subjects who were treated with&#xD;
      Mepilex Border Post-Op following elective hip or knee replacement at one clinic in Belgium&#xD;
      between January 2016 and February 2021.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mepilex Border Post-Op is a CE-marked class IIa medical device developed, manufactured and&#xD;
      marketed by MÃ¶lnlycke Health Care AB. This is a retrospective, observational&#xD;
      (non-interventional), single-arm, single-centre, post-market clinical investigation designed&#xD;
      to verify clinical performance and safety of Mepilex Border Post-Op when used according to&#xD;
      clinical practice for post-operative wounds in a large and broad population. The overall&#xD;
      objective of this investigation is to confirm the clinical performance of Mepilex Border&#xD;
      Post-Op for post-operative wounds when used according to clinical practice, by assessing&#xD;
      dressing wear time from day of surgery to end of dressing use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation will consist of a retrospective medical record review, which will&#xD;
      be completed with data from up to 450 female and male adult subjects who were treated with&#xD;
      Mepilex Border Post-Op following elective hip or knee replacement at one clinic in Belgium&#xD;
      between January 2016 and February 2021. The data collected for each subject will include&#xD;
      those generated in relation to the surgery itself as well as the pre- and post-surgery&#xD;
      phases. There is no available data for subjects treated with an alternative to Mepilex Border&#xD;
      Post-Op to use as a control group, however, the pre-surgery data will serve as control for&#xD;
      some endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment the subjects received at the clinic included pre-surgery visits, the surgery&#xD;
      itself, a short in-patient stay following surgery, and post-surgery follow-up visits at&#xD;
      approximately 14 days, 1.5 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. In addition, the subjects&#xD;
      used the commercially available mobile health application moveUP Therapy to support their&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The subjects' rehabilitation was tracked and aided with moveUP Therapy as it&#xD;
      allows (1) subjects to answer a number of questionnaires; (2) subjects to communicate with&#xD;
      their surgeon and physical therapist via a chat function in the app; and (3) subject-specific&#xD;
      log entries by the surgeon and physical therapist. The data to be used in this retrospective&#xD;
      investigation will be extracted exclusively from moveUP Therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects/medical records will be identified by site personnel through screening&#xD;
      moveUP Therapy. Only data from subjects who have consented to the use of their data related&#xD;
      to the surgery in an anonymous way for medical research and scientific publications will be&#xD;
      extracted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigational device, Mepilex Border Post-Op, was applied as part of the surgery. In&#xD;
      the rare event that a dressing change would be required, the subjects were provided with&#xD;
      spare dressings and instructions for how to do the change by the treating surgeon or clinic&#xD;
      nurse. These instructions included only changing the dressing once at least three corners of&#xD;
      the dressing were stained with blood, and to consult the treating surgeon or clinic nurse by&#xD;
      sending a moveUP Therapy chat message with a picture of the dressing requesting advice on&#xD;
      whether to change or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dressing wear time will be derived from up to three sources:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. how frequently the subjects have answered the question &quot;Is the dressing dry?&quot; with &quot;Yes,&#xD;
           it was changed today&quot;;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. review of potential Health Care Professional log entries for evidence of dressing&#xD;
           change(s); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. review of potential moveUP Therapy chat messages, including photographs, for evidence of&#xD;
           dressing change(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total number of dressings per subject will be derived from the same information as dressing&#xD;
      wear time.&#xD;
