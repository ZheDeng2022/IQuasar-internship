  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aging of the French population is a major public health issue. Frailty is a reversible&#xD;
      clinical state between optimal healthy aging and pathological aging. Early detection of&#xD;
      frailty makes it possible to identify people aged 65 or over who are at risk of developing or&#xD;
      worsen dependency and to offer them appropriate medical and/or social care adapted to their&#xD;
      needs. The multidimensional screening program known as &quot;ICOPE&quot; (for &quot;Integrated Care of Older&#xD;
      People&quot;) promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) aims to prevent functional decline&#xD;
      worldwide and improve the well-being of older people. To support healthy aging, 6 intrinsic&#xD;
      abilities are to be screened according to ICOPE: visual impairment, hearing impairment,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, locomotor abilities, cognitive decline and vitality. This program is&#xD;
      intended to be developed in each country and adapted to the territories of action. The&#xD;
      Mauriac and Vichy community health basins have a proportion of elderly people (≥60 years old)&#xD;
      that is much higher than regional and national data, justifying the regional and national&#xD;
      data, justifying the chosen action territories. The epidemiological characteristics of the&#xD;
      French population and of the action territory made it possible to add to the following themes&#xD;
      to the ICOPE recommendations: socio-economic situation, assistance to caregivers,&#xD;
      vaccinations, drug iatrogeny, alcohol consumption, cardiovascular risk and cancer screening.&#xD;
      The ICOPE process is organized in 5 steps: a community screening and a relay to the general&#xD;
      practitioner to ensure a follow-up, an primary care in case of abnormality, evaluated at 3&#xD;
      months and then 6 months, establishment of a plan of care if necessary, possible referral to&#xD;
      a specialist and mobilization of community resources mobilization of community resources and&#xD;
      support for caregivers if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that conducting a fragility screening in a rural area (Mauriac health&#xD;
      (Mauriac health basin) and a semi-urban area (Vichy health basin) would allow an effective&#xD;
      would allow an effective allocation of expenses. In more detail, the costs are direct&#xD;
      medical, direct non-medical, indirect and intangible costs, and efficiency is measured by&#xD;
      measured by the quality of life score (LEIPAD). The hypothesis is that the early detection of&#xD;
      people's frailties and their management improves their quality of life&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the frailty screening days, information letter will be sent to the people living in&#xD;
      the territories of action in order to present them the project. The evaluation of the level&#xD;
      of frailty will be done in 3 steps: an inclusion visit with one of the co-investigating&#xD;
      physicians or one of the scientific collaborators. The investigating physician will verify&#xD;
      the eligibility criteria (inclusion and non-inclusion criteria), and will propose to the&#xD;
      person to participate in the protocol (consent). Individuals will also have the option to&#xD;
      participate in the screening day but refuse to sign the sheet attesting to their consent, in&#xD;
      which case none of the data concerning them will be kept and analyzed. After consent has been&#xD;
      obtained, individuals will be instructed to participate in the questionnaire (M0), the&#xD;
      frailty screening visit (M0), to the analysis of medical prescriptions (M0), to a debriefing&#xD;
      visit (M0), and a follow-up telephone visit for people detected as frail (M3, M6). For 10&#xD;
      volunteers per screening day, a visit to present the accelerometers will also be added (M0),&#xD;
      as well as an assessment of physical activity assessment (+7 days).&#xD;
