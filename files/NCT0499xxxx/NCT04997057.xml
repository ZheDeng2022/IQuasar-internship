  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics efficacy is mainly assessed by subjective endpoints such as the FDA responder rate&#xD;
      or global relief, which partly explain contradictory results obtained in clinical trials with&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria. Objective biomarkers of IBS will allow to measure the efficacy of&#xD;
      probiotics. In the case of IBS-C, serum resolvin-D1 appears to be an interesting candidate&#xD;
      due to its non-invasive and discriminating character compared to a healthy population. It is,&#xD;
      inversely correlated with the severity of symptoms. Resolvin-D1 modulates the duration and&#xD;
      intensity of inflammation by regulating the transcription of cytokines, chemokines and their&#xD;
      receptors as well as other proteins involved in inflammation. Resolvin D1 could serve as a&#xD;
      predictor of probiotic response based on its baseline value.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resolvin D1 levels will be measured in patients with IBS-C as defined by the Rome IV criteria&#xD;
      before 6 and 12 weeks after supplementation with a mixture of probiotics. The progression of&#xD;
      IBS-C symptoms will also be assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation with resolvin D1 levels and the severity of IBS symptoms will be&#xD;
      investigated. The efficacy of the probiotic mixture in relieving the symptoms of IBS-C will&#xD;
      be measured and compared based on the levels of resolvin D1.&#xD;
