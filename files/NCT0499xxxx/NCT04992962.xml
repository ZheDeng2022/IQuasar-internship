    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of PG-OA-10CN and PG-OA-5TH tablets as a&#xD;
      better pain reliever in patients with moderate to severe chronic pain due to osteoarthritis&#xD;
      of the knee than a placebo.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in the study for a maximum of 36 days, including a 7-day screening&#xD;
      period, 28 days of active product administration, and followed by a post-treatment follow-up&#xD;
      within 1 day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of PG-OA-10CN and PG-OA-5TH for the treatment of pain&#xD;
           associated with osteoarthritis of the knee, compared to a placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences of efficacy between PG-OA-10CN and PG-OA-5TH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of PG-OA-10CN and PG-OA-5TH for stiffness, function in daily&#xD;
           living, function in sport and recreation, and knee related quality of life as assessed&#xD;
           by the KOOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety of PG-OA-10CN and PG-OA-5TH for the treatment of pain associated&#xD;
           with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;
