  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lesions of the lichen planus type within the oral mucosa are now considered a potentially&#xD;
      cancerous condition. One of the minimally invasive methods of treating these lesions is&#xD;
      photodynamic therapy, and the gold standard in therapy is topical steroid administration&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lichen planus shows an irregular shape, which is quite difficult to measure objectively,&#xD;
      which is important in assessing the effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated in protocol split mouth with the treatment of lesions on one cheek&#xD;
      with a steroid (on an adhesive plaster) and on the other - photodynamic therapy with a foot&#xD;
      sensitizer in the form of a methylene blue also on an adhesive plaster The treatment&#xD;
      evaluation procedure will consist of taking a series of intraoral photographs. These photos&#xD;
      will be taken at each visit. This procedure will involve taking pictures traditionally in&#xD;
      &quot;white&quot; light and in the spectrum of 405 nm, 460 nm and 405 + 460 nm (using the unique&#xD;
      feature of the prototype laser - emission of two wavelengths simultaneously) in order to&#xD;
      induce autofluorescence of the mucosa and treated lesions to better visualize them&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, single-blind 12-week clinical trial of full contralateral&#xD;
      split-mouth in patients with bilateral erythematous or erosive lichen planus in the mouth.On&#xD;
      one side, the OLP lesion eligible for treatment was subjected to photodynamic therapy using&#xD;
      methylene blue in four sessions every 2 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      olp on the other side was treated with the administration of the steroid triamcinolone for 8&#xD;
      days&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evaluation of the evolution of OLP eruptions was performed within 12 weeks of&#xD;
      qualifying for treatment: at baseline, at the end of both treatments (day 8) and after the&#xD;
      next 11 weeks&#xD;

In this study, we used two wavelengths: 405, 450 and 405+450 nm together for the autofluorescence of lesions&#xD;
All fractal analysis was performed in ImageJ version 1.53e (Image Processing and Analysis in Java)&#xD;
Applied the intensity difference fractal dimension counting method.&#xD;
We measured the size of oral lichen planus on photos taken with different light wave using computer program as mentioned above</description>
