  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adolescents have escalated. Adolescent-onset is associated&#xD;
      with greater health comorbidities and shorter life expectancy than adult-onset T2D. T2D is&#xD;
      preventable by decreasing insulin resistance, a physiological precursor to T2D. T2D&#xD;
      prevention standard-of-care is lifestyle intervention to decrease insulin resistance through&#xD;
      weight loss; yet, this approach is insufficiently effective in adolescents. Adolescents at&#xD;
      risk for T2D frequently experience depression, which predicts worsening insulin resistance&#xD;
      and T2D onset, even after accounting for obesity. Mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) may&#xD;
      offer a targeted, integrative health approach to decrease depression, and thereby, ameliorate&#xD;
      insulin resistance in adolescents at risk for T2D. In a single-site, pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT), we established initial feasibility/acceptability of a 6-week group&#xD;
      MBI program, Learning to BREATHE, in adolescents at risk for T2D. We demonstrated feasible&#xD;
      single-site recruitment, randomization, retention, protocol adherence, and MBI&#xD;
      acceptability/credibility in the target population. Our preliminary data also suggest MBI may&#xD;
      lead to greater reductions in stress-related behavior, vs. CBT and a didactic/health&#xD;
      education (HealthEd) control group. The current study is multisite, pilot RCT to test&#xD;
      multisite fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability in preparation for a future multisite&#xD;
      efficacy trial that will have strong external validity, timely recruitment, and long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. Adolescents (N=120) at risk for T2D will be randomized to MBI vs. CBT vs. HealthEd&#xD;
      and followed for 1-year. Specific aims are to: (1) test multisite fidelity of training and&#xD;
      implementation of 6-week group MBI, CBT, and HealthEd, to teens at risk for T2D; (2) evaluate&#xD;
      multisite feasibility/acceptability of recruitment, retention, and adherence for an RCT of&#xD;
      6-week group MBI, CBT, HealthEd with 6-week and 1-year follow-up; and (3) modify intervention&#xD;
      training/implementation and protocol procedures in preparation for a future, fully-powered&#xD;
      multisite efficacy RCT.&#xD;
