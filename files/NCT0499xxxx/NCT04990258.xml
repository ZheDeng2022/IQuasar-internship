      Descriptive: A 24-month multicentre, observational, prospective cohort study. Population: IBD&#xD;
      Patients under stable clinical and biological remission Study treatments: Patients who will&#xD;
      be proposed to switch, or who have just switched, from the intravenous originator Remicade®&#xD;
      or one of its biosimilars to the subcutaneous infliximab Remsima®SC as part of routine care.&#xD;
      All consecutive patients in IBD centers participating in the study will be proposed to&#xD;
      participate in the study during their regular outpatients' visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:The primary objective of PEREM study is to determine the rate of persistence of&#xD;
      subcutaneous infliximab at 48 weeks after switching from IV infliximab to subcutaneous&#xD;
      infliximab Remsima®SC.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Number of patients: 400 patients in approximatively 40 sites in France Recrutment period: The&#xD;
      trial duration for each patient will be 2 years Main Endpoint:The primary endpoint is to&#xD;
      assess the rate of persistence of subcutaneous infliximab at month 12 after switching from IV&#xD;
      infliximab to SC infliximab Remsima®SC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients on steroid free clinical remission at week 96 after switch.&#xD;
           Steroid-free Clinical Remission (CR) is defined as a Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score≤4&#xD;
           CD patients and a Partial Mayo Score (PMS) ≤2 with each sub-score of 1 or less for UC.&#xD;
           When HBI scoring will be infeasible (stoma, pouch), evaluation of clinical remission&#xD;
           will be estimated by stoma emptying count and/or by the physician global assessment&#xD;
           (Sturm 2019) Patients having discontinued subcutaneous infliximab Remsima®SC therapy&#xD;
           whatever the reason during the 24 months of follow-up as well as patients referred to&#xD;
           disease-related surgery and patients lost to follow-up before month 24 will be&#xD;
           considered as failure to subcutaneous infliximab Remsima®SC therapy (intention to treat&#xD;
           analysis) and will be classified in the group of patients having failed to maintain&#xD;
           steroid free clinical remission under infliximab Remsima®SC during the whole study&#xD;
           period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patient Reported Outcomes PRO2 rates at inclusion, months 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of biological remission rates (FC &lt;250 μg/g, CRP &lt;5 mg/L) at inclusion, month&#xD;
           3, 6, 12 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of clinical relapse free rates at inclusion, month 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of loss of response rates at inclusion, month 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of clinical response and remission at inclusion, month 3, 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean change from baseline in HBI or PMS, and mean change from baseline in CRP and fecal&#xD;
           calprotectin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients with positive antibodies (IFX, ANA) comparing therapy with&#xD;
           intravenous or one of its biosimilars original and subcutaneous infliximab Remsima®SC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure adherence to subcutaneous infliximab Remsima® switch based on pharmacy data&#xD;
           during the follow-up with Medication Possession Ratio (MPR ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve-month cumulative surgery rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization rate at month 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative infection rate at month 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cumulative SC reactions at month 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discontinuation of subcutaneous infliximab therapy cumulative rates at month 24&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of specific anti-drug antibodies detected during the study&#xD;
