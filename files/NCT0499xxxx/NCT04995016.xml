    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the initial efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab combined with axitinib as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced&#xD;
      non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;

      This study is design to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      combined with axitinib in downsizing tumors in patients with nonmetastatic biopsy-proven&#xD;
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma. This is a single-institution, single-arm phase 2 clinical&#xD;
      trial. Patients will receive axitinib 5 mg bid on days 1-21 combined with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatments repeat every 21 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Patients then will&#xD;
      receive partial or radical nephrectomy after neoadjuvant therapy.&#xD;
