      BACKGROUND Dissection and removal of Lymph nodes in the Axilla (ALND) remains a method used&#xD;
      in breast cancer management across the world. Post- surgical scar tissue that forms in this&#xD;
      dissection is therefore beyond the linear scar, is characterized by less elasticity than&#xD;
      healthy tissue and can over time, because of the anatomical location, cause significant&#xD;
      limitations of the Active Range of Motion (AROM) of the scapulohumeral joint. After this&#xD;
      procedure it's possible that Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) occurs. This study discusses the&#xD;
      physiotherapy management of patients with AWS. The primary objective of the study was to&#xD;
      verify direct and indirect changes to AWS cords with two treatment methods at a single breast&#xD;
      cancer rehabilitation setting: Physiotherapist 's work Vs. Self-treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women. Axillary surgical procedures&#xD;
      have reported, with post-operative morbidity of bleeding, lymphedema and shoulder pain, also&#xD;
      the rather underestimated Axillary Web Syndrome. The study shows that the reduction of the&#xD;
      problems linked to the Syndrome such as pain in shoulder Abduction and Flexion and inability&#xD;
      in everyday life is possible with an early and competent treatment. Two different approaches&#xD;
      to the Syndrome were investigated. The patients were divided in two groups. Good results were&#xD;
      obtained within 5 weeks since the appearance of AWS with both of them but if the&#xD;
      Physiotherapist is able to teach the convenient exercises, the selftreatment seemed to have&#xD;
      the best outcome. This fact can change the awareness that an early approach is necessary&#xD;
      inside the path to recovery. In the last years the Axillary Web Syndrome was the topic of&#xD;
      many studies: the etiology, its clinical diagnosis, the relation with lymphedema…But the&#xD;
      treatment was often reported like a combination of different techniques without indications&#xD;
      about kinds, times. Instead the investigators examined a detailed procedure, the same in both&#xD;
      groups. The work was different only as regards the cords treatment. This fact shows the value&#xD;
      of a comprehensive treatment for neck, shoulder, breast and two different but specific works&#xD;
      on the Axillary Web Syndrome. For these reasons its publishing could be important for all the&#xD;
      professionals working with women after Surgery for breast cancer and metastatic lymphnodes.&#xD;

    <description>The Physiotherapist worked on adhered breast scars, stiffness in neck and arm movements. During each session the patient was also assessed and trained in self-treatment exercises assigned to treat their cords. Subjects were trained to perform self-treatment extension exercises with four exercises selected by the Physiotherapist</description>

    <description>During each session (45 minutes)the patient was assessed and trained in self-treatment exercises assigned to treat their cords. This later method was chosen to ensure regular participation in their exercises and early correction of any inaccuracies in the implementation of the exercises regarding AWS treatment . Or the Physiotherapist worked actively on cords with soft or vigorous stretching.</description>
