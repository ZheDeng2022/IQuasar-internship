      This is an interventional, open label, single arm extension study to assess the long-term&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the Epitomee Capsule in subjects who completed a 24-week treatment&#xD;
      period with the Epitomee-Capsule and experienced at least 3% weight loss during that period.&#xD;
      All participating subjects will receive the Epitomee capsule arm in combination with&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
