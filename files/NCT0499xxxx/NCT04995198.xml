  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PROMISE aims to create a comprehensive nationwide registry of prostate cancer patients with&#xD;
      germline pathogenic variants by prospectively screening approximately 5,000 subjects with a&#xD;
      confirmed prostate cancer diagnosis, either through tissue biopsy, PSA greater than 100 ng/dL&#xD;
      and/or radiographic evidence of disease and receiving systemic therapy for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      Patients at all stages of disease will be welcome to participate in the PROMISE Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited &amp; screened over a five-year period. Study participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide a saliva sample to be tested for germline cancer risk variants through Color&#xD;
      Health. If the results identify a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant, an appointment&#xD;
      with a genetic counselor from Color Health will be scheduled to discuss the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a baseline demographic survey that includes self-reported health&#xD;
      history, family history of cancer and standardized patient reported outcome (PRO) measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROMISE Registry staff will request medical records from the participant's cancer care&#xD;
      provider(s) for the purpose of obtaining clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive bi-annual newsletters offering information on new developments in&#xD;
      treatment and research opportunities, including clinical trials, associated with genetic&#xD;
      variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants (those with target germline mutations) will be followed every 6 months&#xD;
      to obtain updated health records data and patient-reported outcomes data. Participants will&#xD;
      be followed for a minimum of 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PROMISE registry will help identify prostate cancer patients with pathogenic variants to&#xD;
      learn more about how these variants affect patient outcomes. Ultimately, we hope to help&#xD;
      patients learn more about their disease and the treatments that they may derive the most&#xD;
      benefit from, including the germline genetic biomarker-based clinical trials they may be&#xD;
      eligible for.&#xD;
