  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being done to better understand how daily treatment with&#xD;
      Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Cannabidiol (CBD), or the combination of CBD plus THC affects&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis pain and other related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participants will have a screening period and visit (up to 30 days to treatment&#xD;
      start). If participants pass the screening phase, they will be randomly assigned to take one&#xD;
      of the investigational study drugs. For this study, participants will not know when or if&#xD;
      they are taking CBD, THC, THC plus CBD, and when or if taking placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical pain will be assessed at multiple times throughout the study, and eligibility will&#xD;
      be re-assessed at two weeks into the treatment period. It is possible that subjects will not&#xD;
      be able to participate in the study after 14 days of of treatment. The treatment period will&#xD;
      take approximately 16 weeks and then a follow-up period for approximately 2 weeks. In&#xD;
      addition to treatment, participants will have clinical assessments, blood draws,&#xD;
      questionnaires, daily pain diaries, sensory testing, as well as have functional connectivity&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study hypothesizes that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBD alone will exert a peripheral anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing levels of&#xD;
           Interleukin (IL)-6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  THC alone will modify central nervous system (CNS) pain via decreasing insula to Default&#xD;
           Mode Network (DMN) connectivity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBD plus THC will do both.&#xD;
