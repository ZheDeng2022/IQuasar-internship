  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators aimed to better understand the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in&#xD;
      non-critically ill hospitalized patients secondarily presenting with clinical deterioration&#xD;
      and increase in oxygen requirement&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to consecutively enrol 25 patients without clinical or biological evidence&#xD;
      for superinfection, without left ventricular dysfunction and for whom a pulmonary embolism&#xD;
      was discarded by computed tomography pulmonary angiography. Investigators will investigate&#xD;
      lung ventilation and perfusion (LVP) by LVP scintigraphy, and, 24 hours later, left and right&#xD;
      ventricular function by 99mTc-labelled albumin gated-blood-pool scintigraphy with late (60&#xD;
      mn) tomographic albumin images on the lungs to evaluate lung albumin retention that could&#xD;
      indicate microvascular injuries with secondary edema&#xD;

    <description>Chest CT-scan will be performed with blocked inspiration.&#xD;
Lung ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy imaging will be performed within 24hrs after CT pulmonary angiography, 410MBq of Technegas will be inhaled by patients and ventilation tomography performed thereafter. Then, 185MBq 99mTc-macroaggegates will be injected intravenously followed by the perfusion tomography.&#xD;
A combined CT acquisition will be performed.&#xD;
The day following lung ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy, 740MBq of Tc99m labeled albumin will be intravenously administered.&#xD;
Cardiac gated-blood-pool scintigraphy will be then performed in best septal left anterior oblique and left profile according to specific parameters.&#xD;
45-60 min after injection, a non-gated tomographic acquisition over the lungs will be done, with the same parameters than for PS SPECT, resulting in a late albumin acquisition.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia according to the WHO guidance by a positive result of&#xD;
