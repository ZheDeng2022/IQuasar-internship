    <textblock>
      Plyometrics is a kind of exercise training that focuses on increasing muscular power by&#xD;
      varying the pace and force of various motions. Plyometrics training can help you enhance your&#xD;
      physical performance and ability to do a variety of tasks. Pushups, throwing, sprinting,&#xD;
      leaping, and kicking are just a few examples of plyometric activities. Plyometrics are&#xD;
      commonly used by athletes, although these routines may be done by anybody. Plyometrics are&#xD;
      used by people in physical therapy after an accident or injury to get back into form and&#xD;
      physical function. Speed, explosive power, coordination, and particular sports skills may all&#xD;
      be improved with agility training. Agility training routines can benefit players of all&#xD;
      levels, from high school to professional sports teams. Include these drills in your training&#xD;
      regimen a few times a week to improve your foot speed and sports technique.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ability of the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems to generate force at a specific&#xD;
      velocity, in a particular direction, appears to be critical for many sports that involve&#xD;
      sprinting, jumping and throwing. In light of the above, plyometric training can be used to&#xD;
      enhance the ability of skeletal muscle to exert maximal force in as short a time as possible.&#xD;
      Plyometric training typically includes various unilateral and bilateral jumps, hops and&#xD;
      bounds with coaches often prescribing these in a multidirectional fashion to reflect the&#xD;
      unpredictable nature of field and court sports. The rationale of this approach is founded on&#xD;
      the well-accepted principle that adaptations to vertically (VPT) and horizontally orientated&#xD;
      PT will transfer better to athletic tasks that are carried out in the same direction as they&#xD;
      are performed. Plyometric consists of a rapid stretching of a muscle (eccentric action)&#xD;
      immediately followed by a concentric or shortening action of the same muscle and connective&#xD;
      tissue, the stored elastic energy within the muscle is used to produce more force than can be&#xD;
      provided by a concentric action alone. Though aerobic capacity is important during a soccer&#xD;
      game high-intensity single-bout efforts also play an important role for physical performance.&#xD;
      in this sense, aside from endurance activity, female soccer players must also perform&#xD;
      numerous explosive action including jumping, kicking, accelerating, decelerating and changing&#xD;
      of direction, with most of these preceding goal opportunities in competitive leagues.&#xD;
      specifically, the straight sprint (45%) followed by vertical jumps (16%) have shown to be the&#xD;
      two most frequent actions in goal situations during professional soccer matches. Studies also&#xD;
      suggest that changes in motor performance skills resulting from the performance of combined&#xD;
      resistance training and plyometric training are greater than with either type of training&#xD;
      alone. Six weeks of combined resistance training and plyometric training would lead to&#xD;
      greater improvements in fitness performance in healthy boys than resistance training and&#xD;
      static stretching. Plyometric training has been proposed for the development of explosive&#xD;
      power performance and specifically for the improvement of vertical jump ability. he main&#xD;
      finding of this study was the improvement of either vertical- and horizontal jump performance&#xD;
      in basketball players as a consequence of a multipurpose plyometric training intervention.&#xD;
