  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common, debilitating problem for persons with Spinal cord injuries (SCI).&#xD;
      Shoulder pain affects approximately 40-50% of the total population of persons with paraplegia&#xD;
      (those with SCI with full use of their upper extremities and no or limited use of their lower&#xD;
      extremities). Among the etiologies of shoulder pain in persons with paraplegia, overuse&#xD;
      syndrome is the most common. Shoulder overuse syndrome in a person with paraplegia is the&#xD;
      result of high activity demands and high mechanical load on the upper extremity during&#xD;
      activities such as wheelchair propulsion, transferring with the arms, and performing&#xD;
      activities of daily living from a wheelchair height, resulting in increased overhead&#xD;
      activity. The pain as a result of overuse syndrome can limit the patient's participation in&#xD;
      occupational and physical therapy as well as limit performance of activities of daily living&#xD;
      and participation in usual life activities. An alternative treatment for shoulder pain with&#xD;
      evidence to support efficacy in the able bodied population is Manual Therapy (MT).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, there have been no prior research studies published examining the therapeutic&#xD;
      efficacy of MT for overuse injuries of the shoulder in patients with paraplegia. This study&#xD;
      will determine if MT, is efficacious to reduce pain in this population. A total of 20&#xD;
      patients with paraplegia identified in the outpatient clinic at Craig Hospital with overuse&#xD;
      syndrome of the shoulder will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;

      Shoulder pain is a common, debilitating problem for persons with Spinal cord injuries (SCI).&#xD;
      Shoulder pain affects approximately 40-50% of the total population of persons with paraplegia&#xD;
      (those with SCI with full use of their upper extremities and no or limited use of their lower&#xD;
      extremities). Among the etiologies of shoulder pain in persons with paraplegia, overuse&#xD;
      syndrome is the most common. Shoulder overuse syndrome in a person with paraplegia is the&#xD;
      result of high activity demands and high mechanical load on the upper extremity during&#xD;
      activities such as wheelchair propulsion, transferring with the arms, and performing&#xD;
      activities of daily living from a wheelchair height, resulting in increased overhead&#xD;
      activity. The pain as a result of overuse syndrome can limit the patient's participation in&#xD;
      occupational and physical therapy as well as limit performance of activities of daily living&#xD;
      and participation in usual life activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the able bodied population, the most common recommendation for overuse syndrome is resting&#xD;
      the affected joint. In persons with paraplegia and wheelchair dependence, this recommendation&#xD;
      is unrealistic and would lead to non-use of the person's primary means of mobility (the&#xD;
      wheelchair). Often, patients require pharmacologic intervention to help alleviate the pain in&#xD;
      order to participate in therapy sessions and activities of daily living. Current treatment&#xD;
      options for overuse syndrome include oral medication including narcotic pain medication and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medication, modalities, injections, and surgery. Despite these treatment&#xD;
      options, pain from overuse syndrome remains a prevalent problem with no treatment option&#xD;
      proven superior and no gold standard of treatment identified. An alternative treatment for&#xD;
      shoulder pain with evidence to support efficacy in the able bodied population is Manual&#xD;
      Therapy (MT). Unfortunately, there have been no prior research studies published examining&#xD;
      the therapeutic efficacy of MT for overuse injuries of the shoulder in patients with&#xD;
      paraplegia. This study will determine if MT, is efficacious to reduce pain in this&#xD;
      population. A total of 20 patients with paraplegia identified in the outpatient clinic at&#xD;
      Craig Hospital with overuse syndrome of the shoulder will be enrolled in the study. Ten of&#xD;
      the participants will be randomized to the control group and receive no MT and ten&#xD;
      participants will be randomized to the treatment group and receive MT for three days per week&#xD;
      x 2weeks. The treatment will be provided by a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.),&#xD;
      physical, or occupational therapists trained to perform MT. During this study, the subject's&#xD;
      pain and function will be measured by a 10 point questionnaire, the Numeric Pain Rating Scale&#xD;
      (NPRS) and the Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI). The NPRS and WUSPI are included&#xD;
      in Appendix 1 and 2. The NPRS has been validated as a ratio scale for pain. The WUSPI has&#xD;
      been validated as a scale for assessment of baseline shoulder dysfunction and for periodic&#xD;
      measurement in longitudinal studies of musculoskeletal complications in wheelchair users.&#xD;
      Data gathered from these outcome measures will be accumulated and statistically analyzed to&#xD;
      examine the potential benefit of MT in the target population. This investigation will be one&#xD;
      of the first to examine the relationship between MT and reduction in shoulder pain for&#xD;
      treatment of overuse syndrome in persons with paraplegia. It will also examine if decreased&#xD;
      pain secondary to MT will result in a decrease in pain during functional activity in these&#xD;
      individuals. The results of this pilot study may result in publication in peer reviewed&#xD;
      journals, presentations at national symposiums and application for funding for Complementary&#xD;
      Medicine grant by the National Institute of Health or other available grant for larger study.&#xD;
