  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of adolescent vaccines are well known for preventing meningococcal infection and&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (HPV)-related pre-cancerous lesions. Yet, many adolescents in the United&#xD;
      States (US) remain under-vaccinated, with vaccination rates among rural adolescents&#xD;
      significantly lower than among their urban peers. In addition, there are urban-rural&#xD;
      disparities in the coverage of HPV vaccine, particularly in Southern states like North and&#xD;
      South Carolina, which currently fall below the Healthy People 2020 goal of â‰¥80% coverage. The&#xD;
      goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a&#xD;
      school-based intervention for increasing vaccine uptake among adolescents in rural North and&#xD;
      South Carolina.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will consist of 3 primary components: 1) school nurse training and technical support for promoting adolescent vaccination (Tdap, MenACWY, HPV) and strengthening existing school nursing vaccination programming, 2) caregiver-targeted educational materials that are disseminated via school nurses, and 3) tools and resources to facilitate linkage to vaccination providers in the local community. Existing materials will be used in the intervention such as resources available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Middle School Health Starts Here tool kit from the National Association of School Nurses and the National HPV Roundtable. Technical support includes the study team working with local school nurses to identify educational materials available from national and statewide sources.</description>
