  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (SZC) with enhanced nutritional advice to&#xD;
      participants with hyperkalaemia on haemodialysis will reduce serum K+ (S-K+ ) and enable the&#xD;
      consumption of more fruit and vegetables and more satisfying diet. The study aims to show&#xD;
      that participants using SZC achieve S-K+ reduction as well as participants on SoC (other than&#xD;
      K+ binders), without the need for restricting K+ in the diet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, randomised, controlled, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre,&#xD;
      prospective study to evaluate the effect of the combination of SZC and enhanced nutritional&#xD;
      advice to consume fruit and vegetables as compared to SoC in reducing S-K+ levels in&#xD;
      participants with hyperkalaemia on haemodialysis. Following 7-day screening, all participants&#xD;
      who are enrolled will begin an up to 1-month HK Treatment Phase with SZC as per local label.&#xD;
      Participants will receive dietary advice consistent with SoC at that site, including K+&#xD;
      restriction. A 4-month Diet Comparison Phase will begin next with participants being&#xD;
      randomised to either continue taking SZC, which can be titrated as needed to maintain target&#xD;
      S-K+ , and receive enhanced nutritional advice to consume fruit and vegetables (SZC arm), or&#xD;
      SZC will be withdrawn and participants will receive SoC, including dietary K+ restriction&#xD;
      (SoC arm).&#xD;
