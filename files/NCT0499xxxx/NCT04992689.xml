  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistance is defined as a decrease in the ability of insulin to lower blood glucose&#xD;
      levels. Various pathological conditions can cause an increase in insulin resistance, such as&#xD;
      sepsis, administration of certain medications, various stressful situations, surgery or&#xD;
      significant injuries, etc. Sepsis can cause extreme stress, which causes significant changes&#xD;
      in metabolism, disruption of blood glucose regulation and increased insulin resistance. In&#xD;
      sepsis there is an extreme activation of inflammatory mediators and of counter-regulatory&#xD;
      hormones, such as cortisol, glucagon and catecholamines, which increase hepatic&#xD;
      gluconeogenesis on the one hand, and increase the peripheral resistance to insulin on the&#xD;
      other hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorder in the regulation of blood glucose level causes increased mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      among intensive care unit patients with sepsis, as well as an increase in the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization and its financial expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of parameters used in the intensive care unit to diagnose the development&#xD;
      of sepsis within the unit, such as an increase or decrease in body temperature, an increase&#xD;
      in CRP level, white blood cell count, pro-calcitonin level, etc It is possible that an&#xD;
      increase in insulin resistance can also be used as a predictor of sepsis. It should be noted&#xD;
      that almost all patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit are treated with a&#xD;
      continuous infusion of insulin to balance their blood glucose level, including patients who&#xD;
      are not diagnosed with diabetes prior to their hospitalization in the unit. This is in light&#xD;
      of the increase in insulin resistance for the reasons listed above among patients in critical&#xD;
      condition, and also due to the need to maintain blood glucose values in the range of 140-180&#xD;
      mg/dl, since high blood glucose values among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit&#xD;
      are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would therefore like to investigate whether an increase in insulin resistance, as&#xD;
      expressed in an increase in the patient's insulin intake, can predict the development of&#xD;
      sepsis secondary to bacteremia in the intensive care unit.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:Patients aged 18-100, diabetic and non-diabetic, admitted to the General&#xD;
        Intensive Care Unit from January 2013 to January 2021 (inclusive) for any reason, required&#xD;
        during their hospitalization a continuous infusion of insulin, and developed during their&#xD;
        hospitalization acquired bacteremia after more than 48 hours from ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:Patients who did not receive a continuous insulin infusion, patients&#xD;
        with bacteremia of non-pathogenic bacteria (contamination), patients who developed&#xD;
        bacteremia less than 48 hours after ICU admission, patients who received drugs that might&#xD;
        influence insulin resistance (steroids, glucagon) or patients with other reasons that might&#xD;
        explain an increase in insulin resistance other than infection.&#xD;
