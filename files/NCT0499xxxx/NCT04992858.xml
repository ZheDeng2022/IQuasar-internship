      This is a phase II, Single-arm,Open-label Study evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CT053PTSA in Advanced Solid Tumors With MET Exon 14 Skipping Mutations&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out in two parts, part 1 and part 2. Part 1:Observation phase of&#xD;
      dose tolerance: Objective To observe the tolerability and safety of 60 mg CT053PTSA in&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC patients with Metex14 skipping mutation, and to determine the recommended dose&#xD;
      (RED) in the dose expansion phase。 Part 2: This is the expansion part and will continue to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of CT053PTSA at the dose of RED in advanced NSCLC patients&#xD;
      with Metex14 skipping mutation.&#xD;
