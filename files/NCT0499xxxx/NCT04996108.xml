  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pericarditis is swelling of the sac that surrounds the heart, the pericardium, causing chest&#xD;
      pain. For most patients, the condition improves with simple anti-inflammatory medications&#xD;
      like colchicine and ibuprofen. However, in 20-30% of patients the condition comes back.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of recurrent pericarditis is frequently missed or delayed, and many patients&#xD;
      require prolonged courses of corticosteroids to control their disease. Together these factors&#xD;
      damage the quality of life of patients with recurrent pericarditis. Currently there is&#xD;
      limited understanding of why pericarditis comes back in some patients, and how best to treat&#xD;
      it when it does.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PAIReD (Pericarditis: Auto-Inflammation in Recurrent Disease) is an observational research&#xD;
      study funded by the British Heart Foundation that will investigate the role inflammation&#xD;
      plays in recurrent pericarditis. Patients with recurrent pericarditis and other&#xD;
      auto-inflammatory diseases will be recruited from the specialist fever clinic at the Royal&#xD;
      Free Hospital, where they will be asked to donate blood up to six times over a three year&#xD;
      period. Healthy participants will be recruited at the Royal Free Hospital or Guy's Hospital.&#xD;
      Relatives of participants with recurrent pericarditis will be recruited at the Royal Free&#xD;
      Hospital. They latter two groups will attend one appointment where blood or saliva samples&#xD;
      will be taken. A subset of participants will also provide fingerstick blood samples and&#xD;
      questionnaires from home, for up to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected prospectively and by retrospective case note review. Blood&#xD;
      from participants will be analysed to look at how the immune cells of patients with recurrent&#xD;
      pericarditis function during the course of their disease, and to look for genetic changes in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent pericarditis that might contribute to their condition. Together this&#xD;
      knowledge has to potential to help clinicians diagnose and monitor patients with recurrent&#xD;
      pericarditis more accurately, and researchers to design more effective treatments.&#xD;
