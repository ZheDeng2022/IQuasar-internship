  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a real-world, observational, prospective cohort study in patients with severe asthma&#xD;
      recruited into the International Severe Asthma Registry (ISAR) and the US severe asthma&#xD;
      registry (CHRONICLE) and followed-up for occurrence of new malignancies. The primary&#xD;
      objective is to measure the incidence of malignancy in the overall severe asthma population&#xD;
      as well as its relevant subgroups, including patients receiving benralizumab, patients&#xD;
      receiving non-benralizumab biologics, and patients not receiving biologics. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to describe the clinical characteristics of new malignancy cases that develop in&#xD;
      severe asthma patients and relevant subgroups.&#xD;

        The study population includes patients with severe asthma recruited into ISAR and&#xD;
        CHRONICLE. Severe asthma patients are defined as those receiving treatment consistent with&#xD;
        Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 or who are uncontrolled on GINA Step 4 treatment&#xD;
        regimens. The three main study groups are: severe asthma patients who receive benralizumab,&#xD;
        who receive non-benralizumab biologics, and those who do not receive any biologics.&#xD;
