  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will have 2 independent parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of the study is intended to collect samples for Metabolites in Safety Testing (MIST)&#xD;
      analysis after administration of multiple doses of zibotentan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 of the study is designed to evaluate the relative bioavailability of zibotentan and&#xD;
      dapagliflozin after dosing with two different fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations and&#xD;
      dosing with separate formulations of zibotentan and dapagliflozin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 will be an open-label, non-randomised, single treatment period. A single treatment&#xD;
      period during which participants will be resident at the study centre from 2 days before&#xD;
      dosing (Day -2) until the morning of Day 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will be an open-label, randomised, 3-period, 3-treatment, cross-over single dose&#xD;
      study. Participants will be randomised to one of 3 treatment sequences and will receive 3&#xD;
      single-dose study interventions. Participants will be resident at the study centre from 2&#xD;
      days before dosing (Day -2) until Day 3 of the last treatment sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who were enrolled in Part 1 may not be enrolled in Part 2.&#xD;
