    <description>SF-36 score will measure eight scales: physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. Scores on each scale will be directly transformed into a 0-100 scale, where a lower score indicates more disability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Karnofsky Performance Status score will be measured on a scale from 0 percent (%) to 100%, where a lower percentage score indicates a worse disease state.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pain Scale Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 3 days after last dose of study drug (up to approximately 4 weeks)</time_frame>
