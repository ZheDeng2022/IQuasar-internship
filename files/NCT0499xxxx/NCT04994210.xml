  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ENKTL is a highly aggressive NHL with a higher incidence in Asia. L-asparaginase containing&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens are the standard first-line treatment with apparently toxicities. In&#xD;
      2020 ASH, we reported Sintilimab(anti-PD-1 antibody) plus Chidamide(an oral subtype-selective&#xD;
      HDACi) yielded effective antitumor activity, durable response in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory ENKTL(SCENT trial. Abstracts 644). We next conducted a exploratory study to&#xD;
      investigated the safety and efficacy of Sintilimab plus Chidamide(SC) for patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed ENKTL(SCENT-2 trial).&#xD;
