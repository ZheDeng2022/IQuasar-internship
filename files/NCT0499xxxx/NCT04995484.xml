  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      belzutifan (MK-6482) following a single oral 120 mg dose of belzutifan in participants with&#xD;
      moderate hepatic impairment to that of healthy matched control participants. This study will&#xD;
      also evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single oral 120 mg dose of belzutifan in&#xD;
      participants with moderate hepatic impairment.&#xD;
