  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sotos Syndrome (SS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) are known as overgrowth syndromes&#xD;
      as they involve an excessive growth of the whole body or of specific body parts. Beyond their&#xD;
      primary physical problems, people with SS and BWS could present cognitive delay,&#xD;
      socio-emotional and social behavior difficulties. For the SS, previous research reported&#xD;
      impairments in specific neuropsychological domains and alterations of social behavior.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, a description of the neuropsychological and behavioral profile in developmental&#xD;
      age is still lacking. For the BWS, only in recent years alterations in social-cognitive&#xD;
      development and in social behavior have started to gain attention of clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers. However, no study has investigated the neuropsychological and behavioral&#xD;
      functioning of children and adolescents with BWS. In this light, this research project aims&#xD;
      at providing the first detailed description of the neuropsychological and behavioral profile&#xD;
      of children and adolescents with SS and BWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with SS and BWS experience structural alterations of their bodies and are&#xD;
      early exposed to invasive diagnostical and medical procedures, which could interfere with the&#xD;
      development of body representation. Body representation starts forming early in life through&#xD;
      the integration of exteroceptive and interoceptive information, and plays a pivotal role in&#xD;
      the social-cognitive development. Given the changes occurring in puberty and the crucial&#xD;
      importance of body image in the relationship with peers, adolescence could be seen as a&#xD;
      critical period for studying body representation. Thus, this project would investigate body&#xD;
      representation at multiple levels (i.e. body image, body schema and interoceptive perception)&#xD;
      and evaluate their impact on social-cognitive abilities in adolescents with SS and BWS. It is&#xD;
      expected that both the clinical groups show alterations of body representation compared to&#xD;
      healthy peers, and that these alterations could associate with impairments in affect&#xD;
      recognition and regulation.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale Sotos Syndrome (SS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) are known&#xD;
      as overgrowth syndromes as they involve alterations in dimensions of the whole body or of&#xD;
      specific body parts. SS is characterized by advanced bone age, macrocephaly, characteristic&#xD;
      facies and cognitive delay. For the latter aspect, recent studies has described impairments&#xD;
      in specific neuropsychological domains and alterations of social behavior. However, this&#xD;
      evidence has been gathered in small and non-uniform samples, thus requiring further&#xD;
      investigation. Moreover, a description of the neuropsychological and behavioral profile of SS&#xD;
      in developmental age is still lacking. BWS is presented with macroglossia, exomphalos,&#xD;
      lateralized overgrowth and hyperinsulinism as cardinal features, and is often associated with&#xD;
      Wilms tumor and pathologies of internal organs. While the medical care of these primary&#xD;
      issues has greatly improved, recently alterations in social-cognitive development and in&#xD;
      social behavior have started to gain attention of clinicians and researchers. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      no study has investigated the neuropsychological and behavioral functioning of children and&#xD;
      adolescents with BWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body representation is a complex, multi-faceted construct encompassing all the processes that&#xD;
      allow to perceive, to experience and to be aware of our body. Body representation starts&#xD;
      forming from the first months of life through the integration of exteroceptive and&#xD;
      interoceptive information, and plays a crucial role in social-cognitive development. Children&#xD;
      with SS and BWS experience structural alterations of their bodies and are early exposed to&#xD;
      invasive diagnostical and medical procedures, which could interfere with the development of&#xD;
      body representation. Given the changes occurring in puberty and the crucial importance of&#xD;
      body image in the relationship with peers, adolescence could be seen as a critical period for&#xD;
      body representation. Here, multiple levels of body representation (i.e., body image, body&#xD;
      schema and interoceptive accuracy) are investigated in adolescents with SS and BWS compared&#xD;
      to a control group of peers with typical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The current study would provide a full description of the neuropsychological and&#xD;
      behavioral profile of children and adolescents with SS and BWS (Aim 1). Moreover, this study&#xD;
      protocol aims at investigating alterations of body representation at multiple levels, i.e.&#xD;
      body image, body schema and interoceptive perception, and at evaluating their impact on&#xD;
      social-cognitive abilities in adolescents with SS and BWS (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodologies This observational study involves two distinct assessment procedures, which may&#xD;
      be conducted in a single session or in two sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, children with SS and BWS are administered selected subtests of the NEPSY-II, the&#xD;
      most adopted battery in developmental age in conditions of typical and atypical development.&#xD;
      The NEPSY-II provides a full description of the neuropsychological profile in six different&#xD;
      domains (Attention and executive functions, Language, Memory and learning, Sensorimotor&#xD;
      functions, Social Perception, Visuospatial skills). Colored and Standard Raven's Matrices are&#xD;
      also administered so as to obtain a reliable index of general intellectual functioning.&#xD;
      Moreover, a standardized assessment of academic skills is performed by means of specific&#xD;
      tests of the Memory and Transfert (MT) group for reading, comprehension and mathematic.&#xD;
      Lastly, parents are asked to fulfil a sheet collecting socio-demographic and anamnestic&#xD;
      information and two standardized questionnaires: the Child Behavior Check List (CBCL)&#xD;
      assessing the presence of emotional-behavioral problems, and the Autistic Quotient (AQ)&#xD;
      questionnaire assessing autistic traits related to five areas of functioning (social skills,&#xD;
      attention switching, attention to detail, communication and imagination). The entire&#xD;
      procedure is administered in a single session of approximately two hours and 30 minutes, in&#xD;
      which short breaks between activities (approximately 10 minutes) are allowed so as not to&#xD;
      overexert the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, adolescents (aged 11-18 years) with SS and BWS and healthy peers of the control&#xD;
      group are administered with a self-report questionnaire assessing body image, an ad hoc&#xD;
      created experimental task related to body schema, a virtual reality (VR) paradigm of&#xD;
      full-body illusion and two psychophysical tasks assessing interoceptive accuracy. The Body&#xD;
      Uneasiness Test (BUT) questionnaire consists of 34 items on a 1-5 Likert scale and allows for&#xD;
      the assessment of five dimensions related to body image (weight phobia, body image&#xD;
      preoccupation, compulsive self-monitoring, avoidance, and depersonalization). The&#xD;
      experimental task, administered through a computer, was developed according to recent studies&#xD;
      in literature that have assessed body schema changes in relation to peripersonal space and&#xD;
      interpersonal distance. Specifically, participants observe inanimate objects or avatars&#xD;
      approaching them. In one condition they have to judge whether they could easily reach the&#xD;
      objects/avatars (peripersonal space), in the other condition they have to indicate when the&#xD;
      object or avatar is perceived as &quot;too close&quot; (interpersonal distance). The full-body illusion&#xD;
      paradigm involves the use of a camera placed 2 meters behind the participant and of a VR head&#xD;
      mounted display. The back is touched by the experimenter and the image of this action is&#xD;
      replayed to the participant synchronously or with a time delay, thus creating an incongruence&#xD;
      between visual and haptic information.This paradigm induces an illusory sense of ownership of&#xD;
      the virtual body to be elicited more effectively than tasks focused on individual body parts,&#xD;
      and reliable as early as 7-8 year old. A short questionnaire adapted from the literature is&#xD;
      administered after each condition so as to assess the illusion in terms of sense of ownership&#xD;
      over the virtual body, sense of self location, and tactile sensations. In order to assess the&#xD;
      ability to perceive interoceptive signals (interoceptive accuracy), participants are&#xD;
      administerd a heartbeat perception task, in which they are asked to mentally count the number&#xD;
      of their own heartbeats over a certain period of time. Their responses are compared with&#xD;
      precise measurements of the heartbeats by means of a wrist-worn device that allows&#xD;
      noninvasive determination of heartrate by photoplethysmography. The procedure is repeated in&#xD;
      4 different time intervals administered in random order among participants, without giving&#xD;
      feedback on whether or not the responses are correct. In addition, a control task is proposed&#xD;
      in which the participant are asked to mentally count the seconds elapsed in 3 time intervals.&#xD;
      For both tasks, a visual analogic scale (VAS) is administered at the end of each time&#xD;
      interval to assess the degree of confidence in providing the response (0 = totally unsure to&#xD;
      10 = extremely confident). Lastly, in order to assess the difference in heartrate perception&#xD;
      at rest and in dynamic conditions, participants are administered the &quot;Jumping Jack Paradigm,&quot;&#xD;
      recently developed specifically for pediatric age (Schaan et al., 2019). For the baseline&#xD;
      condition, participants, sitting in a comfortable position, are asked to indicate on a VAS&#xD;
      how &quot;loud&quot; their heart rate feels. In the dynamic condition, participants are asked to jump&#xD;
      for 10 s and then indicate again on VAS how loud they feel their heartbeat is. The responses&#xD;
      provided on the VAS scales are compared with the heartrate recorded by the wrist-worn device.&#xD;
      The physical activity required is minimal, thus posing no danger to participants. At the same&#xD;
      time, this procedure facilitates the perception of the pulse and allows its assessment in an&#xD;
      ecological and intuitive way, limiting the impact of any cognitive difficulties. The entire&#xD;
      procedure is completed in approximately one hour and 30 minutes, inserting intervals of&#xD;
      approximately 10 minutes between tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Plan For the first aim, all variables will be transformed into scaled or&#xD;
      standardized scores according to the normative tables for Italian samples, so as to compare&#xD;
      performances of the clinical groups with the age-matched population with typical development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each clinical group, the neuropsychological and behavioral profile will be estimated&#xD;
      using repeated-measures ANOVA models by entering the average scaled scores of each domain of&#xD;
      the NEPSY-II and the standardized scores obtained in the behavioral scales of the CBCL&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the second aim, scores obtained in the five dimensions of the BUT questionnaire from the&#xD;
      clinical groups will be compared to those of the control group by means of two-tailed&#xD;
      Student's t-tests. For the body illusion task, the responses obtained at the questionnaire in&#xD;
      the different conditions will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the heartbeat perception task, the difference between actual and reported heartbeats will&#xD;
      be transformed into an index of interoceptive accuracy according to previous literature. A&#xD;
      similar measure will be estimated for the temporal accuracy control task by calculating the&#xD;
      difference between actual and counted seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the experimental tasks, mixed ANOVA models will be used with both between-groups and&#xD;
      within-subject factors (social/non-social stimulus for the computer-based behavioral task,&#xD;
      synchronous and asynchronous stimulation for the full-body illusion, heart rate/seconds for&#xD;
      the psychophysical tasks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant interaction effects will be explored with post-hoc tests. For all analyses, the&#xD;
      significance threshold will be set at p ≤ .05. Relationships between experimental task&#xD;
      variables and those derived from standardized tests and questionnaires will be analyzed using&#xD;
      Pearson's coefficient, correcting the significance threshold for the number of comparisons.&#xD;
