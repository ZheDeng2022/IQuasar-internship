  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will design, construct, and pilot a prototype of a trauma-informed online&#xD;
      intervention, which will be called &quot;SunnysideFlex,&quot; that functionally integrates a web-based&#xD;
      intervention targeting skills to decrease symptoms of PTSD and better manage mood during and&#xD;
      after pregnancy. SunnysideFlex will build upon the previously tested &quot;Sunnyside&quot; intervention&#xD;
      which targeted skills to manage mood through an interactive website with didactic material&#xD;
      and tools. Women in weeks 16-28 of their pregnancy who self-report symptoms of PTSD will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either SunnysideFlex or Sunnyside. The Sunnyside intervention will&#xD;
      consist of 6 weeks of online lessons during pregnancy and booster sessions at 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum. SunnysideFlex will include an additional 2 weeks of&#xD;
      trauma-informed online lessons during pregnancy, for a total of 8 consecutive weeks of online&#xD;
      intervention during pregnancy, as well as booster sessions at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, 6 weeks postpartum, and&#xD;
      12 weeks postpartum. SunnysideFlex has the potential to provide a novel paradigm for&#xD;
      improving maternal and child health outcomes in high-risk, trauma-exposed women.&#xD;

    <description>The PCL-5 is a well validated screening tool for assessing PTSD symptoms and probable PTSD diagnosis. the PCL-5 checklist assesses frequency of past 30-day PTSD symptoms in reference to an individual's self-identified worst traumatic event. A total score of 33 or greater represents a positive PTSD screen and is the cut-off employed in the current study.</description>

PHQ-9 scoring interpretations are as follows: 1-4: minimal depressive symptoms; 5-9 mild depressive symptoms; 10-14: moderate depressive symptoms; 15-19: moderately severe depressive symptoms: 20-27: severe depressive symptoms.</description>

The Sunnyside intervention will consist of 6 weeks of online lessons during pregnancy and booster sessions at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum.

    <description>SunnysideFlex consists of 8 weeks of online lessons during pregnancy and booster sessions at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks postpartum. SunnysideFlex builds upon the same Sunnyside intervention by providing the original 6-week Sunnyside program (described above), followed by an additional 2 weeks of trauma-specific prenatal intervention designed to reduce symptoms of PTSD, using evidence-based content that has been tailored specifically to the perinatal period.</description>
