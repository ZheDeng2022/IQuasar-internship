  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) studies are required to determine the optimal&#xD;
      training protocol to improve time trial(TT) performance. Data collection for this study will&#xD;
      be conducted virtually through the use of a software platform (www.trainerroad.com) by people&#xD;
      in their homes on cycle ergometers. Investigators will recruit people who are familiar with&#xD;
      cycle exercise training and have their own equipment. By using a virtual platform to collect&#xD;
      data, investigators will extend our reach to include a much larger and diverse sample of&#xD;
      adult men and women up to age 45 years. In addition, the software platform will allow&#xD;
      participants to train from the safety of their home, preventing the risk of exposure to&#xD;
      COVID19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES O1: The primary objective of this study is to determine the influence of interval&#xD;
      work-bout duration on TT performance when total mechanical work is matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      O2: The secondary objective of the study is to determine the influence of work-bout duration&#xD;
      on TT performance when work is matched by effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS H1: long duration bouts of HIIT will lead to greater improvements in performance&#xD;
      compared to short duration bouts due to larger total amount of work completed during the&#xD;
      interval sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: HIIT will lead to equivalent improvements in performance when work is matched by the&#xD;
      participant's rating of effort.&#xD;

      Participants will complete a training history and will be characterized with a questionnaire&#xD;
      with respect to age, sex and location. Prior to the first testing session, participants will&#xD;
      keep a food diary for the day preceeding the testing session to permit replication of diet&#xD;
      for other testing weeks. Participants will be provided with a coded TrainerRoad account used&#xD;
      to record all testing and training data. Training sessions will be pre-programmed into the&#xD;
      TrainerRoad platform. All testing and training will be completed by participants at their&#xD;
      residence on their own bicycles with the use of a smart trainer. Participants will complete&#xD;
      an incremental exercise test (IET) to determine their maximal power output (Wmax) and two&#xD;
      40-minute Time Trials (TTs). The IET includes a warmup followed by ramp increases in&#xD;
      intensity to a voluntary maximum; typically reached after 8 to 12 min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing will be conducted in the 2-weeks prior and the week following the intervention. Once&#xD;
      baseline testing is completed, participants will begin the interval training program which&#xD;
      will consist of two interval training sessions per week and 2-3 sessions of low-intensity&#xD;
      continuous training. There will be assessor blinding since all testing and training will be&#xD;
      conducted solely by the participant with guidance from the TrainerRoad software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENTS Time-Trial Performance The TT test will be performed by each participant on&#xD;
      their own bicycle connected to a smart trainer. Following the warmup, participants will&#xD;
      complete a 40-minute TT to determine their maximal sustainable power which corresponds to&#xD;
      7-8/10 on the 10 point Borg RPE scale. For the first TT test, participants will set their&#xD;
      workload to 65% of the power achieved from the IET. Participants can consume water ad libitum&#xD;
      for the duration of the time trial. Heart rate, cadence, mean power output and maximal power&#xD;
      output will be recorded using the TrainerRoad platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximal Power Output (Wmax). The incremental exercise test determines Wmax. The first stage&#xD;
      of the assessment will be completed at the same intensity completed during the warmup phase&#xD;
      and increased by 12.5 watts every 30-seconds until the participant is unable to maintain a&#xD;
      cadence of 70 RPM. All data will be collected using the TrainerRoad platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four interval training groups&#xD;
      via a computer-generated random sequence. Randomization and allocation will be concealed from&#xD;
      the investigators. The groups will consist of a long-HIIT, a medium-HIIT matched to long&#xD;
      work, a medium-HIIT that is performed at 15% higher intensity (Medium-HIIT-H), and&#xD;
      intermittent short-HIIT (Short-HIIT). Each participant will be aware that they will be&#xD;
      completing one of four interval exercise programs, however, they will be blinded to the&#xD;
      details of the other programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interval Exercise. Participants will perform a 15-minute warm-up. Following the interval&#xD;
      session, they will complete a 10-minute cool down. Interval exercise intensity and durations&#xD;
      will be provided through the TrainerRoad program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-HIIT will include 4-repetitions of 6-minute work-bouts with 4-minutes of recovery&#xD;
      between bouts. The intensity will be set to 15% of the difference between Wmax and the mean&#xD;
      power achieved in the 40-minute TT test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medium-HIIT will consist of 12-repetitions of 2-minute work-bouts with 2-minutes of recovery.&#xD;
      The Medium-HIIT-L group will exercise at the same intensity as the long-HIIT group whereas&#xD;
      the Medium-HIIT-H group will perform the interval sessions at 30% of the difference between&#xD;
      Wmax and the mean power achieved in the 40-minute TT test. During recovery-bouts,&#xD;
      participants cycle at 40% of the work-bout intensity. Short-HIIT will consist of three sets&#xD;
      of 16-repetitions of 30-second work-bouts with 15-seconds of active recovery at 50% of the&#xD;
      work-intensity with 4-minutes of active recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-Intensity Continuous Training (LICT). In addition to the interval training, participants&#xD;
      perform at least 3 sessions of low-intensity continuous training (LICT) for 60-minutes to&#xD;
      simulate a polarized training model. The intensity for LICT will be set to 40% of the&#xD;
      interval training session power. A polarized training model leads to greater improvements in&#xD;
      endurance performance when compared to a threshold training or interval training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION All participants will be provided with a coded TrainerRoad account to record&#xD;
      all testing and training data. Training sessions will be pre-programmed into the TrainerRoad&#xD;
      platform. All testing and training will be completed by participants at their residence on&#xD;
      their own bicycles with the use of a smart trainer. The TrainerRoad application will record&#xD;
      power output, heart rate and cadence for the duration of each exercise session. At the end of&#xD;
      each session, participants will record their session rating of perceived exertion on&#xD;
      TrainerRoad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data analysis will be conducted using R and R-Studio. A comparison of&#xD;
      the mean of the performance variables will be assessed using a repeated-measures analysis of&#xD;
      the variance (ANOVA) to determine differences between the interval protocols. The primary&#xD;
      outcome is change in time-trial mean power. Secondary outcomes include change in maximal&#xD;
      power output (Wmax), session rating of perceived exertion, time-trial perceived exertion, and&#xD;
      adherence. A subgroup analysis will be conducted from baseline data including age, sex,&#xD;
      baseline TT performance and Wmax/kg. If there is a significant difference, a post-hoc&#xD;
      analysis will be completed using a paired Student's t-test with Bonferroni correction. The&#xD;
      level of significance will be set to a p-value of 0.05. Effect size calculations (Cohen's d)&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals will be used to determine the magnitude of the effect.&#xD;
