  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prosthetic-driven immediate implant placement for optimal aesthetic restoration has been&#xD;
      increasing in demand during the last decades but requires higher accuracy. Dynamic navigation&#xD;
      has been reported better implant positioning. However, dynamic navigation's application to&#xD;
      immediate implant placement has not been studied, and its exact role is still needed to be&#xD;
      investigated further. Besides, implant insertion angle may influence primary stability, which&#xD;
      is a prerequisite in achieving osseointegration, while dynamic navigation can precisely&#xD;
      control angle and position. Therefore, the investigators designed a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial study to verify the clinical efficacy of dynamic navigation and freehand in&#xD;
      immediate implant placement.&#xD;

    <description>Taking cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The deviation between the planned implant and the actual implant were measured by Computer Assisted Dental Implant Precision System (Dcarer, Suzhou, China) as follows: (1) At least four feature points (like tooth cusps or bone pits) were selected in preoperative and postoperative CBCT for rough registration. (2) Feature surface circles in preoperative CBCT were selected, and then a mathematical algorithm displayed a similar feature surface circle in postoperative CBCT. The algorithm registered thousands of points in these two circles via conventional iso-surface thresholding technology. The software calculated registration error automatically. (3) Finally, the planned and actual implant were identified, and the deviation would be automatically calculated.</description>

    <measure>Insetion torque value (ITV)</measure>
    <time_frame>surgery day</time_frame>
    <description>A general method to to detect primary stability roughly. The ITV were evaluated by a wrench (Straumann, Waldenburg, Switzerland) at the time of implant placement. The investigator record the number of scale. Being equal to or greater than 35N is a ideal primary stability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>surgery day</time_frame>
    <description>A device to detect primary stability precisely. A Smartpeg was screwed into each implant, and resonance frequency analysis (RFA) was performed using Osstell Mentor (Osstell/Integration Diagnostics, Goteborg, Sweden). ISQ were recorded in the buccal and the palatal directions three times and averaged. &lt;60 represents low stability; 60-70 represents medium stability; higher than 70 represents high stability.</description>
