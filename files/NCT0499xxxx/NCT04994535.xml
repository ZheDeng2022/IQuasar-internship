  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effects of onabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX)&#xD;
      for the temporary improvement in the appearance of platysma prominence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study doctors will randomize participants into 1 of the 2 groups, called treatment arms.&#xD;
      There is a 1 in 2 chance that a participant will be assigned to placebo. Around 400&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study across approximately 35 sites in USA, Belgium,&#xD;
      Canada, Germany, Russia, and the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a single treatment of intramuscular injection of onabotulinumtoxinA&#xD;
      (BOTOX) or placebo on Day 1 during this 4 month long study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend regular monthly visits during the study at the study site.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a casual relationship with this treatment. The investigator assesses the relationship of each event to the use of the study. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that results in death, is life threatening, requires or prolongs hospitalization, results in a congenital anomaly, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or is an important medical event, that based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent adverse events/ treatment emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs/TESAEs) are defined as any event that began or worsened in severity on or after the first dose of the study drug.</description>
