      Leflunomide in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid tumors. Objectives are to determine the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability and the MTD of leflunomide in patients with PTEN-null advanced solid&#xD;
      malignancies and to assess preliminary evidence of clinical activity of leflunomide in&#xD;
      patients with PTEN-null advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;

    <description>A standard 3+3 design is used to define the MTD. Dose level 0 will only be utilized in the presence of ≥2/6 DLTs in dose level 1 or for a dose reduction if a patient does not tolerate dose level one. Standard dosing for rheumatoid arthritis is 100mg daily for 3 days loading dose followed by 20mg daily maintenance dose, which can be reduced to 10mg in the event of intolerance.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced or metastatic solid tumor with lack of PTEN expression as determined by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry. Lack of PTEN expression is defined as the absence of staining in&#xD;
             the tumor (&lt;5%), with strong positive staining of adjacent normal endometrium or&#xD;
             stromal cells, using the monoclonal DAKO antibody 6H2.1.9&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have progressed on, be refractory or intolerant of standard therapy for&#xD;
             their cancer, if such a standard therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging at&#xD;
             least 4 weeks after after CNS directed therapy shows no evidence of progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate CNS directed therapy is not required and is unlikely to be required during&#xD;
             the first cycle of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ≥ 4 weeks from last systemic therapy, surgery or radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with HIV on effective anti-retroviral therapy with an undetectable viral load&#xD;
             within 6 months are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  GFR (Cockroft-Gault) ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior to C1D1 of leflunomide&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             before study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following&#xD;
             completion of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with primary CNS tumors are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks before entering the&#xD;
             study or those who have not recovered from grade ≥ 2 adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Adverse events such as alopecia,&#xD;
             hypothyroidism, and neuropathy are allowed. Other adverse events may be allowed by&#xD;
             permission of the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A known history of acute or chronic Hepatitis B or C, due to the known potential&#xD;
             hepatotoxicity of leflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to leflunomide or teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
