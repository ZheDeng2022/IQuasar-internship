      Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T), a life shortening autosomal recessive multisystem disease, is&#xD;
      caused by mutations in the ATM gene, and affects 1/300,000 live births. The&#xD;
      pathophysiological basis of the disease relates to mutations in the ATM kinase gene that&#xD;
      result in a faulty repair of breakages in double-stranded DNA. A-T causes a progressive&#xD;
      ataxia, dystonia, and movement disorder, and is complicated by immunodeficiency, lung&#xD;
      disease, faltering growth, limb and spinal deformities, and increased susceptibility to&#xD;
      cancers. The disease first manifests in early childhood with balance problems and is slowly&#xD;
      progressive, with loss of control of limb and eye movements, and speech, through the school&#xD;
      years, resulting in severe disability by adulthood. Patients with classical A-T rarely live&#xD;
      beyond their 20s, and there is no effective treatment. Because it is so rare, little has been&#xD;
      published on the natural history of the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Health funds the national multidisciplinary clinic for children with A-T in&#xD;
      Nottingham, with follow-up of adults at the Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire. Clinical&#xD;
      and laboratory data have been collected systematically from over 170 patients, most on more&#xD;
      than one occasion, from 2001 to date. This unique clinical collection will allow us to&#xD;
      elucidate the natural history of A-T using a mixture of cross-sectional and longitudinal&#xD;
      analyses, from presentation in the pre-school years to adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will discover more about the presentation and diagnosis of A-T, and the detailed evolution&#xD;
      of the disease as children grow to adulthood. Preliminary analyses of the neurological&#xD;
      phenotype in 134 patients has shown important genotype-phenotype relationships and a more&#xD;
      variable deterioration over time than anticipated, which will be investigated further. In&#xD;
      parallel, investigation of the morbidity and mortality due to deterioration in lung function,&#xD;
      the immune system, infections, cancers, malnutrition, and skeletal deformity will be&#xD;
      undertaken. We will learn about the interactions between the various disease manifestations,&#xD;
      e.g. lung disease and nutritional status, immunological impairment and neurology and risk of&#xD;
      cancers. These discoveries will inform patient care, and help to generate hypotheses for&#xD;
      further research projects. From the analysis of the cross-sectional data we will establish an&#xD;
      initial Core Outcome Set, which will be further developed at Patient and Public Involvement&#xD;
      (PPI) meetings with young people with A-T and their parents/carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is needed to accurately map the course of A-T from childhood to adulthood, to help&#xD;
      us recognise different patterns of disease in individual patients, improve early diagnosis by&#xD;
      understanding the reasons for diagnostic delay, anticipate complications more accurately and&#xD;
      elucidate the best ages to intervene before rapid deterioration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected clinical course involves deterioration in gross and fine motor skills,&#xD;
      oculomotorpraxia, choreoform movements, and difficulty with chewing and swallowing. By the&#xD;
      end of their first decade children are usually wheelchair dependent as cerebellar destruction&#xD;
      progresses and further neurodisability ensues with development of incapacitating movement&#xD;
      disorder and peripheral neuropathy. Sinopulmonary infections and recurrent lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections with bronchiectasis are common in A-T, and current management aims to avoid&#xD;
      and treat lung infection. The treatment for malignancy must take into consideration the fact&#xD;
      that many oncological therapies have adverse-effects that will impact on individual function&#xD;
      in other domains for example drugs that cause muscle weakness will exacerbate motor&#xD;
      impairments. Also the DNA of patients with A-T is particularly susceptible to double strand&#xD;
      breakage, which can itself cause secondary malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the natural history and its variability is not only vital to planning effective&#xD;
      patient-centred services, and counselling patients and their families, but will also inform&#xD;
      the design of future clinical research, particularly clinical trials. The choice of age group&#xD;
      to include in a trial, duration of treatment, and choice of core outcome measures will depend&#xD;
      on the results of this natural history study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will centre on data analysis and will not involve any therapeutic interventions,&#xD;
      although it is intended that the results will enable future research to determine optimum&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies. The benefits of this study thus relate to the compilation of vast&#xD;
      amounts of data that have been gathered on A-T over the last 15 years and extracting&#xD;
      meaningful information that will inform future care. There is no identifiable risk from&#xD;
      inclusion in the study as it involves patient data that are gathered through standard&#xD;
      clinical interaction and does not involve introducing or changing treatments or any increased&#xD;
      patient interaction apart from voluntary participation of a sample of parents / guardians and&#xD;
      young people with A-T in the PPI focus group meetings, for which informed consent will be&#xD;
      sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no established treatments for A-T. Symptomatic treatments are used in patients&#xD;
      depending on their symptoms, e.g. gastrostomy feeds are used when eating becomes too slow, or&#xD;
      too difficult because of swallowing difficulties. Antibiotics and chest physiotherapy are&#xD;
      used to prevent and treat chest infections. Immunodeficiency can be treated in selected&#xD;
      cases, as can the various complications of A-T as and when they arise, including scoliosis,&#xD;
      cancers, granulomas, movement disorders and spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current therapy in A-T is aimed at mitigating neurological deterioration, prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of respiratory complications, early identification and treatment of malignancy&#xD;
      whilst minimising adverse-effects and treating immunodeficiency with immunoglobulin, in other&#xD;
      words, managing the downstream complications of the gene mutation. Each aspect and&#xD;
      complication requires specialist assessment and input and monitoring of progression and&#xD;
      response to treatment. A-T is managed from a multi-speciality and multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      perspective and in Nottingham this happens in the setting of the National A-T Clinic that&#xD;
      children attend with their families every two years. Neurological progression is determined&#xD;
      using the A-T Index and AT-NEST scoring systems. Assessment by a clinician with paediatric&#xD;
      respiratory expertise also occurs alongside input from a neurologist, immunologist,&#xD;
      geneticist, dietician, occupational and physiotherapist, clinical psychologist and speech and&#xD;
      language therapist. One of the aims of this natural history study is to avoid complications&#xD;
      developing by elucidating the optimal timing of treatment interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory disease patterns in A-T include sinopulmonary disease and bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease and lung disease associated with neuromuscular, especially bulbar,&#xD;
      dysfunction. At present treatment depends on the pattern of lung disease and can range from&#xD;
      antibiotics, immunoglobulin replacement, systemic steroids, chest physiotherapy, and steps to&#xD;
      limit aspiration. Assessment of response to treatment includes assessment of resolution or&#xD;
      persistence of symptoms, spirometry measurements, and imaging such as chest x-rays and where&#xD;
      indicated, CT scans, although limiting exposure to radiation is always a factor to consider&#xD;
      in patients with A-T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several small scale pilot trials of medication for the neurological&#xD;
      impairments with mixed success, including the use of amantidine5, betamethasone6,7, and&#xD;
      dexamethasone loaded autologous redcells8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential but as yet untested treatments include anti-oxidants which have the potential to&#xD;
      slow down progression of neurodegeneration by protecting Purkinje cells in the cerebellum&#xD;
      from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. ATM has a role in the inhibition of oxidative&#xD;
      stress and absence or reduced function of ATM could result in increased oxidative stress and&#xD;
      accelerated neuronal loss.11&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, all these suggestions in fact impact the downstream consequences of the mutations.&#xD;
      In cystic fibrosis, another multisystem genetic disease which largely impacts the respiratory&#xD;
      system, the treatment paradigm has shifted from downstream treatment of the consequences of&#xD;
      gene dysfunction, to gene therapy and small molecule treatments addressing the basic defect.&#xD;
      It is likely that in the near future A-T will follow this paradigm, e.g. with the development&#xD;
      of drugs to allow read-through of premature termination codons, or the skipping of mutations,&#xD;
      or the incorporation of functioning genetic sequences into the genome. These and other, as&#xD;
      yet unknown, therapeutic approaches will require carefully designed clinical trials, and this&#xD;
      natural history study will inform the design of such future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow a systematic approach to A-T and an understanding of the progression of&#xD;
      respiratory, neurological, immunological and oncological disease that underline this&#xD;
      multi-systemic disorder, as well as the impact of growth impairment. It will enable&#xD;
      evaluation of procedures and medical treatments as well as surgical therapies. There will be&#xD;
      insight into the psychological impact of the illness of children and their families and&#xD;
      whether there is a particular period where increased or additional support needs to be&#xD;
      offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As discussed earlier, a critical outcome will be determining the timing of appropriate&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions to prevent complications and delay progression of disease, as well&#xD;
      as the potential to inform the design of future clinical trials involving therapies for A-T.&#xD;
      As a natural history study there will be scope to extract information about A-T within all&#xD;
      domains and identify any important variables in treatment, identify whether timing of&#xD;
      treatment needs adjustment for maximal impact, for example, by earlier introduction of&#xD;
      therapy there may be slower progression of disease or fewer complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A possible negative consequence is that the information gleaned might be of little immediate&#xD;
      clinical use, however we do not think that will be the case. We think that the data will be&#xD;
      valuable in highlighting evidence gaps and informing new studies. We may find that there are&#xD;
      inconsistencies in treatments offered to patients and which will encourage us to try to&#xD;
      rationalise and streamline our clinical assessments and advice.&#xD;
