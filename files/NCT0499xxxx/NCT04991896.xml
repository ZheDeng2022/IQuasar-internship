    <textblock>
      BETAFLEC-CHIOS, is a single-center registry that was initiated in the &quot;Skylitseion&quot; General&#xD;
      Hospital of Chios in January 2020 and is ongoing. The inclusion criterion is IV flecainide&#xD;
      administration for recent-onset AF lasting less than 48 hours. Oral b-blockers are&#xD;
      co-administered in all patients. The main exclusion criteria are severe structural or&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease and conduction system dysfunction. Continuous monitoring is applied&#xD;
      during and after administration of IV flecainide. If no conversion to sinus rhythm is&#xD;
      achieved at 2 hours after flecainide infusion, the patient is recorded as &quot;unsuccessful&#xD;
      conversion attempt&quot;.&#xD;

      Patient population BETAFLEC-CHIOS, is a single-center registry that was initiated in the&#xD;
      &quot;Skylitseion&quot; General Hospital of Chios in January 2020 and is ongoing. Patients are included&#xD;
      in the registry if presenting with recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) (≤48 hours of onset)&#xD;
      and lasting ≥30min, documented by a 12-lead ECG and having received intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      flecainide on treating physician's discretion. Exclusion criteria are severe structural or&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease (previous cardiac surgery, any cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction&#xD;
      at any time), atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, high degree atrioventricular block,&#xD;
      bifascicular block, abnormal electrolyte levels (especially hypo- or hyperkalemia) or known&#xD;
      sensitivity to flecainide. Continuous monitoring is applied during and after administration&#xD;
      of IV flecainide. If no conversion to sinus rhythm is achieved at 2 hours after flecainide&#xD;
      infusion initiation, the patient is recorded as &quot;unsuccessful conversion attempt&quot; and&#xD;
      forwarded for direct current cardioversion (DCC). All patients were anticoagulated according&#xD;
      to the current European Society Guidelines (ESC) or the management of AF [ESC Afib 2020].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flecainide administration Flecainide is given as an IV infusion of 1.5 mg/kg (max 150 mg) in&#xD;
      DW 5% over 10 min under continuous monitoring. Concomitant administration of a b-blocker is&#xD;
      also applied in all patients. The dose and type of b-blocker are selected according to heart&#xD;
      rate during the AF and patient's medical history. &quot;Time to conversion&quot; is calculated as the&#xD;
      time interval from the end of the infusion up to when sinus rhythm is observed on the monitor&#xD;
      and confirmed subsequently with a 12-lead ECG.&#xD;
