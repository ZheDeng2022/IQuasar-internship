  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, observer-blind, randomized study to assess the safety and the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccines regimens in healthy adults aged&#xD;
      18 to 65 years in Mozambique using two approved vaccines (BBIBP-CorV and AZD1222). AZD1222 is&#xD;
      the first option as second vaccine to be used in this study. However, this may be subject to&#xD;
      replacement by another approved COVID-19 vaccine according to its availability for trial&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 cohorts, one for main immunology endpoints (N=260, 65 per study&#xD;
      arm) and one for more detailed immunological assessment (N=100, 25 per study arm). Two doses&#xD;
      of vaccine will be administered intramuscularly 4 week apart. All the study participants will&#xD;
      be follow-up for 12 months from the administration of first vaccine dose&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The randomization of study participants will be stratified into two cohorts including the general and immunology subset cohorts. The general cohort (N=260) for main immunology endpoints will be randomized in 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following arms: Prime BBIBP-CorV, Boost AZD1222 (GA1), Prime BBIBP-CorV, Boost BBIBP-CorV (GA2), Prime AZD1222, Boost BBIBP-CorV (GB1) and Prime AZD1222, Boost AZD1222 (GB2). The participants in the immunology subset cohort (n=100) will be randomized in 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following arms: Prime BBIBP-CorV, Boost AZD1222 (SA1), Prime BBIBP-CorV, Boost BBIBP-CorV (SA2), Prime AZD1222, Boost BBIBP-CorV (SB1), and Prime AZD1222, Boost AZD1222 (SB2). This immunology cohort will enable to further characterize the cellular and humoral immune response.</intervention_model_description>
