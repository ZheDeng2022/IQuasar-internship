  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of parenting interventions on improving the emotion&#xD;
      regulation and functioning of the children with AD/HD as well as their parents' parenting&#xD;
      practices and psychological well-being. Two kinds of parenting interventions are selected in&#xD;
      this study, namely the Mindful Parenting and Tuning in to Kids programs. The value of this&#xD;
      project lies in empowering parents through parenting techniques which they can use both for&#xD;
      themselves and for their daily interactions with children. It is hoped to alleviate their&#xD;
      stress from the role of parenting children with special needs, which may in turn lead to&#xD;
      their better psychological well-being and greater harmony in the families.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is one of the most common&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disorders affecting children and adolescents. Core symptoms of&#xD;
      inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity are associated with impairments in multiple&#xD;
      aspects of functioning. Apart from the cognitive and behavioral symptoms listed in the&#xD;
      diagnostic manual, emotional symptoms are often observed by the parents and teachers and&#xD;
      commonly reported in behavioral rating scales. The prevalence of emotion-related problems&#xD;
      among children and adolescents diagnosed with AD/HD is estimated to be between 24-50%.&#xD;
      Emotion regulation problems in children and youths with AD/HD were associated with greater&#xD;
      risk for more psychopathology, poorer psychosocial functioning, and increased rate of&#xD;
      treatment service utilization. Follow-up study of children with AD/HD into adulthood found a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of difficulties in emotion regulation among those with persistent AD/HD&#xD;
      symptoms than those without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parenting a child with special needs such as AD/HD is known to be associated with increased&#xD;
      level of parental stress. Apart from their jobs and other family duties, the parents must&#xD;
      meet the challenges of taking care of their children's special needs and dealing with their&#xD;
      functional problems. According to a survey conducted by the Centre for Special Educational&#xD;
      Needs and Inclusive Education of the Educational University of Hong Kong in 2018, 82% of the&#xD;
      parents of children with AD/HD experienced higher level of stress in relation to their&#xD;
      children's symptoms, and over half of them reported to have mood problems. The parents often&#xD;
      reported great frustrations in bringing up their children with limited support and&#xD;
      encountering difficulties in daily interactions with their children. Previous research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that parental mental health problems can adversely affect their parenting&#xD;
      abilities and their children's adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication and behavioral treatment are the two evidence-based treatments for children with&#xD;
      AD/HD. Apart from them, there are programs offered by public hospitals, government&#xD;
      departments, and non-governmental organizations on teaching the parents skills to manage&#xD;
      behavioral problems of children with AD/HD. However, parents may experience difficulties in&#xD;
      applying these behavioral management skills when they are suffering from significant&#xD;
      distress. In the recent years, new approaches such as mindfulness and emotion coaching have&#xD;
      been applied to parenting intervention programs. Intervention studies have supported that&#xD;
      these new parenting approaches have not only brought benefits to the parenting behaviors and&#xD;
      parents' mental health but also to the children's behavioral problems and children's&#xD;
      psychological well-being. Specific to the emotion regulation of children with AD/HD, the&#xD;
      effect of behavioral management parent training has been examined in the previous research.&#xD;
      However, there has been very limited intervention study which directly investigates the&#xD;
      effect of new parenting intervention approaches on improving the emotion regulation of&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, we propose to apply two parenting interventions for improving emotion&#xD;
      regulation of children with AD/HD as well as their parents' parenting practices and&#xD;
      psychological well-being. The two selected interventions are &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot; program and&#xD;
      &quot;Tuning into Kids&quot; program. Using mindfulness techniques and everyday practice, the former&#xD;
      intervention aims at helping parents cultivate awareness and self-regulation in parent-child&#xD;
      interactions, bring compassion and non-judgmental acceptance to their difficulties. The&#xD;
      latter intervention teaches the parents emotion coaching techniques to become more aware and&#xD;
      reduce automatic response patterns to their children's emotions, and to communicate&#xD;
      understanding of such emotions to children. Research has showed that these two new approaches&#xD;
      are related to lower level of parental stress and reactivity, and fewer negative parent-child&#xD;
      interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effects of the two parenting interventions on improving emotion&#xD;
           regulation of children with AD/HD as well as their functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effects of the two parenting interventions in promoting parents'&#xD;
           parenting practices and psychological well-being, which includes their emotion&#xD;
           regulation, parenting stress, and mental health conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. It is hypothesized that improvements in emotion regulation and functioning will be&#xD;
           observed among children whose parents have completed one of the parenting interventions.&#xD;
           Some of the improvements will be sustained in the two-months post-intervention&#xD;
           assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. It is expected that the parents who have completed the one of the parenting&#xD;
           interventions will show improvements in their parenting practices and psychological&#xD;
           well-being. The improvements will be showed immediately after the intervention, and some&#xD;
           of the gains will also be sustained in the two-months post-intervention assessment.&#xD;
