  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disease, characterised by low muscle strength and muscle&#xD;
      mass, and associated with higher medical care costs, shorter life expectancy and physical&#xD;
      dependence. Sarcopenia affects around 1 in 10 older adults in the general population.&#xD;
      However, in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), this number is almost 3 in 10.&#xD;
      Patients who have CHD are offered cardiac rehabilitation (CR); a multicomponent programme&#xD;
      designed to improve long-term health outcomes. Nutritional education is an important part of&#xD;
      CR and typically focuses around modifying fat and carbohydrate intake to lower cholesterol&#xD;
      levels and achieve a healthy weight. Currently there is little focus on increasing protein&#xD;
      intake, which might reduce the risk of sarcopenia. Eligible patients with CHD and low protein&#xD;
      intake will receive the standard nutritional education delivered during CR. Next,&#xD;
      participants will be randomised to one of two groups: protein education (intervention), or&#xD;
      standard information (control). Whilst COVID-19 restrictions are in place, education will be&#xD;
      delivered remotely via pre-recorded video. Outcome measures, including protein intake, sit to&#xD;
      stand performance, sarcopenia risk score (modified SARC-F), Physical Activity Vital Signs&#xD;
      (PAVS) and waist circumference, will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the protein group will receive three education sessions. The first two education sessions will be the same for both study arms and will align with the two dietary education sessions that these patients would usually be given during their normal cardiac rehabilitation programme. The content and materials for these sessions will be pre-recorded by the researchers and accessed by participants via the internet or DVD. For the third education session, participants in the protein group will be provided with targeted protein education, which will aim to increase the amount of foods eaten with protein in them (â‰¥1.2 g/kg protein/day) and improve the quality of protein sources that are eaten.</description>

The first two education sessions will be the same for both study arms and will align with the two dietary education sessions that these patients would usually be given during their normal cardiac rehabilitation programme. The content and materials for these sessions will be pre-recorded by the researchers and accessed by participants via the internet or DVD. Participants in the control group will receive a third dietary education session that is similar to the first two sessions, containing only information that is usually provided in the cardiac rehabilitation programme.</description>

    <description>The protein education session is pre-recorded and will describe in lay terms: the health issues associated with low protein intake, the amount of protein to eat in a day, and provide useful information to increase protein intake. This information will focus on the quality and amount of protein eaten, primarily using a whole-food approach. For example, the education sessions will give ideas for everyday foods that can be added to regular meals, favouring plant proteins, fish, lean meat, poultry, low fat dairy and eggs. The education session has been provided in conjunction with an NHS dietitian.</description>
