  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IB/II study with a 3+3 dose de-escalation study design. Patients will&#xD;
      continue maintenance treatment with CPX-351 for 6 cycles on D1 and D3, as long as patient&#xD;
      remains in CR. The dose de-escalation will be one dose given on D1 only, every 28 days&#xD;
      pending toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose will be used for the phase II expansion portion&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
