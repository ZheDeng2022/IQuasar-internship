  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a solid malignancy with a dismal prognosis. It has a 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate of approximately 8%. This is due to the usually late diagnosis, to&#xD;
      chemoresistance, and to intrinsic biological aggressiveness. Risk factors for PC are smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol, chronic pancreatitis, obesity, and diabetes. Recently, research has been dedicated&#xD;
      to the identification of a causal connection between certain pathogenic microorganisms,&#xD;
      especially of the oral flora, and PC. This would ultimately allow to identify new biomarkers&#xD;
      to adopt for early diagnosis, or to create new strategies for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral microbiota, periodontal disease and neoplastic risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      When referring to &quot;oral microbiota&quot; (OM), about 700 hundreds bacterial species are mentioned,&#xD;
      colonizing the oral cavity. A change in the normal flora of the oral cavity is commonly&#xD;
      indicated with the term &quot;dysbiosis&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causal connection between oral microbiota, periodontal disease and neoplastic risk is&#xD;
      possibly triple. First, it has been found that oral flora substantially differentiates&#xD;
      between cancer patients and controls. In particular, the most predominant phyla in cancer&#xD;
      patients are Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, whereas Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and&#xD;
      Bacteroides are more common in healthy controls. This highlights the possibility of a direct&#xD;
      causal connection between dysbiosis and neoplastic risk. Second, oral dysbiosis represents&#xD;
      the main risk factor of PD that per s√© is a risk factor of many cancers. Third, the&#xD;
      conditions leading to oral dysbiosis (alcohol, smoking, obesity, diabetes, chronic drugs&#xD;
      intake, dietary habits, etc.) are the most well known risk factors either for cancer and oral&#xD;
      dysbiosis. The common denominator is always represented by chronic inflammation and migration&#xD;
      of microorganisms to distant sites, ultimately promoting neoplastic progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tangled net of causal connections sheds light on the potential important role of the&#xD;
      oral cavity and PD as independent risk factors for many cancers, and as modifiable elements&#xD;
      to reduce the neoplastic risk and to perform prevention(15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral microbiota, periodontal disease and pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, the pioneering study by Farrell et al. showed that bacteria of the OM can&#xD;
      discriminate PC patients from healthy subjects. Since then, few other studies have shown that&#xD;
      changes of the OM are independent risk factors for PC and that the OM of PC patients differs&#xD;
      than controls. The involved bacterial species are many and their role seems to be contrasting&#xD;
      on the basis of the study considered. Farrell et al. found that the combined adoption of&#xD;
      Neisseria elongata and Streptococcus mitis distinguished PC patients from healthy controls&#xD;
      (both showed low levels in PC patients, AUC of combined sensitivity 0.9), and that higher&#xD;
      levels of Granulicatella adiacens and Streptococcus Mitis distinguished PC patients from&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis ones. Torres et al. found a higher ratio of Leptotrichia to&#xD;
      Porphyromonas in PC patients. Fan et al. reported that Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella&#xD;
      intermedia, Alloprevotella and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are associated with a&#xD;
      higher risk of PC, whereas Fusobacteria and Leptotrichia were associated with a decreased&#xD;
      risk. Another study evaluating the diversity of OM in three groups of individuals (PC&#xD;
      patients, patients suffering from Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [a pancreatic&#xD;
      preneoplastic condition], and healthy controls), excluding current smokers and users of&#xD;
      antibiotics, found no differences in the OM, although patients with PC had a higher&#xD;
      proportion of Firmicutes compared with Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms (IPMNs) and&#xD;
      controls. Lastly, a recent study by Gaiser et al. showed that the cystic fluid of patients&#xD;
      submitted to surgery for IPMNs contained bacterial species that are commonly found in the&#xD;
      oral cavity, including, among the others, Granulicatella adiacens, Fusobacterium nucleatum.&#xD;
      These two, in particular, were higher in the cohort of individuals with IPMNs with high-grade&#xD;
      dysplasia, indicating a pivotal role in tumorigenesis(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regards PD, the first studies demonstrating an association between PD and PC date back to&#xD;
      the mid of 2000's, and they were confirmed afterward, even adjusting confounders such as&#xD;
      diabetes, pancreatitis, hyperlipemia, smoking or alcohol-related conditions. PD is strictly&#xD;
      connected to oral hygiene, that seems to be associated to an increased risk of PC. It is now&#xD;
      clear that PD can concur to development of PC in several ways, promoting chronic&#xD;
      inflammation, spreading continuously to distant organs (including pancreas) pro-tumorigenic&#xD;
      bacteria, or promoting a chronic alteration of the immune function that make the individual&#xD;
      more prone to develop a cancer.&#xD;
