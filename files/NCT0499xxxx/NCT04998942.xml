  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are now well-recognized risk factors for adverse&#xD;
      outcomes in the postpartum period and for development of future cardiovascular disease (CVD).&#xD;
      Postpartum BMI has emerged as a strong predictor of both short- and long-term blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) control in observational studies suggesting that earlier postpartum lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications may be instrumental in future CVD risk reduction in women with HDP. While such&#xD;
      lifestyle modifications are recognized as critical for postpartum health, implementation and&#xD;
      engagement of postpartum women remains a challenge as new mothers face greater barriers to&#xD;
      in-person care given childcare responsibilities. The proposed study will investigate the&#xD;
      acceptability of a virtual cardiac wellness program and its impact on weight, lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications, cardiometabolic health, patient engagement, and outcomes following HDP as&#xD;
      compared to the standard of care for postpartum women at Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this study, we are testing different strategies to help women keep their heart healthy after a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.&#xD;
Participants may or may not undergo some of the following study procedures:&#xD;
Complete surveys which could include topics related to activity, stress, nutrition, heart disease etc. with study staff via telephone or a secure online platform&#xD;
Be contacted by study staff once monthly to collect subjects' weight, blood pressure, whether they are breastfeeding, exercise routine, smoking status, and stress levels&#xD;
Meet with a nutritionist&#xD;
Meet with an exercise physiologist&#xD;
Participate in optional group sessions&#xD;
Receive infographics which could include topics such as mindful living and lifestyle, prevention of heart disease, nutrition, heart disease, etc.&#xD;
Arm assignment and a description of the arms will be disclosed to participants after study completion.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>In order to enable us to conduct a placebo-controlled study, we will not disclose to participants which intervention they have been assigned to. In order to obtain blinded data, incomplete disclosure is necessary to make the research scientifically valid and feasible. Unblinding subjects increases the risk that a favorable outcome is associated with the intervention simply because subjects are aware that they received an intervention and thus performing a placebo-controlled trial is necessary to determine the true effect of the intervention.</masking_description>
