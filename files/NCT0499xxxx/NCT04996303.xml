  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most severe form of interstitial lung disease. It is&#xD;
      known that the prognosis is poor due to extensive inflammation and fibrosis of the lung&#xD;
      parenchyma. In case of acute exacerbation, the prognosis becomes worse. In early studies, the&#xD;
      3-month mortality rate reached 50-80%, and in a recent study, the 1-month survival rate was&#xD;
      66%, and the 3-month survival rate was 41%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that 20% of patients with IPF will experience acute exacerbations in their&#xD;
      lifetime. The most commonly used treatment for such acute exacerbations is antibiotics and&#xD;
      high-dose steroids, or steroid pulse therapy. However, its effectiveness is unclear, and the&#xD;
      survival rate is still low. However, as there is no evident therapeutic agent other than&#xD;
      steroids, it is included in the treatment guidelines, so conservative treatment is&#xD;
      administered while steroids are administered to patients with acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in most upper institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no precise treatment other than steroids for patients with idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis-acute exacerbation, but the side effects of steroid administration cannot be&#xD;
      overlooked. Therefore, a study is needed to confirm whether steroid pulse therapy is&#xD;
      necessary or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Among patients with clinically or histologically confirmed idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
                fibrosis, patients who visited the emergency room with dyspnea symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients within 1 month of exacerbation of respiratory symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients with increased GGO or worsening of IPF on chest CT within the last 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who understand the purpose of the clinical study and voluntarily agree to&#xD;
                participate in this clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When it is determined that steroid administration is necessary under the judgment&#xD;
                of the medical staff during the treatment process&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients who complain of dyspnea symptoms due to causes other than the respiratory&#xD;
                system, such as fluid overload, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients whose respiratory symptoms have worsened for more than 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Persons who cannot read consent forms (eg. illiterate, foreigners, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design Using an open-label RCT randomization method, the administration will be&#xD;
           divided into Group 1 (high-dose followed by low-dose steroid administration) and Group 2&#xD;
           (high-dose/low-dose steroid administration after steroid pulse therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test group: Group 1 (high dose followed by low dose steroid administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control group: Group 2 (high-dose/low-dose steroid administration after steroid&#xD;
                pulse therapy) ▶ Steroid administration Protocol Group 1: Methylprednisolone 1&#xD;
                mg/kg 7 days → 0.5 mg/kg 7 days → 0.25 mg kg 7 days Group 2: Methylprednisolone 10&#xD;
                mg/Kg (500 mg ~ 1g) pulse 3 days -&gt; Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg 7 days → 0.5 mg/kg 7&#xD;
                days → 0.25 mg/kg 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The level of inflammatory markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Imaging improvement: chest x-ray or CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pulmonary function test: performed at the outpatient clinic before discharge or 12 weeks&#xD;
           after the first visit for acute exacerbation&#xD;
