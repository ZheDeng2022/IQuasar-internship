  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As in healthy term babies, the ideal food for preterm infants and sick term babies is breast&#xD;
      milk. There are many studies indicating that the composition of breast milk can vary from&#xD;
      mother to mother, according to the gestational week of the baby and gender. In new researches&#xD;
      on breast milk content; It is argued that breast milk is different during the day and at&#xD;
      night, that the micro and macro nutrient content, hormones and some enzymes show different&#xD;
      levels of secretion at different times of the day, and that breast milk has a circadian&#xD;
      rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled type. The study will be&#xD;
      carried out in order to evaluate the effect of Chronobiological Approach Nutrition Model&#xD;
      application on baby's growth parameters and discharge time in preterm babies hospitalized in&#xD;
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple randomization method will be used for the study and the babies will be divided into&#xD;
      intervention(n=40) and control groups(n=40). The research was carried out with 80 babies&#xD;
      followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The milk of the intervention group patients will be matched circadian and given to the&#xD;
      babies, the milk of the control group patients will be given without matching according to&#xD;
      the clinical routine practice. Demographic data, anthropometric measurements (weight, height,&#xD;
      head circumference of all babies will be recorded in the &quot;Baby Monitoring Form&quot; created by&#xD;
      the researcher.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Circadian fluctuations in breast milk content are very important in preterm infants fed with&#xD;
      expressed breast milk. The composition of breast milk varies throughout the day. In the&#xD;
      literature, there is no randomized controlled study suggesting that the breast milk of&#xD;
      infants fed with expressed milk should be matched to the baby circadian. In this study, it&#xD;
      was aimed to evaluate the effect of Chronobiological Approach Model application on preterm&#xD;
      infants growth parameters and discharge time in feeding of preterm infants hospitalized in&#xD;
      the neonatal intensive care unit . It is aimed to accelerate the growth of babies by making&#xD;
      circadian matching to breast milk in feeding preterm infants and to increase the quality of&#xD;
      nursing practices by reducing the length of hospital stay.&#xD;

    <description>Preterm infants in NICU are fed with breast milk and bottle. Although the date is written on expressed breast milk, it is usually not given by checking its suitability for the time of day. Experiment is about labeling breast milk by time of day before giving it to babies. There is no extra intervention during feeding. The breastmilk of the control group patients will be given without matching according to the clinical routine practice.&#xD;

Although the date is written on expressed breast milk, it is usually not given by checking its suitability for the time of day. The milk of the intervention group patients will be matched circadian and given to the babies. Intervention group's breast milk is labeling by time of day before the each feeding. In the intervention group, a label containing the time of expressed breastmilk will be affixed. Circadian matched milk will be provided at each feeding.&#xD;
intervention is;n the intervention group, a label containing the time of expressed breastmilk will be affixed. In the milk preparation room, breast milk will be stored in a separate refrigerator as 08:00-19:59 day milk and 20:00-07:59 night milk.&#xD;
