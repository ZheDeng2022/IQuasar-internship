  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency is a common state during the perioperative period. Data from literature do&#xD;
      not allow us to conclude on how perioperative iron deficiency influences postoperative&#xD;
      infections occurrence. This prospective observational study aims to assessed the&#xD;
      postoperative infections incidence according to the preoperative iron-stock status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative infections are one of the most common complication after surgery, involving 2&#xD;
      to 50% of patients according to series and representing 16% of healthcare associated&#xD;
      infections. Postoperative infections are highly morbid and result in a significant cost for&#xD;
      the society, by increasing the length of hospital stay for example. They also have an impact&#xD;
      on bacterial ecology because of the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to treat&#xD;
      nosocomial infection. The decrease of postoperative infections occurrence is a major public&#xD;
      health challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iron deficiency, with or without iron-deficiency anemia, is also very common during the&#xD;
      perioperative period. Its prevalence goes from 30 to 40% and even up to 60% when associated&#xD;
      with anemia. Iron deficiency is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality. Indeed,&#xD;
      iron is a mineral element essential for oxygen transport through hemoglobin, but also implied&#xD;
      in cellular metabolism by its role in the electron transport chain and in the citric acid&#xD;
      cycle in the mitochondrion. Hence, iron is essential for the proper functioning of the immune&#xD;
      system. Iron deficiency leads to an alteration of cellular immune defenses with a decrease in&#xD;
      neutrophils function secondary to reduced myeloperoxidase activity, an alteration of their&#xD;
      phagocytic capacity, a decrease in the number of T lymphocytes and a weaker response to&#xD;
      antigenic exposure, an alteration of Natural Killer lymphocytes activity and a lower&#xD;
      interleukine-2 production by lymphocytes. Thus, iron deficiency was associated with an&#xD;
      increased risk of sepsis in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to an old cohort published in 1988, a preoperative iron deficiency (defined by&#xD;
      ferritin ≤20 ng/L) on 448 patients who underwent abdominal surgery, was associated with an&#xD;
      increased in postoperative infections (23 vs 5 infections, p&lt;0,001) and with a longer&#xD;
      hospital stay (12±4 vs 8±3 days, p&lt;0,001). However, a recent prospective observational study&#xD;
      (2018), regarding orthopedic elective surgery, iron deficiency was not associated with an&#xD;
      increased perioperative morbidity nor mortality. The statistical power was limited (100&#xD;
      patients, whose 6 only with iron deficiency, postoperative infections are rare in elective&#xD;
      orthopedic surgery and assessed at day 30 instead of day 90 as recommended).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, data from literature do not allow us to conclude on how perioperative iron&#xD;
      deficiency influences postoperative infections occurrence. Yet, patients might benefit from&#xD;
      preoperative iron supplementation. The PREVENTT randomized controlled trial, published in&#xD;
      October 2020, studied the impact of intravenous iron supplementation before major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery for anemic patients. This trial found a statistically significant decrease in&#xD;
      hospital readmission in the treatment group and a downward trend in the occurrence of&#xD;
      postoperative infections. Similar results were highlighted in 2016 in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial comparing the fate of patients according to iron supplementation or not immediately&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those results invite to undertake further clinical studies to better characterize the impact&#xD;
      of iron deficiency and its correction on postoperative infections occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our first hypothesis is that preoperative iron deficiency would be associated with an&#xD;
      increased incidence of postoperative infections after major surgery and that its correction&#xD;
      would lessen this association.&#xD;

    <description>The main goal of this study is to compare the incidence of postoperative infectious complications according to the preoperative patient's iron-stock status (supplemented or not). The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one infection complication within 90 days after surgery.&#xD;
The various infections recorded are defined by the Center for disease control and prevention and included:&#xD;
superficial surgical site infection (within 30 days after surgery) or deep surgical site infection (within 30 days after surgery or 90 days if an implant is in place)&#xD;
pneumonia&#xD;
