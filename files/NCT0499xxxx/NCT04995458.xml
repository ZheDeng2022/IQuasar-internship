  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the present study are to analyze and to compare the survival rates and&#xD;
      possible biological and technical complications arising from the use of composite-ceramic&#xD;
      posterior implant-supported crowns with those obtained when using their counterparts prepared&#xD;
      using monolithic zirconia restorations. The null hypothesis is that no differences would be&#xD;
      found between the parameters studied for each type of restoration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eighty patients in need of posterior implant-supported crowns (n=80) were recruited from the&#xD;
      Master of Buccofacial Prostheses and Occlusion, Faculty of Odontology, University Complutense&#xD;
      of Madrid, Madrid, Spain. Before treatment, all participants were informed of the purpose of&#xD;
      the study, the clinical procedures, the material to be used, and the advantages and risks of&#xD;
      the restorations. They were asked to give their written informed consent to participate in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty posterior implant-supported crowns were produced and allocated in parallel an randomly&#xD;
      to either monolithic zirconia or composite-ceramic restorations by means of a randomization&#xD;
      list. A total of 40 implant-supported crowns were placed using monolithic zirconia and 40&#xD;
      composite-ceramic. The clinical procedures were performed by two experienced clinicians.&#xD;
      Full-arch impressions were taken using addition silicone. The restorations were cemented&#xD;
      using a resin-based cement. The occlusion was adjusted and the surfaces polished after&#xD;
      cementing. All restorations were prepared by an experienced technician. The restorations will&#xD;
      be examined at one week (baseline), 1, 2, and 3 years by two researchers who were not&#xD;
      involved in the restorative treatment. Each assessor evaluated the restoration independently,&#xD;
      and the worst assessment will be used in the event of discrepancies.&#xD;
