  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurses are a vital and central part of the health care system, accounting for nearly half of&#xD;
      the global health workforce and spending more time with patients than any other medical&#xD;
      professionals. Patient experience with nursing care, as a process indicator, reflects the&#xD;
      interpersonal aspects of care received and has an important impact on overall experience and&#xD;
      satisfaction with hospital care. The results of the previous study showed that the most&#xD;
      important predictor of patient satisfaction with hospitals was patient experiences with&#xD;
      nursing care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since nurses are so deeply and widely involved in patients' care, an instrument with a clear&#xD;
      conception definition, systematically developed and psychometrically validated will be&#xD;
      extremely valuable in measuring patient experience with nursing care, so as to collect and&#xD;
      analyze patient feedback toward nursing services, and push the quality improvement according&#xD;
      to the preferences, needs and values of the healthcare recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, therefore, aimed to develop construct and validate a comprehensive and internally&#xD;
      consistent instrument to measure patient experience with nursing care in the Chinese hospital&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
