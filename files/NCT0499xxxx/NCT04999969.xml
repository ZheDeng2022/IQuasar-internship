      The proposed study is designed to examine the effects of AZD0171 and durvalumab in&#xD;
      combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in patients with pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, single arm, multicentre study to assess the safety,&#xD;
      preliminary antitumour activity, immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK) of AZD0171 in combination with durvalumab and standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine&#xD;
      and nab-paclitaxel) in participants with first line (1L) metastatic pancreatic ductal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma (mPDAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent or another discontinuation criterion is met.&#xD;
