  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long COVID is a common outcome after infection with the SARS-COV-2 virus and the need for&#xD;
      treatment and ongoing support for people experiencing long COVID has been increasingly&#xD;
      recognised, including through the establishment of dedicated treatment units within the NHS.&#xD;
      While symptoms - and their severity - may vary greatly between individuals, some of the&#xD;
      common symptoms associated with long COVID include fatigue, breathlessness, pain and sleep&#xD;
      disturbances. In this study we will test the feasibility of a broad spectrum cannabidiol&#xD;
      dominant formulation (Medicabilis) for treating these symptoms in people with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      long COVID. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the primary non-psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, and it&#xD;
      is being increasingly used in the treatment of symptoms which are similar to those associated&#xD;
      with long COVID. Additionally, there is some evidence that cannabidiol may be effective in&#xD;
      reducing inflammation associated with COVID infection. Together, this evidence suggests that&#xD;
      it is possible that CBD may be an effective treatment for people diagnosed with long COVID.&#xD;
      We will therefore conduct a feasibility trial in which 30 people are prescribed CBD dominant&#xD;
      medical cannabis. Patients will take this medication daily for five months. We will collect&#xD;
      monthly self-report assessments of common symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue, mood,&#xD;
      cognition and pain and real-time data on heart rate, physical activity and sleep using&#xD;
      wearable technology. We will also collect daily self-report assessments of key symptoms&#xD;
      (mood, pain, fatigue and breathlessness) via a smartphone app. Our study will establish&#xD;
      whether it is feasibe to recruit and retain patients with a diagnosis of long-COVID into a&#xD;
      trial of CBD. We will also monitor whether there are any side effects to assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of medicinal cannabis. Our results will determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      medicinal cannabis in the treatment of long COVID and whether it is safe to use.&#xD;

    <description>Assessed by the C19-YRS (COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale). This includes: breathlessness, cough/ voice, swallowing/ nutrition, fatigue, continence, cognition, pain/discomfort, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, communication, mobility, personal care, activities of daily living, social role, perceived health status and family/carers views. The C19-YRS provides an overview of 3 outcomes: symptoms severity score, functional disability score and global health score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue, which has been identified as one of the core symptoms of long-COVID will be assessed using the nine item Fatigue Severity Scale (Krupp et al., 1989). This scale, which was initially designed for use in multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus has been used extensively across multiple disorders and has bene demonstrated to have good reliability and validity. Each of the nine items in this scale is assessed on a seven-point scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Thus, the composite scale ranges from 9 to 63 with higher ratings representing more severe fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The health-related quality of life instrument that will be used in this study is the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D; Devlin et al., 2017). It is a widely used, validated, and reliable tool that assesses the quality of life of patients in many disease areas through assessment of the severity of each of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (1-5): no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The digits for the five dimensions can be numerically summed into a single number, varying from 5 to 25 with higher numbers representing a lower quality of life. In addition, this measure contains a 100-point visual analogue which asks respondents to rate their current health with higher numbers representing better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF; Cleeland, 1989; Cleeland &amp; Ryan, 1994), a 9 item self-administered questionnaire, will be used to evaluate the severity of a patient's pain and the interference of this pain on the patient's daily feeling and functioning. The patient rates their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current treatments and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that pain interferes with general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and enjoyment of life on a 10-point scale. The BPI scale defines pain as follows: 1-4=Mild Pain, 5-6=Moderate Pain, 7-10=Severe Pain. Thus, a mean of the items can be presented with higher ratings representing more severe pain. In addition, the mean of the 7 items assessing interference, each rated on a scale from 0 to 10, will be used as a measure of mean pain interference with higher numbers representing more interference.</description>

    <measure>Mood/anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroneke et al., 2001) will be used to measure mood/ depression. It is a reliable and valid measure of depression severity and is comprised of a 9-item self-rated instrument that has been validated in general populations, medical populations and psychiatric samples.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using Pittsburg self-report questionnaires and wearable technology. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) includes a scoring key for calculating a patient's seven subscores, each of which can range from 0 to 3. The subscores are tallied, yielding a &quot;global&quot; score that can range from 0 to 21. A global score of 5 or more indicates poor sleep quality; the higher the score, the worse the quality. Mean ratings on this global score will be used in our analyses. Furthermore, the wearable technology (i.e. Fitbit) will provide the patients' time in light, deep and REM sleep, as well as a daily Sleep Score in the Fitbit app.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resting heart rate (expressed as average beats per minute)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The wearable technology will provide 24/7 heart rate tracking and heart rate variability. We will analyse mean resting heart rate (beats per minute) for each of the seven-day periods preceding assessments. Variation in the time between each heartbeat (heart rate variability) will also be assessed using the FitBit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity levels (number of daily steps, distance walked, stairs climbed, active minutes and calories burned)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Activity levels assessed via wearable technology. The wearable technology (i.e. Fitbit) tracks all-day activity including number of steps walked, distance walked (expressed in kilometres), floors climbed, active minutes and calories burned. We will analyse the seven-day mean number of daily steps, distance walked, stairs climbed, active minutes and calories burned for each 7-day assessment period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxygen saturation (expressed as percentage saturation)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation expressed as percentage saturation, with typical numbers being in the region of 95% will also be assessed via the FitBit. The seven-day average oxygen saturation will be calculated for each of the assessment periods.</description>
