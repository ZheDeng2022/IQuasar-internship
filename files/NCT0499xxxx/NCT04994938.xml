  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of older Veterans do not meet the minimum healthy diet or physical activity&#xD;
      recommendations, despite known benefits. Identifying novel ways to increase adherence to&#xD;
      rehabilitation programs that improve dietary quality and physical activity may reduce the&#xD;
      risk of disability in older Veterans. Peer-based interventions may be one method to&#xD;
      facilitate lasting behavioral change since peers often share a common culture and knowledge&#xD;
      about the problems that their community experiences. The investigators propose to develop and&#xD;
      evaluate a novel peer-led diet and exercise intervention that targets older Veterans with&#xD;
      multiple chronic health conditions. Successful development and pilot of this intervention&#xD;
      will provide the preliminary data for a larger multisite trial focused on the use of peer-led&#xD;
      interventions to improve long-term compliance to lifestyle interventions in older Veterans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the next ten years the share of Veterans age 65+ years will increase to over 50% of the&#xD;
      total Veteran population. The ability to safely maintain mobility with aging is critical.&#xD;
      Older Veterans with multiple chronic health conditions are more likely to experience mobility&#xD;
      decline and report reduced physical activity levels and poor dietary quality. While a&#xD;
      multitude of interventions have attempted to address poor diet and physical inactivity in&#xD;
      older adults; most have utilized resource-intensive professionally led diet OR exercise&#xD;
      interventions, and few have focused on the unique needs of older Veterans. Peer support&#xD;
      offers a potentially low-cost, easily scalable approach to encourage long-term dietary and&#xD;
      physical activity change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal the investigators seek to develop and pilot a 12-week peer-led lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention that targets older Veterans with multiple chronic health conditions and&#xD;
      dysmobility, in two diverse urban areas with a high percentage of underrepresented minority&#xD;
      Veteran populations (Baltimore, MD and San Antonio, TX). The investigators will develop a&#xD;
      theory-driven, peer-led nutrition and exercise intervention tailored for older Veterans with&#xD;
      dysmobility. The investigators will also determine the feasibility and acceptability of the&#xD;
      peer-led intervention as well as the estimated magnitude and potential impact on selected&#xD;
      outcomes (i.e diet quality and mobility) in older Veterans with dysmobility and multiple&#xD;
      chronic health conditions.&#xD;
