  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain is a common symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Up to&#xD;
      70 % of IBD patients experience pain when the disease is active. Even when patients with IBD&#xD;
      are in remission, 20-50 % experience ongoing pain. The precise mechanism of developing&#xD;
      chronic abdominal pain in patients with IBD in remission remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to identify psychophysiological and biological risk factors for the&#xD;
      development of chronic abdominal pain in patients with newly diagnosed IBD (ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis and Crohn's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 4 sections (Study 1A, 1B, 2, and 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1A: We perform a longitudinal study in 150 patients with new-onset IBD over 18 months&#xD;
      to identify risk factors related to the brain-gut axis for the development of chronic pain.&#xD;
      This is a collaborative study with IBD BioResourse Inception study. We administer online&#xD;
      questionnaires, collect stool and blood samples, and record heart rate. Other physiological&#xD;
      data collected by the Inception study will be also used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1B: This is also a collaborative study with the Inception study. We will apply for our&#xD;
      detailed questionnaires for 7 days (as per study 1A) to be administered to all the new&#xD;
      patients (n=450) that are included in the Inception study on a voluntary basis. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 and 3: Study 2 and 3 are a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study in patients with&#xD;
      IBD. The participants for study 2 are patients registered in IBD BOOST study and those for&#xD;
      study 3 are patients registered in IBD BioResource (but not in IBD Boost study). Detailed&#xD;
      online questionnaires will be administered to them. These studies are just one-day&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 4 sections (Study 1A, 1B, 2, and 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1A: We perform a longitudinal study in 150 patients with new-onset IBD (UC and CD) over&#xD;
      18 months to identify risk factors related to the brain-gut axis for the development of&#xD;
      chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First assessment period: On the first day of the study, we will have a video chat with the&#xD;
      participant using one of the telecommunications applications (e.g. skype, zoom, Microsoft&#xD;
      team, etc.) and obtain an electric consent form using DocuSign (https://www.docusign.co.uk/).&#xD;
      Then, participants will be trained on how to use online validated questionnaires to evaluate&#xD;
      their disease activity, symptoms and psychological state, presence or absence of irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS), or pain elsewhere. Then, they will be asked to download a mobile phone&#xD;
      camera heart rate variability app and be trained to use it. They will also be trained to use&#xD;
      the experience sampling method (ESM) to profile gut symptoms and lifestyle via a smartphone&#xD;
      app at 10 random times in a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After training, participants will fill out baseline online questionnaires using REDCap.&#xD;
      Participants will also start answering questionnaires by ESM for 7 days and recording their&#xD;
      heart rate (5 minutes) using the app once a day in the morning for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2nd-4th assessment periods: Further assessment periods will be scheduled every 6 months.&#xD;
      One-two days before each study period begins, we will remind the participants by email or&#xD;
      phone call. On day 1, participants fill out the same online questionnaires (except&#xD;
      personality, which is a stable trait) followed by 7 days ESM profiling as during their first&#xD;
      assessment period. They will also be asked to record heart rate (5 minutes) once a day in the&#xD;
      morning for 7days. Each patient will be followed at least 18 months until the 4th assessment&#xD;
      period ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients agree, we will add online questionnaires to patients beyond the life of the grant&#xD;
      (at 24 months and 36 months) when they are followed by the IBD BioResource inception study.&#xD;
      (ESM and sample collection are not performed after 18 months follow)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a collaborative study with the IBD BioResource Inception study. The participants in&#xD;
      our study will be asked to participate in the IBD BioResource Inception study as well.&#xD;
      Biological data obtained by the BioResource Inception study, which will be used for the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1B: This is also a collaborative study with the Inception study. Data for 600 patients&#xD;
      will still need to be collected by the Inception study when our study starts. We will apply&#xD;
      for our detailed questionnaires for 7 days (as per study 1A) to be administered to all the&#xD;
      new patients that are included in the Inception study on a voluntary basis. This will allow&#xD;
      us to capture data on almost 600 patients (150 of these will be from study 1A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using both our 150 studied patients from study1A and 450 patients in the Inception cohort&#xD;
      (study 1B), we will then use cutting edge techniques in machine learning to ascertain if&#xD;
      artificial intelligence (AI) can predict individuals who will develop chronic abdominal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2 and 3: Study 2 and 3 are a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study in patients with&#xD;
      IBD (both CD and UC patients). The participants for study 2 are patients who are registered&#xD;
      in IBD BOOST study and those for study 3 are patients who are registered in IBD BioResource&#xD;
      (but not in IBD Boost study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims are to determine the prevalence of chronic pain in Crohn's and UC patients, the&#xD;
      prevalence of comorbid pain and IBS, lifestyle factors, and quality of life. IBD BOOST&#xD;
      questionnaire is due to be administered to 10,000 patients. We will invite these patients to&#xD;
      complete additional questionnaires not covered by IBD BOOST. We also approach 15,000 patients&#xD;
      from IBD BioResourse who are not included in the IBD Boost study and administer&#xD;
      questionnaires to them. We will be able to identify risk factors and aid a predictive model&#xD;
      from static time point data if a number of those individuals have pain and a number do not.&#xD;
      Further, in study 2 and 3, we will be able to determine whether the risk factors identified&#xD;
      in study 1A and 1B accurately identify patients with and without chronic pain.&#xD;
