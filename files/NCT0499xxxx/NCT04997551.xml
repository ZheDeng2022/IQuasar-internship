      EC CORONACOLCHI is a multicenter, double-blind and randomized clinical trial with two&#xD;
      branches. Patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized 1: 1 to be included in one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental group: colchicine for 2 weeks orally at the doses described, added to the&#xD;
           standard treatment of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: placebo for 2 weeks orally added to standard COVID-19 treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Although the definition of respiratory distress usually includes a radiological criterion, as long as the oxygenation deficit is not attributable to another cause by the clinician, we do not consider it essential to perform a chest X-ray to confirm the diagnosis of distress because it does not correspond to clinical practice routine and the X-ray result does not change the patient's management.</description>
