      Summary Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has overtaken health systems worldwide, exceeding&#xD;
      the capacity of intensive care units. In addition to this, countries such as the United&#xD;
      States have reported a decrease in the supplies of drugs such as Propofol and Midazolam&#xD;
      (traditionally used as sedatives in patients with invasive mechanical ventilation), so in the&#xD;
      absence until now of a specific treatment against SARS-COV-2 virus, improving the support&#xD;
      strategies in patients in the severe spectrum of the disease Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome (ARDS) is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the global state of emergency due to COVID-19, the use of sevoflurane has the potential&#xD;
      to mitigate the shortages of sedative drugs, promote the recovery of patients with ARDS, and&#xD;
      potentially reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of sevoflurane as inhalation sedation in&#xD;
      patients with ARDS secondary to SARS-COV2 compared to the standard. The primary objective of&#xD;
      the study is to assess the difference in oxygenation, for which the calculation of the&#xD;
      partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration ratio (PaO2 /&#xD;
      FiO2) will be used at 24 and 48 hours. Also, the effect of the possible attenuation or&#xD;
      inhibition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction will be evaluated by hemodynamic monitoring&#xD;
      with a pulmonary artery catheter and transthoracic echocardiography and its possible effect&#xD;
      on the right ventricle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome: we expect an improvement in oxygenation and consequently a reduction in the days of&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation, stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital. In&#xD;
      addition to evaluating its possible anti-inflammatory effect and probably establishing a safe&#xD;
      and effective alternative and possibly with greater benefits compared to standard intravenous&#xD;
      sedation.&#xD;

      1. Background.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The lung is the main organ affected in the SARS-COV-2 virus infection, in an&#xD;
           observational study, it was reported that up to 42% of patients developed ARDS and of&#xD;
           these, up to 81% required intensive care treatment. The mortality reported at the&#xD;
           beginning of the pandemic for patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 was close to 90%,&#xD;
           however, a recent study places mortality at 32%, a figure that is related to that&#xD;
           reported for ARDS of other etiologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To date, few interventions have been shown to have an impact on the mortality of&#xD;
           patients with ARDS (of any etiology) in mechanical ventilation: judicious use of PEEP&#xD;
           (pressure at the end of expiration), ventilation with low tidal volume (6 ml/kg&#xD;
           predicted weight), limit plateau pressure (Pplt) to less than 30 cmH2O, maintain&#xD;
           alveolar conduction pressure (DP) &lt;15cmH2O and early use of ventilation in the prone&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of alveolar recruitment maneuvers and neuromuscular blockade, although&#xD;
           controversial, are widely used with variable impact on mortality. The use of VV ECMO&#xD;
           (Veno-venous configuration extracorporeal oxygenation membrane), ECCO2R (extracorporeal&#xD;
           carbon dioxide removal), and NO (nitric oxide) systems are limited by availability and&#xD;
           high cost with inconsistent results in mortality in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, the search for other cost-effective strategies for the treatment of ARDS has&#xD;
           led to the consideration in recent years of the use of other drugs such as volatile&#xD;
           anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Jabaudon et al. conducted a study of sedation with sevoflurane in patients with ARDS&#xD;
           where they documented an improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the first two days&#xD;
           compared with patients sedated with midazolam. It should be clarified that the study&#xD;
           showed no difference in mortality between the two groups however this can be attributed&#xD;
           to the number of subjects included (n = 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sevoflurane offers several advantages as a sedative agent in ARDS patients on mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation. They depress the ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia with a&#xD;
           dose and time-dependent effect. The response to hypoxia is altered from 0.1 MAC (minimum&#xD;
           alveolar concentration) of the halogenated agent and disappears above 1.1 MAC, with&#xD;
           moderate effects on hypercapnia. It is a potent bronchodilator that potentiates the&#xD;
           effect of neuromuscular blockers and has cardioprotective properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
           However, there are potential disadvantages of sevoflurane, depression of cardiac&#xD;
           contractile function has been observed in animal models, as well as dose-dependent&#xD;
           lusitropic alteration, and inhibition of the mechanisms that facilitate hypoxic&#xD;
           pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Currently, anti-inflammatory properties of sevoflurane have been documented in animal&#xD;
           models with ARDS, with a significant reduction of cytokines such as IL-1b (interleukin 1&#xD;
           beta), IL-6, IL-10, TNFa (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), TGF- b (transforming growth&#xD;
           factor-beta) among others. These findings were also corroborated in humans by Jabaudon&#xD;
           et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Justification. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic has overtaken health systems worldwide,&#xD;
           exceeding the capacity of intensive care units. In addition to this, countries such as&#xD;
           the United States have reported a decrease in the supplies of drugs such as Propofol and&#xD;
           Midazolam (traditionally used as sedatives in patients with invasive mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation), so in the absence until now of a specific treatment against SARS-COV-2&#xD;
           virus [36], improving the support strategies in patients in the severe spectrum of the&#xD;
           disease (ARDS) is a priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statement of the Problem. Experimental evidence in animal models and with humans reveal&#xD;
           the anti-inflammatory effect of sevoflurane at the pulmonary level with improvement in&#xD;
           oxygenation in the setting of adult respiratory distress syndrome regardless of its&#xD;
           etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the global state of emergency due to COVID-19, the use of sevoflurane has the&#xD;
           potential to mitigate the shortages of sedative drugs, promote the recovery of patients&#xD;
           with ARDS, and potentially reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Therefore, it is relevant to define the effect of sevoflurane on cardiac function,&#xD;
           especially on the right ventricle, as well as its ability to attenuate the hypoxic&#xD;
           vasoconstriction mechanism, since it would allow establishing its risk profile in this&#xD;
           population and standardizing its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Research Question. Can sevoflurane improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS secondary&#xD;
           to COVID-19 without significantly affecting the mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction or&#xD;
           right ventricular function?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Primary objective. To determine whether sedation with sevoflurane improves oxygenation&#xD;
           without producing significant changes in the mechanism of hypoxic vasoconstriction&#xD;
           (determined by changes in pulmonary vascular resistance) or in right ventricular&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5.1 Secondary objectives: Compare the effect on the pulmonary circulation of sevoflurane&#xD;
           against Propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compare the effect on the right ventricular function of sevoflurane versus Propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compare anti-inflammatory effect (determined by serum levels of IL-6, CRP, ferritin,&#xD;
           DHL) of sevoflurane against propofol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Hypothesis. Sevoflurane improves oxygenation in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19&#xD;
           without a significant impact on the mechanism of HVP and right ventricular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Patients and Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.1 Randomization Simple randomization will be carried out using an envelope containing&#xD;
           each sedative with 2 treatment groups, in total 11 patients will be placed in each&#xD;
           group. Considering 5% losses, by the formula: Sample adjusted to losses = n (1/1 - R) n&#xD;
           = number of subjects without losses R = expected proportion of losses A person outside&#xD;
           the study will place the indicated therapy inside identical opaque envelopes numbered 1&#xD;
           to 22 and then in a closed box. The investigators will use the envelopes consecutively&#xD;
           with the indicated therapy. Neither the researcher nor the people related to the study&#xD;
           or the treatment will know the therapy that each patient will receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
           7.2 Sample calculation: The investigators based the sample calculation on the article&#xD;
           published by Jabaudon and collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the formula for the difference of means: (Alpha). Sample size estimation for two&#xD;
           tails n=((Z1-β±Z1-α/2)2*σ)/((µ0-µ1))&#xD;
&#xD;
           Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Zα = value of z related to α = 0.05 (extracted from reference tables) Zβ = value of z&#xD;
           related to β = 0.20 (power of 80%). SD = standard deviation μ0 = group A mean µ1 = mean&#xD;
           of group B&#xD;
&#xD;
           According to the example, substituting the values. It would be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Zα = 1.96 Zβ = -0.84 SD = 2 µ0 = 205 ± 56 μ1 = 166 ± 59&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is necessary to include 39 patients in each group if it is desired to obtain 80%&#xD;
           statistical power with an error α of 0.05. If it is desired to achieve greater power,&#xD;
           i.e. 99% with an error α of 0.01, 107 should be included per group. To detect a mean&#xD;
           difference of -141, seeking to achieve that with the use of sevoflurane oxygenation&#xD;
           improves by using the PaO2/FIO2 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.1 Randomization. A person outside the research group will randomize the patients&#xD;
           through the simple selection of the two drugs, once their admission to the intensive&#xD;
           care unit is requested. The investigators will not carry out the blinding of the&#xD;
           researchers since the use of sevoflurane requires an external computer that cannot be&#xD;
           replicated for the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Definition of the maneuver to be performed. Experimental group: will receive&#xD;
           sedation with sevoflurane with an infusion rate to maintain MAC of 0.7 and fentanyl 1mcg&#xD;
           /kg/hour Control group: will receive sedation with Propofol at doses of 20-50mcg/kg/min&#xD;
           and fentanyl at doses of 1 to 2mcg/kg /hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For both groups, the doses will be titrated to maintain a RASS score between -3 to -4 in&#xD;
           both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both groups will receive cisatracurium as a continuous infusion of 3 to 5mcg / kg/min&#xD;
           for 48 hours. The investigators will maintain sedation for both groups with the same&#xD;
           scheme for 48 hours, after which the drugs used for sedation will be modified at the&#xD;
           discretion of the intensive care physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.2 Evaluation of Oxygenation. The primary objective of the study is to assess the&#xD;
           difference in oxygenation in both groups, for which the calculation of the PaO2 / FiO2&#xD;
           ratio will be used, taking peripheral arterial blood, with FiO2 at 100% one hour after&#xD;
           the start of sedation corresponding to each group, again at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.3 Effect on the mechanism of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a complex mechanism that responds to local&#xD;
           effects on oxygen depletion probably through precapillary alveolar vasoconstriction&#xD;
           mediated by intrinsic, sympathetic, and perhaps other humoral agents. Due to the&#xD;
           difficulty of studying this mechanism, the investigators will use surrogate methods. For&#xD;
           this purpose, the use of pulmonary vascular resistance is considered, which will&#xD;
           represent changes in pulmonary vascular tone and will be determined invasively through a&#xD;
           pulmonary arterial catheter (Swan-Ganz) for which the following formula will be used:&#xD;
&#xD;
           PVR=(MPAP-LAP)/CO Where PVR = pulmonary vascular resistance, MPAP = mean pulmonary&#xD;
           artery pressure, LAP = left atrial pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure and CO = cardiac&#xD;
           output.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The research group agreed to calculate the PVR using parameters obtained by the&#xD;
           Swan-Ganz catheter because it is the gold standard for the study of pulmonary&#xD;
           circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another surrogate method will be the shunt fraction, for which mixed venous blood (taken&#xD;
           from the pulmonary artery) and systemic arterial blood (taken from the radial artery)&#xD;
           with a FiO2 (inspired oxygen fraction) of 100% will be used. Alterations in the hypoxic&#xD;
           vasoconstriction mechanism will be reflected as an increase or decrease in the&#xD;
           short-circuit fraction, for the above, the following formula will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
           SCF=(CcO2-CaO2)/(CcO2-CvO2) Where SF = Shunt fraction, CcO2 = capillary oxygen content,&#xD;
           CaO2 = arterial oxygen content and CvO2 = venous oxygen content.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CcO2=1.34xHbx1+0.0031xPaO2 Where Hb = Hb concentration in g / dL, 1 represents 100%&#xD;
           saturation of hemoglobin at the level of the alveolar capillaries, 0.0031 is the oxygen&#xD;
           dilution constant in plasma and PaO2 is the peripheral arterial oxygen partial pressure&#xD;
           in mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CaO2=1.34xHbxSaO2+0.0031xPaO2 Where SaO2 is the peripheral arterial oxygen saturation&#xD;
           (numerical value) and paO2 is the peripheral arterial oxygen partial pressure in mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CvO2=1.34xHbxSvO2+0.0031xPvO2 Where SvO2 is the mixed venous oxygen saturation&#xD;
           (numerical value) and PvO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen at the venous level.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The shunt fraction was considered by the research group as another surrogate to evaluate&#xD;
           the phenomenon of hypoxemic pulmonary vasoconstriction, the inhibition of this would&#xD;
           produce an increase in the shunt fraction by allowing blood circulation through&#xD;
           non-ventilated alveoli. The shunt fraction will be recorded one hour after the start of&#xD;
           sedation corresponding to each group, again at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.4 Evaluation of right ventricular function. The investigators will assess the right&#xD;
           ventricular function by determining invasive parameters of the pulmonary artery&#xD;
           catheter. The investigators will measure parameters one hour after the start of sedation&#xD;
           for each group, again at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.5 Determination of the anti-inflammatory effect. The anti-inflammatory effect is&#xD;
           assessed with serum measurement of interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP),&#xD;
           ferritin, DHL (lactic dehydrogenase), taken by venipuncture on admission, at 24 and 48&#xD;
           hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.6 Measurement of dead space (DS). Quantitative lateral flow capnography will be&#xD;
           performed through a Carescape B450 multiparametric (General Electric, Finland).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The physiological dead space expressed as a percentage will be calculated using the Bohr&#xD;
           formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           DS=(PACO2-PEtCO2)/PACO2 Where DS = dead space, PaCO2 = partial pressure of arterial CO2&#xD;
           in mmHg, PEtCO2 = end tidal CO2 pressure in mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurements will be made one hour after the start of sedation for each group, again at&#xD;
           24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.7 Alveolar ventilation monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will measure the partial pressure of CO2 at the peripheral arterial&#xD;
           blood and the values will be recorded after the start of sedation corresponding to each&#xD;
           group, as well as at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.8 Mechanical Ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mechanical ventilation will be carried out with Mindray SV300 ventilators (Mindray,&#xD;
           China) for the case of the control groups, in the case of the experimental group, due to&#xD;
           the type of connection required for the activated carbon filter, Avea ventilators&#xD;
           (Carefusion, United States) will be used or Dräger Evita Infinity V500 (Dräger,&#xD;
           Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After intubation, the investigators will perform a staircase recruitment maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.8.1 Staircase recruitment maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pressure assist-control mode will be programmed with an inspiratory pressure of 15 cm&#xD;
           H2O, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, inspiration-expiration ratio (IRR) 1: 1,&#xD;
           FiO2 100% and PEEP of 25 cm H2O for 1 minute, then PEEP will be increased to 30 cmH2O&#xD;
           for 1 minute and finally, PEEP will increase to 35 cm H2O for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.8.2 PEEP titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the alveolar recruitment maneuver, PEEP will be titrated based on the best&#xD;
           compliance (descending fashion).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In assist-control mode by volume with decelerated flow (not all the ventilators used to&#xD;
           offer a continuous flow option), a volume of 6ml / kg of predicted weight will be&#xD;
           programmed with the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Men = 50 + [0.91 x (size in cm-152.4)] Women = 45.5 + [0.91 x (size in cm-152.4)]&#xD;
&#xD;
           The respiratory rate will be programmed at 20 breaths per minute with 1: 2 inspiration:&#xD;
           expiration (IRR) ratio, FiO2 100%, PEEP of 23cmH2O. The selected PEEP will be maintained&#xD;
           for 1 minute and lung compliance will be measured with an inspiratory pause of 3&#xD;
           seconds, which will be recorded, a total of 3 minutes will be completed with the&#xD;
           selected PEEP after which 3cmH2O will be decreased, repeating this process until the&#xD;
           best distensibility is obtained. The best static compliance, which will be recorded and&#xD;
           the PEEP will be programmed 2cmH2O over the PEEP in which the best compliance has been&#xD;
           obtained. Once the PEEP has been titrated, it will not be modified within 48 hours,&#xD;
           unless airway pressure targets are not maintained (alveolar conduction pressure or&#xD;
           plateau pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.8.3 Objectives of mechanical ventilation: Tidal volume ventilation calculated at 6ml /&#xD;
           kg predicted weight. Plateau pressure = or &lt;27 cmH2O Alveolar conduction pressure = or&#xD;
           &lt;14 cmH2O FiO2 to maintain SpO2 between 92 to 94% Arterial pH&gt; 7.25. Minimize Auto-PEEP&#xD;
           3.8.4 Measurements of lung mechanics and ventilation parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following measurements will be made through the ventilator software tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plateau pressure (Pplt) by applying a 3-second inspiratory pause.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alveolar driving pressure (DP): using the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           DP=Pplt-PEEP&#xD;
&#xD;
           Static compliance (Cest) = by the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cest=Tidal Volume/DP Airway resistance (Raw), which will be calculated using the&#xD;
           following formula. RVA=(Ppk-Pplt)/Flow Where Ppk is the peak pressure, Pplt is the&#xD;
           plateau pressure, and flow is the volume that enters the system during inspiration in&#xD;
           one second.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will record the minute volume and respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will record the measurement of Dp, Cest, and Pplt 1 hour after the&#xD;
           start of the corresponding sedation and again at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will document the average minute volume and respiratory rate on days 1&#xD;
           and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.8.5 Ventilation in the prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who, after 24 hours of the recruitment and PEEP titration maneuver, have a PaO2&#xD;
           / FiO2 ratio &lt;150mmHg will be candidates for ventilation in the prone position.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.9 Inhalation sedation The AnaConda device (Sedana Medical, Ireland) is placed between&#xD;
           the endotracheal tube and the ventilator circuit. The anesthetic infusion line is&#xD;
           attached to a syringe, from where the anesthetic (sevoflurane) will be delivered to said&#xD;
           device. The sample line will be taken to the anesthetic gas analyzer for MAC control&#xD;
           (End-expiratory concentration &quot;EEC&quot; of the anesthetic). The anesthetic gas outlet port&#xD;
           will be attached to the absorbent material container.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Filling the syringe and purging the infusion line: the infusion lines and sampling line&#xD;
           must be supplied by the manufacturer AnaConda since volatile anesthetics can dissolve&#xD;
           plastic materials. The syringes must be filled with the special adapter which is placed&#xD;
           on the anesthetic bottle, avoiding leaks to avoid environmental contamination. Since the&#xD;
           infusion line has a dead space of 1.2 ml in volume, a bolus will be programmed in the&#xD;
           infusion pump. Once the line has been purged, the infusion rate will be adjusted to the&#xD;
           minute volume or MAC of the anesthetic. The rate will be between 2 to 10 ml/hour or&#xD;
           until obtaining a MAC 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unwanted effects with the use of AnaConda:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Increased dead space (approximately 100 ml) Hemodynamic effects in case of overdose.&#xD;
           Effects of sevoflurane administration Drug Interactions with Sevoflurane. There is no&#xD;
           evidence of interaction with other drugs other than those indicated by the anesthetic&#xD;
           technical datasheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           8.10 Hemodynamic monitoring and pressure recording. Carescape B450 multiparametric&#xD;
           monitors (General Electric, Finland) will be used for the measurement and recording of&#xD;
           pressures, as well as standard transducers for the measurement of invasive pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A central venous catheter (triple-lumen) of 7 Fr and 20 cm in length (Teleflex, USA)&#xD;
           will be installed for all patients through left internal jugular access, as well as a 7&#xD;
           Fr Swan-Ganz type pulmonary artery catheter and 110 cm (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) using&#xD;
           11 cm long 8 Fr percutaneous introducers (Teleflex, USA) through the right internal&#xD;
           jugular vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For venous cannulation, a modified Seldinger technique will be used with ultrasound&#xD;
           guidance with a 5-10 MHz linear transducer L-38 (Fujifilm Sonosite Europe, The&#xD;
           Netherlands) with a Sonosite SII ultrasound device (Fujifilm Sonosite Europe, The&#xD;
           Netherlands). After the placement of the venous catheters, a portable chest X-ray will&#xD;
           be taken to confirm that these catheters have the usual position and rule out&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following measurements will be performed: pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic&#xD;
           pressure (PASP, PADP respectively), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery&#xD;
           occlusion pressure (PAOP), pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), systemic vascular&#xD;
           resistance (SVR), right ventricular stroke work (RVSW) and left ventricular work (LVSW).&#xD;
           Stroke volume (and cardiac output) will be computed using the thermodilution technique&#xD;
           averaging three consecutive injections with 10 ml of 0.9% saline solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Measurements will be made by two operators and will be recorded one hour after the start&#xD;
           of sedation for each group and at 24 and 48 hours. In the case of systolic, diastolic,&#xD;
           and mean pressure, the averages at 24 and 48 hours will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The record will be made one hour after the start of the sedation assigned to each group,&#xD;
           at 24 and 48 hours after the averages of the mean systemic arterial pressure.&#xD;
