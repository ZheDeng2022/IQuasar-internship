  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peanut ball use has become popular with midwives and nurses because it is an inexpensive,&#xD;
      nonpharmacological intervention that can help with positioning the patient to decrease labor&#xD;
      time. The peanut ball allows the patient to reposition her legs in a way that mimics&#xD;
      squatting and changes the diameter of the pelvis. This can aid in cervical dilatation and the&#xD;
      descent of the fetus. In turn, laboring down can decrease the time spent pushing and prevent&#xD;
      maternal exhaustion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the peanut ball compared to standard of care will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduce the time (in minutes) between administration of epidural and complete cervical&#xD;
           dilation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce pushing time as measured by duration of time pushing to the delivery of the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Decrease the rate of cesarean sections in nulliparous women&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control study. Each patient who meets the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      informed about the study within 12 hours of admission to the unit. When the participant is&#xD;
      alert and prior to administration of medicinal pain relief measures, the patient will be&#xD;
      asked to consent to be a participant. Basic admission demographic information will be&#xD;
      collected from the electronic medical record (EMR) and will be used to identify potential&#xD;
      subjects (inclusion/exclusion criteria). Recruitment will include a scripted informative&#xD;
      conversation with the potential subject along with an informed consent to further determine&#xD;
      eligibility and willingness to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peanut ball size will be determined by the patient weight indicated on the peanut ball&#xD;
      itself and compared with the patient's documented weight in the EMR. The ball will be&#xD;
      inflated prior to use and a pictorial introduction of how to use the peanut ball will be&#xD;
      shown to the study subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peanut ball use will be discontinued immediately prior to the delivery of the baby. The&#xD;
      study time will be documented and calculated for all subjects (treatment and control) from&#xD;
      the time of introduction of epidural analgesia to the delivery of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Peanut Ball manufactured by Clinton industries at graylinemedical.com is made&#xD;
      from durable, ribbed, heavy-walled, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) material, burst resistant,&#xD;
      deflate slowly if punctured, and latex free with non-slip grip ridges. It is available in&#xD;
      variable sizes ranging from 40 cm-70 cm in length. It is re-usable, after cleaning with&#xD;
      hospital grade wipes. It is recommended that the peanut balls should be protected from&#xD;
      sunlight and sharp objects.&#xD;
