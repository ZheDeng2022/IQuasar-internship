      The recently emerged coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARSCoV-2) is the newest threat to human health. It has already infected more than half a&#xD;
      million people worldwide, leading to a lot of deaths. Patients with Coronavirus Disease&#xD;
      2019(COVID-19) will experience high levels of anxiety and low sleep quality due to isolation&#xD;
      treatment. Purposes: Was to investigate the effect of aerobics and balancing exercises on&#xD;
      anxiety and dizziness in patients with COVID-19. Subjects: Thirty anxiety and dizziness&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 aged from 45-65 years of both sexes, randomly divided into two groups,&#xD;
      selected from outpatient clinic ,General&#xD;

      In December 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei,&#xD;
      China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia. Deep sequencing&#xD;
      analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named&#xD;
      2019 novel coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). On February 12, 2020, WHO officially named the&#xD;
      disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),and by March&#xD;
      11th, 2020 when the number of countries involved was 114, with more than 118,000 cases and&#xD;
      over 4000 deaths, the WHO declared the pandemic status&#xD;

    <description>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS for Windows, version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The P value is the degree of significant. A P value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be significant. Comparison between the mean values of different parameters in the two groups was performed using an unpaired t test. Comparison between pretreatment and post-treatment data in the same group was performed using a paired t test.</description>
