      Prospective monocentric quality of life study. Including all patients who have been exentered&#xD;
      at the Institut Curie Paris, from January 2004 to December 2019, proposing to compare the&#xD;
      reported quality of life of patients according to the reconstruction technique they have&#xD;
      undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor will evaluate the quality of life of our patients by means of two validated&#xD;
      questionnaires, in French, in the context of ENT surgery: the FACT-G and FACT-MBIS&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is now obvious to all surgeons involved in the follow-up of these patients that not all&#xD;
      orbital reconstruction techniques are equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, through this study, The investigators wish to objectively highlight the gain in quality&#xD;
      of life and prosthetic equipment in exentered patients, depending on the reconstruction&#xD;
      method used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study, including all patients who have been exentered at the Institut Curie&#xD;
      Paris, from January 2004 to December 2019, proposes to compare the reported quality of life&#xD;
      of patients according to the reconstruction technique patients have undergone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the quality of life of our patients by means of two validated&#xD;
      questionnaires, in French, in the context of ENT surgery: the FACT-G and FACT-MBIS&#xD;
      questionnaires. The investigators will submit them, after express telephone agreement, by&#xD;
      post to all the patients included in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of such a study will therefore be to provide assistance to both surgeons and patients&#xD;
      in the choice of an orbital reconstruction technique, by objectively demonstrating the&#xD;
      superiority of one technique over the others in terms of quality of life and prosthetic&#xD;
      equipment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study will have to answer two questionnaires, submitted by&#xD;
      post. This study therefore falls within the framework of minimal or moderate risk studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be informed by telephone interview about the method of writing the&#xD;
      questionnaires and their content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will pay particular attention to the quality of life of the patients who&#xD;
      have benefited from a free ante-brachial flap reconstruction in comparison with other&#xD;
      reconstruction techniques; this will constitute the main criterion of our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the collection of pseudo-anonymised computerised data from all the patient files&#xD;
      will give rise to a comparison of post-operative healing times, the rate of prosthetic&#xD;
      fitting, and the time taken to fit the prosthesis according to the reconstruction techniques.&#xD;
      These three factors, already identified in the literature as indicators of good&#xD;
      rehabilitationn , will constitute our secondary judgment criteria.&#xD;

The primary endpoint: Analysis of the quality of life score according to the reconstruction technique (free ante-brachial flap versus others) will be performed by a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.</description>
