  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide health system has been marked by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. French educational&#xD;
      system has been upset, especially medical schools, which, because of their hospital location,&#xD;
      are particularly exposed to the spread of the virus. The medical school of Paris-Saclay&#xD;
      University, located within bicetre University Hospital, AP-HP, must therefore adapt on a&#xD;
      daily basis to ensure educational continuity. Taking advantage of an exceptional scientific&#xD;
      ecosystem, innovative viral epidemic propagation modeling approaches based on both simulation&#xD;
      and contact tracing data will be tested in real-life conditions. These propagation models&#xD;
      will serve to scientifically optimize future educational organization procedures in this&#xD;
      medical school.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the participants will be equipped with individual wireless contact tracing technology.&#xD;
      Anonymised contact events will be automatically monitored for a period of two months to&#xD;
      measure the daily contact flow density between the students at medical school. Epidemic&#xD;
      simulation models will be enriched with these real contact tracing data to generate optimized&#xD;
      viral propagation probability networks. During the same period, CO2 measurement will be&#xD;
      performed in several relevant sectors (classrooms, amphitheaters, corridors etc) to allow a&#xD;
      more holistic understanding of the propagation conditions. Finally, the probabilistic models&#xD;
      will be confronted to the results of a two step COVID-19 screening campaign.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CO2 rate will be measured under very diverse conditions in terms of room size, number of people, type of ventilation. These systematic measurements together with the reading of precise conditions will allow us to establish a precise correspondence between the various factors and this rate. This should improve our understanding of the chains of contamination. and the circumstances that may have favored the spread of the disease.</description>
