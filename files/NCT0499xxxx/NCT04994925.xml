  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are public health concerns and there is a forecast rise in the&#xD;
      consumption of ready meals that are generally high in saturated fat and low in fibre.&#xD;
      Slimming World, a commercial weight management organisation has designed a range of ready&#xD;
      meals in line with their weight management programme, which advocates an unrestricted intake&#xD;
      of low energy dense food in order to aid in weight loss. Hence, it is valuable to understand&#xD;
      the satiating properties of ready meals in order to establish if specific ready meals can&#xD;
      enhance satiety and contribute to reducing subsequent energy intake. This study aims to&#xD;
      explore the effect of ready meals on short-term satiety and food intake among females with a&#xD;
      BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 26 female participants aged between 18-65 years attended Oxford Brookes Centre for&#xD;
      Nutrition and Health for two separate testing days. The study aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of energy matched ready meals (calorie-matched but differing quantities of protein&#xD;
      and fat) on appetite and subsequent energy and macronutrient intake. The ready meals (Control&#xD;
      = supermarket brand and Test = Slimming World) differed in energy density and macronutrient&#xD;
      composition, with satiety responses investigated in the studies. The participants consumed a&#xD;
      standard breakfast and four hours later consumed either a test ready meal (lasagne, higher&#xD;
      energy density) or the control ready meal (lower energy density). Four hours after lunch&#xD;
      participants food intake was measured during an ad libitum buffet tea. Additionally, satiety&#xD;
      measurements were recorded using visual analogue scales throughout and participants completed&#xD;
      a weighed food diary for the remainder of the test day.&#xD;
