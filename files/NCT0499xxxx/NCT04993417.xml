  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project was a Randomized clinical trial conducted to compare the effects of motor&#xD;
      imagery technique and mime therapy on facial expressions in facial palsy patients so that we&#xD;
      can have best treatment option for patients of facial palsy. Duration was of 6 months,&#xD;
      convenient sampling was done, subjects following eligibility criteria from Imran Idrees&#xD;
      Teaching hospital and Idrees Hospital Sialkot, were randomly allocated in two groups via&#xD;
      computer generated method, baseline assessment was done, MIT Group received motor imagery&#xD;
      technique, 45 min session (3 times a week for 3 months) plus the EMS (10-15 min), while the&#xD;
      MT Group received mime therapy 30-45 min session (3 times a week for 3 months) plus the EMS&#xD;
      (10-15 min). Outcome measures were collected for both groups at before treatment (T0) and at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment i-e after 3 months (T1). The outcome measures were severity of&#xD;
      paresis, facial symmetry and intensity of depression measured by using House-Brackmann Scale,&#xD;
      Sunnybrook Facial Grading System and Beck Depression Inventory Scale, respectively. Data was&#xD;
      analyzed by using SPSS version 24.0.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial palsy is due to the damage in the facial nerve that supplies the muscles of the face.&#xD;
      Peripheral facial nerve paralysis can have various causes, such as Bell's palsy, which is the&#xD;
      most common cause. Among secondary cause, tumors and the adverse effects of surgery for tumor&#xD;
      pathologies such as, acoustic neuroma and facial nerve schwannoma are the most prevalent. The&#xD;
      prognosis for FNP is complete recovery in roughly 80% of cases with Bell's palsy, whereas 15%&#xD;
      experiences some type of permanent nerve damage, with the remaining 5% enduring severe&#xD;
      sequelae. To this end, FNP should be treated in a multidisciplinary setting, in which&#xD;
      physical therapy, psychological and medical or surgical interventions are integrated. The&#xD;
      current study has compared the effects of motor imagery technique and mime therapy on facial&#xD;
      expressions in facial palsy patients. The current study was novel in a way that there is no&#xD;
      evidence of superiority of any rehabilitative treatment compared with another in the recovery&#xD;
      of FNP, which was clearly determined by the current study.&#xD;

    <measure>House-Brackmann Scale (HBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12th Week</time_frame>
    <description>House-Brackmann Facial Grading System comprises of six evaluations, where grade 1 addresses normal function and grade VI addresses complete loss of motion. It is quite possibly the most generally utilized scales and has been appeared to have great between rater reliability anyway its affectability to change in facial symmetry is low.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>SunnyBrook Facial Grading System is a 13 item evaluating scale. The framework estimates three segments of facial deviation; resting asymmetry, symmetry of voluntary activities and synkinesis. Resting lopsidedness of the eye, cheek and mouth are all things considered scored from 0 to 4 with 4 being the most uneven. Symmetry of the intentional movements; forehead wrinkle, delicate eye conclusion, open mouth grin, growl and lip pucker, are each scored from 0 to 3 with 3 being the most synkinetic, giving an all out scope of 0 to 15</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory Scale (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Week</time_frame>
    <description>The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory comprises of four proclamations that depict expanding powers of depressive symptoms and incorporates substantial and intellectual emotional manifestations, everything is isolated into a scale from 0 to 3, mirroring the patient's feelings in the past fourteen days. An absolute score of each of the 21 things are created; score of 14 or above is demonstrative of depressive indications. Depressive manifestations were sorted as, minimal-moderate (14-19), moderate-severe (20-29) and severe (30-63)</description>

    <description>All the subjects carried out the treatment process for a total of 3 months. During this treatment duration, the sessions were administered 3 times per week for 45 minutes, depending upon the subject's ability to focus and tiredness. The patients were mentioned to play out the emotional facial appearances for non-verbal correspondence i-e pleasure, misery, interest, appall, dread, irritation and shock. Patients were then requestedto envision himself winking, for instance, envisioning himself in a wonderful and natural social setting, at that point the patient cognitively addresses, with his eyes shut, the movement of decaying the recognized central issues, without creating any specific movement.</description>

During this treatment duration, the sessions were administered 3 times per week for 45 minutes, depending upon the subject's ability to focus and tiredness. Mime treatment incorporates self kneading of face and neck, breathing and relaxation works out, activities to synchronize the two sides and diminish synkinesis and for eye and lip closure per the myofascial way to deal with recovery, letter and word practices and expressive activities.</description>
