  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As population ages, geriatric patients with urinary tract cancer suffer from more&#xD;
      complications and functional decline that alter treatment plan despite advance in cancer&#xD;
      surgery. It was found that these urinary tract cancer survivors required a longer time to&#xD;
      recover to the state before the treatment, and some may be even unable to recover to the&#xD;
      state before the treatment. Exercise intervention has been found to be beneficial to improve&#xD;
      functional capacity for cancer survivors, such as breast cancer. However, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether exercise intervention could also improve functional recovery and mobility in patients&#xD;
      with urinary tract cancer following curative surgery, especially in older adults. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the effect of reconditioning exercise on morbidity,&#xD;
      oncological outcomes, and functional recovery in older adults with urinary tract cancer&#xD;
      following curative surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged over 65 years old and after having undergone curative surgery for confirmed&#xD;
      urinary tract cancer will be recruited. The participants will be assigned into two groups&#xD;
      using blocked randomization design. One group will receive reconditioning exercise training&#xD;
      for five consecutive days, and the other group will receive exercise education. Structured&#xD;
      questionnaire for comprehensive geriatric assessment and functional mobility, such as walking&#xD;
      performance, will be used to assess the training effect. Outcome measures are assessed&#xD;
      including major complication after surgeries, changes in functional status, tumor&#xD;
      progression, and length of survival. Physical function measurement will include hand grip,&#xD;
      muscle strength of lower extremities, and gait performance.&#xD;
