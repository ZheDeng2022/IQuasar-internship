      Single arm, prospective open-label study of a care model consisting of two components:&#xD;
      Component I aims to achieve high coverage of interventions to prevent maternal-to-child&#xD;
      transmission of hepatitis B virus: antenatal tenofovir, and timely newborn administration of&#xD;
      hepatitis B birth dose vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin; Component II aims to achieve&#xD;
      high coverage of screening, vaccination, and anti-viral therapy for HBV among household&#xD;
      members of women with chronic HBV infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 248 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV); and 75% of them live in Asia. Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) accounts for the&#xD;
      majority of chronic hepatitis B infections in Southeast Asia. Elimination of MTCT of HBV is&#xD;
      theoretically possible with a comprehensive suite of interventions that includes birth dose&#xD;
      vaccination, hepatitis B immune globulin, and antenatal antiviral therapy (e.g., tenofovir).&#xD;
      However, the ideal gestational age to initiate antenatal tenofovir remains undefined; and&#xD;
      evidence is lacking for implementation strategies capable of providing cost-effective,&#xD;
      equitable access to a comprehensive suite of interventions to prevent MTCT of HBV in&#xD;
      low-resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component I: Prevention of Vertical Transmission Pregnant women living in the study area will&#xD;
      be identified and screened for hepatitis B by a network of antenatal care (ANC) providers and&#xD;
      existing community outreach workers; HBsAg positive patients will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Consenting participants will provide serum samples to assess eligibility for&#xD;
      anti-viral therapy: creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT), platelet count, HCV, HIV. Pregnant women eligible for antiviral therapy according to&#xD;
      WHO criteria, or who have viral load (VL) &gt;200,000 IU/mL, will be treated with tenofovir&#xD;
      starting at 20 weeks gestation through 4 weeks postpartum. Hospital-based delivery will be&#xD;
      encouraged. All newborns, including those delivered at home, will receive the HBV birth dose&#xD;
      vaccine within 24 hours of delivery, and newborns of women on tenofovir treatment will also&#xD;
      receive Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin within 24 hours after delivery. Children will be linked to&#xD;
      routine immunization services in Myanmar to complete their HBV vaccination series (HBV is&#xD;
      co-formulated in a pentavalent vaccine). Maternal VL will be measured at delivery; infants&#xD;
      will be tested for hepatitis B infection at 24-28 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component II -- Household Screening and Treatment The household members of HBsAg positive&#xD;
      pregnant women who consent to participate in the study will be screened for HBV-related&#xD;
      immune status and chronic HBV infection. Non-immune individuals (HBsAb/Ag negative) will be&#xD;
      vaccinated; HBsAg positive household members will be assessed for treatment eligibility and&#xD;
      initiated on anti-viral therapy according to World Helath Organization guidelines. Eligible&#xD;
      household members will also be screened every six months for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&#xD;
      by liver ulatrasound and alpha-fetoprotein levels&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-depth interviews with approximately 30 HBsAg-positive women, 30 HBVsAg-negative women, and&#xD;
      20 household members of study participants will be conducted to assess barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators related to HBV testing and treatment. Approximately 15 key-informant interviews&#xD;
      with healthcare providers and community leaders will also be conducted. Sample size will&#xD;
      depend on data saturation and will be adjusted based on results of data analysis during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
