  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II interventional study evaluating the use of minimal residual disease by&#xD;
      next generation sequencing to defer autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHCT)&#xD;
      in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While AHCT is an important treatment strategy for patients with multiple myeloma, from a&#xD;
      safety standpoint, AHCT is associated with both acute toxicities that reduce quality of life&#xD;
      and long-term toxicities that may limit life expectancy for some patients. Additionally its&#xD;
      benefit in patients without evidence of minimal residual disease (MRD) is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to examine MRD response as a strategy to defer AHCT in a systematic manner.&#xD;
