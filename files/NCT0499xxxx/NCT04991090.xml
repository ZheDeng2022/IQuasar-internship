  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with lateral lymph node (LLN)&#xD;
      metastasis would be enrolled. The LLNs with short axis (SA) ≥ 5 mm are considered&#xD;
      metastatic.The safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy(nCRT) with a booster dose to 58Gy had&#xD;
      been initially demonstrated in our previous research. The effective and safety of dose&#xD;
      escalation of LLN in LARC patients, will be further verified in this prospective, clinical&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational clinical study for validation the efficiency and safety&#xD;
      of the dose escalation of LLN. Patients who have been pathologically diagnosed as rectal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma and defined as clinical T1-4N1-2M0 without distant metastasis will be enrolled&#xD;
      from the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Patients should have at least&#xD;
      one LLN metastasis defined on primary MRI, and the data of primary pelvic MRI will be&#xD;
      performed within two weeks before the beginning of enrollment. All patients should follow a&#xD;
      standard treatment protocol, including concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) with a&#xD;
      dose boost of LLNs to 58Gy, TME surgery with or without LLND ( lateral lymph node dissection)&#xD;
      and adjuvant chemotherapy. The regimen of chemotherapy and the way of operation should be&#xD;
      depended on the MDT(multiply discipline treatment) decision. The restaged MRI scan would be&#xD;
      performed 6-12 weeks after the last fraction of radiotherapy. The LLN response rate ( short&#xD;
      axis &lt; 5mm ) would be evaluated. This study is aimed to apply a new way to control LLN&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;

    <description>The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as gross disease determined on MRI scans. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the GTV plus areas considered at significant risk of harboring microscopic area. The lymph nodes (SA ≥ 5 mm) existed at the internal iliac and obturator would be delineated, named as GTVnd, and received a radiation dose boost. The planning target volume (PTV) was generated by adding an 8-mm margin around the GTV, GTVnd, and CTV in all directions. Doses of 58 Gy, 50 Gy, and 45 Gy were delivered to PTV-GTVnd, PTV-GTV, and PTV-CTV at 25 fractions, respectively. The dose of the normal organs at risk was constrained to the following criteria: bowel bag, V50 ≤ 5%; bladder, V50 ≤ 50%; femoral heads, V50 ≤ 5% .</description>
