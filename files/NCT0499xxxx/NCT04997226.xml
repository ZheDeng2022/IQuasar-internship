      According to the EC Special Report (www.ageconcern.org.uk), till 2030 it is expected ca. 40%&#xD;
      increase of population aged 66-79. Increasing population of elderly people in modern society&#xD;
      has suggested that more individuals are expected to suffer from cognitive deficits, as&#xD;
      chronological aging is usually accompanied by declined cognition, in particular memory&#xD;
      functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive decline reaches medical attention for about 5-25% of the elderly population&#xD;
      (over 65 years of age) as they suffer from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is usually&#xD;
      referred to as an intermediate phase between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging&#xD;
      and the pathological cognitive decline linked to dementia. In recent years, a new viewpoint&#xD;
      argues that substantial improvement in cognitive function may be possible even in older age,&#xD;
      using appropriately designed training programs. In our project we propose a potential&#xD;
      intervention that might delay the onset of dementia by maintaining cognitive performance in&#xD;
      general and improving in MCI in particular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach is to employ cognitive enhancement protocols, such as the combination of&#xD;
      non-invasive, low intensity electrical stimulation and memory training aiming to preserve and&#xD;
      ultimately improve cognitive abilities in MCI and healthy elderly.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with several physiological changes that affect global functioning, daily&#xD;
      activity and quality of life. For instance, cognitive functions progressively decline during&#xD;
      normal aging, as evidenced by decreased episodic memory and working memory (WM) performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above mentioned cognitive decline reaches medical attention for about 5-25% of the&#xD;
      elderly population (over 65 years of age) as they suffer from Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      (MCI). MCI is usually referred to as an intermediate phase between the expected cognitive&#xD;
      decline of normal aging and the pathological cognitive decline linked to dementia. Around 46%&#xD;
      of people with MCI develop dementia within three years, compared to 3% of the age-matched&#xD;
      population. According to Peterson's initial definition (Petersen, 2004), The selected&#xD;
      technique to improve cognition as we propose here is transcranial non invasive brain&#xD;
      stimulation (TES). We will employ a couple of these techniques of neuromodulation that have&#xD;
      proven to influence performance in different cognitive domains. Here we propose to combine&#xD;
      our expertise and to investigate the effects on cognition and health of brain&#xD;
      stimulation-based treatment in MCI patients compared to matched healthy controls, combine it&#xD;
      with cognitive training and explore the longer term effects of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The main objective of the proposed research is to explore the potential&#xD;
      intervention based on non-invasive brain stimulation and cognitive training to improve&#xD;
      cognition in the elderly. In particular we aim to explore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The immediate efficacy of various stimulation protocols with cognitive training on&#xD;
           cognitive improvement in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The long term effect of a selected stimulation protocol on MCI improvement in the&#xD;
           elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a large controlled study on cognitive stimulation for people with MCI, the&#xD;
      treatment proved effective in improving the functioning in several cognitive areas compared&#xD;
      to a control group (Ball, Berch, Helmers et al., 2002).The cognitive training in this study&#xD;
      included a computerized training, which is more enjoyable and effective than pencil-and paper&#xD;
      training due to its immediate feedback and engaging nature. In their systematic review of 26&#xD;
      studies on computerized cognitive training (CCT) for older people with known MCI, Hill et al.&#xD;
      (2016) concluded that CCT is an efficient tool for cognitive enhancement in older people with&#xD;
      MCI. The overall effect size on cognition score was moderate (Hedges' g=0.35); a large&#xD;
      significant effect size on working memory; and there were moderate significant effect sizes&#xD;
      for specific cognitive domains, such as verbal memory, non-verbal learning, attention and on&#xD;
      psychological functioning measures. In contrast, and consistent with findings of previous CCT&#xD;
      meta-analysis (Motter, Pimontel et al., 2016), there were insignificant results regarding&#xD;
      executive functions, processing speed and non-verbal memory. The results on dementia&#xD;
      patients, as opposed to MCI ones, were less optimistic: there was only a small but&#xD;
      statistically significant effect size of the overall efficacy of the CCT on cognition&#xD;
      enhancement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers have previous works that revealed an enhanced training effect when it was&#xD;
      combined with non-invasive brain stimulation, for example Lavidor reported better cognitive&#xD;
      control following training combined with Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      compared to training alone (Ditye et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a safe, low-cost, non-invasive&#xD;
      neurophysiological technique that consists in the application of mild (1-2 milliamper (mA))&#xD;
      electrical current on the scalp (Jacobson et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that tDCS, combined with cognitive stimulation, improves cognitive&#xD;
      functioning among healthy adult subjects. Specifically, tDCS to the prefrontal cortex has&#xD;
      been proved effective. Anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)&#xD;
      increases the performance on a working memory task in young healthy adults. In a combined&#xD;
      treatment of behavioral training and tDCS stimulation of ten sessions for 10 days, healthy&#xD;
      elderly subjects increased working memory skills for up to 28 days (Park et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS has also been proved efficient for people with AD or other types of dementia. In one&#xD;
      study, anodal tDCS was applied to both hemispheres of the temporal cortex in 30 minutes&#xD;
      sessions for five successive days. Results showed a significant improvement in a visual&#xD;
      recognition memory task. tDCS anodal stimulation of the Broca's region within the left&#xD;
      inferiorfrontal gyrus (IFG) had some positive effects on verbal fluency among patients with&#xD;
      MCI in a double-blind, crossover, sham-controlled stimulation study. Additional fMRI analysis&#xD;
      of these results indicated that there was also a reduction of compensatory upregulated&#xD;
      activity within the frontal cortices. Manenti et al. (2016) have used anodal tDCS combined&#xD;
      with physical therapies in MCI patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Following daily&#xD;
      administration of 2 mA stimulation for two weeks, subjects have improved their PD Cognitive&#xD;
      Rating Scale scores and their verbal fluency test, in comparison with the sham control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of using tDCS in combination with cognitive training is yet controversial. A&#xD;
      study on AD patients which used anodal tDCS to stimulate the left DLPFC in a name-face&#xD;
      association learning task, found no additional effect to the tDCS stimulation beyond that of&#xD;
      the behavioral training. In contrast to these findings, in a study of healthy subjects, the&#xD;
      combination of tDCS stimulation and simultaneous cognitive behavioral training has been&#xD;
      proved more effective than tDCS stimulation to the left DLPFC by itself (Martin, Liu, Alonzo&#xD;
      et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study (Andr√©, Heinrich, Kayser, Menzler et al., 2016), four sessions of anodal&#xD;
      tDCS stimulation over the left DLPFC, in combination with different cognitive tasks, were&#xD;
      applied to 21 patients with mild vascular dementia. There was a significant improvement up to&#xD;
      two weeks later in visual short term memory (in a pictures naming task), verbal working&#xD;
      memory (2-back task) and executive control (go/no go task) in the anodal stimulation group,&#xD;
      Yet, there are still some considerable limitations to the research on tDCS effects on&#xD;
      cognition and to its clinical applications. For instance, choosing the target area or network&#xD;
      is, of course, critical. Various target areas have been used in different studies: frontal&#xD;
      lobe, especially the DLPFC and the IFG, are natural candidates. Few studies have targeted the&#xD;
      inferior parietal lobe, which might require further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome some of the problems we will test another brain stimulation technique,&#xD;
      transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) where promising previous results suggest&#xD;
      that tACS over prefrontal areas might be a better tool to improve cognitive functions in the&#xD;
      elderly. tACS, a specific subtype of Non-invasive Brain Stimulation methods (NIBS), is based&#xD;
      on the application of low-intensity electrical currents oscillating sinusoidally at a&#xD;
      predetermined frequency (Antal et al., 2008). TACS-mediated physiological and behavioral&#xD;
      changes seems to be frequency-dependent, thus, tACS could interact with the on-going brain&#xD;
      activity through cortical oscillatory entrainment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since episodic memory decline is one of the most important markers of MCI, we will test brain&#xD;
      stimulation protocols that were found to affect different types of memory performance.&#xD;
      Possible effects of transcranially applied oscillating currents on memory functions have been&#xD;
      investigated on humans by using transcranial Slow Oscillation Stimulation (SO-tDCS; i.e.,&#xD;
      anodal transcranial direct current stimulation oscillating at 0.75 Hz in a trapezoid&#xD;
      waveform-fashion, applied bi-frontally) in combination with on-line EEG recording during slow&#xD;
      wave sleep (Marshall et al., 2006). Ripple-range oscillations in the hippocampus have also&#xD;
      been associated with declarative memory consolidation. The co-PI, Prof. Antal and her team&#xD;
      reported that bilateral 140 Hz tACS over both DLPFC during encoding may have a positive&#xD;
      effect on the consolidation of declarative material (Ambrus et al., 2015). Novel&#xD;
      cross-frequency protocols (theta-gamma coupling) of tACS affected spatial working memory&#xD;
      performance in humans: enhancement of working memory performance and increase of global&#xD;
      neocortical connectivity were observed when bursts of high gamma oscillations (80-100 Hz)&#xD;
      coincided with the peaks of the theta waves, whereas superimposition on the trough of the&#xD;
      theta wave and low gamma frequency protocols were ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sum, evidence from recent studies portray a promising picture of this new line of&#xD;
      research, suggesting that non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, in general, and tDCS and&#xD;
      tACS, in particular, may be used to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in patients in&#xD;
      pre-dementia. Though prospects seem promising, the mixed results and inconclusive findings of&#xD;
      several studies call for cautious. Hopefully, the proposed research will narrow the gap&#xD;
      between theoretical knowledge and the clinical applicability of the findings for the sake of&#xD;
      a treatment that can truly affect many people's lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach is to employ cognitive enhancement tools aiming to develop effective protocols&#xD;
      that will preserve (and ultimately improve) cognitive abilities in MCI and healthy elderly.&#xD;
      The main method are non-invasive brain stimulation tools, tDCS and tACS, combined with&#xD;
      computer-based cognitive training in a multiple session design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Registries:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject is met by the experimenters (PhD students) for 16 individual meetings. The&#xD;
      baseline measurements and cognitive evaluation that is manually conducted by the&#xD;
      experimenters is inserted and saved in local Excel files. The subjects' performance in the&#xD;
      computerized games (the cognitive training) is automatically saved on the lab's computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance: the completeness and accuracy of the training log files is checked after&#xD;
      every session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures - a paper file is prepared for each subject to keep background&#xD;
      and contact details, printed records of his/her performance in the memory evaluation tests&#xD;
      (at baseline, immediately after completing the intervention, and 3 months after completing&#xD;
      the intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size assessment: The sample size was a priori calculated using More Power software&#xD;
      (Campbell &amp; Thompson, 2012) based on the effect size reported for memory enhancement by&#xD;
      transcranial electrical stimulation by Jacobson et al. (2012) (d = 0.49). This established&#xD;
      that with a Œ± = 0.05, power = 0.95, 60 participants are necessary to detect a moderate-large&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis plan: data will be analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,&#xD;
      version 23 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). The main analysis is a mixed design analysis that&#xD;
      compares the experimental conditions (between subject factors) regarding their effect on&#xD;
      memory performance in 2 episodic memory tests and 3 time points (within subjects variables).&#xD;
      The cognitive status at baseline will serve as a covariate (the baseline scores). In&#xD;
      addition, we plan hierarchical regression to check how ongoing scores in the cognitive&#xD;
      training predict episodic memory score at the end of the intervention.&#xD;
