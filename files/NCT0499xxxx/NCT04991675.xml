    <textblock>
      The main aim of this pilot study was to examine the effect of diaphragmatic breathing&#xD;
      exercise on urinary incontinence treatment. The secondary purpose was to compare the effect&#xD;
      of pelvic floor muscle exercises and diaphragmatic breathing exercises on urinary&#xD;
      incontinence women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Participants were randomized into two groups: pelvic floor muscle exercises (Group&#xD;
      PFM n=20) and diaphragmatic breathing exercises (Group DB n=20). Exercise programs consisted&#xD;
      of 1 set of contractions per day and each set included 30 repetitions for 6 weeks. Women were&#xD;
      asked to complete forms of Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7) and the Urogenital&#xD;
      Distress Inventory (UDI-6), Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL), and Overactive Bladder&#xD;
      (OAB-V3) before starting the program and again at the end of the 6-week program. Changes from&#xD;
      baseline were compared in both groups and between the two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a chronic condition with involuntary urine loss. Urgency urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UUI) is a complaint of involuntary loss of urine associated with urgency;&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a complaint of involuntary urine leaks out on effort or&#xD;
      physical exertion including sporting activities, or on sneezing or coughing. In the mixed&#xD;
      type of urinary incontinence (MUI) complaints coexist both in stress and urgency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening condition, the feeling of discomfort&#xD;
      caused by constant wetness, irritation, and the fear of odor affects the daily and social&#xD;
      activities of in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdominal-pelvic cavity contains most of the internal organs, is bounded by the diaphragm&#xD;
      above, abdominal muscles anterior and lateral, thoracolumbar fascia and dorsal muscles in the&#xD;
      back, and pelvic floor in the lower part. The respiratory diaphragm forms the roof of the&#xD;
      abdomina-pelvic cavity and the pelvic floor forms the base. The diaphragm is the main&#xD;
      respiratory muscle, connected to the pelvic floor via the transversalis fascia. The pelvic&#xD;
      floor supports internal organs, as well as constrictor and continence mechanisms of the&#xD;
      urethral, anal and vaginal orifices in females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculofascial support is provided by the pelvic floor forms a hammock onto which the urethra&#xD;
      is compressed during increases in intra-abdominal pressure. When intraabdominal pressure&#xD;
      increases, intra-abdominal contents downward momentum is arrested by stretch resistance of&#xD;
      the pelvic floor structures. At this time, the proximal intraabdominal portion of the urethra&#xD;
      is compressed against the underlying supporting layer, which consists of the endopelvic&#xD;
      fascia, vagina, and pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscle (PFM) exercises, defined by Arnold H. Kegel, aims to regain support to&#xD;
      the urinary organs by actively functioning the pelvic floor muscles. Previous researches show&#xD;
      that PFM exercises are an effective treatment for UI and improve the quality of life (Qol) of&#xD;
      in women. It is currently used as the first choice in conservative treatment of incontinence.&#xD;
      However, PFM exercises may be encountered with some difficulties in order to understanding&#xD;
      and performing by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talas et al. showed that the pelvic floor moves in the craniocaudal direction parallel to the&#xD;
      diaphragm during respiration. In this study, they suggested that during expiration, the&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscles contract together with the abdominal muscles, pushing the abdominal&#xD;
      organs up, pushing the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to towards the diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators hypothesized that the patients can improve pelvic floor&#xD;
      function by performing DB exercises, indirectly via the facial and functional connection&#xD;
      between the diaphragm and PFM, and incontinence could be reduced.&#xD;
