  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the antibacterial effect and degree of postoperative pain&#xD;
      of single rotary and reciprocating file systems during endodontic therapy&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Introduction: Instrumentation kinematic is one of the many aspects of shaping files that&#xD;
      underwent heavy development through the last decade. The impact of the type of motion used to&#xD;
      drive shaping instruments was heavily studied but mostly in-vitro. More randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials are needed to achieve a reliable body of data concerning the issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of varying shaping files' kinematics on&#xD;
      bacterial reduction, post-operative pain and the incidence of flare-ups. Methods: Necrotic,&#xD;
      asymptomatic, single-rooted mandibular premolars with single canals were used in the study,&#xD;
      where 46 patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the first group, WaveOne Gold was&#xD;
      used for mechanical preparation while One Shape was used in the second group. Samples were&#xD;
      taken preoperatively (S1) and after chemomechanical preparation (S2). Bacterial reduction was&#xD;
      evaluated and compared between both groups via culturing technique and quantitative analysis&#xD;
      by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Post-operative pain and the incidence of&#xD;
      flare-ups were also evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) method.&#xD;
