  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to learn more about the day-to-day use of Iberogast in people who have&#xD;
      functional and motility-related gastrointestinal (stomach and bowel) diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional and motility-related stomach and bowel diseases are conditions in which the&#xD;
      functionality of the gut, mainly the gut muscles or the gut/brain axis is disturbed.&#xD;
      Functional and motility related stomach and bowel diseases cause symptoms like heartburn,&#xD;
      cramps and u pain of the upper and middle part of the belly, also known as functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia (FD), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS affects predominantly the lower&#xD;
      digestive system and causes symptoms like pain of the belly, cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to learn more about Iberogast, a plant-based treatment.&#xD;
      Iberogast is available to treat stomach and bowel diseases such as FD and IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies with Iberogast have shown how well it works and how it affects the body. But,&#xD;
      little is known about the day-to-day use of Iberogast and how satisfied patients are who take&#xD;
      it. So in this study, the researchers want to learn more about Iberogast including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how well it works in day-to-day use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how it affects the body, also referred to as tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how it is used day-to-day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how safe it is&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how satisfied patients are who take it&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, the researchers will collect information from pharmacies in&#xD;
      Germany. Patients who get Iberogast from these pharmacies to help treat their&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease will complete a questionnaire before, during and after taking&#xD;
      Iberogast. The researchers will use the results from the questionnaires to learn more about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the disease details of the patients who are taking Iberogast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the patients' symptoms while taking Iberogast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the patients' symptoms change after taking Iberogast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  how satisfied patients are with Iberogast&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if the patients had adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include patients in Germany who:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have functional stomach and bowel symptoms or disorders like FD or IBS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take Iberogast to treat symptoms of their stomach and bowel disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  are able to complete the questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no required tests or visits with a study doctor in this study. No treatments&#xD;
      will be given as part of this study. The researchers will review information collected from&#xD;
      patients who have decided for their own or by recommendation of their doctors or pharmacist&#xD;
      to take Iberogast. The researchers will collect the results from the patient questionnaires&#xD;
      from November 2017 to March 2018.&#xD;
