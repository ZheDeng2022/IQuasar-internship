      Does the presence of fellow pupils and parents improves a pupil's resistance to undergo a&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to control the outbreak of cluster infections on school during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic, regular rounds of collective nasopharyngeal swab testing were organized. However,&#xD;
      it is unclear under which circumstances nasopharyngeal swab testing is better accepted by&#xD;
      young children. Due to the closing of schools, and the different logistic situations in&#xD;
      schools, a natural pragmatic RCT formed. In some cases, children could observe their peers&#xD;
      before having their own test, while for others the view was blocked. Also, sometimes parents&#xD;
      would be present during a test procedure when the school was closed, while they were not&#xD;
      present when the school was open. To date, it is unclear whether these two variable elements&#xD;
      influence a child's resistance to be tested. Therefore a cluster-randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      with testing site as the unit of randomisation will be set-up. Four conditions will be&#xD;
      tested. On the individual level, the resistance of their peers before their own testing will&#xD;
      be taken into account. The aim of the study is to compare whether (1) the visibility of&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab testing on their peers and (2) the presence of their parents impacts a&#xD;
      child's resistance towards the test. Additionally, the impact of whether or not their peers&#xD;
      resisted the test impact predicts the likelihood of their own resisting behaviour.&#xD;
