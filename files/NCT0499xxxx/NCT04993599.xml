  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted for a mixed methods study. Subjects are 20 child patients and 20&#xD;
      their carers. First, Participants use and interact with a social robot. The robot is&#xD;
      controlled by researcher with the wizard of oz. method. The interaction is video-recorded for&#xD;
      the later analysis of the child's engagement through amount of his vocalization and&#xD;
      sentences. After using social robot, a survey and an in-depth interview will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the usability, satisfaction, emotion, and other dimensions of social&#xD;
      robots of pediatric patients and carers and evaluate the degree of interaction with them with&#xD;
      the recording data, survey and in-depth interview. This study is a basis for using social&#xD;
      robots to pediatric patients in the hospital environments.&#xD;

    <description>A quantitative study on the user experience using User Experience Questionnaire. The items have the form of a semantic differential, i.e. each item is represented by two terms with opposite meanings. The items are scaled from -3 to +3. Thus, -3 represents the most negative answer, 0 a neutral answer, and +3 the most positive answer.</description>
