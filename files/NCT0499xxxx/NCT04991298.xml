    <textblock>
      evaluate the efficacy of the intravenous formulation of fentanyl citrate administered orally&#xD;
      as a sedative premedication, we will compare it with oral midazolam, as a gold standard&#xD;
      premedication, in paediatric congenital cardiac surgeries&#xD;

      In this double-blinded randomized controlled study, after approval by the local ethics&#xD;
      committee, paediatric patients, aged 1 to 7 years, scheduled for elective surgical procedures&#xD;
      for correction of congenital heart disease will be enrolled. Patients with hepatic or renal&#xD;
      disorders, gastrointestinal tract disorders or malformation, conduction disorders, coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, emergency operations, mental disabilities, and known reactions to the drugs&#xD;
      to be used will be excluded. After assessing the patient for anaesthesia, informed consent of&#xD;
      patients about study and anaesthesia will be obtained.Children will be kept off solid food&#xD;
      for 6 hours and of clear fluids for 2 hours. The premedication will be administered orally&#xD;
      mixed with equal volume of 5% dextrose and using a 5-ml syringe, 30 minutes before admission&#xD;
      to operating room by a member of the nursing staff unaware of the group allocation, in the&#xD;
      preoperative holding area, in the presence of one parent. A randomized block design will be&#xD;
      used for allocation of patients into two groups (50 patients each); one group of patients&#xD;
      will receive midazolam (Group M) and the other will receive fentanyl (Group F) as a sedative&#xD;
      premedication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group M: patients will be premedicated with the undiluted IV formulation of Midazolam (5&#xD;
           mg/mL), 0.5 mg/kg up to 15 mg per patient. The dose is chosen to be similar to the dose&#xD;
           of midazolam used in other previous studies ().&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group F: patients will be premedicated with the undiluted IV formulation of fentanyl&#xD;
           citrate (50 µg/mL), 10 µg/kg up to 400 µg per patient. The dose is chosen to be similar&#xD;
           to the dose of OTFC used in other previous studies&#xD;
