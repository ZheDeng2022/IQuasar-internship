  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background &amp; Significance. Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) have experienced&#xD;
      improved postoperative survival shifting the focus away from minimizing mortality to&#xD;
      curtailing morbidities. Critical illness following cardiac surgery induces catabolism which&#xD;
      may impact functional status. Catabolism, a state in which protein breakdown exceeds protein&#xD;
      synthesis, can lead to lean body mass (LBM) breakdown. LBM loss has been associated with poor&#xD;
      clinical outcomes. Muscle ultrasound (mUS) has been utilized to measure LBM changes and the&#xD;
      functional status score (FSS) was developed to assess functional status changes in children&#xD;
      following hospitalization. The ability to identify LBM loss acutely and its association with&#xD;
      FSS changes may lead to earlier interventions to preserve LBM and aid in outcome prediction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims &amp; Hypotheses. Specific Aim 1 is to identify the percent change in LBM by mUS&#xD;
      during the first postoperative week in children following complex cardiac surgery. Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2 is to evaluate the relationship between percent change in LBM during the first&#xD;
      postoperative week and the FSS at discharge and 6 and 12-month follow-up in children with CHD&#xD;
      following complex cardiac surgery. The investigators hypothesize children with CHD following&#xD;
      complex cardiac surgery will experience a decline in LBM and that there is a direct&#xD;
      relationship between the change in LBM and postoperative FSS follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Methods. The investigators are conducting a single-center, prospective,&#xD;
      observational cohort study. Consecutive children (&gt; 3 months and &lt; 18 years of age) with CHD&#xD;
      undergoing biventricular conversion will be enrolled. Patients will undergo a baseline mUS&#xD;
      and FSS at the time of the index operation. Interval mUS will be obtained on the third and&#xD;
      seventh postoperative day. Discharge mUS and FSS will be obtained and a remote FSS will be&#xD;
      requested by the family at 6 and 12-months postoperatively. Demographics, pertinent&#xD;
      laboratory, concomitant medications, nutrition and ultrasound variables will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes. The primary outcomes will be change in LBM during the first postoperative week and&#xD;
      change in FSS at 6 and 12-month follow-up in children following complex cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Change in LBM will be defined as a percent change in cross-sectional area of the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle layer thickness (QMLT). Change in FSS will be significant if the score drops 3 points&#xD;
      or more from baseline at postoperative follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central objective of our single center, pilot study in children with CHD following&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is to identify serial changes in QMLT, as an estimate of LBM, during the&#xD;
      first postoperative week, and to examine its relationship to functional status, assessed by&#xD;
      FSS, after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1. To measure the percent change in QMLT by mUS during the first postoperative&#xD;
      week in children undergoing complex cardiac surgery. The investigators hypothesize children&#xD;
      undergoing complex cardiac surgery will have a mean decline of at least 10% in QMLT during&#xD;
      the first postoperative week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2. To examine the relationship between percent change in QMLT during the first&#xD;
      postoperative week and FSS at 3 and 6-months. The investigators hypothesize there is a direct&#xD;
      relationship between percent change in QMLT during the first postoperative week and FSS at 3&#xD;
      and 6-months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1. To explore the relationship between nitrogen balance, defined as the&#xD;
      difference between total nitrogen intake and total urinary nitrogen loss, and mean change in&#xD;
      QMLT during the first postoperative week. The investigators hypothesize there is a direct&#xD;
      correlation between nitrogen balance and mean change in QMLT during the first postoperative&#xD;
      week in children following complex cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed utilization of mUS to measure alterations in body composition during the acute&#xD;
      phase of critical illness may provide early prediction of subsequent functional status&#xD;
      decline.&#xD;
