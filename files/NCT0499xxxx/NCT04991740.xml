    <textblock>
      JNJ-78306358 is a bispecific antibody binding to CD3 on T cells and human leukocyte antigen G&#xD;
      (HLA-G) on cancer cells. The study consists of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a&#xD;
      post-treatment follow-up phase. Study evaluations include safety, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      biomarkers, immunogenicity, and efficacy (disease evaluations). The total study duration will&#xD;
      be up to 2 years 4 months.&#xD;

    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years and 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response (DOR) will be calculated among responders (PR or better) from the date of initial documentation of a response (PR or better) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease, as defined in the RECIST version 1.1 response criteria and GCIG CA 125 response criteria (for ovarian cancer participants only) or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
