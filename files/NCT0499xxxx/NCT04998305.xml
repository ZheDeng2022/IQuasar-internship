  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the safety and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      TJ-68 for improving muscle cramps in participants with ALS based on a two-site, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled double-blind multi-period crossover (N-of-1) study design.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Japan, TJ-68 is a common Kampo medicine prescribed by Japanese physicians to manage muscle&#xD;
      cramps or pain of diverse origins. In the USA, there are no effective medications to control&#xD;
      muscle cramps and no approved medications to specifically treat muscle cramps. Quinine&#xD;
      sulfate and Mexiletine have shown some effect with additional safety considerations. The fact&#xD;
      that TJ-68 has been commonly used for the treatment of muscle cramps in Japan and the lack of&#xD;
      available medications for cramps in ALS represent the fundamental rationale for this&#xD;
      proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1/2, two-site, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-period&#xD;
      crossover clinical trial for individuals with ALS and muscle cramps. Participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the study for 11 weeks and receive TJ-68, also known as Shakuyakukanzoto - a&#xD;
      kampo, herbal medicine - to assess its effect in relieving muscle cramps. This clinical trial&#xD;
      employs N-of-1 study design in which all participants will receive TJ-68 and placebo at&#xD;
      certain points, serving as their own controls.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (MCS-VAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>This is designed to measure improvements in muscle cramps. MCS-VAS indicates the level to which muscle cramps affect overall daily activity. The score ranges from 0 to 10; 0 indicates no interference and 10 indicates severe interference with overall daily activity. MCS-VAS will be administered by a trained evaluator to reduce recall bias and lack of insight, which can limit subjective assessments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in overall Muscle Cramp Scale (MCS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in trigger, frequency, severity, and location of muscle cramps will be measured by administering all of MCS questions. Motor behaviors which trigger muscle cramps and muscle cramps' effects on sleep quality will also be measured. The score for each component of MCS -- trigger, frequency, severity, location, behavior, and effect on sleep quality -- will range from 1 to 5, with the severity increasing from 1 to 5. All of the MCS components will be administered by a trained evaluator and evaluated by investigator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported cramp pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete weekly cramp diary and cramp pain scale. Cramp diary will assess frequency (0 to more than 10 cramps) and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of muscle cramps in various parts of the body (R/L leg, arm; torso; neck or above). Cramp pain will be measured on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating severe pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ALSFRS-R Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in functionality due to disease progression will be measured by administering ALSFRS-R to participants. ALSFRS-R includes 12 questions that can have a score of 0 to 4. A score of 0 on a question would indicate no function while a score of 4 would indicate full function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical Global Impression of Changes (CGIC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in participant's feelings since the start of dosing will measured by using a score of 1 to 7 with 1 indicating &quot;very much improved&quot; and 7 indicating &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ALSAQ-5 (Quality of Life Questionnaire) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in participants motor functions and resulting quality of life will be measured by asking questions about their ability to perform certain tasks or feelings of hopelessness within the last two weeks. Participants can answer by saying never, rarely, sometimes, often, or always/cannot do at all.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 5, Week 8 and Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>Participant and the evaluator will collaborate and establish a goal. Progression of goal achievement will be measured over the course of participation and scored from -2 to +2 with -2 indicating &quot;(achievement) much worse than expected&quot; and +2 indicating &quot;(achievement) much better than expected.&quot;</description>
