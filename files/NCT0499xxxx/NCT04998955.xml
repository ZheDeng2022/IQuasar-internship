    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of 10 weeks of maximal strength&#xD;
      training (MST) in patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease. As well as the effects of MST&#xD;
      on maximal strength, rate of force developement and quality of life in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) such as rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus have reduced strength and muscle mass in&#xD;
      the lower extremities compared to healthy control groups. This attenuation results in&#xD;
      impaired physical function and health-related quality-of-life. Maximum muscle strength is an&#xD;
      important indicator of total mortality, even when adjusted for cardiovascular health.&#xD;
      Therefore, international guidelines encourage strength training since it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that resistance exercise using moderate loads (â‰¤80% of one repetition maximum;&#xD;
      1RM) result in improved strength and function without worsening pain or disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial patients are randomized into either a maximal strength training (MST)&#xD;
      intervention group or a control group. The intervention period will last 10 weeks. The MST&#xD;
      group will perform two supervised MST sessions per week, on non-consecutive days, in a seated&#xD;
      horizontal leg press apparatus. The control group will continue with their existing activity&#xD;
      routines. One MST session consist of 4 series of 4 repetitions maximum (4RM) utilizing heavy&#xD;
      loads (~90 % of 1RM), separated by 3 minutes break and lasts approximately 15-20 minutes. The&#xD;
      MST intervention follows the principle of linear progression continuously adjusting the&#xD;
      resistance to achieve the targeted 4RM training load. The control group will be given&#xD;
      supervised introduction to effective strength training after the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this intervention is to evaluate the feasibility of the highly potent MST&#xD;
      intervention and its impact on 1RM, rate of force development (RFD) and quality of life in&#xD;
      the IRD patient population. MST has been documented to yield almost twice the increase in&#xD;
      both 1RM and RFD as conventional strength training performed with moderate resistance.&#xD;
      However, it is uncertain if MST is well tolerated by the IRD patient population which is&#xD;
      characterized by having pain, stiffness, and joint swelling. Before and after the training&#xD;
      period, identical testing (approximately 60 min) will be performed by both intervention&#xD;
      groups. The testing will include measurements of maximal oxygen uptake in an endurance test&#xD;
      as well as maximal muscle strength, recorded as 1RM, and dynamic RFD both carried out in a&#xD;
      horizontal leg press apparatus. Additionally, quality of life questionnaires will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
