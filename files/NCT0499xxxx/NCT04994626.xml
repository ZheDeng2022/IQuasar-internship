      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Ibrutinib Combined With&#xD;
      Rituximab in Relapsed Refractory MYD88 and CD79A/B (or CD79B Alone) DLBCL Who Have Received&#xD;
      at Least Two Prior Therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have found that about 30% of DLBCL have mutations in MYD88 and/or CD79A/B&#xD;
      genes. MYD88 and CD79A/B protein molecules belong to two signal transduction pathways, which&#xD;
      regulate B cell proliferation. Both MYD88 and CD79A/B gene mutations can abnormally activate&#xD;
      BTK located downstream of MYD88 and CD79A/B, leading to over activation and proliferation of&#xD;
      B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ibrutinib is the first generation of oral BTKi, which may theoretically inhibit the&#xD;
      tumorigenesis of DLBCL with abnormal BTK activation caused by mutations in MYD88 and CD79A/B&#xD;
      genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase II clinical study of ibrutinib monotherapy in the treatment of relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory DLBCL showed that the effective rate of ibutinib for single CD79B mutation was&#xD;
      55.5% (5/9 cases), and that for both CD79B and MYD88 mutations was 80% (4/5 cases). About 40&#xD;
      ~ 50% of primary central nervous system large B cell lymphoma (PCNSL) have CD79B and MYD88&#xD;
      mutations. A small sample study found that the overall response rate (ORR) for the treatment&#xD;
      of relapsed and refractory PCNSL with ibrutinib was 77% (10/13). An expanded sample study of&#xD;
      44 cases of PCNSL treated with ibrutinib found that the ORR is 52% and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) is 4.8 months. These results suggest that ibrutinib may be more effective in&#xD;
      DLBCL with MYD88 and CD79A/B or CD79B mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between mutations in MYD88 and CD79B and therapeutic sensitivity of&#xD;
      ibrutinib can not be simply categorized, because abnormalities in other genes of B cell&#xD;
      signaling pathway, such as CARD11, TNFAIP3, CXCR4, JAK1 and PIM1, may also affect the&#xD;
      efficacy of ibrutinib. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the gene&#xD;
      abnormalities of other B cell related signaling pathways, such as downstream signal of Bruton&#xD;
      kinase, CXCR, JAK-STAT, and NFKB, to find out the most effective group of DLBCL patients&#xD;
      treated with ibrutinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II, single-arm, open-label, multi-center clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in treating relapsed refractory MYD88 and&#xD;
      CD79A/B (or CD79B alone) DLBCL who have received at least two prior therapies. The study will&#xD;
      also explore the relationship between MYD88 and/or CD79A/B and efficacy, and detect the gene&#xD;
      abnormality by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and evaluate the relationship between other&#xD;
      gene abnormality and efficacy.&#xD;
