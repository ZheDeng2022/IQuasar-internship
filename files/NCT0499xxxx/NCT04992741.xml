  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is a single-blind, randomized, parallel-controlled experimental study designed&#xD;
      to determine the effect of Health Belief Model (SIM)-based motivational interviews given to&#xD;
      mothers of high school students on mothers' knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards HPV&#xD;
      vaccine. . The hypotheses of the research; The experimental group that received training and&#xD;
      motivational interviews within the framework of SIM had higher knowledge and perception of&#xD;
      HPV infection and vaccination in the posttest than the control group that did not receive any&#xD;
      application.&#xD;

      Methods: In order to determine the sample size of the study, it was planned to work with a&#xD;
      total of 54 patients, at least 27 patients in each group, in the power analysis performed by&#xD;
      taking the reference information of the statistician and previous studies, and the study was&#xD;
      completed with a total of 63 people (31 in the experimental group, 32 in the control group).&#xD;
      The Health Belief Model-based motivational interview will be conducted over the phone and&#xD;
      will last 15-20 minutes. One week after each motivational interview, a questionnaire and&#xD;
      scale form will be applied to the mothers. After the third meeting, the study will be&#xD;
      completed by applying the questionnaire and scale forms. Finally, the questionnaire for&#xD;
      measurement will be filled and the research will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will be subjected to routine processing without any intervention.&#xD;
      Questionnaire forms were applied to the control group simultaneously with the experimental&#xD;
      group. At the end of the study, a single-session motivational interview will be held by the&#xD;
      researcher, since the patients in the control group have equal ethical rights. The primary&#xD;
      result expected from the study is that mothers' perceptions of the benefit, sensitivity and&#xD;
      severity of HPV vaccine increase, and their perception of barriers decreases. The secondary&#xD;
      result expected from the study is the increase in mothers' knowledge about HPV infection and&#xD;
      vaccination. The tertiary expected outcome of the study is that the mother sees her daughter&#xD;
      at risk of HPV infection and decides to have her daughter vaccinated against HPV.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The two high schools included in the research will be determined as experimental and control groups by lottery method. By an independent researcher who was not involved in the study, 27 mothers from both schools who agreed to participate in the study will be selected by lottery method. Selected mothers will be called one by one by phone to be informed about the research, and the &quot;Informed Consent Form&quot; will be filled in via whatsapp and survey/scale forms will be applied. Participants will be blinded. The researcher (YA) cannot be blinded due to the nature of the research. When the research is completed, the data will be transferred to the computer environment by an independent researcher who does not know the A and B groups and the data will be analyzed by a statistician and the findings will be reported</masking_description>

    <measure>Primary Outcome Measures: Health Belief was assessed with the Health Belief Model Scale for Human Papilloma Virus Infection and Vaccination</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from before implementation, 1th week, 2th week and 3th week of practice</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed by Kim (2012) to measure health beliefs towards the HPV vaccine. The scale consists of 4 subscales: benefits (1-3 items), perceived disability (10-14 items), sensitivity (4-5 items), severity (6-9 items) and a total of 14 items. The scale items are interpreted as four-point likert type, with 1 as &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 as &quot;a little&quot;, 3 as &quot;quite a lot&quot;, and 4 as &quot;a lot&quot;. The total score range of the scale is 14-56. As the scale score increases, the perception also increases.</description>

    <description>The HPV knowledge scale was developed by Waller et al (2013) to measure the knowledge levels of individuals about HPV, HPV vaccine and screening tests. In the scale with a total of 33 items; It consists of four sub-dimensions: general HPV information (1-16 items), HPV screening test information (17-22 items), general HPV vaccine information (23-27 items) and information about the current HPV vaccination program (28-33 items). Participants are expected to mark each item of the scale as &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; and &quot;I don't know&quot;. In the evaluation phase, each correct answer is scored with=1, while incorrect answers and I don't know are scored with=0. In order to avoid bias in the answers, the correct and incorrect answers were mixed as in the original scale. The total score to be obtained from the scale is between 0-33, and a high score indicates a high level of knowledge about HPV, HPV screening tests and HPV vaccine.</description>

    <description>Health Belief Model Based Motivational Interview Group The application will be made by the researcher who has been trained in motivational interviewing techniques. Motivational interviews based on Health Belief Model will be made by telephone to mothers who have daughters studying in high school. There will be 3 interviews with mothers based on the benefits, barriers, sensitivity and severity perception structures of the Health Belief Model regarding HPV infection and vaccination, and each interview will last 15-20 minutes. One week after each interview, the questionnaire/scale forms will be sent via whatsapp and applied.</description>
