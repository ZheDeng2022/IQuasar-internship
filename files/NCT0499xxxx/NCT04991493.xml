  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post operative sore throat after general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation is a common&#xD;
      problem causing dissatisfaction and discomfort to the patients. The investigators want to&#xD;
      study the effect of tramadol on postoperative sore throat in general anesthesia with&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled study. Setting: Single-center university&#xD;
      hospital. Participants: The study included 168 patients undergoing thyroid surgery under&#xD;
      general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The patients were allocated randomly into the following 3 groups: the control&#xD;
      group: patients will be injected intravenously 5ml of normal saline 15 minutes before&#xD;
      anesthesia and another 5ml of normal saline was injected intravenously when the incision was&#xD;
      washed and sutured；the pre-tramadol group: patients will be injected intravenously 5ml of&#xD;
      tramadol (1mg / kg) 15 minutes before anesthesia and 5ml of normal saline was injected&#xD;
      intravenously when the incision was washed and sutured. the post-tramadol group: patients&#xD;
      will be injected intravenously 5ml of normal saline 15 minutes before anesthesia and 5ml of&#xD;
      tramadol (1mg / kg) was injected intravenously when the incision was washed and sutured.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, all patients will receive standard treatment.&#xD;
