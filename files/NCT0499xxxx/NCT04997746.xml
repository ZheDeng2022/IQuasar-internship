      INTRODUCTION: aging is the natural process of deterioration of the reserves of biological&#xD;
      systems, human beings are inherent to this process. The elderly population in Brazil grows&#xD;
      very quickly, this is due to the drop in fertility, mortality and increased life expectancy.&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: to promote the planning of guiding and educational actions based on the&#xD;
      qualification of the frailty of the elderly in the Basic Health Unit of the study through the&#xD;
      use of the Multidimensional Assessment of the Elderly in Primary Care (AMPI/AB) tool.&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY: an experimental, longitudinal, prospective and analytical study aimed at&#xD;
      approximately 20 pre-frail elderly people residing in a specific area of a Family Health Unit&#xD;
      in the city of Guarulhos/SP. A survey of data referring to the application of AMPI/AB carried&#xD;
      out in 2021 and classified as pre-fragile will be carried out, in order to later select them&#xD;
      for research. The participant will receive educational guidance on nutrition, use of&#xD;
      medications and nursing guidance as identified as needs. Three months after the intervention,&#xD;
      AMPI/AB will be applied in order to observe whether the pre-frail elderly remained or changed&#xD;
      category after the experimental multidisciplinary educational interventions.&#xD;

      Experimental, longitudinal, prospective and analytical study aimed at pre-frail elderly&#xD;
      people living in a specific area of a Family Health Unit in the city of Guarulhos/SP,&#xD;
      developed with the aim of qualifying the health care of the elderly population of the&#xD;
      territory of the Basic health Unit in 2021, using the Multidimensional Assessment of the&#xD;
      Elderly in Primary Care (MAE/PC questionnaire) as the main data collection instrument,&#xD;
      associated with the multidisciplinary educational intervention. Initially, a survey of data&#xD;
      referring to MAE/PC carried out in 2021 will be carried out during the routine of care by the&#xD;
      authors, in order to identify the elderly who were classified as pre-frail. Data referring to&#xD;
      healthy and frail elderly people will be used in the research in a descriptive (quantitative)&#xD;
      way. Participants will not be identified, data will be displayed in absolute numbers and&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The educational activities will be carried out through home visits and collection of&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements, at which time the Informed Consent Form will be offered to&#xD;
      authorize participation in the research. The reference participant and/or caregiver will&#xD;
      receive all the necessary information to consciously decide whether or not to participate in&#xD;
      the aforementioned research and is free to withdraw at any time, which will not harm any of&#xD;
      the parties involved. Participants will also receive educational guidance on nutrition,&#xD;
      medication use and nursing guidance as identified as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after the intervention, the MAE/PC questionnaire will be reapplied in order to&#xD;
      verify if the participant kept or changed his category after receiving the multidisciplinary&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;

The BMI for the elderly (LIPSCHITZ, 1994 apud TAVARES et al., 2015) determines underweight less than or equal to 22kg / m2, adequate or eutrophic weight between 22 and 27kg / m2 and overweight result greater than or equal to 27kg / m2 .</description>
