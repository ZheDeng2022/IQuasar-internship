    <textblock>
      T-cell exhaustion may limit long-term immunity in COVID-19 patients. T cells can lose their&#xD;
      ability to fight viruses and tumors when they have prolonged exposure to these enemies. New&#xD;
      data suggests people who experience mild COVID-19 symptoms show the molecular signs of&#xD;
      exhausted memory T cells and therefore could have a reduced ability to fight reinfection. On&#xD;
      contrary people who develop severe COVID-19 symptoms may be better protected from&#xD;
      reinfection. A recent study reported that the 82.1% of COVID-19 cases displayed low&#xD;
      circulating lymphocyte counts . It has been reported that, in the case of chronic viruses,&#xD;
      continuous PD-1 expression causes T-cell exhaustion, and impairs the ability of killing the&#xD;
      infectious cells . The adumbration of patients with COVID-19 is characterized by a diminished&#xD;
      lymphocyte percentage, with a similar proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. The quantity of&#xD;
      T-cells, mostly CD8+ T-cells, presenting high expression rates of late activity marker CD25&#xD;
      and exhaustion marker PD-1 increases. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 is able to make changes by&#xD;
      modifying the acquired immune system, including B and T cells. According to experiments,&#xD;
      PD-1's expression, as an important factor in the induction and maintenance of circumferential&#xD;
      tolerance keeping the stability of T-cells, has been found to have a higher percentage in&#xD;
      different cells of COVID-19 patients. In an experiment conducted by Diao et al., on the&#xD;
      patients with SARS-CoV-2, it was observed that the expression of PD-1 on the surface of&#xD;
      T-cells was increased significantly; it was also shown that during the SARS-CoV-2 -induced&#xD;
      disease, additional expressions of PD-1 and Tim-3 on the T-cells were directly related to the&#xD;
      disease's severity; the factors that were also increased in other viral infections. T cell&#xD;
      exhaustion&quot; phenomenon could be reversed relatively easily, for example when the T cells are&#xD;
      no longer exposed to the virus or tumor. But unfortunately, although exhausted T cells&#xD;
      recovered from chronic infection (REC-TEX) regain some function and features of memory T&#xD;
      cells (TMEM), they retain epigenetic scars indicating the control of gene expression is&#xD;
      &quot;locked in&quot; to their exhaustion history. Once T cells become exhausted, they remain&#xD;
      fundamentally 'wired' to be exhausted-thus it may be hard to get them to become effective&#xD;
      virus- and cancer-fighters again,&quot; said John Wherry, PhD, chair of the department of Systems&#xD;
      Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics and director of the Penn Institute of Immunology&#xD;
      in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, COVID-19&#xD;
      may infect T lymphocyte cells and induce apoptosis and apoptotic markers. Lymphocytopenia was&#xD;
      also found in the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases. MERS-CoV can directly infect&#xD;
      human primary T lymphocytes and induce T-cell apoptosis through extrinsic and intrinsic&#xD;
      apoptosis pathways, but it cannot replicate in T lymphocytes. However, it is unclear whether&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 can also infect T cells, resulting in lymphocytopenia. A study showed that T cells&#xD;
      express a very low expression level of hACE2 on its cell surface and T-cell lines were&#xD;
      significantly more sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with SARS-CoV . In other&#xD;
      words, these results tell us that T lymphocytes may be more permissive to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. Therefore, it is plausible that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 might mediate potent&#xD;
      infectivity, even on cells expressing low hACE2, which would, in turn, explain why the&#xD;
      transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is so high. Through recent advances in genomic editing, T&#xD;
      cells can now be successfully modified via CRISPR/Cas9 technology. For instance, engaging&#xD;
      (post-)transcriptional mechanisms to enhance T cell cytokine production, the retargeting of T&#xD;
      cell antigen specificity or rendering T cells refractive to inhibitory receptor signaling can&#xD;
      augment T cell effector function. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing might&#xD;
      provide novel strategies for inducing long term immunity against COVID-19.Immunotherapies&#xD;
      with autologous T cells have become a powerful treatment option for many diseases like viral&#xD;
      infection or cancer. These include the adoptive isolation and transfer of naturally-occurring&#xD;
      virus/tumor-specific T cells and the transfer of T lymphocytes that have been genetically&#xD;
      modified . According to the investigator, exhausted virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells will&#xD;
      be isolated from patients with mild infection using a modified antigen-reactive T cell&#xD;
      enrichment (ARTE) assay. exhausted virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells will be collected and&#xD;
      both Programmed cell death protein 1(PDCD1) gene and ACE2 gene will be knocked out by CRISPR&#xD;
      Cas9 in the laboratory. The lymphocytes will be selected and expanded ex vivo and infused&#xD;
      back into patients.&#xD;

      This study will assess the safety of PD-1 and ACE2 knockout engineered T cells as genetically&#xD;
      modified memory T cells capable of providing long-term immunity against COVID-19 by&#xD;
      remembering and killing the virus if it is reintroduced. Blood samples will also be collected&#xD;
      for research purposes. This is a dose-escalation study of ex-vivo knocked-out, expanded, and&#xD;
      selected PD-1 and ACE2 knockout-T cells from autologous origin. Patients are assigned to 1 of&#xD;
      3 treatment groups to determine the maximal tolerant dose. After the lower number of cycles&#xD;
      are considered tolerant, an arm of the next higher number of cycles will be open to next&#xD;
      patients. Biomarkers and immunological markers are collected and analyzed as well. According&#xD;
      to the investigator, exhausted virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells will be isolated from&#xD;
      patients with mild infection using a modified antigen-reactive T cell enrichment (ARTE)&#xD;
      assay. exhausted virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells will be collected and Programmed cell&#xD;
      death protein 1(PDCD1) gene and ACE2 gene will be knocked out by CRISPR Cas9 in the&#xD;
      laboratory (PD-1 and ACE2 Knockout T cells). The lymphocytes will be selected and expanded ex&#xD;
      vivo and infused back into patients. A total of 2 x 10^7/kg PD-1 and ACE2 Knockout T cells&#xD;
      will be infused in one cycle. Each cycle is divided into three administrations, with 20%&#xD;
      infused in the first administration, 30% in the second, and the remaining 50% in the third.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a total of two cycles of treatment.&#xD;
