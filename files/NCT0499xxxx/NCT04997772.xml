  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The entry of digitization into the world in recent years is helping the health care system to&#xD;
      operate more efficiently than in the past and has increased the participation of patients and&#xD;
      their families in managing their health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a rare disease, such as Gaucher disease, patient involvement through digital technology is&#xD;
      of great importance. Gaucher patients come for an inspection at the Gaucher unit once every&#xD;
      six months. However, medical events, related and unrelated to Gaucher, may occur between&#xD;
      these visits, some of which may be urgent. A digital Gaucher platform will allow for the&#xD;
      updating of medical events occurring in the patient between these visits and will allow&#xD;
      specialists to give up-to-date medical advice to the patient and the local doctor when&#xD;
      needed. The Gaucha Digital Platform will provide digital tools (and applications) for&#xD;
      self-management, monitoring and regular contact with the Gaucher Unit. The system will have&#xD;
      an alert system that will allow accessible communication between the patient and the Gaucher&#xD;
      unit. Moreover, patients with Gaucher disease need a lifelong commitment to their care;&#xD;
      Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate inhibitor therapy (SRT). When patients are&#xD;
      monitored only once or twice a year, monitoring adherence to treatment may be a problem.&#xD;
      Adherence to the treatment regimen is essential for achieving normalization. The system will&#xD;
      have a system of reminders for treatment and a system for monitoring the receipt of&#xD;
      treatment. The digital system will include quality of life questionnaires and pain&#xD;
      questionnaires that will help to more comprehensively understand the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a Gaucher-adapted digital platform will ensure the collection of all relevant&#xD;
      clinical data that is important for the treatment of a rare and multi-systemic disease such&#xD;
      as Gaucher disease. A complete database will make it possible to create an anonymous database&#xD;
      that will be used to find predictors of response to treatment, complications and commodities&#xD;
      associated with Gaucher disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      With quality outcomes and value, the watchwords for health care in the 21st century,&#xD;
      stakeholders around the globe are looking for innovative, cost-effective ways to deliver&#xD;
      patient-centered, technology-enabled &quot;smart&quot; healthcare, both inside and outside hospital&#xD;
      walls.The Digital transformation in health and care aims at supporting the management of&#xD;
      health and well being while empowering the participation of people and facilitating the&#xD;
      transformation of health and care services to more digitized, person-centered and&#xD;
      community-based care models, thereby enabling better access to healthcare and the&#xD;
      sustainability of health and care systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, the investigators see also an increase in the desire of patients themselves to play&#xD;
      an active role in their healthcare management. In rare disease, such as Gaucher Disease (GD),&#xD;
      patient engagement through a combined digital technology may have added importance. It is&#xD;
      recommended for patients with GD to be managed by a multidisciplinary team of experts having&#xD;
      long-term experience with the diverse clinical manifestations and potential GD-related or&#xD;
      unrelated co-morbidities, their follow-up visits at the center of excellence are usually on&#xD;
      an annual or semi-annual basis. However, disease-related and un-related medical events may&#xD;
      occur in-between these visits, some which may be emergent. A digital Gaucher platform will&#xD;
      enable updating medical events occurring to the patient in-between these visits and enable&#xD;
      the specialists to give updated medical consult to the patient and local physician when&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients with GD need a life-long commitment to their therapy; enzyme&#xD;
      replacement therapy (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT). The adherence to therapy&#xD;
      regimen is essential to achieve normalization. When patients are followed only once-twice a&#xD;
      year in a specialized clinic following the adherence to therapy might be a problem. A digital&#xD;
      Gaucher-platform will provide digital tools (and applications) for self-management,&#xD;
      adherence, and patient-reported outcome using a Gaucher-dedicated APP. Alert dashboard will&#xD;
      be developed and installed for the health professionals in order to enable accessible&#xD;
      communication between the patient and health professionals and be able to respond in a timely&#xD;
      manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-reported outcome (PRO) and Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are increasingly&#xD;
      important in research and clinical practice and to monitor the efficiency of health care&#xD;
      services. The use of PROMs is fundamental to ensure that what matters to patients is captured&#xD;
      in a valid, reliable, responsive, and feasible manner. A Digital Gaucher Platform can collect&#xD;
      GD-specific PROMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, a digital Gaucher platform will ensure capturing all relevant clinical data, full&#xD;
      data files, and complete missing data, important endeavor for the treatment of the individual&#xD;
      patients with a rare and multi-system disease such as GD. Data completion is essential for&#xD;
      the development of a database, agnostic to pharma companies or ways of treatment, with&#xD;
      high-quality real-time data. This database can then be used for big data analysis for finding&#xD;
      predictors for GD-related complications and commodities.&#xD;
