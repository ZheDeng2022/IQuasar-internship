    <textblock>
      There are limited treatment options for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) who failed to the combination therapy with targeted agents plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1.&#xD;
      Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) had shown potent antitumor effects in&#xD;
      single-centered studies when was used as first-line therapy. However, HAIC was not used as&#xD;
      second or third-line therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination therapy of anti-angiogenic agents and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies had shown&#xD;
      potent anti-tumor efficacy for unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However,&#xD;
      the treatment options were limited when patients were failed the combination therapies.&#xD;
      Hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) had shown potent anti-tumor efficacy with an&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile as a first-line treatment for patients with intermediated-stage or&#xD;
      advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of HAIC were used in the late-line setting, i.e., after the failure&#xD;
      of combination therapy with anti-angiogenic agents and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.&#xD;
