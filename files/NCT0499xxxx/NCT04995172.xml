  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether using a mobile-CT-assisted bronchoscopy (M-CAB) during a&#xD;
      bronchoscopy procedure will better enable the study staff to reach the lung tumor, perform a&#xD;
      biopsy, and obtain a diagnosis. One method that doctors use for diagnosing lung tumors is&#xD;
      bronchoscopy guided by an X-ray machine (called fluoroscope). Though much better guidance&#xD;
      could be provided with a CT scanner when compared to the fluoroscope, the standard CT&#xD;
      equipment is very large, fixed in a radiology room, and difficult to use with bronchoscopy.&#xD;
      Mobile CT imaging systems may more easily and effectively perform the same tasks of the&#xD;
      standard CT imaging in the bronchoscopy room, offering better guidance than the standard&#xD;
      fluoroscope.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the added value of mobile-CT)-assisted bronchoscopy (M-CAB) for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of peripheral lung nodules defined as the proportion of patients in whom bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) and 2-D Fluoroscopy is non-diagnostic (lesion&#xD;
      is not reached or rapid-onsite cytology is non-diagnostic) and diagnosis is obtained after&#xD;
      utilizing mobile-CT assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the navigational yield of bronchoscopy with RP-EBUS/2-dimensional (2-D)&#xD;
      fluoroscopy for peripheral nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy with RP-EBUS/2-D fluoroscopy for peripheral&#xD;
      nodules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the mobile-CT (M-CT) added navigational yield. IV. Describe the sensitivity for&#xD;
      malignancy of bronchoscopy with RP-EBUS/2-D fluoroscopy and its increase (if any) provided by&#xD;
      mobile-CT assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Describe anatomical and procedural characteristics that can influence navigational and&#xD;
      diagnostic yield (tumor location, tumor characteristics -solid, semisolid-, air-bronchus&#xD;
      sign, biopsy tool, relationship between biopsy tool/tumor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Describe procedure duration. VII. Describe time required to obtain mobile CT scans VIII.&#xD;
      Describe fluoroscopy time and estimate radiation dose to the patient. IX. Describe procedural&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo RP-EBUS bronchoscopy per standard of care. If the study staff cannot reach&#xD;
      the target lesion or is unable to determine a diagnosis, patients undergo bronchoscopy using&#xD;
      mobile CT imaging. Patients' medical records are also reviewed for up to 6 months.&#xD;
