  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Supaglutide injection in the treatment&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycemic control after metformin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes dosage determination (Phase IIb) and efficacy confirmation stage(Phase&#xD;
      III ). The primary outcome of the phase IIb period is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Supaglutide combined with metformin and to provide the recommended dosage for&#xD;
      the Phase 3 period after 12-week treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the Phase III period is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Supaglutide combined with metformin treatment after 24-week, double-blind treatment. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Supaglutide combined with&#xD;
      metformin during the 24-week, double-blinded plus 28-week, open-label treatment period.&#xD;

      This trial includes a 2-week screening period, a 4-week metformin titration and&#xD;
      dose-stabilization period, a 4-week induction period, a 24-week double-blind treatment period&#xD;
      and a 28-week open-label treatment period, followed by a 4-week follow-up period and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit. We calculated that the sample size would need to be 375, including 120&#xD;
      subjects in the period of Phase IIb and 255 subjects in the period of Phase III. During the&#xD;
      phase IIb period, subjects were randomly assigned to once-weekly subcutaneously injected&#xD;
      Supaglutide 1mg plus metformin, 3mg plus metformin and placebo plus metformin at a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the number of participants who have completed the 12-week follow up reached 120, interim&#xD;
      analyses will be performed and the results will be evaluated by Independent Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee experts to determine the recommended phase 3 dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the phase III stage, subjects were randomly assigned 1:1 to the &quot;recommended phase 3&#xD;
      dosage + metformin&quot; group and the &quot;placebo + metformin&quot; group.&#xD;

During the phase IIb, subjects were randomly assigned to Supaglutide 1mg + metformin, Supaglutide 3mg + metformin and placebo + metformin according to a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
When 120 subjects complete the 12 weeks of follow-up, Interim analysis will be performed and the results be evaluated by IDMC to confirm the RP3D dose.&#xD;
And then during the phase III, subjects were randomly assigned to Supaglutide RP3D + metformin, placebo + metformin group according to a 1:1 ratio.</intervention_model_description>
