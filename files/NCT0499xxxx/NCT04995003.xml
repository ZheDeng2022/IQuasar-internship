  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether it is safe to give HER2-CAR T cells in&#xD;
      combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug (pembrolizumab or nivolumab), to learn&#xD;
      what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another goal of this study is to study the bacteria found in the stool of patients with&#xD;
      sarcoma who are being treated with HER2 CAR T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs to&#xD;
      see if the types of bacteria influence how well the treatment works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells&#xD;
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to see if they can&#xD;
      put a new gene in these cells that will let the T cells recognize and kill sarcoma cells. The&#xD;
      new gene that the investigators will put in makes an antibody specific for HER2 (Human&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) that binds to sarcoma cells. In addition, it contains&#xD;
      CD28, which stimulated T cells and make them last longer. After this new gene is put into the&#xD;
      T cell, the T cell becomes known as a chimeric antigen receptor T cell or CAR T cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In another clinical study using these CAR T cells targeting HER2 as well as other studies&#xD;
      using CAR T cells, investigators found that giving chemotherapy before the T cell infusion&#xD;
      can improve the effect the T cells can have. Giving chemotherapy before a T cell infusion is&#xD;
      called lymphodepletion since the chemotherapy is specifically chosen to decrease the number&#xD;
      of lymphocytes in the body. Decreasing the number of the patient's lymphocytes first should&#xD;
      allow the infused T cells to expand in the body, and potentially kill cancer cells more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy used for lymphodepletion is a combination of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient receives the lymphodepletion chemotherapy and CAR T cells during treatment&#xD;
      on the study, they will receive an antibody drug called an immune checkpoint inhibitor,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that remove the brakes on&#xD;
      the immune system to allow it to act against cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will first be asked to give blood to make the HER2 CAR T cells. These cells are&#xD;
      grown and frozen for the patient. To get the HER2 antibody (and the CD28zeta) to attach to&#xD;
      the surface of the T-cell, investigators insert the antibody gene into the T-cell. This is&#xD;
      done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and will carry the&#xD;
      antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps the investigators find the T cells in&#xD;
      the patient's blood after they are injected. Because the patients in this study receive cells&#xD;
      with a new gene in them, they will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are&#xD;
      any long-term side effects of gene transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive cyclophosphamide for 2 days followed by fludarabine for 5 days before&#xD;
      receiving the HER2 CAR T cells. These chemotherapies may be given in the clinic or hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and HER2 CAR T cells will be given intravenously (through&#xD;
      a needle inserted into a vein or port-a-cath or another type of central venous line).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the patient receives the injection of HER2 CAR T cells, they may be given a dose of&#xD;
      Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) and Tylenol (Acetaminophen). The injection of T cells will take&#xD;
      between 1 and 10 minutes. Patients will be monitored in the clinic or hospital after the&#xD;
      injection for up to 4 hours. The treatment will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene&#xD;
      Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital. Patients will be follow ed in the clinic after the&#xD;
      T-cell injection and also by disease evaluations from their primary doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after the patient receives the HER2 CAR T cells,they will begin receiving an immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab every three weeks or nivolumab every two weeks . If the&#xD;
      patient experiences any immune side effects from treatment with the HER2 CAR T cells,&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab (or nivolumab) will be delayed until they have recovered from&#xD;
      those side effects. Pembrolizumab (or nivolumab) is given intravenously and at Texas&#xD;
      Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests before treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being treated, patients will receive a series of standard medical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, inflammation, kidney and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart function test (Echocardiogram)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by imaging studies that were used before to follow the tumor&#xD;
           such as Computer Tomogram (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), or Positron Emission&#xD;
           Tomography (PET/CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor has spread to the patient's bone marrow, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy&#xD;
           may also be used to measure the tumor in addition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-Ray to assess the lungs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical tests during and after treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive standard medical tests when they are getting the infusions and after:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exams&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests to measure blood cells, inflammation, kidney, and liver function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart function test (Echocardiogram) at 6 weeks after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of the tumor by imaging studies 6 weeks after the infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the tumor was previously detected in the bone marrow, bone marrow studies (bone&#xD;
           marrow aspiration and biopsy) will be performed 6 weeks after the infusion to follow the&#xD;
           tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about the way the HER2 CAR T cells are working and how long they last in the&#xD;
      body, an extra amount of blood, based on the patient's weight, up to a maximum of 60 ml (12&#xD;
      teaspoons) of blood will be taken on the day of the T-cell infusion, before and at the end of&#xD;
      the T-cell infusion, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months for 1&#xD;
      year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years. One additional blood&#xD;
      sample might be drawn 3 to 4 days after the T-cell infusion; this is optional. If the patient&#xD;
      develops fever or other inflammation following CAR T cell injection, additional blood samples&#xD;
      may be collected daily until the inflammation has resolved. For children, the total amount of&#xD;
      blood drawn will not be more than 3 ml (less than 1 teaspoon) per 1 kg of body weight on any&#xD;
      one day. This volume is considered safe but may be decreased if the patient is anemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the time points listed above, if the T cells are found in the patient's blood at a&#xD;
      certain amount an extra 5 ml of blood may need to be collected for additional testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform the bacteria studies on the patient's stool, the patient with provide a stool&#xD;
      sample during chemotherapy, after HER2 CAR T cell infusion, and after starting pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (or nivolumab) treatment, and at optional additional timepoints for up to 6 months after&#xD;
      treatment stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient received the prescribed treatment (lymphodepletion chemotherapy, HER2 CAR T&#xD;
      cells, and two doses of pembrolizumab or nivolumab) and tolerated the treatment well, they&#xD;
      can receive additional doses of the T cells at 6 to 12 weeks intervals and continue on&#xD;
      treatment with pembrolizumab or nivolumab if they wish for up to 12 weeks after the last T&#xD;
      cell infusion. After each T-cell infusion, the patient will be monitored as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient has a tumor biopsy performed any time while they are on study, a sample of&#xD;
      this will be used for research purposes (if a sample can be obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient develops a second abnormal growth, significant blood or nervous system&#xD;
      disorder during the trial, a biopsy sample of the tissue will be tested (if a sample can be&#xD;
      obtained).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive supportive care for acute or chronic toxicity, including blood&#xD;
      components or antibiotics, and other intervention as appropriate.&#xD;
