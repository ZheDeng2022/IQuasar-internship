  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the system of care in place, patients suffering from an alcohol use disorder (AUD)&#xD;
      continue to relapse after their detoxification. For about twenty years, neuromodulations and&#xD;
      their mechanisms have been investigated in research in order to apply it as a therapeutic&#xD;
      means, in particular direct current transcranial stimulation (tDCS). A first clinical trial&#xD;
      was carried out at Unit 72 Addictology at CHU Brugmann between 2017 and 2020 (ref: CE&#xD;
      2017/117), funded by the King Baudouin Foundation (ref: 2016-J1130650-206500) and then by the&#xD;
      Brugmann Foundation (fonds 2020-2021) (article in submission, pre-recorded:&#xD;
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03447054). This was a design with 2x2 conditions&#xD;
      combining 5 sessions of (A) tDCS on the CPFDL, with the anode on the right and the cathode on&#xD;
      the left (active 2mA vs sham 0mA) simultaneously with (B) inhibitory control training (ICT),&#xD;
      either alcohol specific ICT vs non-specific neutral ICT. This clinical trial has shown a&#xD;
      decrease in relapse two weeks after treatment, due (1) to the effectiveness of tDCS combined&#xD;
      with whatever specific or non-specific ICT, (2) all the more effective if tDCS is combined&#xD;
      with specific ICT aimed at reducing the tendency towards alcohol. However, no significant&#xD;
      reduction of craving, depression or improvement of working memory or inhibition performance&#xD;
      were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these results, questions remain unanswered: should tDCS be combined with ICT to be&#xD;
      effective? To answer this question, we are carrying out a new clinical trial of 5 sessions of&#xD;
      tDCS alone on the DLPFC (20 minutes, anode on the right, cathode on the left). This study&#xD;
      would follow the same tDCS configuration as the previous one and would take place in the same&#xD;
      multidisciplinary detoxification framework in order to be able to compare our data.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotheses: For patients with AUD five sessions of tDCS during a detoxification:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease the relapse rate 2 weeks after the treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease patient craving;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve depression and anxiety;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strengthen inhibitory capacities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context: This is a clinical trial that is part of an alcohol detoxification cure at Unit 72&#xD;
      Addictology of CHU Brugmann. The idea is to add a neuromodulation intervention to the initial&#xD;
      management, multidisciplinary and psycho-bio-social. This will be a randomized,&#xD;
      sham-controlled, single-blind study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 subjects will be recruited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      They will be randomly divided into two groups: the 'active' group (A) that will benefit from&#xD;
      tDCS stimulation and the 'sham' group (S).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history of epilepsy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have metal head implants that counter-indicate electrical stimulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosis of chronic psychotic disorder, schizophrenia or bipolar type 1 disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of alcohol or other illicit substances during the experiment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hair incompatible with neuromodulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary dependent variables :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse and total abstinence measured at several defined times: two weeks, one month, three&#xD;
      months, six months and one year after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Craving measured before and after each tDCS session via visual analog scales, such as&#xD;
           Likert -100 to +100, as well as the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) with 8 items.&#xD;
           Craving will also be measured in T1 and T2 through the Craving Experience Questionnaire&#xD;
           (CEQ);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptoms of depression with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and positive and&#xD;
           negative affectivity with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) measured at&#xD;
           T1 and T2;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anxiety trait in T1 and T2 with the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The working memory performance measured in T1 and T2 with the span reversed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhibitory control evaluated by performance at a Go/Nogo task and its event-related&#xD;
           potential (Nogo N2 and Nogo P3). This measurement will be carried out as part of a&#xD;
           clinical examination (cognitive and neurophysiological battery with an&#xD;
           electroencephalogram) offered to patients during their hospitalization at Unit 72. This&#xD;
           review will be conducted before and after the intervention (in T1 and T2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the questionnaires were in French version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metacognition items: At the end of the experiment, patients will be asked orally (1) Do you&#xD;
      think you are in the active tDCS group?, (2) Would you be interested in continuing this&#xD;
      intervention over a longer period of time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measurement: In order to respond to our primary assumptions about relapse, a logistic&#xD;
      regressions will be performed with the independent variable conditions (tDCS active scored 1&#xD;
      and tDCS sham scored -1) and the variable dependent relapse at each measurement (2 weeks, 1&#xD;
      month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year). A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be performed on&#xD;
      the number of days prior to relapse to compare the curves up to one year of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, in order to compare our two conditions to the four conditions of the previous study,&#xD;
      a logistic regression with linear polynomial contrasts (combined active tDCS with ICT &gt; tDCS&#xD;
      only &gt; tDCS sham) will be perform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures: In order to respond to our secondary assumptions about the variables&#xD;
      before and after the intervention, mixed repeated measures ANOVAs [Time (T1 vs. T2) x&#xD;
      Condition (tDCS active vs. tDCS sham)] will be perform.&#xD;

    <description>We compare 5 sessions of active tDCS alone vs. 5 sessions of tDCS combined with alcohol ICT vs.5 sessions of tDCS combined with neutral ICT vs. 5 sessions of sham tDCS to observe whether tDCS is better combined than alone to reduce early relapses (2-week follow-up). For all active and sham tDCS conditions there is 15-second ramping up and down and the session lasts 20 minutes. Patients are watching a documentary during the application of tDCS alone and there are two types of ICT combined with tDCS: one alcohol ICT (8 alcohol images associated to nogo response, 8 sport images associated to go response, 8 neutral images associated to nogo response and 8 neutral images associated to go response) and one neutral ICT (the same 16 neutral images).</description>
