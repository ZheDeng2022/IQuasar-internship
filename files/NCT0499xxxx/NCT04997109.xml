      This study assesses two active treatments in different sequences and a standard of care group&#xD;
      among infants with cerebral palsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder characterized by impairments of sensorimotor function&#xD;
      resulting from neural insults in the perinatal period. Every year almost 10,000 children are&#xD;
      born with CP in the US. CP incidence ranges from 2 to 3 per 1000 in North America, Australia,&#xD;
      and Europe and is difficult to estimate in the developing world. Intervention strategies to&#xD;
      promote function of children with CP must be adaptable to settings where resources or access&#xD;
      may be limited, yet simultaneously integrate best clinical evidence and neuroscientific&#xD;
      principles. Upper extremity (UE) impairments are present in a significant portion of children&#xD;
      with CP, some with hemiplegia (~25% children with CP), and others with quadriplegia, in which&#xD;
      one arm and hand may be more affected than the other (another ~25%). UE impairments in CP&#xD;
      result from a combination of motor and sensory dysfunctions including a lack of high-quality&#xD;
      motor experience, which combined with &quot;noisy&quot; (often faulty) sensory input, challenges the&#xD;
      acquisition of new effective motor patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the various approaches to improve UE function in infants with CP are constraint-induced&#xD;
      movement therapy (the use of constraints on less affected limbs) and bimanual therapy&#xD;
      (training of both extremities in coordination). Brief sessions of parent-delivered,&#xD;
      infant-initiated, goal-directed, success-motivated and repetitive activity in enriched&#xD;
      sensory environments can be effective, while respecting fundamental principles of infant&#xD;
      development and home life. Parent administration of the intervention helps preserve the&#xD;
      integrity of early parent-child relationships, critical to establishment of infants' sense of&#xD;
      self, safety, and independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, to take full advantage of neuroplasticity and maximize potential downstream&#xD;
      developmental effects, it is essential to intervene as early as possible in children with CP.&#xD;
      Promising new treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, robotic-assisted&#xD;
      movements and technology enhancements to movement feedback are in development. However, these&#xD;
      interventions require substantial investments of highly-skilled therapists, technology,&#xD;
      infrastructure and access to academic facilities. While they advance the cutting-edge of&#xD;
      motor intervention development, on another leading edge, parent-delivered therapist-directed&#xD;
      telehealth interventions are becoming more widespread, addressing a critical need for&#xD;
      lower-resource interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare systems resources are limited, and can be difficult to access due to geographic&#xD;
      and socioeconomic obstacles. While telehealth therapy seems eminently practical, and a&#xD;
      natural extension of current interventions for infants with CP, it faces its own scientific&#xD;
      challenges. The same essential attributes of physical therapy that make it so effective in&#xD;
      person can make it difficult to deliver via telehealth. Telehealth therapy in infants&#xD;
      requires a level of parent engagement, knowledge and parenting skills that is sometimes&#xD;
      lacking. Feasible telehealth interventions to improve function in infants with CP must also&#xD;
      address the challenges faced by their parents in conducting the sessions through effective&#xD;
      parenting supports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, infant participants with CP will be randomized to one of three treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The APPLES intervention via telehealth (APPLES-tele) followed by a parent-centered&#xD;
           approach (PCA) intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The PCA intervention followed by the APPLES-tele intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The standard of care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures will be standardized assessments of hand/arm function and validated&#xD;
      parent-report measures of infant motor activity.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley-4) Motor Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (after the first intervention), Week 12 (after the second intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley-4 instrument is a norm-referenced test assessing developmental delays in early childhood. The motor scale is comprised of 46 items assessing fine motor skills and 37 items assessing gross motor skills. Responses are provided on a 3-point scale where 0 = the skill is not present, 1 = the skill is emerging, and 2 = the skill is mastered. Total motor scores are normed with a standard score of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Scores below 100 indicate deficiencies with motor skills.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hand Assessment in Infants (HAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6 (after the first intervention), Week 12 (after the second intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAI is an assessment evaluating quality and frequency of hand abilities in infants 3 to 12 months corrected age using a semi-structured 12-15 min videotaped play session that is scored by a certified therapist. There are 12 unimanual and 5 bimanual items, each is scored on a 3-point rating scale, of 0, 1, or 2 points. Each hand receives a raw score based upon performance on the unimanual items. The raw score for the more affected hand will be reported as a continuous variable. Total raw scores for the unimanual items range from 0 to 24 and higher scores indicate greater ability.</description>

    <description>The APPLES-tele intervention is 5 weekly telehealth sessions of therapist-demonstrated tasks, delivered over a 6 week period. Infant participants wear a soft-constraint harness (C-Mitt) on their less affected arm for 6 hours per day, while their parent encourages them to use their more affected arm to reach for objects with a &quot;sticky-mitt&quot;. As the infant experiences success, heavier objects are provided. During times when the C-Mitt is not worn, parents engage therapist-demonstrated bimanual play of increasing difficulty.</description>

    <description>The PCA support intervention is 5 weekly telehealth sessions delivered over a 6 week period. The PCA curriculum includes 5 basic principles of positive parenting from Triple P: ensuring a safe engaging environment, creating a positive learning environment, using assertive discipline, having reasonable expectations, and looking after yourself as a parent. All of these elements, when taught to parents in an individualized manner, can help promote responsivity, structure and expectations that are tailored to their child's condition and developmental stage. In addition, a curriculum of CP-specific knowledge will address the challenges unique to parents of children with CP, such as understanding principles of infant learning of new movements, challenges and solutions for self-directed activity in infants with CP.</description>
