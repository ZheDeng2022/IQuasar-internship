  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      [Background] Hyperinflation caused by increased airflow limitation and emphysema change&#xD;
      commonly accompanies dyspnea, which leads to inactivity, reducing exercise capacity, and&#xD;
      deconditioning. Hyperinflation in COPD is also associated with decreased left and right&#xD;
      end-diastolic volume and stroke volume, and cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies investigated effects of ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA versus placebo on cardiac&#xD;
      function in patients with COPD and lung hyperinflation. However, there are not evidences for&#xD;
      effects of LABA/LAMA on cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is an exercise stress test with concomitant expired&#xD;
      gas analysis, which provides objective parameters of functional capacity. Since CPET can&#xD;
      assess integrated exercise responses of cardiopulmonary, vascular, and skeletomuscular&#xD;
      systems, it can reveal abnormalities that are not apparent in a resting state. Moreover,&#xD;
      change in oxygen consumption during exercise and anaerobic threshold can be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to investigate change in cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity via&#xD;
      CPET before and after tiotropium/olodaterol inhalation in COPD patients with hyperinflation,&#xD;
      which is the first clinical study. Association between change in cardio-pulmonary exercise&#xD;
      capacity with function of heart and lung would be further evaluated with cardiac magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (CMR) and lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in investigators expect to enhance cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity though the&#xD;
      improvement in cardiac and pulmonary function with tiotropium/olodaterol inhalation. This&#xD;
      result would provide evidence to encourage to treat with dual bronchodilators in COPD&#xD;
      patients with hyperinflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Study objectives] To investigate and compare the bronchodilator effect of&#xD;
      tiotropium/olodaterol on cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity in hyperinflated COPD patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Study design] Prospective, single-center, one-arm clinical study After using the&#xD;
      tiotropium/olodaterol inhaler for 4weeks, the investigators will compare pre- and post-&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary exercise capacity, cardiac function, lung function, symptoms and quality of&#xD;
      life&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Statistic methods] For continuous variables, data will be presented as median, minimum,&#xD;
      maximum with standard deviation (95% confidence intervals). For categorical variables, data&#xD;
      will be presented as percentage (95% confidence intervals). Paired t-test for continuous&#xD;
      variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables will be performed to compare the&#xD;
      difference in results before and after inhalation of the tiotropium/olodaterol inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study; therefore, sample size cannot be calculated by power analysis, because&#xD;
      of the absence of any data in the literature that could be reviewed. A sample size is&#xD;
      expected to be 40 patients. When the drop-out rate 10% is considered, final sample size is&#xD;
      expected to be 44.&#xD;
