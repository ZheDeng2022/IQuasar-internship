  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory viruses pose a permanent threat to humans and society as demonstrated by the&#xD;
      current Covid-19 pandemic. Novel drugs and vaccines provide a means for controlling illness.&#xD;
      Infections and symptomatic presentation of illness may be reduced, but it remains to be&#xD;
      determined to which extent viral shedding and transmission (e.g. by silent transmitters) can&#xD;
      be controlled. Lack of such activity may result in continuing viral spread by assumed healthy&#xD;
      but asymptomatic spreaders. Echinacea is an established and readily-accessible product with&#xD;
      demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity (including coronaviruses). This study aims to&#xD;
      estimate the potential of different Echinacea formulations (head-to-head) to reduce&#xD;
      concentration infectivity and shedding of SARS-CoV-2 under in vivo conditions.&#xD;
