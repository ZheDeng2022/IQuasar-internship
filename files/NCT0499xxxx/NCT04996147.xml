  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common cancer. Most cases are&#xD;
      diagnosed in locally advanced stages, with treatment involving multimodal approach with&#xD;
      combinations of radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy. The aggressive nature of HNSCCs and&#xD;
      treatment modalities are associated with important acute and late toxicities that often&#xD;
      promote temporary or definitive treatment interruption and may compromised the capability to&#xD;
      tolerate subsequent treatments. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the acute and&#xD;
      long-term impact of cancer treatment on quality of life, physical and cognitive function of&#xD;
      HNSCC patients diagnosed with a locally advanced disease.&#xD;

      Potential cases will be identified at the multidisciplinary head and neck group meeting. If&#xD;
      the case meets eligibility an informed consent will be presented to the patient. Interested&#xD;
      participants will be scheduled for baseline assessment before the beginning of treatment&#xD;
      (M0). At the end of CRT patients will be submitted to a second assessment (M1). Follow-up&#xD;
      assessments will occur 16th to 18th weeks after the treatment is completed (M2). Patients&#xD;
      proposed to surgery or induction chemotherapy will also be submitted to an additional&#xD;
      assessment before the beginning of CRT (Mc / Mic).&#xD;
