  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NDV-HXP-S is an inactivated COVID-19 vectored-vaccine virus using the Newcastle Disease Virus&#xD;
      as basis and expressing S protein from SARS-CoV-2 stabilized in pre-fusion form with Hexapro&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine was successfully tested in non-clinical study with a good safety profile and&#xD;
      eliciting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Clinical testing is conducted by an&#xD;
      international consortium including three different manufacturers. Butantan, in Brazil, is one&#xD;
      of them.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present protocol aims, stepwise, to respond to several regulatory requirements to advance&#xD;
      the clinical development of the product through a controlled, randomized, adaptive, adult&#xD;
      clinical trial in stages. The results of the first stage, or Stage A, allow us to base the&#xD;
      decision to move between two alternatives, called Alternative 1 and Alternative 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These alternatives guide on the progression or not of the clinical development of the product&#xD;
      generated with the parental strain. In Alternative 1, the parental vaccine will continue its&#xD;
      development if verified. In Alternative 2, the parental vaccine will be discontinued and a&#xD;
      variant-based vaccine will be selected to continue development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If Alternative 1 is followed, the parental vaccine will be compared directly against an&#xD;
      active vaccine control in Stage B1 and in Stage C1 an additional evaluation of a&#xD;
      variant-based vaccine will be made. However, Alternative 2, Stage B2 aims to evaluate&#xD;
      vaccines based on variants to select one of them for direct comparison with an active vaccine&#xD;
      control in Stage C2.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Stage A (blinding form) will verify the product safety and support the decision on the dose selection among 1 μg, 3 μg and 10 μg, based on the immune response assessment. These results will also explore the response against 2 variants of concern in SARS-CoV-2: γ and β. The scientific justification for these decisions will be approved by the regulatory agency before choosing Alternative 1 or 2 and progression to the next stage, either B1 or B2.&#xD;
Stage B1:to compare the experimental parental vaccine with an active vaccine control in terms of homotypic(Ho) immunogenicity.&#xD;
Stage C1, complementary to B1: to assess an immune response of the variant-based vaccine with the best heterotypic(He) immunogenicity among those assessed in B1.&#xD;
Stage B2:to assess the Ho and He immunogenicity response induced by each of the vaccines based on variants.&#xD;
Stage C2: comparison between the experimental vaccine based on the variant selected in B2 and an active vaccine control.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>An electronic central randomization system will be used to designate the investigational product (IP) that each participant must receive. A team study non-blind, qualified member (nurse/pharmacist) will obtain the corresponding randomization, will separate the respective IP, will blind the product and deliver it to blind staff. The product will be in a syringe that is in a blister labeled with the sponsor's name, IP code, administration route, IP dose and expiration date. The study non-blind staff will not have contact with the participants, will not have access to identification data or any other involvement with the study, besides randomizing the participant, separating the syringe containing placebo or vaccine, checking if the information on the blister label corresponds the information on the cartridge label and the syringe is labeled with the clinical trial code, ID, corresponding visit and investigator's name. Blinding is maintained with the opacity of the label.</masking_description>

&#xD;
         11. Use of immunosuppressive therapies six months prior to inclusion in the study or its&#xD;
             scheduled use in subsequent two years of inclusion. The dose of corticosteroids&#xD;
             considered immunosuppressive is equivalent to prednisone at a dose of 20 mg/day for&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the principal&#xD;
             investigator or his/her medical representative, affects the participant's ability to&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. The participant is a member of the team that is conducting the study or is in a&#xD;
             dependent relationship with one of the study team members. Dependency relationships&#xD;
             include close relatives (ie, children, partner / spouse, siblings, parents), as well&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Abnormalities in laboratory screening tests considered to be excluding in the&#xD;
             principal investigator opinion or his/her medical representative. Grade 1 changes are&#xD;
             considered to be insignificant, unless the principal investigator or his/her medical&#xD;
             representative indicates otherwise. If any change in the tests is due to a reason&#xD;
             considered temporary, the tests may be repeated up to three times during the screening&#xD;
             period;&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Positive serological tests for the human immunodeficiency virus (Ac HIV1/2); Hepatitis&#xD;
