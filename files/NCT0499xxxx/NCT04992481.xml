      Objectives: to assess the efficiency of four prophylactic protocols on white spot lesions&#xD;
      during orthodontic treatment: 1. professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC)+fluoride&#xD;
      varnish, 2. PMTC+fluoride varnish+gaseous ozone therapy 3. PMTC+fluoride varnish+domestic&#xD;
      octenidin mouth rinse, 4. PMTC+fluoride varnish+domestic octenidin mouth rinse+ gaseous ozone&#xD;
      therapy versus a control group not subjected to any prophylactic program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Patients (n=150, 111 women and 39 men, age 16-50y,) who began&#xD;
      orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances bonded to both dental arches have been provided&#xD;
      with detailed initial oral hygiene instruction recommendations. The hygienic recommendations&#xD;
      comprised: toothbrushing every surface after every meal (4 minutes) with a fluoridated&#xD;
      toothpaste (1450 ppm) using the roll and Bass methods with a soft toothbrush recommended for&#xD;
      fixed appliance, interdental toothbrushes, single-tufted brushes and dental floss recommended&#xD;
      for fixed appliance. An instruction leaflet has been delivered to every subject, as well. A&#xD;
      reinstruction was made during every control visit referring to the results of the oral&#xD;
      hygiene assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patients were randomly allocated (using number random generator) into five&#xD;
      groups (n=30), including four study groups (I, II, III, IV) and one control group (K). Group&#xD;
      I: professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC)+fluoride varnish, group II: PMTC+fluoride&#xD;
      varnish+gaseous ozone therapy, group III: PMTC+fluoride varnish+domestic octenidin mouth&#xD;
      rinse, group IV: PMTC+fluoride varnish+domestic octenidin mouth rinse+ gaseous ozone therapy,&#xD;
      control group (K) not subjected to any prophylactic program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of observation was 12 months, with prophylactic visits every four weeks and&#xD;
      examinations every 12 weeks. The assessment of white spot lesions was proceeded on the labial&#xD;
      surfaces of upper and lower teeth, with patient on the dental chair in proper dental&#xD;
      lighting, after cleaning and drying the assessed surfaces.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the recent years orthodontic treatment has become very popular. Patients seek orthodontic&#xD;
      treatment, mainly to improve the esthetics of their smiles, since appearance has become&#xD;
      extremely important in the modern society. Another reason to have orthodontic treatment is&#xD;
      striving for a better, more comfortable occlusion. However, complications of orthodontic&#xD;
      therapy may occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bonding an orthodontic appliance creates environment for bacterial adhesion, with reduced&#xD;
      salivary flow. The most retentive sites are: area between the bracket upper surface and&#xD;
      gingival margin as well as proximal surfaces. The resulting pH reduction in this area&#xD;
      promotes the demineralization process. Enamel demineralization, being an initial stage of&#xD;
      caries as well as gingival inflammation belong to the most prevalent detrimental effects&#xD;
      resulting from increased accumulation of the biofilm and difficulty to clean these surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With treatment initiation the microbial environment of the oral cavity changes - increases&#xD;
      the number of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus mutans in biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      White spot lesions (WSLs) are the first sings of carious lesions on enamel that can be&#xD;
      detected with the naked eye and result from demineralization. WSLs may arise as early as four&#xD;
      or even two weeks following bonding fixed appliance creating a need for a clinical&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most often affected teeth are lateral incisors, followed by canines, premolars and&#xD;
      central incisors. There is no side predilection, or difference for upper and lower dental&#xD;
      arches. At least one new initial carious lesion is found in 72,9% patients, whereas in 61%&#xD;
      cavities develop during the first twelve months of orthodontic treatment. A fast increase of&#xD;
      the incidence of WSLs is observed during the first six months of treatment - initial caries&#xD;
      is found in 38% patients, after 12 months WSLs are found in 46% patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caries prevention in patients under orthodontic treatment is based on hygienic regimen, in&#xD;
      order to prevent biofilm accumulation by proper brushing technique, use of fluoride, as well&#xD;
      as bactericidal chemicals, including chlorhexidine, octenidin, ozone, casein&#xD;
      phosphopeptides-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alterations of enamel structure within WSLs are only partially reversible. The number of&#xD;
      WSLs does not return to that from before orthodontic treatment even 12 years after debonding.&#xD;
      The treatment methods comprise: remineralization (with fluoride or hydroxyapatite), resin&#xD;
      infiltration, microabrasion, restorative treatment or veneers, depending on the severity of&#xD;
      the destruction .&#xD;
&#xD;
      WSLs constitute a health and an esthetic problem thus introducing preventive measures and&#xD;
      early detection of WSLs is essential. A patient prepared for orthodontic treatment should be&#xD;
      aware of the need for a high hygienic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with increased caries risk professional fluoride prophylaxis, using a varnish or&#xD;
      gel should be considered. In-office application of fluoride varnish allows for better control&#xD;
      of application and is independent from patient's domestic cooperation. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      research based on 36 RCTs showed that NaF varnish is the most effective agent in the&#xD;
      prevention of orthodontically induced WSLs. Application of fluoride varnish on every&#xD;
      orthodontic appointment reduces enamel demineralization by 44% comparing to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ozone is a strong oxidant, destructing to pathogens; exerts bactericidal, antiviral and&#xD;
      fungicidal activity as well as stimulates tissue metabolism by increasing oxidation. It&#xD;
      reduces inflammation, by stimulating interleukin and interferon production, enables&#xD;
      remineralization, breaking protein chains and oxidating aminoacids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Octenidin dihydrochloride exerts antimicrobial action on: S. mutans, Str. sanguis, A.&#xD;
      viscosus, A. naeslundii, influencing the biofilm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study goals and objectives The aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of four&#xD;
      prophylactic protocols on white spot lesions during orthodontic treatment: 1. professional&#xD;
      mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC)+fluoride varnish, 2. PMTC+fluoride varnish+gaseous ozone&#xD;
      therapy 3. PMTC+fluoride varnish+domestic octenidin mouth rinse, 4. PMTC+fluoride&#xD;
      varnish+domestic octenidin mouth rinse+ gaseous ozone therapy versus a control group not&#xD;
      subjected to any prophylactic program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The study was conducted in years 2013-2016 in 150 participants (111 females and&#xD;
      39 males) aged from 16 to 50 years, who were recruited from a pool of patients attending&#xD;
      Department of Interdisciplinary Dentistry at Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin,&#xD;
      Poland. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Pomeranian Medical&#xD;
      University in Szczecin (KB-0012/124/12) and conducted in accordance with accepted ethical&#xD;
      standards for research practice. A written informed consent was obtained from all&#xD;
      participants enrolled. The study protocol has been registered in clinicaltrials.gov&#xD;
      (reference number NCT04147091).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology Sample size calculation for repeated-measures ANOVA was performed by using the R&#xD;
      function wp.rmanova, WebPower package. The power of correlation was established at the level&#xD;
      of 0,75.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To participate in the study 167 healthy adults (16-50 years) who began orthodontic treatment&#xD;
      with fixed appliances bonded to both dental arches were eligible and consecutively invited.&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from 150 patients (111 women and 39 men). The patients have&#xD;
      been randomly divided (using number random generator) into five groups (n=30), including four&#xD;
      study groups (I, II, III, IV) and one control group (K).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed initial oral hygiene instruction recommendations have been provided to every&#xD;
      patient. The hygienic recommendations comprised: toothbrushing every surface after every meal&#xD;
      (4 minutes) with a fluoridated toothpaste (1450 ppm) using the roll and Bass methods with a&#xD;
      soft toothbrush recommended for fixed appliance, interdental toothbrushes, single-tufted&#xD;
      brushes and dental floss recommended for fixed appliance. An instruction leaflet has been&#xD;
      delivered to every subject, as well. A reinstruction was made during every control visit&#xD;
      referring to the results of the oral hygiene assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of prophylaxis procedures (performed every four weeks) in the study and&#xD;
      control groups has been presented in Consort flow diagram. In patients from the study groups&#xD;
      I, II, III, IV a professional mechanical tooth cleaning (PMTC) including air-polishing was&#xD;
      proceeded on every visit using a glycine-based prophylaxis powder (Air-Flow Soft, EMS,&#xD;
      Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients from groups I, II, III, IV a fluoride varnish of 5% NaF (Profluorid Varnish,&#xD;
      Voco, Germany) was applied with a microbrush. Every patient was instructed to stop from&#xD;
      drinking and eating for the next two hours (as recommended by the manufacturer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from groups II and IV were additionally subjected to in-office ozone therapy using&#xD;
      OzonyTron-OZ (Mymed, Germany). Ozone was applied on a silicone double-jaw tray of a proper&#xD;
      size (allowing even ozone distribution in the oral cavity) following professional mechanical&#xD;
      tooth cleaning. A Full Mouth Desinfection program lasting 5 minutes was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from groups III and IV received a domestic mouthrinse (Octenidol MD, Schülke,&#xD;
      Germany) and were recommended to use 15 ml of the liquid for 30 seconds after evening&#xD;
      toothbrushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients assigned to control group had no professional hygienic or prophylactic procedures&#xD;
      performed, despite for initial oral hygiene instruction and written dietetic recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of observation was 12 months, with prophylactic visits every four weeks and&#xD;
      examinations every 12 weeks. The assessment of white spot lesions was proceeded on the labial&#xD;
      surfaces of upper and lower teeth, with patient on the dental chair in proper dental&#xD;
      lighting, after cleaning and drying the assessed surfaces. WSL index according to Gorelick et&#xD;
      al. was used as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - no visible WSL or surface disruption (no demineralization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - visible WSL, covering less than 1/3 of surface, without surface disruption (mild&#xD;
           demineralization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - visible WSL, covering more than 1/3 of the surface, with a roughened surface, but not&#xD;
           requiring restoration (moderate demineralization)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - visible cavitation, requiring restoration (severe demineralization) Every dental&#xD;
           surface was subjected to visual-tactile examination performed on a dental chair with&#xD;
           proper dental lighting, using dental probe and a mirror. Caries was diagnosed on the&#xD;
           level of cavitation, the presence of fillings has been noted as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up This study has a 1-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and Statistical Analysis All continuous variables were verified for&#xD;
      distribution normality using Kołmogorov-Smirnov test, ShapiroWilk test, also by qqplots.&#xD;
      Statistical significance of differences between two groups were analyzed using Student t-test&#xD;
      and Mann-Whitney test and between multiple groups - analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey HSD&#xD;
      test or Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuous variables were described by their number and frequency of occurrence.&#xD;
      Statistical correlations between discontinuous variables were analyzed using χ2 Pearson's&#xD;
      test or exact Fisher's test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study of correlations between discontinuous variables: ordinal and nominal (coded&#xD;
      variables: 0/1) and continuous variables rank Spearman correlation coefficient was used. The&#xD;
      results have been described using the correlation coefficient r and the level of significance&#xD;
      p.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes with data visualization have been programmed in the interpreted&#xD;
      programming language &quot;R&quot; with open-source software for data science, scientific research, and&#xD;
      technical communication &quot;R studio&quot; version 1.4.1106. The level p=0,051-0,099 has been set as&#xD;
      a borderline trend of statistical significance. Computer software STATA 11 (2009) of license&#xD;
      No 30110532736 has been used for all analyses.&#xD;
