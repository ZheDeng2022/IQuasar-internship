  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia is a neuropathic facial pain condition, characterized by unilateral&#xD;
      paroxysmal pain which can be described as stabbing or electric shock like, in the&#xD;
      distribution of one or more divisions of trigeminal nerve which is triggered by innocuous&#xD;
      stimuli. The attack is provoked by touching or stimulating these trigger zones. There are&#xD;
      various pharmacological drugs present for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;
      Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are the first-choice drugs for the treatment of TN. Other&#xD;
      drugs include lamotrigine , baclofen , gabapentin, antidepressants , eslicarbazepine ,&#xD;
      sumatriptan &amp; vixitrigine. The carbamazepine is first choice of drug which has serious side&#xD;
      effects including dizziness, memory loss, sleppiness, aplastic anaemia. Oxcarbazepine has&#xD;
      similar mechanism of action and found to have lesser adverse events when used in various&#xD;
      neuralgias in the place of carbamazepine. But there is still lack of evidence to prove that&#xD;
      oxcarbazepine can be used as monotherapy in TN patients.&#xD;

      Trigeminal neuralgia is a neuropathic facial pain condition which is characterised by&#xD;
      unilateral paroxysmal pain which is excruciating, short lasting in the distribution territory&#xD;
      of trigeminal nerve.(1) Trigeminal neuralgia is oro-facial pain restricted to one or more&#xD;
      divisions of the trigeminal nerve. With the exception of Trigeminal Neuralgia caused by&#xD;
      Multiple sclerosis, the pain affects one side of the face. It is abrupt in onset and&#xD;
      typically lasts only a few seconds (2 min at maximum).Patients may report their pain as&#xD;
      arising spontaneously, but these pain paroxysms can always be triggered by innocuous&#xD;
      mechanical stimuli or movements. Patients usually do not experience pain between paroxysms.&#xD;
      If they do report additional continuous pain, in the same distribution and in the same&#xD;
      periods as the paroxysmal pain, they are considered to have Trigeminal Neuralgia with&#xD;
      continuous pain. (IASP)(1) Trigeminal neuralgia is mainly classified into three diagnostic&#xD;
      categories i.e. Classical, Secondary and Idiopathic. This classification is mainly based on&#xD;
      the etiology &amp; pain characteristics. The etiology of Trigeminal Neuralgia is not well&#xD;
      understood, but various theories such as Compression of sensory root of trigeminal nerve by&#xD;
      arteries &amp; bony exostoses.(4) ,focal demyelination of trigeminal afferents near the entry of&#xD;
      the trigeminal root into pons(2)and alteration in the central neural function followed by&#xD;
      injury to peripheral nerves (4) are widely accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trigeminal Neuralgia has a profound effect on quality of life of the patient &amp; expenditure on&#xD;
      health (4). Due to the severe intensity of pain, patients avoid touching face, washing face,&#xD;
      thus making patient's life disturbing &amp; miserable. Even after so many years of research, it&#xD;
      is still a challenge to treat patients suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. Treatment can be&#xD;
      sub- divided into pharmacological &amp; invasive therapies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacological therapy include drugs such as carbamazepine ( 200-1200mg) , oxcarbazepine&#xD;
      (300-1800mg) , lamotrigine, Gabapentin , baclofen, eslicarbazepine, sumatriptan, vixotrigine.&#xD;
      The pre- surgical procedures like botulinium toxin A &amp; intranasal non-inhaled CO2 have also&#xD;
      been sporadically used (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review study discussing the pharmacological options to treat trigeminal neuralgia concluded&#xD;
      that carbamazepine &amp; oxcarbazepine are the first choice of drugs(1). Oxcarbazepine showed&#xD;
      equal efficacy in reducing pain attacks with better tolerability &amp; less side effects (1) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently conducted study found that carbamazepine is associated with serious side effects&#xD;
      including CNS disturbances, somnolence, unbalance, thrombocytopenia, increase level of&#xD;
      transaminases while OXC showed similar efficacy with less side effects. CNS disturbances&#xD;
      encountered in patients on CBZ were triple to those on OXC &amp; withdrawal from the treatment&#xD;
      was also more in patients on CBZ(27%) than on OXC (18%)(12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OXC has contemporarily been used as monotherapy in epileptic patients (8) &amp; has proven&#xD;
      efficacy over the CBZ. In trigeminal neuralgia, though various studies have shown that OXC&#xD;
      produce lesser side effects, but none of the studies have compared the efficacy of&#xD;
      carbamazepine with oxcarbazepine .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the present study intends to compare the efficacy of oxcarbazepine with carbamazepine as&#xD;
      monotherapy in patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia.&#xD;
