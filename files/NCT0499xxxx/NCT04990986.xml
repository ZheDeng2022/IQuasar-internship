    <textblock>
      In the SAME-study, we aim to develop and evaluate a new, multifaceted (complex) intervention&#xD;
      in a mixed methods study-design to increase medication safety in nursing homes. The&#xD;
      SAME-study will be locally anchored, including investigation of patient safety culture, in a&#xD;
      mixed methods design, including both in depth qualitative and organizational-focused&#xD;
      quantitative methods. This study will be guided by the following main research questions and&#xD;
      hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can we elucidate new areas susceptible for intervention to increase medication safety in&#xD;
           nursing homes through qualitative in-depth investigation of patient safety culture in&#xD;
           nursing homes guided by safety theory with participatory approach?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Is it possible to develop a multifaceted intervention fit to context within actual&#xD;
           resource-frame to increase medication safety in nursing homes based on patient safety&#xD;
           culture, guided by safety theory with participatory approach?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A complex intervention developed within a participatory framework will lead to positive&#xD;
           change of care-staff self-reported perceptions of patient safety climate culture in&#xD;
           nursing homes in the intervention group compared with the control group of this study?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study applies mixed-methods pragmatic paradigm led by Safety 1 and 2&#xD;
      theory, with participatory approach to an exploratory sequential three-phased study-design,&#xD;
      embedding a cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT). Overall study-settings will be&#xD;
      nursing homes within the municipality of Aalborg, North Denmark Region, Denmark.&#xD;
