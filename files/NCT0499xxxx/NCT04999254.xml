  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study consists in recruiting patients with ankle sprains who visit the emergency&#xD;
      department (ED).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be tested by an osteopath who we will measure pain, swelling and/or edema,&#xD;
      and mobility of the ankle. Patients will be asked to reproduce exercises such as to hold on&#xD;
      one foot, to stand on tiptoes...&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, patients will be divided into two groups. The first group will undergo medical&#xD;
      treatment during the ED visit, while the second group will undergo osteopathic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three time points will be planned. The first one will be the patient's consultation in the ED&#xD;
      where treatment will be carried out according to its assignment, as well as the clinical&#xD;
      measures previously described. The second time point will be seven days later (plus or minus&#xD;
      three days), where only clinical measurements will be performed. The third time point will be&#xD;
      three weeks later (plus or minus three days), when the ankle sprain has consolidated, in&#xD;
      order to carry out the clinical measurements again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical measurements will allow to evaluate the effectiveness of a single osteopathic&#xD;
      consultation in the ED. The investigators expect a reduction in immediate pain, and&#xD;
      thereafter, a reduction in swelling, and an improved mobility and stability of the ankle.&#xD;

    <description>Medical treatment will be based on functional treatment and the doctor will prescribe the RICE protocol. For this, the patient will have to :&#xD;
place an ice pack on the sprain&#xD;
apply sports rest for three weeks&#xD;
compress the sprain with a compression stocking when standing in order to prevent phlebitis. In addition, to avoid this complication, the doctor will prescribe an anticoagulant.&#xD;
raise the foot with crutches during the day&#xD;
elevate the foot at night or when doing an activity in a sitting position, using a cushion for example.&#xD;
In addition, the doctor will prescribe anti-inflammatory drugs to ease the pain and physiotherapy to establish proprioception, muscle strength, joint range and dynamic postural balance of the sprain.</description>
