  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different scoring systems were developed for risk prediction and adjustment of morbidity from&#xD;
      perforated duodenal ulcer. However, these scoring systems are not routinely used in&#xD;
      perforated duodenal ulcer patient in everyday clinical practice. Identification of patient&#xD;
      with a high risk of adverse outcomes following surgery is important for clinical&#xD;
      decision-making which can assist in risk stratification and triage e.g. timing and extent of&#xD;
      pre-operative respiratory and circulatory stabilization, postoperative admission to a high&#xD;
      dependency unit (HDU), the level and extent of monitoring, and inclusion in specific&#xD;
      perioperative care protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies assessed and compared the accuracy indices of PULP with BOEY and ASA in&#xD;
      predicting post PPU repair 30-day morbidity Further, the efficacy must be verified in&#xD;
      individual settings like ours. So we wish to assess its efficacy in BPKIHS-a tertiary&#xD;
      referral center of eastern Nepal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perforated peptic ulcer disease (PPU) is an important indication for emergency surgery,&#xD;
      complicating 2%-10% of peptic ulcer disease. In the context of modern peptic ulcer therapy,&#xD;
      the incidence of PPU has been declining over the past two decades, but mortality has not&#xD;
      followed a commensurate decline, in spite of advances in operative strategy and perioperative&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omental patch repair of duodenal ulcer perforation is both simpler than and as effective as&#xD;
      definitive ulcer surgery in the emergency situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However,mortality due to ulcer perforation treated by simple closure and/or other methods is&#xD;
      still around 10%. Factors reported to affect mortality in duodenal ulcer perforations in&#xD;
      other series are old age, co-morbidity, preoperative hypotension, large size of the&#xD;
      perforation, delay in presentation, and, delay in operation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several scoring systems have been proposed for the predictions of 30-day morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) in order to risk stratify patients subject to&#xD;
      their anticipated complications, and accordingly direct the required attention to high-risk&#xD;
      patients. Scoring systems most commonly used include ASA (American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists), Boey and peptic ulcer perforation score (PULP). Each comprises 3-11&#xD;
      demographic, clinical and biochemical variables that consider only pre-operative, or include&#xD;
      pre/intra -operative and laboratory findings. Clinical scoring systems need good diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy in order to risk stratify patients correctly.&#xD;
