      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, randomized, open-label, uncontrolled trial. Approximately&#xD;
      400 healthy volunteers, male or female, aged 18 years or older, will be randomized to one of&#xD;
      the following five groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [IM Groups] Group A: Vaccination 2 mg, three times at 2-week intervals (n = 80) Group B:&#xD;
      Vaccination 4 mg, twice at 4-week intervals (n = 80) Group C: Vaccination 8 mg, twice at&#xD;
      4-week intervals(n = 80)&#xD;
&#xD;
      [ID Groups] Group D: Vaccination 1 mg, three times at 2-week intervals (n = 80) Group E:&#xD;
