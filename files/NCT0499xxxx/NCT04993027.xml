      11% of the general population undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA) in their lifetime and 7%&#xD;
      undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with these rates expected to rise up to 50% by 2026.&#xD;
      Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains one of the most common complications, accounting&#xD;
      for 30% of THA/TKA revision surgeries. Topical delivery of antibiotic powder may reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of PJI but its potential drawbacks include wound healing complications, reduced&#xD;
      osteoblast activity, third body wear, and antibiotic resistance. In THA and TKA, topical&#xD;
      administration of vancomycin powder for the primary prevention of PJI has been studied in&#xD;
      observational studies, but conclusions are limited due to the low incidence of PJI and high&#xD;
      number of patients required to detect a significant difference. Investigators therefore&#xD;
      propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the impact of topical vancomycin&#xD;
      compared to standard care on PJI rates following THA and TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine whether topical vancomycin is a safe and effective intervention for the&#xD;
      primary prevention of PJI after THA and TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a pilot multi-centre RCT to evaluate the study design and assess&#xD;
      feasibility prior to implementation across Canada. Investigators aim to recruit 50 THA and 50&#xD;
      TKA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria THA or TKA Patients aged 18 years or older Patients must complete 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up Exclusion Criteria Patients undergoing surgery for inflammatory arthritis,&#xD;
      post-traumatic arthritis, or avascular necrosis History or septic arthritis based on history&#xD;
      or synovial aspirate Prior major operation on the affected joint Current immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications Vancomycin allergy or history of a vancomycin-related complication Recruitment:&#xD;
      surgeons introduce study to the patients, research staff will conduct recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized preoperatively and remain blinded to their&#xD;
      treatment arm. Patients allocated to the control group will have all standard care infection&#xD;
      prophylaxis interventions. Patients allocated to the vancomycin group will undergo all the&#xD;
      standard care measures in addition to 1g of powdered vancomycin applied to the wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: Patients will complete follow-up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1&#xD;
      year visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: PJI in the same joint. Secondary outcome: PJI in THA and TKA subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reoperation on the same joint Superficial and non-infectious wound complications All&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip and knee arthroplasty are the third and second most performed inpatient surgeries,&#xD;
      respectively. Eleven percent of the general population undergo total hip arthroplasty (THA)&#xD;
      in their lifetime and 7% undergo total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with these rates expected to&#xD;
      rise up to 50% by 2026. Unfortunately, periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) remains one of&#xD;
      the most common and devastating complications of hip and knee arthroplasty, accounting for&#xD;
      30% of revision surgeries.The incidence of PJI ranges from 0.2-1.6% for primary THA and 1-2%&#xD;
      for primary TKA. Patients with PJI are subjected to repeated hospitalization and revision&#xD;
      surgeries, which leads to increased morbidity and mortality as well as decreased functional&#xD;
      outcomes. An estimated $1.6 billion USD is spent on treating hip and knee PJI in the United&#xD;
      States yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topical delivery of antibiotic powder is a simple intervention which may reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of PJI. Direct delivery of antibiotics to a target area allows for high local drug&#xD;
      concentrations while limiting systemic side effects.Potential drawbacks of topical&#xD;
      antibiotics include wound healing complications, reduced osteoblast activity, third body&#xD;
      wear, and contribution to antibiotic resistance. Though systemic absorption is reduced,&#xD;
      complications such as anaphylaxis, nephrotoxicity, and ototoxicity remain possible. Topical,&#xD;
      intrawound administration of vancomycin powder has been well studied in spinal surgery for&#xD;
      the prevention of surgical site infections (SSI), with good results. Based on this&#xD;
      literature, vancomycin powder has been investigated for the prevention of SSI in multiple&#xD;
      orthopaedic domains. In THA and TKA, topical administration of vancomycin powder for the&#xD;
      primary prevention of PJI has been studied in a number of recent observational studies, but&#xD;
      conclusions are limited due to the low incidence of PJI and high number of patients required&#xD;
      to detect a significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Knowledge to Date investigators have completed a systematic review meta-analysis of nine&#xD;
      comparative observational studies investigating topical vancomycin for the primary prevention&#xD;
      of PJI after hip and knee arthroplasty. Patients treated with topical vancomycin had a lower&#xD;
      incidence of PJI compared to the control group (0.6% versus 1.8%, OR 0.40, p = 0.003).&#xD;
      Excluding revision cases, patients undergoing primary hip or knee arthroplasty also had a&#xD;
      lower incidence of PJI after topical vancomycin (0.6% versus 1.6%, OR 0.46, p = 0.001). After&#xD;
      total hip arthroplasty 0.4% of patients developed a PJI in the vancomycin group compared to&#xD;
      1.8% of patients in the control group (OR 0.26, p = 0.003). After unicondylar or total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty, topical vancomycin led to a 0.8% rate of PJI compared to 1.8% in the control&#xD;
      group. However, this difference failed to reach statistical significance (OR 0.55, p = 0.07).&#xD;
      Topical vancomycin did not increase the rate of wound complications (4.5% versus 5.4%, OR&#xD;
      0.83, p = 0.40). There was no significant difference in overall complication rates between&#xD;
      vancomycin and control groups (5.8% versus 7.0%, OR 0.87, p = 0.45).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Figure 1: Forest plot of PJI rates after topical vancomycin administration compared to&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conclusions of this meta-analysis are limited by the retrospective nature of the included&#xD;
      studies. Most studies use a consecutive series of patients without vancomycin administration&#xD;
      followed sequentially by a series implementing topical vancomycin, or a single surgeon using&#xD;
      vancomycin compared to a different surgeon as a control. Additionally, results are limited by&#xD;
      the relatively short minimum follow-up period, as many studies reported only three-month&#xD;
      results, along with varied definitions of PJI and reporting of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PJI after hip and knee arthroplasty remains a devastating and difficult to treat complication&#xD;
      following hip and knee arthroplasty. Low level evidence suggests that topical vancomycin may&#xD;
      be effective prophylaxis against PJI. However, given the substantial limitations of prior&#xD;
      studies and potential for harm, higher quality studies are required before topical vancomycin&#xD;
      can be routinely recommended. Investigators therefore propose a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      investigating the impact of topical vancomycin compared to standard care on PJI rates&#xD;
      following THA and TKA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Research Question The overarching aim of this study is to determine whether topical&#xD;
      vancomycin is a safe and effective intervention for the primary prevention of PJI after THA&#xD;
      and TKA. Understanding its impact on PJI and other complication rates with high quality&#xD;
      evidence can help make recommendations for or against its routine use and reduce risks to&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Study Design The proposed research project is a pilot study which will precede a&#xD;
      multi-centre randomized controlled trial to evaluate complication rates in THA and TKA&#xD;
      following vancomycin administration compared to standard care. This pilot study will allow us&#xD;
      to evaluate the study design and assess feasibility prior to implementation across Canada.&#xD;
      Surgery will take place at one of the four major academic adult orthopedic hospitals: Peter&#xD;
      Lougheed Center, Foothills Medical Centre, Rockyview General Hospital, and South Health&#xD;
      Campus either Peter Lougheed Centre or Rockyview General Hospital with plans to expand to&#xD;
      hospitals across Calgary and Canada in the future study. Investigators aim to recruit 50&#xD;
      patients undergoing THA and 50 patients undergoing TKA and will follow patients for one year&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria 2.2.1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult patients aged 18 years or older, who are undergoing elective primary THA or TKA&#xD;
           for osteoarthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be able and willing to complete one year of follow-up postoperatively&#xD;
           2.2.2 Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergoing surgery for inflammatory arthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, or&#xD;
           avascular necrosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History or septic arthritis based on history or synovial aspirate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior major operation on the affected joint including osteotomy, open reduction internal&#xD;
           fixation, or major open ligamentous repair, but excluding arthroscopic procedures such&#xD;
           as ACL reconstruction or meniscus or labral debridement/repair&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current immunosuppressive medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vancomycin allergy or history of a vancomycin-related complication such as ototoxicity&#xD;
           or nephrotoxicity 2.3 Recruitment Initial introduction to the study will be done by the&#xD;
           surgeons, followed by screening and recruitment, which will be completed by the research&#xD;
           coordinator. Patients will have an opportunity to read the consent form and ask&#xD;
           questions prior to signing the consent form. Baseline demographics including age, sex,&#xD;
           gender, BMI, ethnicity, comorbidities, and smoking status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Intervention Once enrolled, patients will be randomized preoperatively on the day of&#xD;
      surgery Randomization will be done using R software (version 4.0.2), randomize R package.&#xD;
      Block Randomization with randomly mixed block sizes to assign equal sample numbers to control&#xD;
      and treatment groups (the allocator will hide the block size from the executer). This will be&#xD;
      done via 'blockrand' Function in R. with an online randomizer (e.g. studyrandomizer.com).&#xD;
      Patients will be blinded to their treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the control group will have all standard care infection prophylaxis&#xD;
      interventions such as pre- and post-operative intravenous antibiotic administration, sterile&#xD;
      surgical helmet systems, saline pulse lavage irrigation, and antimicrobial drapes. No&#xD;
      povidone-iodine lavage will be used. Antibiotic impregnated cement may be used according to&#xD;
      the individual surgeons' routine practices but will not differ for an individual surgeon&#xD;
      between treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients allocated to the vancomycin group will undergo all the standard care measures in&#xD;
      addition to 1g of powdered vancomycin applied to the wound, in the intra-articular space and&#xD;
      along wound edges after irrigation and prior to fascial closure.&#xD;
