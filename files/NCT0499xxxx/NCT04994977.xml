  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety and efficacy of intra-arterial chemotherapy in subjects with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed, residual, or recurrent atypical choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus&#xD;
      carcinoma prior to a second surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that intra-arterial chemotherapy will be safe and feasible for this population&#xD;
      and will result in decreased tumor size, which may further improve the goals of a second-look&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this study is to determine if intra-arterial chemotherapy is a safe and&#xD;
      effective option for subjects with atypical choroid plexus papilloma and choroid plexus&#xD;
      carcinoma prior to receiving second-look surgery. Angiography occurs when a catheter is&#xD;
      inserted through the subjects vasculature to the major vessels that supply cerebral&#xD;
      circulation. Subjects on this trial will undergo a a cerebral angiogram to determine the&#xD;
      ideal arteries to use for drug infusion. Once identified, chemotherapy will be delivered&#xD;
      through the catheter directly to the site of tumor.&#xD;
