      The ClockWork Postpartum Weight Management Pilot Study is an intervention study that will&#xD;
      assess the feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of the ClockWork intervention&#xD;
      among women with prepregnancy obesity during the first 4 months postpartum.&#xD;

      Overview of Procedures. The investigators developed a prototype mobile app to monitor&#xD;
      ClockWork target behaviors, and now aim to gain stakeholder input to refine the interface and&#xD;
      improve usability via feedback from postpartum women who began pregnancy with obesity. In&#xD;
      this pilot trial, women (N=50) will complete baseline assessments in the first month&#xD;
      postpartum and be randomized to either usual care (n=25) or ClockWork (n=25) for 4 months,&#xD;
      then complete assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; Recruitment. Given that the investigators want to initiate treatment quickly&#xD;
      after delivery, women will be recruited at the end of pregnancy through Magee-Womens&#xD;
      Hospital. Women will be randomized to receive either the ClockWork intervention or Usual&#xD;
      Care. ClockWork is a behavioral weight loss intervention comprised of coaching sessions as&#xD;
      well as digital monitoring and feedback tools. It addresses 4 key behaviors related to the&#xD;
      circadian timing system (CTS), weight, and health and their Amount, Regularity &amp; Timing-the&#xD;
      ART of ClockWork. Women will receive 12 tailored coaching sessions to review digital&#xD;
      monitoring of each key behavior, learn intervention content, and set goals, which are&#xD;
      delivered in-person, by phone, or web to fit women's needs postpartum. Coaches (Dr. Kolko&#xD;
      Conlon or study interventionist) will use women's baseline responses to tailor sessions&#xD;
      around the key behaviors. The investigators will protocolize real-time monitoring to increase&#xD;
      engagement and adherence, and to facilitate just-in-time adaptive reminders, recommendations,&#xD;
      and coaching sessions. Usual Care consists of an e-newsletter on maternal health, postpartum&#xD;
      weight loss, and general calorie guidelines for lactating/nonlactating women.&#xD;
