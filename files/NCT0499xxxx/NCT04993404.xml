    <textblock>
      This multi-center, open-label, parallel-controlled, single-dose Phase 1 study is being&#xD;
      conducted to directly characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and safety of Jaktinib&#xD;
      following administration of a single oral dose in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic&#xD;
      impairment compared to healthy matched control subjects with normal hepatic function(matched&#xD;
      by age, weight, and sex).&#xD;

    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma Jaktinib and its metabolites（ZG0244 and ZG0245）concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C(last)/lambda(z)</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
