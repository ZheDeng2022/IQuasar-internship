  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study explores the application of marker-less motion analysis (visual-perceptive&#xD;
      computing, VPC) using a consumer grade infrared and video camera (Microsoft Kinect) for&#xD;
      clinical assessment in MS. It includes as the primary outcomes a short assessment battery of&#xD;
      simple motor tasks (PASS-MS) that can be performed in front of the sensor after standard oral&#xD;
      instructions given by the operator. For each task, the sensor data are transformed into a set&#xD;
      of kinematic parameters that may be used as motor outcome reflecting specific neurological&#xD;
      dysfunction. For validation against both clinical and patient-reported outcomes as well as&#xD;
      MRI findings, we here prospectively investigate a large cohort of patients with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis. This will allow to determine the usefulness of the various kinematic parameters&#xD;
      generated and to define a reduced set of the most meaningful parameters for potential use in&#xD;
      future MS trials. Data on repeatability and benchmarks for clinically relevant change are&#xD;
      essential to interpret test results and, more importantly, changes thereof. Further, this&#xD;
      prospective study will yield estimates of progression rates that are required for planning&#xD;
      future studies using this motion analysis tool and assessment battery as an outcome. The&#xD;
      study is designed to obtain benchmarks for sensitivity and clinical responsiveness. Primary&#xD;
      analysis aims to answer the question: Does the SMSW - Maximum Speed worsen with disease&#xD;
      progression established as confirmed disability progression based on EDSS after 24 months&#xD;
      (defined as 1 step increase in EDSS ≤ 5.5 and 0.5 step in EDSS &gt; 5.5)?&#xD;

      The study is designed as a prospective observational (non-interventional) single-center study&#xD;
      performed at one center, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study converges with prospective observational studies performed at our center. These&#xD;
      studies started in 2011 with the objective to define determinants of progression in&#xD;
      neuroimmunological disorders (CIS, MS, NMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables collected for this study were defined according to the study objective and&#xD;
      comprise different markers of motor/mobility function, cognitive and affective function,&#xD;
      fatigue and health-related quality of life. The primary outcome is a VPC-based assessment of&#xD;
      locomotor function (PASS-MS SMSW-MaxS) as the diagnostic test under study. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      serve to cross-validate progression rates or as benchmarks of clinical progression to&#xD;
      determine clinical relevance of change. Further, possible effects of cognitive and affective&#xD;
      function on the primary outcome can be explored which is of high relevance for the&#xD;
      interpretation of changes in the population of MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All assessments are performed at inclusion and after 12and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PASS-MS kinematic parameters with Short Maximum Speed Walk - Speed (SMSW-MaxS) as primary&#xD;
      outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other kinematic parameters derived from PASS-MS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical Rating with EDSS and Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) consisting&#xD;
           of tests of walking capacity (T25FW), hand dexterity (9HPT), cognitive processing speed&#xD;
           (SDMT) and visual acuity (Sloan charts)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive testing (BRB-N)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient-reported outcomes on global impression of change, MS-related impairment in&#xD;
           walking (MSWS-12), hand function, occurrence of fatigue (FSMC), depressive symptoms&#xD;
           (BDI-II) and health-related quality of life by MS-specific questionnaire (HAQUAMS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A change in T25FW speed of at least 20% was found to be clinically meaningful for MS patients&#xD;
      (Hobart 2013). In a previous study the investigators found SMSW average walking speed was&#xD;
      slower in MS patients (1.6 ± 0.3 m/sec) than in HC (1.8 ± 0.4 m/sec) (Behrens 2014).&#xD;
      Therefore, a similar average walking speed was assumed for the population under study at&#xD;
      baseline (1.6 m/sec) and a decrease of 0.3 m/sec (corresponding to approximately 20%) as&#xD;
      clinically meaningful. Moreover, based on previous reports, investigators assume a standard&#xD;
      deviation in the changes of SMSW-MaxS of 0.4 m/sec (Behrens 2014). This results in an&#xD;
      expected effect size of 0.75 for the change in SMSW-MaxS between baseline and 24 months&#xD;
      follow-up in those with clinically confirmed disability progression. A sample size of N=16&#xD;
      patients will have a power of 80% to detect an effect size of 0.75 with a two-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 and a t-test for dependent samples (nQuery Advisor 7.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation considered previous evidence on the proportion of patients who will&#xD;
      show clinically confirmed disability progression throughout the observation period based on&#xD;
      an EDSS change defined as 1 step increase in EDSS ≤ 5.5 and 0.5 step in EDSS &gt; 5.5 within 24&#xD;
      months. Cutter et al. (1999) reported that 10% of their patients showed EDSS confirmed&#xD;
      sustained change within 3 months and 40% showed a change to baseline in 1 year reported in&#xD;
      MSFC, which also incorporates the T25FW. The investigators assume that at least 20 % of&#xD;
      patients showing a confirmed sustained change in EDSS according to above definition within&#xD;
      24months to be a realistic scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When considering an overall dropout rate of 10-20% (lost to follow-up), this would result in&#xD;
      N=16 complete datasets when overall N=100 patients are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should not have had an acute relapse up to 3 months before follow-up visit (12 and&#xD;
      24 months). To avoid dropout due to acute relapse the follow-up visit is extended to up to 3&#xD;
      months in case of acute relapse.&#xD;

        We aim to include and follow-up 100 patients with a diagnosis of MS according to revised&#xD;
        McDonald criteria including relapsing-remitting and progressive disease courses. The design&#xD;
        as a single-center study implied that broad inclusion criteria (RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) should be&#xD;
        used in order to obtain robust results. We therefore chose not to limit recruitment to&#xD;
        progressive MS, which would have required a multi-center study. Still, we conceive the main&#xD;
        results of our study - sensitivity and responsiveness - to be conferrable to progressive MS&#xD;
        (yet not the progression rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
        We restrict inclusion to those able to walk at least short distance with unilateral&#xD;
        assistance according to the testing requirements of the primary outcome. We further include&#xD;
        patients with any intervention for MS or other morbidity as long as this is not considered&#xD;
        to affect balance or locomotor function. Type of MS treatment and comorbidities are&#xD;
        documented at baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
