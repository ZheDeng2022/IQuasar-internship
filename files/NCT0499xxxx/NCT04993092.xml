      this study will be a randomized clinical trial. This study will be conducted in Nishat Latif&#xD;
      Hospital, Barath, Sialkot. A sample size of 22 patients will be taken. Patients will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups by lottery method. Group A will be treated with mulligan mobilization&#xD;
      technique and conventional physiotherapy with Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and&#xD;
      electrical heating pad. Group B will be treated with muscle energy technique and conventional&#xD;
      treatment of Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and electrical hot pack. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive treatment for5 weeks,2 sessions in a week with baseline and 6 weeks treatment&#xD;
      reading will be taken. The outcome measures Numeric pain rating scale, disabilities of the&#xD;
      arm, shoulder and hand, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index . data will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 25.&#xD;

      Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition characterized by stiffness&#xD;
      and pain in your shoulder joint. A condition in which a person has severe limitation of the&#xD;
      range of motion of the shoulder due to scarring around the shoulder joint. Adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis is an unwanted consequence of rotator cuff disease that involves damage to the&#xD;
      rotator cuff. Muscle energy technique involves careful positioning of an area of the body by&#xD;
      the physical therapist. After positioning, you will be asked to contract the muscle or resist&#xD;
      a movement done by the physical therapist. This will be followed by a stretch to lengthen the&#xD;
      same or opposite muscle group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be followed by a stretch to lengthen the same or opposite muscle group. Mulligan's&#xD;
      technique &quot;combines the sustained application of manual gliding force to a joint, with the&#xD;
      aim of repositioning bone positional faults while enabling concurrent physiological&#xD;
      (osteo-kinematic) motion of the joint. Essentially, this means repositioning a joint to&#xD;
      enable proper motion while taking that joint through pain-free passive and active range of&#xD;
      motion (ROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mulligan Manual Therapy can be used to help treat a variety of injuries and pain including&#xD;
      neck pain, back pain and upper and lower extremity injuries. Designed to reduce pain and&#xD;
      improve the patient's range of motion the Mulligan technique involves Natural Apophyseal&#xD;
      Glides (NAGS), Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides (SNAGS) and Mobilization with Movement&#xD;
      (MWM) for the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons describe three stages: Freezing, or painful&#xD;
      stage: Pain increases gradually, making shoulder motion harder and harder. Pain tends to be&#xD;
      worse at night. Frozen: Pain does not worsen, and it may decrease at this stage. The shoulder&#xD;
      remains stiff. Thawing: Movement gets easier and may eventually return to normal. Signs and&#xD;
      symptoms typically begin gradually, worsen over time and then resolve, usually within one to&#xD;
      three years.&#xD;

    <measure>The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>The Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand only contains subset of 11 items. it is a self-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point Likert scales.&#xD;
At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated The scores range from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>4th week</time_frame>
    <description>it is a patient completed questionnaire with 13 items assessing pain level and extent of difficulty with activity of daily living requiring the use of the upper extremities. The pain subscale is a composite measure and has 5-items and the Disability subscale is a composite measure and has 8-items.&#xD;
Total pain score (which is composite measure): / 50 x 100 = % (Note: If a person does not answer all questions divide by the total possible score, eg. if 1 question missed divide by 40)&#xD;
Total disability score (which is composite measure): / 80 x 100 = % (Note: If a person does not answer all questions divide by the total possible score, eg. if 1 question missed divide by 70)&#xD;
Total Shoulder Pain and Disability score: / 130 x 100 = % (Note: If a person does not answer all questions divide by the total possible score, eg. if 1 question missed divide by 120)&#xD;
The means of the two subscales are averaged to produce a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).</description>
