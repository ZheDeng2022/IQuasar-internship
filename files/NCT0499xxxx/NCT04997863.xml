  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is one of the most common procedures performed in plastic&#xD;
      surgery and dermatology. The donor site of skin grafting is expected to heal without&#xD;
      scarring. However, hypertrophic scar formation is prevalent among STSG donor sites during&#xD;
      scar maturation and has become a significant problem at present. Hypertrophic scar results in&#xD;
      aesthetic, physical, functional, and psychological problems, leading to a dramatic impact on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life ultimately. There are many current therapeutic approaches for&#xD;
      preventing and treating hypertrophic scars; however, they remain clinically unsatisfactory&#xD;
      because many treatments have been associated with high recurrent rates, high cost, and side&#xD;
      effects. Currently, there are no gold standards for hypertrophic scar therapy. There are many&#xD;
      attempts to develop new treatment options for the prevention and management of scarring that&#xD;
      are acceptable to both physicians and patients. It has previously been shown that both edible&#xD;
      bird's nest (EBN) extract and sericin have effectiveness in reducing scar development. They&#xD;
      might be a suitable alternative option for scar prevention and could be used safely.&#xD;
      Therefore, the sericin hydrogel sheet impregnated with EBN extract is developed as it is&#xD;
      believed that the synergism of these combined compounds would be a great help to prevent the&#xD;
      development of scars. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sericin hydrogel&#xD;
      sheet impregnated with EBN extract for the prevention of scar formation in patients with STSG&#xD;
      donor sites.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, matched pairs&#xD;
      clinical study will be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of sericin hydrogel&#xD;
      sheet impregnated with EBN extract for the prevention of scar development at STSG donor site.&#xD;
      Patients who underwent the STSG procedure at the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive&#xD;
      Surgery, Department of Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital will be considered for&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty patients will be enrolled in this study. After&#xD;
      complete epithelialization, each donor site will be equally divided into two halves: upper&#xD;
      and lower halves. Both halves of the donor site will be randomized into sericin hydrogel&#xD;
      sheet impregnated with EBN extract group (treatment group) or placebo hydrogel sheet group&#xD;
      (control group). The application of both dressings will be done once daily by the patient in&#xD;
      the morning or evening after shower. Both dressings will be recommended to wear over the&#xD;
      donor site for 8-12 hours per day. The duration of treatment will be six months. Wound&#xD;
      quality at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months after starting application will be measured in terms of&#xD;
      erythema level, melanin level, transepidermal water loss by using Cutometer速 and scar quality&#xD;
      (Vancouver scar scale as well as Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale). Adverse&#xD;
      reactions will also be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Sericin hydrogel sheet impregnated with EBN extract will be used as a primary dressing for preventing scar development at one-half of the STSG donor site. Then, the donor site will be covered with adhesive tape (secondary dressing). The application of primary and secondary dressings will be done once daily after shower in the morning or evening. Both dressings will be recommended to wear over the donor site for 8-12 hours per day. Patients will be advised to remove both dressings before shower to clean the donor site and the surrounding skin, and then replace them with new wound dressing sheets in the next day. The duration of the dressing application will be 6 months.</description>
