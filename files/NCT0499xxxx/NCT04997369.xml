  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Rezum system is an ablative procedure for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia&#xD;
      (BPH). One of the limitations of the technology is the need for post-operative&#xD;
      catheterization up to 5 days. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of employing&#xD;
      Catheterless Rezum post-operatively in patients with normal or strong bladder contractility.&#xD;
      Upon a positive outcome of interim analysis, the effectiveness of Catheterless Rezum will be&#xD;
      assessed at five sites for the multicenter phase.&#xD;
