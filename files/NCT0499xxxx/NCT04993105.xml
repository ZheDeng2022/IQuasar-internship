    <textblock>
      study was conducted to check the effectiveness of graston on patients with chronic plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis. After screening from inclusion exclusion criteria.Data will be randomly divided in&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graston assisted release of plantar fascia is used for soft tissue mobilization. Pain level&#xD;
      using NPRS, score on FADI and dorsiflexion restriction using LUNGE test will be performed&#xD;
      before any treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis is one of the most common cause of pain in foot and calf areas effecting up&#xD;
      to 10% of the total population.(1) On assessment of such patients pain on calcaneal&#xD;
      tuberosity on passive dorsiflexion is very common.(2) Common features include sharp stabbing&#xD;
      pain specially in morning which subsides after brief walking but may return after prolong&#xD;
      period of weight bearing and walking.In general, plantar fasciitis occurs when the plantar&#xD;
      fascia is injured from too much pressure or activity, but there is often not a clear cause or&#xD;
      triggering event(3)People who are overweight and people who have tight calf muscles,&#xD;
      high-arched feet, or flat feet are at risk of plantar fasciitis(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple measures can often be taken to lessen the symptoms of plantar fasciitis(5). If a clear&#xD;
      cause such as a sudden increase in high-impact exercise can be identified, then decreasing&#xD;
      the amount of physical activity may be helpful.(6)Daily stretching of the plantar fascia and&#xD;
      the calf muscles should be performed, and ice can be applied to the affected area for 10 to&#xD;
      20 minutes at a time 2 to 3 times per day. Wearing shoes with good arch supports can also&#xD;
      improve symptoms, and taping the bottom of the feet or using shoe inserts called orthotics&#xD;
      are other ways to provide additional foot support. .(6) Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      medications such as ibuprofen may provide short-term relief(7). If pain persists, steroid&#xD;
      injections may be given into the foot to reduce the pain. Although most people experience&#xD;
      improvement or resolution of symptoms over time, surgery may be considered in rare cases if&#xD;
      the pain does not improve after several months of conservative treatments(8). Graston is a&#xD;
      used for soft tissue mobilization. Graston Technique is performed by specifically designed&#xD;
      stainless steel instruments with beveled edges to perform soft tissue mobilization graston is&#xD;
      used in a multi direction strokes on skin at a 30° to 60° angle to the treatment site(8)This&#xD;
      technique allows the clinician to feel irregularities in the soft tissue texture through the&#xD;
      movement of the gliding tools(8)In addition to removing scar tissue adhesions, Graston&#xD;
      instruments have been applied to boost the proliferation of extracellular matrix fibroblasts,&#xD;
      improve ion transport, and decrease cell matrix adhesions as has been hypothesized with&#xD;
      transverse frictional massage and extra corporeal shock wave therapy.(6)Studies have shown&#xD;
      that the controlled micro trauma induced through GT increased fibroblasts recruitment and&#xD;
      activation in an animal model. Additional studies have shown clinical efficacy using GT for&#xD;
      the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar compartment syndrome(7) and trigger thumb(8).&#xD;
      Graston instrument has been used for relieving pressure of soft tissue mobilization and&#xD;
      release very effectively for years. It is used by manual therapist and is also known as&#xD;
      instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization(IASTM). The instruments are specially designed&#xD;
      for manual therapist to identify the areas of adhesion in soft tissue and focus on the&#xD;
      release.As proved by Carey-Loghmani and Hammer the GISTM is used to detect and treat soft&#xD;
      tissue lesions.The application of the GISTM initiates the inflammatory process, which allows&#xD;
      for healing and scar tissue remodeling to take place(9). Although a recent systematic review&#xD;
      have reported on current evidence to support the use of conservative interventions for&#xD;
      individuals identified as having CPHP. Martin et al reported that soft-tissue mobilization&#xD;
      procedures should also be considered in the plan of care for individuals with CPHP(10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent research suggests that plantar &quot;fasciitis&quot; manifests itself as a noninflammatory&#xD;
      degenerative process, and hence, the term fasciosis may be more appropriate.(6) Brian looney&#xD;
      et al proved graston to be an effective tool to increase pain and dorsiflexion range in&#xD;
      patients with plantar fasciitis through case series(11). The authors reported that the&#xD;
      participants demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in pain ratings and functional&#xD;
      improvements in Global Rating of Change Scale and Lower Extremity Functional Scale&#xD;
      scores(11)Daniels and Morrell reported the effectiveness of using the Graston technique to&#xD;
      perform IASTM in addition to joint manipulation to manage a 10-year-old male athlete with&#xD;
      bilateral plantar fasciitis(12). In addition, the biologic evidence that suggests that PF is&#xD;
      not truly an inflammatory condition but one of fibrosis supports the theorized mechanism&#xD;
      behind the graston(2) .Perhaps the use of instruments allows the clinician to introduce a&#xD;
      more controlled amount of micro trauma into an area of scar tissue or excessive fibrosis(8).&#xD;
      Research suggests that the response of this microtrauma would result in the healing process&#xD;
      by initiating inflammatory phase of healing and, ultimately, tissue remodeling through proper&#xD;
      realignment of collagen fibers(11).A pilot study by Edward R. Jones et al demonstrates that&#xD;
      inclusion of IASTM using the Graston technique for chronic plantar heel pain lasting longer&#xD;
      than 6 weeks is a feasible intervention warranting further study(13). Andrew L. Miners and&#xD;
      Tracy L. Bougie showed a specific protocol of heat, graston assisted soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization, eccentric exercise, stretching, and cryotherapy appeared to facilitate a rapid&#xD;
      and complete recovery from chronic Achilles tendinopathy(14).&#xD;
