  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) group founded guidelines for treating&#xD;
      patients with clinically significant diabetic macular edema (DME) with focal/grid macular&#xD;
      laser photocoagulation. Since then, macular laser, and steroids, were the main therapies for&#xD;
      the treatment of DME until anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF) drugs were&#xD;
      developed after a growing body of scientific evidence implicated VEGF in the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      process of DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-VEGF drugs have been implicated in the treatment of DME. VEGF has been shown to play an&#xD;
      important role in the occurrence of increased vascular permeability in DME. VEGF levels are&#xD;
      significantly higher in patients with DME and extensive leakage than in patients with minimal&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies such as Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research [DRCR] Network studies, RESTORE&#xD;
      Study, RISE and RIDE Research Group, and The BOLT Study have supported the use of anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents in the treatment of DME with better visual outcomes using anti-VEGF injections alone&#xD;
      or in combination with other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ocular complications of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have been reported&#xD;
      including endophthalmitis, cataract, and retinal detachment. The different effects on macular&#xD;
      perfusion between different anti-VEGFs have yet to be fully concluded with mixed conclusions&#xD;
      that it increases or decreases or has no effect on perfusion of the macula in response to&#xD;
      Anti-VEGF treatment. In many of these studies, however, patients with more ischemic retinas&#xD;
      were not included. Retinal ischemia is a vital factor determining the diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      progression and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) detects blood flow by analyzing signal&#xD;
      decorrelation between two sequential OCT cross-sectional scans at the same location. As it&#xD;
      detects the movements of red blood corpuscles within the vessels, compared to the stationary&#xD;
      retinal surroundings, which will result in signal disparity and imaging The split-spectrum&#xD;
      amplitude-decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm improves the signal to noise ratio.&#xD;
      OCTA is considered a reliable tool in the detection and quantification of macular ischemia in&#xD;
      diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to compare the effect of repeated intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of ranibizumab and bevacizumab on the perfusion of different capillary layers in&#xD;
      the macula of diabetic patients using OCTA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the major cause of blindness in developed but also in developing&#xD;
      countries. The disruption of the blood-retinal barrier and the subsequent accumulation of&#xD;
      fluid in the intraretinal layers result in diabetic macular edema (DME), the leading cause of&#xD;
      central vision loss in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) group founded guidelines for treating&#xD;
      patients with clinically significant DME (CSME) with focal/grid macular laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation. Since then, macular laser, and steroids, were the main therapies for&#xD;
      treatment of DME until anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (anti-VEGF) drugs were&#xD;
      developed after a growing body of scientific evidence implicated VEGF in the pathophysiologic&#xD;
      process of DME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-VEGF drugs have been implicated in the treatment of DME. VEGF has been shown to play an&#xD;
      important role in the occurrence of increased vascular permeability in DME. VEGF levels are&#xD;
      significantly higher in patients with DME and extensive leakage than in patients with minimal&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies such as Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research [DRCR] Network studies, RESTORE&#xD;
      Study, RISE and RIDE Research Group, and The BOLT Study have supported the use of anti-VEGF&#xD;
      agents in the treatment of DME with better visual outcomes using anti-VEGF injections alone&#xD;
      or in combination with other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRCR network protocol T found statistically insignificant difference between ranibizumab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab on visual acuity and central macular thickness in diabetic macular edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several ocular complications of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections have been reported&#xD;
      including endophthalmitis, cataract, and retinal detachment. The different effects on macular&#xD;
      perfusion between different anti-VEGFs have yet to be fully concluded with mixed conclusions&#xD;
      that it increases or decreases or has no effect on perfusion of macula in response to&#xD;
      Anti-VEGF treatment.in many of these studies, however, patients with more ischemic retinas&#xD;
      were not included. Retinal ischemia is a vital factor determining the diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      progression and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using ocular ultrasound some studies showed retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction in eyes&#xD;
      treated with anti-VEGF, while others showed decreased blood flow velocities in all&#xD;
      retro-bulbar arteries after intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF. This may indicate that&#xD;
      anti-VEGF may have an effect on ocular perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluorescein angiography (FA) was the method used to assess changes in macular perfusion after&#xD;
      anti-VEGF injections in most of the studies. Despite its clinical value, however, FA is known&#xD;
      to have documented risks. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an excellent&#xD;
      non-invasive modality to acquire high-resolution images of the retinal vasculature that can&#xD;
      be utilized in the treatment of retinal disease without the need for dye injection. It allows&#xD;
      the visualization of both the superficial and deep retinal capillary layers separately and&#xD;
      the construction of microvascular flow maps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCTA detects blood flow by analyzing signal decorrelation between two sequential OCT&#xD;
      cross-sectional scans at the same location. As it detects the movements of red blood&#xD;
      corpuscles within the vessels, compared to the stationary retinal surroundings, which will&#xD;
      result in signal disparity and imaging The split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography&#xD;
      (SSADA) algorithm improves the signal to noise ratio. OCTA is considered a reliable tool in&#xD;
      the detection and quantification of macular ischemia in diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to compare the effect of repeated intravitreal&#xD;
      injections of ranibizumab and bevacizumab on the perfusion of different capillary layers in&#xD;
      the macula of diabetic patients using OCTA.&#xD;
