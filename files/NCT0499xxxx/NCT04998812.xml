      This study will evaluate the potential placental transfer of ocrelizumab in women with&#xD;
      clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or multiple sclerosis (MS) [in line with the locally&#xD;
      approved indications] whose last dose of ocrelizumab was administered any time from 6 months&#xD;
      before the last menstrual period (LMP) through to the first trimester (up to gestational week&#xD;
      13) of pregnancy, and the corresponding pharmacodynamic effects (B cell levels) in the&#xD;
      infant.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Documentation that first and second obstetric ultrasound has been conducted before&#xD;
             enrolment during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documentation that the last exposure to ocrelizumab occurred up to 6 months before the&#xD;
