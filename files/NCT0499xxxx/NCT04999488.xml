  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to gather data on whether oral supplementation of CoQ10 is enriched&#xD;
      in the blood and muscles in older adults with sarcopenia. This study involves 28 consecutive&#xD;
      days of oral CoQ10 supplementation to explore changes in muscle strength, aerobic capacity&#xD;
      and physical function with CoQ10 supplementation.&#xD;

             exercise session (approximately 30 mins) per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant must be sarcopenic, defined as having a skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)&#xD;
             of &lt;7.25 kg/m2 for males or &lt;5.67 kg/m2 for females via DEXA scan.&#xD;

             any forms needed throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an&#xD;
             Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee, and provided Health Insurance&#xD;
             Portability and Accountability Act authorization (HIPAA) or other privacy&#xD;
             authorization prior to any participation in study.&#xD;

             stroke) ≤ 6 months prior to screening visit; or stated history of congestive heart&#xD;
             failure; or participant has evidence of cardiovascular disease assessed during the ECG&#xD;
             at screening. In the event of a positive stress test, participants are referred to&#xD;
             their primary care physician. If the electrocardiogram (ECG) is determined to be a&#xD;
             false positive, participant may be allowed to participate in study after confirmatory&#xD;
