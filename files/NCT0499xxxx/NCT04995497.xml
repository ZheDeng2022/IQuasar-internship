  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interfascial plane blocks have been developed for analgesia, among which the erector spinae&#xD;
      plane (ESP) has gained popularity. The ESP block has been hypothesized to provide truncal&#xD;
      analgesia by spread of local anesthetic into the paravertebral space. Recent studies have&#xD;
      contested this idea showing unreliability in the spread of the local anesthetic into the&#xD;
      paravertebral space.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain is a significant issue following open heart surgeries and poorly&#xD;
      controlled pain can result in significant cardiorespiratory morbidity. Many patients suffer&#xD;
      pain both at rest (49%) and on movement (62%) following open heart surgeries via sternotomy&#xD;
      and adequate pain management requires closer re-assessment and treatment. The intensity of&#xD;
      pain is noted to be higher in the first 48 hours post surgery and hence modalities to control&#xD;
      pain may make the greatest difference in the first 2 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced recovery pathways utilizing multimodal analgesia have shown significant analgesic&#xD;
      and opioid sparing benefit while minimizing ICU and length of hospital stays. Some multimodal&#xD;
      regimens have also incorporated regional blocks but the optimal analgesic regimen remains&#xD;
      elusive. The ESP block has been hypothesized to provide truncal anesthesia by spread of local&#xD;
      anesthetic into the paravertebral space, but recent studies contest this idea. Bilateral&#xD;
      paravertebral blocks can result in higher than acceptable levels of local anesthetic in both&#xD;
      cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients and this may be true following bilateral erector&#xD;
      spinae plane (ESP) as well. Hence, the pharmacokinetic profile of administered local&#xD;
      anesthetics is necessary given the lack of information about the local anesthetic systemic&#xD;
      levels following bilateral ESP.&#xD;

    <description>Pain scores will be recorded at baseline and at two hour intervals. The patients are asked to report their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being no pain and 10 is the most imaginable. The variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation.</description>

    <measure>Quantitate the amount of opioid medication required to provide pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>First 2 days post surgical intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To assess if either route (IV or ESP catheter) of lidocaine provided maximal pain relief when compared to its counterpart, the type and amount of medication provided the subject will be recorded. The amounts of opioid medications required to provide relief during the first 48 hours will be tabulated in morphine equivalents. A comparison will be made between the two route to see if one route is optimal over the other. The variables will be presented as mean and standard deviation.</description>
