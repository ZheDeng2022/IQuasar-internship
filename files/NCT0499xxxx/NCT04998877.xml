  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand the relationship between information&#xD;
      collected by wearable devices and clinical measurements in people with heart failure with&#xD;
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and others without HFpEF. This is an observational study&#xD;
      with no study intervention or randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo baseline history and physical, 12-lead EKG, laboratory studies of&#xD;
      blood/serum/urine, echocardiography, activity questionnaire, 6 minute walk test, and&#xD;
      placement of wearable devices to be worn for up to 14 days (activity monitors, EKG monitor&#xD;
      and continuous glucose monitor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will return after ~14 days of wearing the devices and repeat of physical&#xD;
      examination, 12-lead EKG, 6 minute walk test, activity questionnaire. Additionally,&#xD;
      participants will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of their leg with exercise,&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and, for those who qualify, magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) of their heart with exercise.&#xD;
