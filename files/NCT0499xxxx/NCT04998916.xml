  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), specifically&#xD;
      TMS at a frequency known as theta burst stimulation (TBS), to see how it affects the brain&#xD;
      and changes the brain's response to alcohol-related pictures. TMS and TBS are stimulation&#xD;
      techniques that use magnetic pulses to temporarily excite specific brain areas in awake&#xD;
      people (without the need for surgery, anesthetic, or other invasive procedures). TBS, which&#xD;
      is a form of TMS, will be applied over the medial prefrontal cortex, (MPFC), which has been&#xD;
      shown to be involved with drinking patterns and alcohol consumption. This study will test&#xD;
      whether TBS can be used as an alternative tool to reduce the desire to use alcohol and&#xD;
      reducing the brain's response to alcohol-related pictures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With advances in optogenetic stimulation techniques, preclinical studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that activity in frontal-striatal neural circuits has a causal influence on heavy drinking&#xD;
      and alcohol reinstatement. Clinically, however, this research has not yet been translated&#xD;
      into a neural circuit based therapeutic technique for patients with alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      (AUD). The long term goal of this multidisciplinary research study team is to determine the&#xD;
      optimal parameters through which non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used&#xD;
      to improve alcohol drinking outcomes (abstinence, heavy drinking days) among individuals&#xD;
      seeking behavioral treatment for AUD. Building on a foundation of several target&#xD;
      identification studies and a small double-blinded clinical trial in treatment-engaged AUD&#xD;
      patients performed by the study team in the Charleston Alcohol Research Center, here the&#xD;
      investigator proposes a double-blind placebo controlled, randomized study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of theta burst stimulation (TBS) to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a tool to&#xD;
      decrease drinking and brain reactivity to alcohol cues among treatment-seeking individuals&#xD;
      with AUD. Individuals will be screened initially by the Clinical Intake and Assessment core,&#xD;
      then given an opportunity to enroll in this study, provide informed consent, and be&#xD;
      randomized to receive real or sham TBS to the mPFC 36 sessions (3x/day on each of 3 days/week&#xD;
      over 4 weeks, i.e., 12 days). The scientific premise of this 5 year proposal is that, by&#xD;
      modulating the neural circuits that regulate alcohol cue-reactivity it will be possible to&#xD;
      increase alcohol abstinence rates and decrease heavy drinking days over a 4 month period.&#xD;
      With the combined scientific expertise in brain stimulation, neuroimaging, alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder research in the Charleston Alcohol Research Center, and clinical practice at MUSC,&#xD;
      the study team is uniquely suited to develop this critical line of research. The outcomes of&#xD;
      the proposed Aims will provide an evidence-based foundation for a multisite clinical trial&#xD;
      and will hasten progress towards developing a new neural circuit based treatment for patients&#xD;
      with AUD.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome analysis will examine the TMS treatment effect (active vs. sham) on drinking outcomes-measured as percent heavy drinking days (PHDD) (heavy drinking day defined as 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men)-in the follow-up period beginning after the final treatment session. Collected via timeline follow back (TLFB) in three 28-day (month) intervals, this will be analyzed using multivariate mixture models to consider the effect of time (month after treatment) and the interaction of treatment with time, baseline drinking, number of treatment sessions received, and any other potential covariates (e.g., age, nicotine use, time since last drink). Drinking data will be collected on all randomized participants, irrespective of treatment completion. Lower percentages indicate fewer heavy drinking days in the 28-day interval.</description>

    <measure>Change in alcohol cue task MRI activation 1-week post treatment from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 1), Post-treatment (4-weeks from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>For the alcohol cue reactivity task, multivariate mixture model analyses will be used to calculate the difference in activation between the ALC and BEV blocks for vmPFC and ventral striatal ROIs, and to analyze maximum likelihood estimates for ALC vs. BEV activation as a function of time, treatment, and the cross-level interactions of these factors. Specifically, the cue task stimuli will be nested within time (post- vs. pre-treatment scan); time will be nested within participant; and participants will be nested within treatment (Sham vs. Active).</description>

    <description>The MagVenture MagPro system has an integrated, active sham which passes current through two surface electrodes placed on the scalp. The electrodes will be placed on the left frontalis muscle for all sessions. A patient identification card will randomize participants to receive either real or sham stimulation. This system maintains blinding by a gyroscope in the coil which indicates to the clinical staff whether the coil should be rotated up or down for this participant once the card is entered into the machine. One side of the coil is active, the other is sham. The integrity of the double-blind procedure will be assessed by asking the patients and study personnel rate their confidence regarding whether they thought they received real or sham (scale 1-10).</description>
