  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the study will be to investigate the incidences and risk factors for&#xD;
      postoperative delirium (POD) after hip fracture surgery in elderly patients aged â‰¥ 65 years&#xD;
      in five different Southeast and East Asian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate factors in the hospital environments, such as noise levels, ambient&#xD;
           lighting, nursing ratios, ward bedding and climate control, that contribute to&#xD;
           similarities and/or differences in POD occurrences in different countries and health&#xD;
           systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate patient factors, such as disease burden, mental health, education levels,&#xD;
           and socioeconomic factors, that contribute to similarities and/or differences in POD&#xD;
           occurrences in different countries and health systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To quantify the direct and indirect costs, as well as resource utilization, resulting&#xD;
           from the development of POD in each country&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fractures encompass all fractures of the upper (proximal) part of the thigh bone (femur).&#xD;
      They are commonly divided into two types: intracapsular fractures, which represent those that&#xD;
      occur within or proximal to the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the femur, and&#xD;
      extracapsular, which represent fractures occurring below or distal to the attachment of the&#xD;
      hip joint capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip fractures are common in elderly people with an annual incidence rate estimated as&#xD;
      1.29/1000 person-years in men and 2.24/1000 person-years in women. It is the most common&#xD;
      condition requiring physical rehabilitation in older adults. The majority (&gt;95%) of people&#xD;
      undergo hip surgery following hip fracture. The location of the fracture, stability, and&#xD;
      degree of comminution (number of pieces the bone breaks into) determine which operative&#xD;
      procedure should be used to repair the hip fracture. The aim of surgery, irrespective of the&#xD;
      type of operation, is to reduce pain, facilitate early weight-bearing mobility to improve&#xD;
      outcome, and facilitate independence in activities of daily living, such as bathing,&#xD;
      dressing, and continence. However, hip fracture is associated with significant pain and loss&#xD;
      of independence and function. Although 33-37% of patients return to their prior level of&#xD;
      function within six months including those needing assistance, only 24% of people are&#xD;
      independently mobile six months after hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major complication in elderly hip fracture patients is POD, with an incidence rate varying&#xD;
      from 13% to 65%. POD after hip surgery was significantly associated with non-home discharge&#xD;
      disposition, and higher odds of 30-day readmissions and 30-day mortality. POD is also&#xD;
      associated with poor outcomes, such as lower rates of immediate postoperative weight bearing,&#xD;
      increased pressure sores, and poorer recovery of activities of daily living. In addition, a&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis showed that POD after hip surgery translates into long-term cognitive&#xD;
      disease burden, by increasing the risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline by a marked&#xD;
      odds ratio of 8.957.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No strong evidence exists regarding the treatment of delirium. Several studies performed on&#xD;
      delirium prevention in hip fracture patients have described the use of care bundles such as&#xD;
      orthogeriatric care and comprehensive geriatric care as an effective potential treatment for&#xD;
      this patient group, although the evidence remains weak. However, Inouye et al stated that in&#xD;
      the general geriatric population, 30% to 40% of the delirium episodes could be prevented by&#xD;
      addressing modifiable risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies in the five Asian countries involved in this study show that the incidence&#xD;
      of POD after hip fracture surgery varied greatly between countries and within countries:&#xD;
      12.8-27.9% in Japan, 5.07-51.3% in Korea, 13.4-45% in Thailand and 7.2% in Singapore. The&#xD;
      incidence of POD in Malaysia can be estimated at 9-12% as reported in the recent HIP Attack&#xD;
      trial. However, these studies were heterogenous in terms of patient selection, study&#xD;
      methodology and hospital systems. These variations make it difficult to draw a direct&#xD;
      comparison regarding the incidence of POD amongst Asian countries and to Western cohorts.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the cost of POD to patients and institutions, both direct and indirect, is very&#xD;
      poorly defined in Asian countries.&#xD;
