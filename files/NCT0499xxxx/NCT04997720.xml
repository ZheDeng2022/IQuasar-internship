      A single group study will be carried out in the Microsurgery Laboratory, Neurosurgery&#xD;
      Department, Hospital de Clínicas, and the Center for Microsurgical Skills of the Argentine&#xD;
      Association of Neurosurgery. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      theoretical-practical course learning in neurosurgery and plastic surgery residents.&#xD;

      Introduction: In the second half of the 20th century, the use of the surgical microscope&#xD;
      became popular in neurosurgery. In the last twenty years, simulation has gained worldwide&#xD;
      acceptance as a teaching tool in medicine, especially microsurgery. For this, various&#xD;
      training models have been created.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To evaluate the effect of the theoretical-practical course learning in&#xD;
      neurosurgery and plastic surgery residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: A single group study will be carried out in the Microsurgery&#xD;
      Laboratory, Neurosurgery Department, Hospital de Clínicas, and the Center for Microsurgical&#xD;
      Skills of the Argentine Association of Neurosurgery. Medical doctors of both genders will be&#xD;
      included in the first three years of neurosurgical or plastic surgery training from any&#xD;
      center in Argentina. The course will be theoretical-practical, lasting eight hours, divided&#xD;
      into two meetings with a theoretical class and practical microsurgery exercises. It will be&#xD;
      supervised by teachers microsurgery experienced. An Initial and final evaluation will be&#xD;
      carried out and the scores obtained between both theoretical and practical evaluations will&#xD;
      be compared. In the practical evaluations, the time and the SMART scale will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be reported as absolute and relative numbers. The normality of the&#xD;
      data will be verified by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variables will be reported&#xD;
      as mean and standard deviations or median and interquartile ranges. Student's t test,&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare means, when appropriate, according to the&#xD;
      distribution of variables. The categorical variables will be compared with the χ2 test.&#xD;
