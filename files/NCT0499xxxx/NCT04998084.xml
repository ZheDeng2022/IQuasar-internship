      The study is aim to detect common microbial profiles and metabolic pathways in patients&#xD;
      belonging to the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapy naïve newly diagnosed Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and&#xD;
           pouchitis patients. Studying this group of patients will enable the detection of&#xD;
           microbial profiles associated with disease onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients planned to commence biological therapy (with or without IBD). Studying this&#xD;
           group of patients will enable the detection of microbial profiles associated with&#xD;
           response to biological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IBD patients in complete remission (treated or untreated with biologics). Following this&#xD;
           group of patients will enable the detection of microbial profiles associated with&#xD;
           disease exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A prospective cohort study. Setting: The investigators will prospectively&#xD;
      collect clinical, behavioral and environmental data of patients participating in the study.&#xD;
      Data will be collected according to a uniform standardized protocol specifically adapted to&#xD;
      the needs of the study and shared between the collaborators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Eligible patients, who sign an informed consent form and answer to all the&#xD;
      study inclusion criteria. Patients will be informed of the study by their treating physician,&#xD;
      recruited and followed throughout the follow-up period by study coordinators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      sample size: sample size was estimated according to clinical capabilities of the researcher.&#xD;
      We aim to collect data from a total of 1000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule: Data will be collected between the years 2019-2024.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and disease characteristics At baseline, demographic characteristics, medical history&#xD;
      and specifically IBD phenotype, severity, extent and location, disease duration, previous&#xD;
      medicinal treatment will be documented. Baseline and follow-up study visits which will&#xD;
      include biological sample collection and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete questionnaires to account for their lifestyle, sleep,&#xD;
      quality of life and disease related symptoms and outcomes. Physician global assessment (PGA),&#xD;
      disease severity using clinical scores (HBI and SCCAI scores for CD and UC patients) and&#xD;
      biochemical data (CRP, fecal calprotectin) will be documented.&#xD;
