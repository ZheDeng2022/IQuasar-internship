  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposed study is to pilot test a novel treatment model (PRE-CARE)&#xD;
      addressing unmet social needs for families of preschool-age children with Attention&#xD;
      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The investigators will conduct an adaptive,&#xD;
      pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention with parents of 60 low-income&#xD;
      children age 3-5 (36-71 months) with ADHD symptoms in order to: optimize intervention&#xD;
      delivery; field test study logistics (e.g., recruitment, enrollment, randomization,&#xD;
      retention); explore putative intervention mechanisms; and obtain estimates of study&#xD;
      parameters to plan an appropriately powered RCT of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PRE-CARE intervention is adapted from Well Child Care, Evaluation, Community, Resources,&#xD;
      Advocacy, Referral, Education (WE CARE), a screening and referral intervention that has been&#xD;
      shown to be feasible and effective in addressing the family psychosocial stressors of&#xD;
      low-income families seen in pediatric medical homes. Given the negative impact that&#xD;
      socioeconomic stressors can have on the health and development of young children with ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms, tailored interventions such as PRE-CARE may serve as a vital early intervention&#xD;
      strategy to promote long-term well-being.&#xD;
