  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled, 2 months clinical trial. The&#xD;
      objective is to investigate the feasibility, effects and side-effects of virtual&#xD;
      reality-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT) vs. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      on alcohol intake in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the major randomized clinical trial, a total of 10 participants with alcohol&#xD;
      dependence are included in a pilot trial. This is done to examine the feasibility of the&#xD;
      following elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) adherence to the intervention and drop-outs ii) the therapists' theoretical and practical&#xD;
      abilities to use the virtual reality (VR) equipment iii) the time spent on virtual reality&#xD;
      during the therapy session iv) the need for technical support v) the collaboration in the&#xD;
      project group and vi) the participants' experience of virtual reality-assisted cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (VRCBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pilot trial, patients receive standardized alcohol treatment for alcohol&#xD;
      dependence at the Novavis outpatient clinics based on national guidelines from health&#xD;
      authorities. Three of the therapy sessions contain VR-CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seeking alcohol treatment in the Novaví outpatient clinics are informed orally and&#xD;
      in writing about the research project, and if they are interested, an information meeting is&#xD;
      booked. If patients exhibit abstinence, these are treated prior to a possible information&#xD;
      meeting by doctors and nurses in Novaví. If the patient wishes to participate and meets the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria, informed consent is obtained, and screening is conducted using&#xD;
      questionnaires described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening sessions, patiens medical history is obtained, as well as patients' alcohol&#xD;
      intake over the past 30 days is recorded via Timeline Follow-back (TLFB). Patients are also&#xD;
      asked about previous alcohol dependence treatment and general information about psychosocial&#xD;
      factors incl. education, work, marital status, and functional level using Global Assessment&#xD;
      of functioning (GAF). In addition, alcohol-related problems are assessed using the Alcohol&#xD;
      Users Identification Test (AUDIT), abstinence using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal&#xD;
      Assessment of Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-Ar), intake of other drugs using the Drug User&#xD;
      Identification Test (DUDIT), alcohol craving using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). The&#xD;
      Becks questionnaires, Depression Inventory 2 (BDI-II) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI), are&#xD;
      included to assess the degree of anxiety and depression, and in addition, tests of mental&#xD;
      function are performed using the Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included participants will in collaboration with their therapist schedule a standard course&#xD;
      of treatment based on national guidelines from health authorities. After inclusion,&#xD;
      participants are randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 3 sessions of VR-CBT (Group A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CBT without VR (Group B, control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in group A are exposed to VR-simulated high-risk situations filmed in a&#xD;
      restaurant to trigger alcohol cravings of which the participants are subsequently trained to&#xD;
      handle by trained therapists using CBT-based techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in group B receive the same treatment without VR exposure. There will be&#xD;
      weekly therapy sessions of approx. 1 hour for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention deviates from standard treatment, as none of the participants receive&#xD;
      pharmaceutical alcohol treatment during the treatment period except for abstinence treatment&#xD;
      if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening the patient (ensuring that all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are met) the patient is included. Participants are randomly allocated to either VR-CBT og&#xD;
      CBT, 5 participants in each group. After randomization, the therapist ensures that the&#xD;
      participant receives the correct treatment and performs the alcohol craving assessment during&#xD;
      each VR-CBT session unblinded using visual analog score (VAS). The study staff conducting the&#xD;
      remaining data collections and the entire data analysis are blinded, until the database is&#xD;
      opened at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient must attend a follow-up visit 1 week and 1 month after the last session (session&#xD;
      3), where data collection will take place using the before mentioned questionnaires. The&#xD;
      follow-up visit will be approx. 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes are performed using the intention-to-treat principle, where all&#xD;
      patients who have become randomized and has received a minimum of 1 session of VRCBT (group&#xD;
      A) or CBT without VR (group B), is included in the analysis. Missing data are implemented&#xD;
      through the multiple imputation method and the analyzes are performed in the program &quot;R&quot; with&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05 and 2-sided test. All continuous effect measures are analyzed using ANOVA from&#xD;
      baseline to most recent measurement, and categorical data are analyzed using chi2 analysis.&#xD;
      All data distributions will be assessed for normality by visual inspection of histogram and&#xD;
      by Q-Q plots. If data is not normally distributed, log transformation is performed, and if&#xD;
      this is not successful, non-parametric testing is used.&#xD;
