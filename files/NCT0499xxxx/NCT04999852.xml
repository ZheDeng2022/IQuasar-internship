  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) is a passive acoustic intervention that is designed as a&#xD;
      &quot;neural exercise&quot; to promote efficient regulation of autonomic state. Prior research has&#xD;
      shown that the SSP can improve autonomic function, auditory hypersensitivities, and emotion&#xD;
      regulation in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders. This observational pilot study is&#xD;
      being conducted to establish methods for an upcoming randomized controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      utility of the SSP for trauma treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll clients at the Spencer Psychology clinic who are set to take part in&#xD;
      SSP under the supervision of their therapist. Because the therapists have participated in the&#xD;
      design of the protocol and will participate in data collection and analysis, SSP will be&#xD;
      considered a research procedure. In addition to taking part in SSP, subjects complete a set&#xD;
      of questionnaires and have their pulse measured before starting the SSP intervention, after&#xD;
      having completed 2/5 hours of the SSP, one week after completing all 5 hours of the SSP, and&#xD;
      one month after completing the SSP intervention. The investigators will also pull relevant&#xD;
      information from Spencer Psychology's medical records to document diagnosis, track client&#xD;
      progress during study, and augment self-reported demographics.&#xD;

    <description>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for the DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item self report, will be used. Total symptom severity scores range from 0 to 80, with higher scores indicating higher symptomology (poorer outcome).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>2--4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), 7-item self report will be used. Scores range from 0-21 points, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety symptoms (poorer outcome).</description>

    <measure>Self-reported disruption of autonomic reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>2--4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ), 20-item self-report, be used. Raw scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater level of symptoms associated with autonomic activity (poorer outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean heart period during posture shifts</measure>
    <time_frame>2--4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mean heart period during supine, sitting, and standing posture shifts will be measured using an earlobe pulse sensor (Photoplethysmography). Longer heart period (higher values, reported in milliseconds) are indicative of lower autonomic arousal states. This metric is intended as a measure of mechanism and and high values may be associated with a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during posture shifts</measure>
    <time_frame>2--4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) - a component of heart rate variability - will be measured during supine, sitting, and standing posture shifts using an earlobe pulse sensor (Photoplethysmography). Greater RSA (higher values, reported in ln[milliseconds]^2) is associated with greater parasympathetic activity, which can help reduce physiological threat responses. This metric is intended to measure mechanism and high values may be associated with a better outcome.</description>
