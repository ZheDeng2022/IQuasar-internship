  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By-products from the wine industry pose serious problems of management, both from an economic&#xD;
      and environmental point of view. Although traditionally the use of by-products of the wine&#xD;
      sector has been limited to the production of biogas and energy, or its use as animal feed or&#xD;
      agricultural fertilizer, there is greater interest in the use of these by-products as a&#xD;
      potential source of functional ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the main cause of mortality in Europe, with hypertension&#xD;
      being one of the main CVD risk factors. It has been shown that lowering blood pressure&#xD;
      through behavioral and pharmacological interventions significantly improves CVD. Currently,&#xD;
      one of the most widely used pharmacological therapies to treat hypertension is based on the&#xD;
      use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as Captopril or Enalapril. ACE&#xD;
      plays a key role in arterial pressure regulation, catalyzing the production of angiotensin&#xD;
      II, an octapeptide with potent vasoconstrictor activity. In addition, ACE catalyzes the&#xD;
      inactivation of bradykinin, peptide with vasodilator activity. The evaluation of various&#xD;
      potential by-products of the wine industry for the generation of functional ingredients&#xD;
      showed that the by-product called wine from the lees of the Cabernet variety (VLC) presented&#xD;
      beneficial effects on blood pressure in in vitro models as well as in vivo models using rats&#xD;
      with hypertension.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis: daily consumption of dry wine from the lees of the Cabernet variety (VLC)&#xD;
      can induce a decrease on blood pressure in individuals with elevated blood pressure and grade&#xD;
      1 hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of daily intake of dry VLC on the&#xD;
      change in systolic blood pressure values in individuals with high blood pressure and grade 1&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of dry VLC on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in diastolic blood pressure values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in body weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in the circulating values of total cholesterol, LDL-c, HDL-c, triglycerides&#xD;
           and ApoB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in the atherogenic index of plasma, which combines triglycerides and HDL-c&#xD;
           values and which is considered a good indirect indicator of LDL-c particle size and&#xD;
           subclinical atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The change in the inflammation values analyzed by the marker high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
           protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled and double-blind nutritional&#xD;
      intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of subjects in the study will be 40. After the pre-screening visit, the&#xD;
      participants will be randomly divided into two groups of 20 participants, according to start&#xD;
      the study by taking the dry VLC or placebo for 5 weeks. At the end of the week 5 of the&#xD;
      study, when the first treatment is finished, there will be a washing period for 3 weeks and&#xD;
      then the treatment will be changed for another 5 weeks: a total of 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of dry VLC and placebo will be 3 g per day, presented in powder form in a single&#xD;
      container and with a measuring spoon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 g of dry VLC will contain 1.4 g of VLC and 1.6 g of maltodextrin used as carrier, with&#xD;
      3 g / kg of red fruit flavor and 900 mg / kg of RED TN 9014. The placebo will contain 3 g of&#xD;
      maltodextrin with 3 g / kg red fruit flavor and 900 mg / kg of RED TN 9014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The containers of the two treatments, the VLC and the placebo, will present the same shape&#xD;
      and appearance. The two products will present similar organoleptic characteristics of taste&#xD;
      and color.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each volunteer will make 5 visits, according to the crossover study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a pre-selection visit (to check inclusion / exclusion criteria) (V0; week1) and, in case&#xD;
           of meeting the inclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two study visits during the consumption of the first product (VLC or placebo), which&#xD;
           will take place on the first day of study (V1; week 2) and after 5 weeks of treatment&#xD;
           (V2; week 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  two study visits during the consumption of the second product (VLC or placebo), which&#xD;
           will take place after the three week washout period (V3; week 10) and after 5 weeks of&#xD;
           treatment (V4; week 15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all visits except the V0 visit, participants must present themselves in fasting conditions&#xD;
      of 8 hours to obtain blood. In addition, on V2 visits and V4 the participants will be asked&#xD;
      the presence / absence of adverse effects that could be associated with the consumption of&#xD;
      the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The products (VLC or placebo) will be given at visit V1 and V3, so that the participants will&#xD;
      have all the necessary treatment to carry out the 5 weeks of study with each of the products,&#xD;
      but they will not have simultaneously of the two products.&#xD;
&#xD;
