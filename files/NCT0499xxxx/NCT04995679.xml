  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Total knee revision arthroplasty is increasing in daily practice and will become more&#xD;
      relevant in the years to come. Bone loss is a significant challenge in total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) especially in revision procedures. Metaphyseal sleeves are widely used to&#xD;
      bypass bone loss and improve stability. This study aims to report the results of primary and&#xD;
      revision TKA (R-TKA) using metaphyseal sleeves.&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of implant's survivorship</measure>

    <description>A retrospective study was performed on patients who underwent TKA or Revision TKA using tibial and/or femoral metaphyseal sleeves to evaluate the implant's survivorship</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>A numerical rating scale (NRS) requires the patient to rate their pain on a defined scale. 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Western Ontario and Mc Master University (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is widely used in the evaluation of Hip and Knee Osteoarthritis. It is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 24 items divided into 3 subscales:&#xD;
Pain (5 items): during walking, using stairs, in bed, sitting or lying, and standing upright Stiffness (2 items): after first waking and later in the day Physical Function (17 items): using stairs, rising from sitting, standing, bending, walking, getting in / out of a car, shopping, putting on / taking off socks, rising from bed, lying in bed, getting in / out of bath, sitting, getting on / off toilet, heavy domestic duties, light domestic duties The test questions are scored on a scale of 0-4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4).&#xD;
A sum of the scores for all three subscales gives a total WOMAC score</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Oxford Knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery (arthroplasty). It is short, reproducible, valid and sensitive to clinically important changes.&#xD;
Each of the 12 answers are assigned the previously defined number of points. They range from 1 = least difficult to 5 = most difficult. The 12 ratings are then added together to give a total score used to assess the patient. The possible total score ranges from 12 to 60 points. Here, a low score (e.g. 12 points) indicates good outcomes and vice versa.</description>
