  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia, is a subjective sensation of dryness of the mouth. There are more than 700&#xD;
      medications that can lead to the salivary hypofunction that results in dry mouth. This study&#xD;
      will investigate a semi solid cohesive gel (referred to as Whitening Gel) that has the&#xD;
      primary marketed purpose of teeth whitening. We theorize that the whitening gel's retention&#xD;
      in the oral cavity is longer than rinse forms and this is likely to promote the flow of&#xD;
      saliva by stimulating taste buds which could alleviate the sensation of dryness in the oral&#xD;
      cavity. This will be a single center, two visit study investigating the effectiveness of&#xD;
      dryness in the oral cavity, whiteness of teeth, and teeth sensitivity after one week's use of&#xD;
      whitening agent.&#xD;

      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary aim: To see a reduction in the self-reported subjective perception of dryness in&#xD;
           the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary aims: To measure self-reported sensitivity of the teeth,. self-reported&#xD;
           perception of teeth whiteness, and objective measurement of improvement of saliva&#xD;
           production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia, is a subjective sensation of dryness of the mouth, which may have a significant&#xD;
      effect in a persons quality of life. The sensation of dryness of the mouth may be caused by&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases which attack the saliva producing glands irreversibly e.g., salivary&#xD;
      glands, or the sensation of dryness could be caused by therapeutic radiation, which can&#xD;
      destroy the salivary glands at the genetic level and impede their functions. Additionally,&#xD;
      there are more than 700 medications including antihypertensives, anti-anxiety agents,&#xD;
      psychiatric remedies, and antihistamines that can effect neural transmission. Neural&#xD;
      transmission is when the neuro transmission is hindered reversibly leading to the salivary&#xD;
      hypofunction that results in dry mouth. It is estimated that 12-47% of the elderly and&#xD;
      10-19.3% in their early 30's suffer from dry mouth (Thomson et al 2005)(Guggenheimer et al&#xD;
      2003). In a study, it was found that the prevalence of xerostomia was 10.0% (with no apparent&#xD;
      gender difference) among 32-year-olds and was significantly higher among those taking&#xD;
      antidepressants (odds ratio =4.7) (Murray et al 2006). At risk groups may present much higher&#xD;
      (60+%) rates of xerostomia. A systemic literature review suggests a prevalence of 27 -32% of&#xD;
      the medicated population suffer from xerostomia as a side effect (Guggenheimer et al 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, the bulk fluid of the oral cavity is very important in maintaining the functions and&#xD;
      balance in the oral cavity including candidiasis and enamel erosion prevention. In past&#xD;
      studies, residual mucosal fluid levels were seen to vary in different oral cavity sites from&#xD;
      an average of 70-100 μm (Collins et al 1987)(Pramanik et al 2010). In addition, the vault of&#xD;
      the hard palate has much less mucosal fluid thickness than the floor of the mouth. Over the&#xD;
      moisture layer is the lipid layer and reduction or loss of this moisture layer can contribute&#xD;
      to the subjective perception of the dryness in the mouth. An addition of the lipid layer will&#xD;
      also increase lubrication in the oral cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unstimulated salivary flow in dry mouth patients has shown an increased clinical oral dryness&#xD;
      score and mucosal wetness is at a significantly reduced rate (p&lt;0.05) when compared with&#xD;
      healthy subjects (Osailan et al 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, various products containing methylcellulose, water, oily emulsions etc., have&#xD;
      been used to alleviate the subjective sensation of dryness in the oral cavity in the forms of&#xD;
      rinse, gel, ointment and paste. However, the alleviation of the dry mouth symptoms has been&#xD;
      varied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study product contains an inert hydrophobic phase in an amount from 30% to 98%,&#xD;
      preferably from 40% to 90% by weight of the composition. It also contains an emulsifying&#xD;
      system in an amount from 1% to 10%, preferably from 3% to 7% by weight of the composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P&amp;G's whitening gel emulsifying system is comprised of at least one surfactant having an&#xD;
      hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) &lt;10, preferably comprised between 3 and 7, and at least&#xD;
      one surfactant with HLB&gt;10, preferably comprised between 12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The optimal duration and frequency of application for whitening is up to 4 times a day. For&#xD;
      the purpose of this study, the whitening gel will set on the subject's teeth for 5 minutes&#xD;
      during each use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The product being used is a commercially available product, known as &quot;Crest Whitening&#xD;
      Emulsions&quot;, will be used as the investigative product. There will be no active control group.&#xD;
      This is not the first time the P&amp;G whitening gel will be used in humans. We do believe this&#xD;
      is the first study investigating dry mouth sensation from using a whitening gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of each dose should be enough to cover the entire tip of the whitening wand,&#xD;
      approximately ½ a tsp. The use of the study product in this study will be for what they are&#xD;
      approved for. Per the manufacturer's instructions, study subjects will be asked to apply the&#xD;
      study product up to 4 times a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (1-1.5 hours) Screening/ Baseline (Day 0)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject will be called 1-2 days before their appointment to confirm that in order to&#xD;
           participate, they must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Not consume alcohol for 24 hours prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Not brush their teeth for 1.5 hours prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Not have had anything to eat or drink (including chewing gum or eating candy) for&#xD;
                1.5 hours prior to their visit). Water is acceptable to drink up to 1 hour prior to&#xD;
                the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Not smoke 1.5 hours prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subjects will be asked to read the informed consent form (ICF). Subjects will be&#xD;
           given ample time to have any questions answered. If a subject decides to participate, he&#xD;
           or she will be asked to sign the ICF. A copy of the ICF will be given to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subject will be asked to complete demographic information and a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An oral exam, including evaluation of oral cavity, soft and hard tissues, will be&#xD;
           completed following standard of care procedures in US dentistry using a mouth mirror and&#xD;
           dental explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subject medications with potential side effects being dry mouth will be verified using&#xD;
           the Physician's Reference Desk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Saliva Collection 1 (pre-product application): Saliva will be collected by asking&#xD;
           subjects to do nothing but drool into a pre-weighed vial for 5 minutes (referred to as&#xD;
           the Drooling Method). The post collection weight will be subtracted from the pre-weight&#xD;
           to determine the flow rate. The saliva samples will be discarded after they are weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A paper questionnaire will be given to subject to complete before application of study&#xD;
           product and after application of study product. Questionnaire includes Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scale (VAS) questionnaire on dry mouth, quantity of saliva, and perceived sensitivity of&#xD;
           teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated and eligibility for the study will be&#xD;
           determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Demonstration and application of study product:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. A visual and oral demonstration of application of the whitening gel will be performed&#xD;
           by a study team member. The script for the demonstration will be the one provided in the&#xD;
           information packet in each study product box so the subject can bring the instructions&#xD;
           home. The study team member will mimic the necessary steps to properly apply the gel,&#xD;
           without using the product. The study team member will then have the subject complete the&#xD;
           steps while applying the gel to their own teeth. Subjects will then be asked to sit for&#xD;
           5 minutes to let the gel set on their teeth. During that time, the subject can fill out&#xD;
           the post-application questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Saliva Collection 2 (post-product application): Saliva will be collected using the same&#xD;
           Drooling Method as Saliva Collection 1. The saliva samples will be discarded after they&#xD;
           are weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Photographs of subject teeth will be taken by a standard dental camera. The photos will&#xD;
           only contain subject teeth and oral cavity with no subject identifiers visible. In&#xD;
           addition to the ICF, the subjects will be asked to sign a photo release form. If the&#xD;
           subject does not wish to sign this form, their photographs will not be taken. Those who&#xD;
           do not consent to having their photos taken will be tracked in the enrollment log&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Distribution of study product and diary: One box of study whitening gel product,&#xD;
           (0.88Oz) toothpaste, and a toothbrush will be dispensed by study team members. This is&#xD;
           to ensure all participants are using the exact same dental products during the trial&#xD;
           period. The subjects will be asked to not use any other oral tools or products during&#xD;
           the trial period aside from the ones distributed by the study team at Visit 1. A diary&#xD;
           will also be dispensed for the record keeping of the application of the products. A&#xD;
           study team member will again verbally tell the participant the instructions that are&#xD;
           provided with the study product and that per the instructions, they can apply the&#xD;
           product up to 4 times per day until their next study visit. The same script from step&#xD;
           9.a. will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Gift card will be distributed upon successful completion of visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (1-1.5 hours) Final Visit - 7 ∓ 2 days after visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject will be called 1-2 days before their appointment to confirm that in order to&#xD;
           participate, they must:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Not consume alcohol for 24 hours prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Not brush their teeth for 1.5 hours prior to their visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

           medications will also be reviewed and noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Eligibility and subject withdrawal criteria will be reviewed to ensure the subject still&#xD;
           qualifies for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subject medications with potential side effects being dry mouth will be verified using&#xD;
           the Physician's Reference Desk. Subjects will be asked to confirm that they have taken&#xD;
           their medications as prescribed since Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. An oral exam, including evaluation of oral cavity, soft and hard tissues, will be&#xD;
           completed following standard of care procedures in US dentistry using a mouth mirror and&#xD;
           dental explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Saliva Collection 1 (pre-product application): Saliva will be collected using the&#xD;
           drooling method for 5 minutes into a pre-weighed vial. The post collection weight will&#xD;
           be subtracted from the pre-weight to determine the flow rate. The saliva samples will be&#xD;
           discarded after they are weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The paper questionnaire will be given to subject to complete before application of study&#xD;
           product and after application of study product. The questionnaire includes the Visual&#xD;
           Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaire on dry mouth, quantity of saliva, and perceived&#xD;
           sensitivity of teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Application of study product: A study team member will ask the subjects to apply the gel&#xD;
           to their teeth. Subjects will then be asked to sit for 5 minutes to allow the gel to set&#xD;
           on their teeth. During that time, subjects will fill out the post- application&#xD;
           questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Saliva Collection 2 (post-product application): Saliva will be collected using the same&#xD;
           drooling method as Saliva Collection 1. The saliva samples will be discarded after they&#xD;
           are weighed.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Photographs of subject teeth will be taken by a standard dental camera. The photos will&#xD;
           only contain subject teeth and oral cavity with no subject identifiers visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. The study diary and any leftover product will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Gift card will be distributed upon successful completion of visit.&#xD;
