      This study of physiologically functional FFR in STEMI patients without direct PCI treatment&#xD;
      will provide unique data on plaque progression and risk factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical study that plans to&#xD;
      continuously enroll patients with STEMI who, for various reasons, have not received direct&#xD;
      PCI treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset. All STEMI patients will be treated according&#xD;
      to the hospital's standard procedures and will continue to watch for plaque stability for 7&#xD;
      to 30 days. Treatment options for STEMI include: progressive thrombus aspiration without&#xD;
      balloon or stent implantation; Stabilization with medication in a relatively small hospital&#xD;
      that could not provide PCI treatment and then transfer to a tertiary hospital for further&#xD;
      evaluation; Thrombolytic therapy. After that, all patients underwent an angiogram to identify&#xD;
      any residual stenosis in the culprit's blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 300 subjects with target vessel stenosis of 50%-90% confirmed to be suitable&#xD;
      for stent implantation by angiographic evaluation will be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      FFR, OCT or Angio group according to 1:1:1. FFR group: Patients with FFR ≤0.8 were treated&#xD;
      with PCI; FFR &amp;gt; 0.8 patients will receive drug therapy; All patients will undergo OCT&#xD;
      examination. OCT group: if MLA&amp;lt; 4.5mm2 patients will receive PCI; Other patients will be&#xD;
      treated with medication; All patients will be examined for FFR. Angio group: The appropriate&#xD;
      treatment (stent implantation) will be given according to the evaluation of the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed up at 1 month (±7d), 6 months (±14d) and 12 months (±30d) after&#xD;
      surgery, respectively. Target lesion failure (TLF), including cardiogenic death, target&#xD;
      vessel myocardial infarction (TV-MI), or clinically indicated target lesion revascularization&#xD;
      (TLR), was used as the primary end point. Secondary end points included the incidence of&#xD;
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 1 year postoperatively. The clinical composite&#xD;
      end points included: All due to death, Arc-defined stent thrombotic events, non-fatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, clinically driven target vessel revascularization, or readmission due&#xD;
      to unstable angina pectoris or aggravation of angina; Patients in the FFR group and OCT group&#xD;
      were treated with a change of treatment strategy (pre-PCI: change of stent implantation&#xD;
      strategy; After PCI: with or without additional intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each research center shall operate and test in accordance with the operating procedures&#xD;
      uniformly described in the scheme to ensure the consistency of the test operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical event committee (CEC) : a clinical event committee will be composed of independent&#xD;
      cardiologists not involved in this study to reevaluate all reported deaths, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, revascularization, and thrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 STEMI patients who did not receive direct PCI treatment within 48 hours after&#xD;
      symptom onset due to different reasons are planned to be enrolled in 16 centers nationwide.&#xD;
      The overall study time is about 24 months.&#xD;
