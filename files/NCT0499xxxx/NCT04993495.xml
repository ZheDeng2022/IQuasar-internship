  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head injuries are a common reason for consultation in emergency departments. The clinical&#xD;
      severity of head injury is assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Between 71% and 97.5%&#xD;
      of patients with head trauma seen in the emergency department are considered minor, that is&#xD;
      to say with an initial GCS 13 and the consequences are quite variable. Three to 10% of&#xD;
      patients will have short, medium or long-term health consequences. According to the studies,&#xD;
      there are between 2.1 and 8% of intracranial bleeding immediate or delayed (up to one month),&#xD;
      with about 1% of them, the need to resort to neurosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a minor head trauma, it is recommended, in the absence of clinical signs of&#xD;
      severity, to realize a brain scan (cerebral computerized tomography scan (CT scan): reference&#xD;
      imaging examination) within 6h (between 4 hours and 8 hours according to studies), a hospital&#xD;
      surveillance of 24h, with the realization of a control scanner within 12 hours to 24 hours in&#xD;
      case of treatment by anticoagulants or antiaggregation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In December 2015, Journal of the American Medical Association published an article evaluating&#xD;
      two clinical algorithms across the Atlantic, the New Orleans Criteria (NOC) and the Canadian&#xD;
      CT Head Rule, to identify a group of patients with a very low risk of severe brain damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of this score is unquestionably, however, it does not include patients&#xD;
      treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs; risk factors having a decisive impact on&#xD;
      the incidence of intracranial bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, various studies have been carried out retrospectively in Angers to assess&#xD;
      the incidence and risk factors of the occurrence of an immediate or delayed intracerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage in patients with minor head trauma with or without anti-thrombotic treatment.&#xD;
