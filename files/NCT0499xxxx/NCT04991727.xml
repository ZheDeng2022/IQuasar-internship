  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri - operative ultrasonography was used to evaluate the effects of protective lung&#xD;
      ventilation on the postoperative lungs of obese patients.The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      apply ultrasound lung ventilation area score to the monitoring of pulmonary complications in&#xD;
      patients with postoperative obesity.To verify the reliability and practicability of&#xD;
      perioperative lung ultrasound quantitative scoring.&#xD;

      Ultrasound lung ventilation area score was applied to monitor the pulmonary complications of&#xD;
      patients after obesity operation to verify the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reliability and practicability of quantitative lung ultrasound score to clarify the&#xD;
      effect of protective lung ventilation under perioperative pulmonary ultrasound monitoring on&#xD;
      obesity patients.To guide the management of mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia&#xD;
      and the prevention and treatment of postoperative pulmonary complications&#xD;

    <measure>Lung ultrasound scoring</measure>
    <time_frame>in the morning of the first day</time_frame>
    <description>Four signs were used in lung ultrasound scoring&#xD;
Lung ultrasound score: N (0): pleural line and A line, less than 3 B lines; B1 (1 mark): More than 3&#xD;
B line; B2 (2 points): Fuse line B; C (3 points): Signs of lung consolidation. The higher the score is, the worse the pulmonary ventilation status is.&#xD;
When scoring, the sign with the greatest severity is taken as the score value of the examination area. There are 12 examination areas in both lungs, so we have a LUS&#xD;
The score is between 0 and 36</description>

    <description>The patient was admitted to the operating room, and routine ECG monitoring was performed. The patient was placed in supine position, and ultrasound lung examination was performed. The images of the patient were saved and the score of lung ventilation area was recorded. The induction of general anesthesia was started, and endotracheal intubation was performed after 3min of preoxygenation (100% O2) to establish a safe and effective artificial airway.Mechanical ventilation was performed after endotracheal intubation, and a second time was performed immediately after endotracheal intubation was completed.Pulmonary ultrasound was performed. The PEEPgroup was given the first RM (pulmonary retraction) with pressure maintained at 40cmH2O for 30s, followed by a 7cmH2O PEEP to maintain mechanical ventilation, and the RMS was repeated every 30 minutes until the end of surgery</description>
