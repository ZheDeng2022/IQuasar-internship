  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Aging is associated with muscle mass and strength loss and &quot;oldest&quot; old people&#xD;
      (≥85 y) are at a far greater risk of developing sarcopenia. Training increases muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength in a variety of populations, yet the efficacy has not been clearly defined for&#xD;
      individuals in the fourth age (≥80 y).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The following hypotheses will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve weeks of progressive resistance-type exercise training increases muscle mass and&#xD;
           strength in young old (65-75 y) and oldest old (85 y and over) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The training-induced increase in muscle mass and strength is relatively greater in young&#xD;
           old subjects when compared to oldest old subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals: The primary aim of this study is to compare the effect of resistance-type exercise&#xD;
      training on skeletal muscle mass (i.e. quadriceps cross-sectional area and whole body lean&#xD;
      mass) in young old and oldest old subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific goals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether resistance-type exercise training can increase muscle mass and muscle&#xD;
           strength in young old and oldest old subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether resistance-type exercise training can improve physical performance in&#xD;
           young old and oldest old subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify whether inflammatory markers (i.e., TNFα, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13) are up- or&#xD;
           down-regulated in young old and oldest old subjects before and after resistance-type&#xD;
           exercise training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Sixty older females and males (young old group: n=30, 65-75 y; oldest old group:&#xD;
      n=30, 85 y and over) will be included in this prospective clinical trial. All volunteers will&#xD;
      be subjected to 12 weeks of whole-body resistance-type exercise training (3x/wk). Before, and&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 weeks of training, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the upper leg will be&#xD;
      performed to assess quadriceps cross sectional area. On those days, fasting blood samples&#xD;
      will be obtained and whole-body dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan will also be&#xD;
      performed. Maximal strength will be determined by 1-repetition maximum (1RM) and physical&#xD;
      functioning by the short physical performance battery (SPPB) at the same time points.&#xD;

      Background: Aging is associated with muscle mass and strength loss and &quot;oldest&quot; old people&#xD;
      (≥85 y) are at a far greater risk of developing sarcopenia. Training increases muscle mass&#xD;
      and strength in a variety of populations, yet the efficacy has not been clearly defined for&#xD;
      individuals in the fourth age (≥80 y). A better understanding of the skeletal muscle adaptive&#xD;
      response to resistance-type exercise training with advanced age will provide a strong basis&#xD;
      to develop and implement care programs within our rapidly aging population, in which the&#xD;
      &quot;oldest&quot; old represent the fastest growing group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The following hypotheses will be investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Twelve weeks of progressive resistance-type exercise training increases muscle mass and&#xD;
           strength in young old (65-75 y) and oldest old (85 y and over) subjects.&#xD;

      functioning by the short physical performance battery (SPPB) at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study parameters/endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main study endpoint is the increase in quadriceps cross-sectional area as assessed&#xD;
           via CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoints include: Whole-body and segmental body composition (i.e., lean mass,&#xD;
           fat mass, bone mineral content; DEXA scan); Maximal strength assessment (1RM); Hand grip&#xD;
           strength; Short physical performance battery (SPPB); Inflammatory and molecular markers&#xD;
           (blood samples analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other study parameters include: Age, body weight, body height, body mass index (BMI),&#xD;
           lipid profile, glucose, and insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of resistance-type exercise training to increase muscle mass and strength in the&#xD;
      oldest old population remains unclear. With the proposed project, we expect that&#xD;
      resistance-type exercise training will increase muscle mass and strength, although the impact&#xD;
      will be relatively lower in the oldest old group when compared with a group of young old&#xD;
      individuals. The potential findings will define the efficacy of resistance-type exercise&#xD;
      training to increase muscle mass and strength in individuals with advancing age. Better&#xD;
      maintenance, or even an increase in muscle mass and strength increases independence,&#xD;
      prolonging good health, recovery from disease and illness, and ultimately decreases burden on&#xD;
      healthcare systems. This information will have a beneficial impact in the exercise physiology&#xD;
      and aging areas for future interventions at the local, regional, national and international&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
