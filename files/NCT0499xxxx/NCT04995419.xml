  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the antitumor activity of enfortumab vedotin (EV)&#xD;
      confirmed by the objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also evaluate the effect of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), total antibody&#xD;
      (TAb) and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) in Chinese participants with locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study will also evaluate the duration of response (DOR), disease control&#xD;
      rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunogenicity&#xD;
      determined by the incidence of antitherapeutic antibodies (ATA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability of EV in participants with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      cancer will also be evaluated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will comprise of a single group of participants who will receive one dose of&#xD;
      enfortumab vedotin (EV) on Day 1, 8 and 15 of every 4-week (28 days) cycle. Participants will&#xD;
      continue on study treatment until discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment discontinuation, participant will have an end of treatment (EOT) visit for a&#xD;
      30-day Safety Follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants to discontinue to treatment for reasons other than disease progression will be&#xD;
      followed for response assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Pharmacokinetic (PK) cohort will be available at some study centers. Participants enrolled&#xD;
      at the PK cohort site(s) will have intense PK samples collected after single and repeated&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
