      EMERALD OLE trial is an open-label extension of the EMERALD trial. Long term tolerability and&#xD;
      safety of the MediCabilis CBD oil has not been extensively studied. EMERALD OLE aims to&#xD;
      establish data on the prolonged used of the study drug product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who completed the EMERALD trial will be offered to enter EMERALD OLE.&#xD;
      Participants will be taking the active drug MediCabilis CBD oil for 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>MediCabilis CBD Oil to be taken no more than 7ml/day orally based from participants' individual 14 day titration period completed at the beginning of the trial. The frequency of the drug intake can range between once and three times a day depending on the outcome of the 14 day titration period. Titration period allows participants to gradually increase study drug intake in order to find appropriate dose for participants without or with minimal undesired side effects. The treatment will last no more than 6 months.</description>
