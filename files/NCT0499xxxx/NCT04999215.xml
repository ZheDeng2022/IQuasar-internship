  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choline is an important building block of phospholipids in cell membranes. Certain cancers&#xD;
      and medical conditions are known to demonstrate increased absorption and incorporation of&#xD;
      choline into their cell membranes. 18-F-fluorocholine (F-choline) and 11-C-choline&#xD;
      (C-choline) are diagnostic positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that can be used&#xD;
      to image, in vivo, the metabolism of choline. Both tracers have been extensively studied in&#xD;
      prostate cancer and C-choline has obtained US FDA approval for the investigation of recurrent&#xD;
      prostate cancer. F-choline is currently not approved for clinical use by the FDA or Health&#xD;
      Canada, but it offers many advantages over C-choline due to its better physical&#xD;
      characteristics (mainly due to its positron range, shorter and longer half-life). In recent&#xD;
      years, reports have started to emerge on broader potential applications of choline PET&#xD;
      imaging, particularly for imaging parathyroid adenomas, certain cervical cancers and certain&#xD;
      liver cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to discover and explore potential new and emerging indications in which&#xD;
      F-choline could play a role and provide clinically relevant information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are 1) To assess the safety of F-choline PET imaging using F-choline&#xD;
      produced at the CRCHUM; 2) assess changes in patient/disease management following F-choline&#xD;
      PET imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hypothesize that F-choline will provide useful and incremental clinical&#xD;
      information in a variety of conditions, and outperform the &quot;standard&quot; workup in numerous&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F-Choline PET exams will be performed on hybrid PET/CT scanners according to standard&#xD;
      procedures. These examinations could be repeated at the discretion of the treating physician&#xD;
      (up to a maximum of 4 exams per year) if the treating physician and the research team deem&#xD;
      this could provide additional clinically useful information (for example, by helping to&#xD;
      assess response to newly started therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be provided to the attending physician and any new knowledge could lead to a&#xD;
      change in treatment or an investigation of the condition that prompted enrollment in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
