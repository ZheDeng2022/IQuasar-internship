  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the induction phase of the study is to compare treatment retention&#xD;
      of participants following rapid induction or standard of care (SoC) induction onto&#xD;
      extended-release buprenorphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the maintenance phase is to compare the efficacy of 100 mg and 300&#xD;
      mg maintenance doses of extended-release buprenorphine administered every 4 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of an open-label induction phase followed by a double-blind maintenance&#xD;
      phase. Each phase is designed to test separate objectives and endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the induction phase participants who use opioids via an injection route and/or use high&#xD;
      doses of opioids who are in withdrawal will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      extended-release buprenorphine rapid induction or SoC induction. The rapid induction arm is&#xD;
      designed to initiate extended-release buprenorphine treatment following a single dose of&#xD;
      transmucosal (TM) buprenorphine, while the SoC induction arm inducts the participant onto&#xD;
      extended-release buprenorphine using a TM buprenorphine-containing product for a minimum of 7&#xD;
      days. All participants will receive the first injection of extended-release buprenorphine on&#xD;
      Day 1 and the second injection on Day 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants eligible to continue treatment in the maintenance phase will be randomized at&#xD;
      Week 6 prior to Injection 3 in a 1:1 ratio to receive maintenance doses of either 300 mg or&#xD;
      100 mg extended-release buprenorphine every 4 weeks for a total of up to 8 maintenance&#xD;
      injections.&#xD;
