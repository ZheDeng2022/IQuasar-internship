  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postnatal depression (PND) is a type of depression that can occur in some parents after the&#xD;
      birth of their baby. PND has been estimated to affect 1 in 10 new parents; mothers in&#xD;
      particular are at an increased risk of developing PND in the first year after childbirth.&#xD;
      Symptoms of PND include a persistent feeling of sadness or low mood, a lack of enjoyment and&#xD;
      loss of interest in the wider world, lack of energy and feeling tired all the time,&#xD;
      difficulty bonding with your baby, withdrawing from contact with other people and problems&#xD;
      concentrating and making decisions. Research has shown that mothers with PND have more&#xD;
      cognitive, behavioural and interpersonal issues, and lower mood, energy and concentration&#xD;
      than mothers without PND. Current treatments for PND include self-help resources, support&#xD;
      from local and national organisations, psychological therapy or antidepressants with varying&#xD;
      success rates. Further research is required to investigate accessible, cost-effective&#xD;
      preventions or treatments for new mothers who are at risk or have been diagnosed with PND.&#xD;
      There is also a pressing need to investigate natural alternatives to medication, especially&#xD;
      for breastfeeding mothers who do not want to expose their infants to pharmaceuticals through&#xD;
      breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds found in high levels in foods such as berry and&#xD;
      citrus fruits, leafy green vegetables, tea, dark chocolate and red wine. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that consumption of high flavonoid foods can improve health and cognitive outcomes. Prior&#xD;
      research investigating daily dietary flavonoid intervention in a postnatal population for 2&#xD;
      weeks indicated significantly higher physical quality of life and significantly lower state&#xD;
      anxiety in mothers of infants under 1 year old, at the end of the intervention. These&#xD;
      benefits were not observed in the control group. This data shows promise for the management&#xD;
      of mood in a key period for mothers and their babies, where risk of PND is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research aim of the current study will be to further these investigations to see whether&#xD;
      implementation of a high flavonoid diet across a 2 week period positively affects maternal&#xD;
      mental health, specifically mood, anxiety, depressive symptoms and perceived quality of life.&#xD;
      The study will involve recruiting mothers of infants under 6 months old to take part in an&#xD;
      online study investigating diet and mental health. Mothers will be assigned to either a high&#xD;
      flavonoid diet or a control condition for 2 weeks. They will complete online questionnaires&#xD;
      (Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS),&#xD;
      Postpartum-Specific Anxiety Scale (PSAS), World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL),&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) at the start (day&#xD;
      0) and end (day 14) of the dietary intervention. In this study, a sub-sample of fathers will&#xD;
      also be recruited to take part in the same study to assess if dietary or mood outcomes are&#xD;
      similar or different in this population. This pilot data will inform future research of&#xD;
      dietary interventions in new fathers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not pose ethical issues. Participants will be asked to complete non-invasive&#xD;
      questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. For those in the high flavonoid group&#xD;
      the change to diet will not be extreme; this group will be encouraged to include 2 items from&#xD;
      a list of high flavonoid foods in their daily food consumption. All participants will be&#xD;
      provided with helplines and web links upon debrief should they wish to seek further support.&#xD;
      The helplines provided will be Samaritans UK and PANDAs Foundation. Web links to NHS, MIND&#xD;
      and the Association for Postnatal Illness will also be listed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will employ a between-groups, randomised, controlled, participant-blind design. The&#xD;
      study will primarily recruit mothers of infants under 6 months old to take part. Participants&#xD;
      will be invited to an online study investigating diet and mental health and will be provided&#xD;
      with an information sheet detailing what the study entails. If participants would like to&#xD;
      take part, they will be sent a weblink to the online study. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either the intervention (consumption of high flavonoid food items) or the control&#xD;
      (no change to diet) condition. Only the experimenters will know which group participants have&#xD;
      been assigned to to prevent participants unconsciously biasing results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online study will be hosted on Jisc online surveys. Once participants open the study&#xD;
      weblink, they will be presented with the study information sheet followed by a consent form.&#xD;
      Once participants have consented to take part, they will be asked to provide some demographic&#xD;
      information about themselves (e.g. age, occupation, health or psychological diagnoses, any&#xD;
      pregnancy or birth complications) and their baby (e.g. age, sex, health diagnoses, breast or&#xD;
      bottle feeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers will then complete PANAS-NOW, EPDS, PSAS, WHOQOL, STAI and FFQ measures. Once&#xD;
      completed, they either will (if in high flavonoid group) or will not (if in control group) be&#xD;
      presented with a high-flavonoid food list and instructions for food consumption over the 2&#xD;
      week intervention. Those presented with the high flavonoid food list will be encouraged to&#xD;
      consume 2 high flavonoid food items per day from the list over the next 2 weeks, above what&#xD;
      they already consume each day typically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intervention and control groups will be encouraged to fill in food logs where they will&#xD;
      write down all food consumption every day over the 2 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One and a half weeks into the intervention study participants will be reminded (via email) to&#xD;
      complete the follow up questionnaires via a weblink when convenient for them over the next&#xD;
      few days. They will then complete the online questionnaires (PANAS-NOW, EPDS, PSAS, WHOQOL,&#xD;
      STAI and FFQ) via the weblink at the end of the dietary intervention (day 14). Upon&#xD;
      completion, participants will be presented with a debrief sheet explaining the aims of the&#xD;
      study, what the study entailed and which condition they were in. Participants will also be&#xD;
      reminded of their right to withdraw their data from the study if they wish. Helplines and&#xD;
      support weblinks will be provided to all participants as well as encouragement for&#xD;
      participants to contact their GP should they wish to seek support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside recruitment of postnatal mothers, fathers will also be invited to take part in the&#xD;
      study, recruited via the mothers that consent to take part. This is so that important pilot&#xD;
      data can be collected on a sub-sample of postnatal fathers to assess mood outcomes in this&#xD;
      at-risk population before and after a 2 week dietary flavonoid intervention. This will follow&#xD;
      the same methods, procedures and measures as recruited mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 80 postnatal mothers. A power analysis using GPower 3.1 rendered a&#xD;
      total sample size of 40 as appropriate to obtain a small effect (0.3) at a power of 0.95 and&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.05. The recruitment aim will be 80 to allow for a number of participant&#xD;
      dropouts and to allow sufficiently powered analysis between groups at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional aim is to recruit a sub-sample of 20 postnatal fathers alongside the main study&#xD;
      recruiting mothers. This is to collect important pilot data to assess whether similar or&#xD;
      different patterns or outcomes occur in a postnatal male population to inform future research&#xD;
      into dietary intervention in men.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using scores from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory- State scale measure at baseline and 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety. This questionnaire is a measure of state and trait anxiety containing 40 items in total (20 for trait; 20 for state). Only the state scale (20 items) will be used in current research to measure situational anxiety. Participants are asked to agree or disagree with anxiety-related statements on a scale of 1-4.</description>

    <measure>Mean depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using scores from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at baseline and 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of depressive symptoms. This questionnaire contains 10 items where participants rate how they have been feeling over the past 7 days on a 4-point Likert scale. The EPDS was designed for women who are pregnant or have just had a baby and has shown to be an efficient and effective way of identifying patients at risk for perinatal depression. This measure is suitable for use in new mothers and fathers.</description>

    <measure>Mean quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using scores from the World Health Organization Quality of Life (short form) measure at baseline and 2 weeks. Higher scores indicate higher levels of quality of life across 4 domains: physical health, psychological, social relationships and environment. It is an abbreviated version of the 100 item WHOQOL-100 and contains 24 items. The participants need to answer questions on how they feel about their quality of life on a scale from 1-5.</description>
