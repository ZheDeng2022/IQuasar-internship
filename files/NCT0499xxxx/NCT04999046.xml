      This is a pilot, single blind, randomized crossover design, and single center. DRE patients&#xD;
      with a determined epileptogenic foci will be enrolled. After completing the informed consent,&#xD;
      patients will enter the 28-day screening period for baseline observation. Patients who had at&#xD;
      least 3 seizures during the screening period will be eligible to participate the clinical&#xD;
      trial. Eligible patients will be randomized into two groups to receive Sham treatment or FUS&#xD;
      treatment on day 1. After FUS/Sham treatment, patients will be under home monitor to record&#xD;
      the seizure by daily diary card for 1 month. After 1 month (Day 30±7), patients will be&#xD;
      crossed over to the other treatment. Another one month observation will be necessary. In this&#xD;
      trial, patients will totally receive 2 treatments: one FUS treatment, and one Sham treatment.&#xD;
      Sixty (±7) days after day 1, patients will have a follow-up visit and overall evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>FUS treatment will be conducted with following exposure parameters: intracranial spatial-peak temporal-average intensity (ISPTA) ceiling level: 2.8 W/cm2 (the focused ultrasound intensity in brain area considering transcranial attenuation), burst length: 3 ms, duration: three consecutive 5-minute FUS exposures with two 5-minute intermission intervals.
