  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects more than 43 million people worldwide, but specific exercise&#xD;
      recommendations do not exist for this group of patients. Despite a lack of evidence, athletes&#xD;
      are often advised to reduce exercise intensity (detraining) after being diagnosed with AF.&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will be the first study that investigates effects of&#xD;
      detraining in endurance athletes. Participants will be randomized to an intervention group&#xD;
      that will be instructed to refrain from high intensity exercise, and a control group. The&#xD;
      study aims to clarify whether detraining might reduce the burden of AF and has the potential&#xD;
      to guide development of exercise guidelines for AF patients.&#xD;

      Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects more than 43 million people worldwide, but specific exercise&#xD;
      recommendations do not exist for this group of patients. Despite a lack of evidence, athletes&#xD;
      are often advised to reduce exercise intensity (detraining) after being diagnosed with AF.&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will be the first study that investigates effects of&#xD;
      detraining in endurance athletes. Participants will be included at Bærum Hospital, St.Olavs&#xD;
      Hospital, Trondheim, Baker Institute, Melbourne, and Leuven University Hospital. In total 120&#xD;
      participants will be monitored with a wrist band (exercise intensity) and an Insertable&#xD;
      cardiac monitor (ICM, heart rhythm). Participants will be randomized to an intervention group&#xD;
      (n=60) that will be instructed to refrain from high intensity exercise (heart rate (HR) above&#xD;
      75% of maximal HR (HRmax)) for a period of 16 Weeks, or a control group (n=60) that will be&#xD;
      instructed to perform at least three weekly sessions of high intensity training HR above 85%&#xD;
      of HRmax. The primary endpoint will be relative change in time-in-AF after 16 weeks measured&#xD;
      by ICM. The study aims to clarify whether detraining might reduce the burden of AF and has&#xD;
      the potential to guide development of exercise guidelines for AF patients. The investigators&#xD;
      will also study exercise-induced cardiac remodeling, aiming to improve the understanding of&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for AF, not only in athletes but in the large&#xD;
      population of AF patients worldwide.&#xD;
