    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the effect of standard verbal counseling with or without a&#xD;
      pictorial educational tool for the reduction of psychological morbidity in women with stage&#xD;
      0-IIIA breast cancer receiving radiation therapy. Beginning radiation therapy for breast&#xD;
      cancer can be stressful. Education about what to expect often reduces the stress, anxiety,&#xD;
      and depression experienced by these patients. This study is being done to see how effective&#xD;
      photos are in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression associated with radiation therapy for&#xD;
      patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To create a pictorial reference depicting expected side effects during and after radiation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the impact of the addition of the photo guide on patients' psychosocial&#xD;
      wellbeing and perceived side effect burden during and after radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo verbal counseling and view a photo guide. Patients also complete&#xD;
      questionnaires at 2 weeks, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo verbal counseling. Patients also complete questionnaires at 2 weeks,&#xD;
      6 and 12 months.&#xD;
