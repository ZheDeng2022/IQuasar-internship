    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The subjects were&#xD;
      patients who received ECMO support. According to whether ulinastatin is used in the treatment&#xD;
      regimen (determined by the competent doctor according to the patient's condition), the&#xD;
      patients were divided into the ulinastatin and control groups. In the ulinastatin group,&#xD;
      ulinastatin was used for inflammation management and organ protection early before ECMO was&#xD;
      started. Baseline data and inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), capillary leakage&#xD;
      markers, routine test results, duration of ECMO use/length of hospital stay/length of ICU&#xD;
      stay were recorded at 1, 3, and 5 days after the start of ECMO support, and patients were&#xD;
      followed up on the 28th and 90th days.&#xD;

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The subjects were&#xD;
      patients who received ECMO support. According to whether ulinastatin is used in the treatment&#xD;
      regimen (determined by the competent doctor according to the patient's condition), the&#xD;
      patients were divided into the ulinastatin and control groups. 144 subjects were enrolled,&#xD;
      including 72 subjects in the ulinastatin group and 72 subjects in the control group. In the&#xD;
      ulinastatin group, ulinastatin was used for inflammation management and organ protection&#xD;
      early before ECMO was started. The recommended clinical routine dosage of ulinastatin is&#xD;
      300,000 IU, q8h (continuous administration for more than 5 days). Baseline data and&#xD;
      inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α), capillary leakage markers, routine test&#xD;
      results, duration of ECMO use/length of hospital stay/length of ICU stay were recorded at 1,&#xD;
      3, and 5 days after the start of ECMO support, and patients were followed up on the 28th and&#xD;
      90th days.&#xD;
