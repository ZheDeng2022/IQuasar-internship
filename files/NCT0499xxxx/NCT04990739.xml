  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MetaboMed is developing MTB-9655, an orally bioavailable, first-in-class small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of the human Acetyl coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA) synthetase short chain family member 2&#xD;
      (ACSS2) enzyme, as a potential treatment for patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase 1,First-in-Human (FIH), open-label dose-escalation study of MTB-9655&#xD;
      given daily as a single oral (PO) agent. Up to 30 patients with locally advanced,&#xD;
      unresectable and/or metastatic solid tumor(s) are expected to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      dose-escalation portion (Part A). The study will be conducted at 1 to 2 sites in the United&#xD;
      States and Israel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 First-in-Human (FIH) study is to initiate clinical development of MTB-9655 in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors who have failed or refused standard treatment, or who&#xD;
      have a tumor for which no therapy of proven efficacy exists. This study of MTB-9655 may&#xD;
      consist of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part to establish a safe and tolerable dose of MTB-9655&#xD;
      in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors for which no standard therapy is&#xD;
      available or standard therapy has failed (Part A), and a dose expansion phase (Part B) which&#xD;
      may be initiated at the Sponsor's discretion after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose [RP2D]) has been determined in the dose-escalation (Part A), and&#xD;
      with approval of an amendment to the protocol. This study will be the basis for future&#xD;
      studies. The study will identify the safety and tolerability of MTB-9655 when administered on&#xD;
      a continuous dosing schedule (given by mouth on a 21-day schedule).&#xD;

    <description>Study has two parts:&#xD;
Part A Dose-Escalation will evaluate MTB-9655 monotherapy administered in 21 days cycle,and will be conducted in 2 stages (accelerated titration and dose-escalation).&#xD;
The first stage will consist of accelerated titration in single-patient cohorts for the initial two dose levels.&#xD;
In the second stage, a conventional 3+3 schema using a modified Fibonacci dose titration strategy will be implemented. The first dose at every dose level and in every patient will be administered under close medical supervision, and the patients will be hospitalized for approximately 24 hours.&#xD;
Up to 30 participants will participate in this dose escalation arm.&#xD;
Part B dose-expansion will further explore the safety, PK and preliminary efficacy of MTB-9655 at the RP2D. The RP2D level will be no higher than the MTD identified in Part A.</description>

    <description>MTB-9655 is an orally available investigational product that is highly potent as it exhibits selectivity as an ACSS2 inhibitor when tested against a panel of related enzymes. MTB-9655 is formulated as a powder blend in a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) capsule and is presented as 25 mg and 100 mg strengths for oral administration.&#xD;
Patients will receive MTB-9655, by mouth daily in 21-day treatment cycles,either 1 hour before mealtime or 2 hours after mealtime.</description>
