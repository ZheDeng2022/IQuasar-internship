  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intradialyic exercise on dialytic parameters,&#xD;
      HRQL, and depression status in hemodialysis patients. A randomized controlled trial was&#xD;
      conducted. Sixty-four participants were recruited using stratified random sampling and&#xD;
      allocated with a 1:1 randomization ratio to either experimental group (EG, treated in odd&#xD;
      weekdays, n = 32) or comparison group (CG, treated in even weekdays, n = 32). The EG received&#xD;
      a 12-week intradialytic exercise, while the CG maintained usual lifestyles. Dialytic&#xD;
      parameters, HRQL, and depression status were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      results indicated that there were no differences in changes of dialytic parameters from&#xD;
      baseline between EG and CG. However, the EG had increased HRQL and reduced depression status&#xD;
      at 12 weeks compared with the CG. A 12-week intradialytic exercise is safe, feasible and&#xD;
      effective in improved HRQL and reduced depression status for hemodialysis patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise has been shown to be of fundamental importance in managing chronic diseases and&#xD;
      improving health-related quality of life (HRQL) as well as psychological health. However,&#xD;
      whether intradialyic exercise is safe and has positive impact on HRQL and depression status&#xD;
      in hemodialysis patients requires further researches with diverse racial and cultural groups&#xD;
      to clarify. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of intradialyic exercise on dialytic&#xD;
      parameters, HRQL, and depression status in hemodialysis patients. A randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial was conducted at a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Sixty-four participants from 112&#xD;
      eligible hemodialysis patients were recruited using stratified random sampling and allocated&#xD;
      with a 1:1 randomization ratio to either experimental group (EG, treated in odd weekdays, n =&#xD;
      32) or comparison group (CG, treated in even weekdays, n = 32). The EG received a 12-week&#xD;
      intradialytic exercise (supine lower-limb ergometer, 30 minutes/session, 3 sessions/week),&#xD;
      while the CG maintained usual lifestyles. Dialytic parameters (serum chemistries, serum&#xD;
      electrolytes, and estimated glomerular filtration rate), HRQL, and depression status were&#xD;
      collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. The results indicated that there were no differences&#xD;
      in changes of dialytic parameters from baseline between EG and CG. However, the EG had&#xD;
      increased HRQL (ß = 22.6, p&lt;.001) and reduced depression status (ß = -7.5, p = .02) at 12&#xD;
      weeks compared with the CG. A 12-week intradialytic exercise is safe, feasible and effective&#xD;
      in improved HRQL and reduced depression status for hemodialysis patients.&#xD;
