  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the long-term effect of glepaglutide on the&#xD;
      intestinal absorption, nutritional status of participants with Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS).&#xD;
      The trial will also investigate whether glepaglutide is safe during long-term use. All&#xD;
      participants in the trial will receive glepaglutide injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 14 visits with the study doctor. At 2 of these, participants will&#xD;
      spend 48 hours at the trial site, one visit at the start of the trial and one after 24 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with glepaglutide. At all visits, participants will meet with trial staff and&#xD;
      will have blood tests along with other clinical checks and tests done. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked about their health and medical history.&#xD;

    <description>Measured by 48-hour metabolic balance studies. The metabolic balance study measures the total intake and output of energy, macronutrients (lipids, carbohydrates, proteins) and micronutrients. The oral diet (food and fluids) are assessed by duplicate meals and liquids. During the metabolic balance study, the patients will collect duplicate portions of all fluids and liquids covering 24-hour periods. Likewise, all output (ostomy output, diarrhea and urine production) will be collected, quantified and analyzed.</description>

          -  More than 2 SBS-related or PS-related hospitalizations (e.g., catheter-related&#xD;
             bacteremia/sepsis, bowel obstruction, severe water-electrolytes disturbances, etc.)&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poorly controlled inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that is moderately or severely&#xD;
             active or fistula interfering with measurements or examinations required in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current bowel obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known radiation enteritis or significant villous atrophy, e.g., due to active celiac&#xD;
             disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac disease defined as: decompensated heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
             [NYHA] Class III-IV), unstable angina pectoris, and/or myocardial infarction within&#xD;
             the last 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of colon cancer. History of any other cancers (except margin-free resected&#xD;
             cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinoma or adequately treated in situ cervical&#xD;
             cancer) unless disease-free state for at least 5 years&#xD;
