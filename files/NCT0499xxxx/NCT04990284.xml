      This is a randomized, parallel group, multicentre, multinational, prospective, open-label&#xD;
      exploratory study in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients to evaluate the add-on efficacy of&#xD;
      opicapone 50 mg or an extra dose of levodopa (L-DOPA) 100 mg as first strategy for the&#xD;
      treatment of wearing-off.&#xD;

      The study consists of a one-week screening period, four weeks of open-label treatment and two&#xD;
      weeks of post-study follow-up. The total study duration for each patient will be&#xD;
      approximately 7 weeks&#xD;
