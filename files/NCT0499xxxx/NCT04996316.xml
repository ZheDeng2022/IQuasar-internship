      This study collects information to implement MammoScreen for Breast Cancer Screening and&#xD;
      Referrals. MammoScreen is a risk assessment questionnaire that identifies individuals at&#xD;
      average and increased risk for breast cancer and guides their screening decisions.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Uptake of MammoScreen (the proportion of women who enroll and use MammoScreen, also&#xD;
      referred to as Reach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identification of women with above-average risk for breast cancer by MammoScreen&#xD;
      integrated with the electronic health record (EHR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rates of mammography screening referral. II. Screening completed and mammography results&#xD;
      stratified by risk category. III. Among those who meet criteria, genetic counseling referral,&#xD;
      visit completed and genetic test done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL STAFF: During development some clinical team members will participate in usability&#xD;
      testing (up to 30 minutes) of the electronic health record interface with MammoScreen. Some&#xD;
      participants will participate in interviews lasting up to 30 minutes at baseline, then&#xD;
      undergo training sessions of about 20 minutes monthly prior to MammoScreen launch. Clinical&#xD;
      staff also participate in interviews up to 30 minutes after MammoScreen launch during years&#xD;
      2-4. Participants complete surveys during the first month of the maintenance phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS: Patients participate in interviews lasting up to 1 hour. Patients medical records&#xD;
      are reviewed. Patients will be invited via MyChart to use the MammoScreen. Reminders will be&#xD;
      sent via MyChart to non-respondents at 2 and 4 weeks. Patients will use MammoScreen one time&#xD;
      right after enrollment. Some patients may also participate in interviews up to 1 hour each&#xD;
      during years 3-5.&#xD;

    <description>Defined as the proportion of women who enroll and use MammoScreen.

    <description>The proportions of patients who open, and complete MammoScreen and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who complete MammoScreen versus those who do not will be compared using a two-sample t-test or chi-square test as appropriate. Variation in completing MammoScreen by patient (e.g., age) and provider characteristics (e.g., panel size) will be explored.</description>
