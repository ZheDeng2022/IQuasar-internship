  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, repeated single-arm trial, 8 healthy adults consumed 20 grams of formula&#xD;
      that contain 60.2% inulin (w/w) dissolved in 100 ml of water. Blood glucose was measured in&#xD;
      fasted participants and at, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after starting to eat a prepared meal&#xD;
      (470 Kcal). As supplementation controls, the investigators used the vehicle-glucose,&#xD;
      dextrose, isomaltooligosaccharides (IMO), or the combination of IMO and Inulin solution 20%&#xD;
      (w/v).&#xD;

      Subjects In this trial, 8 healthy subjects (6 women and 2 men), aged between 23-37 years old&#xD;
      were voluntarily recruited. Inclusion criteria were: healthy men or women aged between 18-50&#xD;
      years old, body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-25.0, normal diet, not under any medication,&#xD;
      and not having any history of metabolic diseases or abnormalities such as systemic&#xD;
      hypertension (resting blood pressure more than 140/90 mmHg), impaired glucose tolerance&#xD;
      (fasting blood glucose concentration between 100-126 mg/dL and oral glucose tolerance test or&#xD;
      OGTT more than 140 mg/dL), and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Subjects were&#xD;
      excluded if they had an acute infection, pregnant, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, renal disease, pancreatic disease, and take any medication during or 1 week before&#xD;
      trial. At the beginning of the trial, demographic data including age, sex, history of&#xD;
      diseases, medication, diet, and physical activities within 3 days were collected using a&#xD;
      questionnaire form. Bodyweight was measured using Omron digital scale HN286 (PT. Omron&#xD;
      Manufacturing of Indonesia). Body height was measured using a stature meter. To determine the&#xD;
      amount of daily calorie expenditure for selection of the suitable ready-meal, the estimated&#xD;
      energy requirements (EER) were calculated based on the harris-benedict formula as previously&#xD;
      reported45, with the physical activity level 1.0 (sedentary activity). This research was&#xD;
      approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of Widya Mandala Catholic University&#xD;
      Surabaya (No. 131/WM12/KEPK/DOSEN/T/2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design This experimental design adapted a single-arm trial analysis. A group of&#xD;
      8 subjects received intervention with single pre-meal supplementation. After that, the&#xD;
      glycaemic response was measured (see blood sampling preparation). This intervention was&#xD;
      repeated every week with five different supplementation formulae (see below) for five&#xD;
      consecutive weeks. The difference in their glycaemic response after meal for every&#xD;
      intervention was measured and analyzed statistically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplement preparation: Inulin formulations, isomaltooligosaccharides formulations, the&#xD;
      combination of inulin and isomaltooligosaccharides formulations, dextrose solution, and&#xD;
      vehicle-glucose formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first week, the investigators measured glycaemic response to a meal without any&#xD;
      intervention and use those data as a baseline. For the intervention, the investigators used&#xD;
      the untreated control without supplementation (NS), HP Inulin formulations (IF),&#xD;
      isomaltooligosaccharides/IMO formulations (IM, this formulation is marketed as Fibercreme®),&#xD;
      the combination of HP inulin and IMO formula (MF), dextrose solution (DS), and&#xD;
      vehicle-glucose formulations (VO) in the form of powder. All the supplementation formulas are&#xD;
      purchased from PT. Lautan Natural Krimerindo (Mojokerto, Jawa Timur, Indonesia). The detailed&#xD;
      composition of each formulation could be seen in Supplementary Table 1. For the preparation&#xD;
      of 20% IF, IM, and MF solution, 20 grams of designated powder was diluted in 100 ml distilled&#xD;
      water. For 20% DS, 20 grams of purified dextrose monohydrate was diluted in 100 ml distilled&#xD;
      water. IMO solution was chosen as a control because IMO could act as partially digestible&#xD;
      dietary fibre.43 Vehicle-glucose could act as a negative control for IF intervention because&#xD;
      IF contains similar ingredients with the IF, but instead of inulin, glucose syrup was added&#xD;
      as the caloric source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: fasting, pre-meal supplementation, and meal Three days before the intervention,&#xD;
      every subject was informed to maintain their normal diet, physical activities, and enough&#xD;
      sleep (6-8 hours/day). All subjects fasted 10-12 hours before the intervention. Supplement&#xD;
      formula solution 20% (w/v) then given orally before a meal for five consecutive weeks in the&#xD;
      following orders: IF in the first week, followed by IM in the second week, MF in the third&#xD;
      week, DS in the fourth week, and VO in the last week. The meal for experimental subjects was&#xD;
      given after intervention and contained 470 kcal &quot;Ready Meal&quot;. The amount of calories in&#xD;
      &quot;Ready-Meal&quot; is 25-30% from the calculated EER (see table 1). The macronutrient composition&#xD;
      of the &quot;Ready Meal&quot; was purchased from PT. Charoen Pokphand Indonesia,TbK (Jakarta,&#xD;
      Indonesia) was listed in supplementary table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling preparation, blood glucose, and glycaemic response (iAUC) measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An intravenous cannula was inserted into the cubital vein to provide access to repeated&#xD;
      glucose measurement. Peripheral vein whole blood samples were taken for analysis of glucose&#xD;
      concentration using a commercially available FreeStyle Optium glucose monitoring system&#xD;
      (Abbot Laboratories, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Blood glucose was measured at 0, 30, 60, 90,&#xD;
      and 120 minutes after intervention and meal. The first measurement at 0 representing the&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG), that is the blood glucose concentration after an overnight fast&#xD;
      (10-12 hours). The glycaemic response measurement unit at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes for&#xD;
      each subject was described as the incremental area under the curve (iAUC). The iAUC refers to&#xD;
      actual body exposure to certain substances after their administration. The AUC depends on the&#xD;
      rate of substance elimination from the body and its dose of administration. iAUC calculation&#xD;
      (symbolized with A) was carried out using a linear trapezoidal method and formula (see&#xD;
      supplementary figure 1) as described in the literature.44&#xD;
