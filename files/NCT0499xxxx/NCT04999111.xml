      The purposes of this study are to demonstrate the non-inferiority (NI) of the neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody response to the original strain 14 days after booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
      at the different dose levels, administered greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6 months after&#xD;
      single-dose primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S, compared to the neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      response to the original strain induced by single-dose primary vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S;&#xD;
      To demonstrate the NI of the neutralizing antibody response to the leading variant of high&#xD;
      consequence or concern 14 days after booster vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5*10^10&#xD;
      virus particle (vp) dose level, administered &gt;= 6 months after single-dose primary&#xD;
      vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S (5*10^10 vp dose level), compared to the neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      response to the leading variant of high consequence or concern induced by single-dose primary&#xD;
      vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5*10^10 vp dose level, if feasible; To demonstrate the NI&#xD;
