  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy women undergoes anatomical, mechanical and physiological changes to meet the&#xD;
      demand of growing fetus. Dyspnea is a common complaint in pregnancy related to change in&#xD;
      respiratory centre threshold and sensitivity. Pregnant women who engaged in regular exercise&#xD;
      have less pregnancy induced discomforts like dyspnea and leg cramps than who did not engage&#xD;
      in exercise. During pregnancy women undergoes anatomical, mechanical and physiological&#xD;
      changes to meet the demand of growing fetus. Purpose of this study was to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of volume Spirometry and breathing exercise on dyspnea in third trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Rationale of the study was to find the effects of volume Spirometry and breathing&#xD;
      exercise on dyspnea with focus on method of deep breathing exercise and volume Spirometry and&#xD;
      outcomes. Significance of this study was to improve functional capacity and quality of life&#xD;
      in pregnancy induced dyspnea. Subjects were randomly allocated to either two groups both&#xD;
      groups received baseline treatment while interventional group received volume Spirometry and&#xD;
      deep breathing exercise. Estimated sample size of 48 divided into 24 in either group by&#xD;
      randomization. Modified Borg scale and visual analog scale were used to collect the findings.&#xD;
      Non-parametric tests were used and analyzed by using spss22.&#xD;

    <measure>Modified dyspnea Borg scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd week</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale is most commonly used to assess symptoms of breathlessness. It has a range from 0 to 10 (with 0 being no exertion and 10 being maximum effort).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd week</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire that consist of 5 statements about breathlessness. Grade0, get breathlessness only at strenuous exercise. Grade1, got breathlessness when hurrying on level ground. Grade2, walk slower than the people of my age on the level. Grade3, stop for breath after few minutes of walk on the level. Grade4, too breathlessness to leave the house when dressing or undressing.</description>

    <measure>London chest activity of Daily Living questionnaire (LCADL)</measure>
    <time_frame>2nd week</time_frame>
    <description>It consist of four domains Selfcare, domestic activities, physical activities and leisure activities.&#xD;
Selfcare, domestic, physical and leisure activities contains 4, 6, 2 and 3 items respectively. Each item is graded by numbers 0-5, 0 mean little or no dyspnea and 5 mean worst dyspnea.gy</description>
