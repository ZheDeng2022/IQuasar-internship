  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if nicotinamide riboside can reduce the airways&#xD;
      inflammation associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients aged 60&#xD;
      or older. A major event in aging is the loss of the central metabolite nicotinamide adenine&#xD;
      dinucleotide (NAD+) that appear to be important in the proinflammatory environment that occur&#xD;
      during aging. Notably, recent work suggest that aging can be ameliorated by even a short-term&#xD;
      treatment of the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside. Nicotinamide riboside has recently&#xD;
      been shown to be able to return aging tissues to a younger state even after short term&#xD;
      treatment. This vitamin B3- analog is naturally occurring, is readily taken up through oral&#xD;
      administration and has been tested in human trials with few side effects. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that six weeks of nicotinamide riboside supplementation reduces interleukin-8&#xD;
      measured in sputum from COPD patients. Further, it is hypothesized that augmentation of NAD+&#xD;
      in COPD patients might alleviate symptoms through activation of sirtuins.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major problem that affect more and more&#xD;
      people worldwide with over three million deaths reported every year. COPD has been described&#xD;
      as a disease of accelerated lung aging and is associated with oxidative stress and an&#xD;
      increased inflammatory response to for instance viral infections. Therefore, in the current&#xD;
      pandemic COPD patients are considered at high risk of COVID-19-related death and&#xD;
      interventions in this group are crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major event in aging is the loss of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-a loss which&#xD;
      may be important in promoting the pro-inflammatory environment that occur with aging and&#xD;
      therefore possibly COPD. Indeed, NAD+ is emerging as a central metabolic molecule involved in&#xD;
      multiple age-related pathways including inflammation and metabolic control. Recently, it was&#xD;
      shown that age-associated NAD+ loss is due to macrophage M1-polarization, suggesting that&#xD;
      NAD+ is required for macrophage activation, an event that is involved in the pulmonary&#xD;
      inflammatory response. In humans, the therapeutic potential of boosting NAD+ levels through&#xD;
      supplementation with one of its more bioavailable precursors has therefore gained attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD+ precursor and recent work suggests that aging can be&#xD;
      ameliorated by even short-term treatment with NR. This vitamin B3-analog is naturally&#xD;
      occurring, is readily taken up through oral administration and has been tested in human&#xD;
      trials with few side effects. Notably, NR treatment in humans decreases circulating markers&#xD;
      of inflammation. In addition, NAD+ replenishment may facilitate overall greater resilience of&#xD;
      older patients considering the anti-aging effects of NR allowing these patients to better&#xD;
      cope with infections. Interestingly, NR has been shown to return aging tissues to a younger&#xD;
      state, possibly through augmentation of the sirtuin enzyme family-known to play an important&#xD;
      role in almost all cellular functions. COPD patients have reduced sirtuin levels in the&#xD;
      airways likely due to oxidative stress. Because sirtuins are NAD+-dependent, supplementation&#xD;
      with NR could serve as a treatment option for patients with COPD through activation of&#xD;
      sirtuins. In addition, NAD+ replenishment may facilitate overall greater resilience of older&#xD;
      patients considering the anti-aging effects of nicotinamide riboside allowing these patients&#xD;
      to better cope with infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chosen dosage is 2 g per day given orally. This dose has been shown to be safe and&#xD;
      tolerated. The dose will be split in two with ingestion of 1 g in the morning and 1 g in the&#xD;
      evening. NR is a naturally occurring vitamin B3 analog produced by yeast and found in&#xD;
      multiple food products at low concentration. Many organisms including humans cannot produce&#xD;
      NR but have instead evolved methods to convert this into the central redox modulator NAD+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of NR supplementation has been tested in a number of studies in both&#xD;
      healthy middle-aged and older adults and in patients suffering from metabolic disease. Since&#xD;
      this is a natural compound widely found in nature no subjects have yet developed allergic&#xD;
      responses to the molecule, and repeated doses of up to 2 g orally per day have demonstrated&#xD;
      an acceptable safety profile. No treatment-emergent adverse events have so far been reported&#xD;
      for NR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older adults (age ≥ 60 years) with a diagnosis of COPD will be recruited from the Respiratory&#xD;
      Medicine and Emergency departments at Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark, and through&#xD;
      advertisements on online websites (e.g. www.lungeforskning.dk). Lung-healthy controls will be&#xD;
      recruited through online websites (e.g. www.forsøgsperson.dk). Potential participants will be&#xD;
      asked if they want to participate in this trial and informed about the study procedures. If&#xD;
      they agree and if they meet the inclusion and not the exclusion criteria, the subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized to either the NR or placebo group. All subjects that give informed consent to&#xD;
      participate will receive a study identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints will be assessed at baseline, after the 6-week treatment and follow-up after&#xD;
      18 weeks. Telephone follow-up will be conducted after 58 weeks. Endpoints include airway&#xD;
      inflammation measured in sputum, untargeted RNA sequencing of nasal epithelial cells, DNA&#xD;
      methylation and untargeted metabolomics in peripheral mononucleated cells, circulating&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and NAD+ levels in whole-blood, in addition to clinical outcomes such as&#xD;
      lung function (spirometry), chest x-ray and questionnaires.&#xD;
