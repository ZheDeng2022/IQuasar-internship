  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a technology-enhanced educational intervention for caregivers and children who&#xD;
      are hospitalized due to asthma. We will conduct a pilot RCT with 60 children (5-11 yrs)&#xD;
      hospitalized with asthma at the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, NY. After baseline&#xD;
      assessment, subjects will be randomized to either: 1) the Telehealth Education for Asthma&#xD;
      Connecting Hospital and Home (TEACHH) intervention, which includes inpatient child/caregiver&#xD;
      education using pictorial materials, color/shape labels for home medications (green&#xD;
      star=controller, yellow/red circles=rescue), and a pair of in-home, smartphone-based&#xD;
      telehealth visits after discharge to reinforce effective home management; or, 2) the standard&#xD;
      care (SC) condition, which features standard inpatient education and routine outpatient&#xD;
      follow-up. Patients in TEACHH will also receive all SC measures. All caregivers will complete&#xD;
      blinded telephone follow-up assessments at 2, 4, and 6 months after discharge; children will&#xD;
      be asked medication questions at baseline and 6 months. We will describe the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of implementing the TEACHH intervention by reviewing process measure data&#xD;
      collected throughout the study; assess the preliminary efficacy of TEACHH in improving key&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, including asthma-related ACU at 7 days, 30 days, and 6 months (per&#xD;
      electronic health record documentation) and symptom-free days at each follow-up (reported by&#xD;
      caregivers); and assess secondary clinical and functional outcomes including asthma-related&#xD;
      quality of life, missed school or work due to asthma, caregiver and child medication&#xD;
      knowledge, and reported adherence. We will also invite all caregivers to complete a&#xD;
      semi-structured qualitative interview (1 month after baseline for the TEACHH group, 6 months&#xD;
      after baseline for the SC group). Findings from this work will establish a strong foundation&#xD;
      for a full-scale trial, and guide future efforts to deliver guideline-based asthma care to&#xD;
      underserved children and families at the greatest risk for preventable morbidity.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a 2-year pilot randomized trial of the TEACHH intervention vs.&#xD;
      Standard Care (SC). We will enroll 60 children (5-11 years) with persistent asthma who are&#xD;
      hospitalized at a tertiary care children's hospital with an acute asthma exacerbation. These&#xD;
      children will be systematically screened, and those eligible approached for enrollment. After&#xD;
      enrollment, participants will be randomly assigned to TEACHH or SC. We will measure&#xD;
      feasibility continuously, and measure preliminary efficacy at 2, 4, and 6 months after&#xD;
      enrollment. All caregivers will be invited to complete an additional in-depth interview to&#xD;
      solicit feedback on the TEACHH intervention, and better understand family experiences with&#xD;
      asthma management, educational support, and unmet home needs. We aim to conduct at least 20&#xD;
      interviews among caregivers in the TEACHH group, and 20 interviews among caregivers in the SC&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 5-11 years will be screened for eligibility following admission to the Golisano&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, a tertiary care institution in Rochester, NY. Eligibility will require&#xD;
      persistent asthma severity (as per national guidelines) and a primary or secondary hospital&#xD;
      diagnosis of asthma. We plan to enroll 60 children and caregiver dyads over a 9-month period.&#xD;
      The mean length of stay at GCH for children with primary or secondary diagnoses of asthma is&#xD;
      3.8 days (1.9 days for primary diagnoses), ensuring ample time for study procedures.&#xD;
      According to hospital census data, 293 children 5-11 years old with asthma are admitted for&#xD;
      inpatient asthma care each year (109 primary diagnoses, 184 secondary diagnoses). We&#xD;
      anticipate that at least 75% of these children (~220) will have persistent asthma symptoms&#xD;
      and will be eligible for the pilot study, and we aim to enroll approximately 36% of the 165&#xD;
      eligible children hospitalized within a 9-month timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These ages were chosen because: 1) younger children suffer the largest burden of asthma&#xD;
      morbidity, 2) young children are at high risk for inadequate therapy for asthma, 3) children&#xD;
      at age 5y are beginning to participate in medicine use, and 4) children older than 11 years&#xD;
      have different medical and developmental needs compared to younger children, with different&#xD;
      co-management roles with their parents that shift toward increased independence. The&#xD;
      pictorial lessons, hands-on interactive demonstration of medication technique, and&#xD;
      application of stickers to medications are all developmentally appropriate activities for&#xD;
      this group of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures: Screening will occur in a rolling fashion from October 2021 through&#xD;
      June 2022. The investigators will identify potentially eligible children through a daily&#xD;
      review of the inpatient census at the Golisano Children's Hospital. To be included in this&#xD;
      study, children (5-11 years old) need to have (1) a physician diagnosis of asthma; (2)&#xD;
      inpatient admission to the Golisano Children's Hospital with asthma as a primary or secondary&#xD;
      diagnosis; and (3) persistent asthma or poor asthma control for which daily controller&#xD;
      therapy is recommended by NHLBI guidelines. Caregivers will also need to have access to a&#xD;
      smartphone (or similar device) for telehealth education. Dr. Frey will conduct a brief review&#xD;
      of the patient's chart to determine whether key eligibility criteria are met (no known&#xD;
      language barriers, no other significant medical or developmental conditions). Remaining&#xD;
      eligibility criteria outlined above will be assessed during a brief screening visit with&#xD;
      caregivers in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Assessment: The baseline survey assessment will be conducted following enrollment by&#xD;
      Dr. Frey or his research assistant within the child's hospital room or another comfortable,&#xD;
      private inpatient setting. All survey instruments will be available in English, and questions&#xD;
      will be read aloud to the caregiver and child. Although most questions will be posed to&#xD;
      caregivers, children will also be asked several questions about their medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: After the baseline assessment, children will be randomly assigned to TEACHH or&#xD;
      SC using a permuted block design to ensure an equal balance of children in each group over&#xD;
      time. The URMC Biostatistics Center will develop the randomization scheme independently, and&#xD;
      randomization will be implemented electronically via REDCapTM. All families will receive&#xD;
      information on community resources for asthma management, addressing home asthma triggers,&#xD;
      and smoking cessation. A letter describing study participation will be sent to each child's&#xD;
      PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEACHH Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medicine Availability: All patients will have an albuterol MDI and spacer at the bedside per&#xD;
      inpatient protocol. All subjects will have persistent asthma and should also be treated with&#xD;
      a daily controller medication. We will ask inpatient providers to transmit controller&#xD;
      prescriptions to the hospital outpatient pharmacy, which can send filled prescriptions to&#xD;
      inpatient wards for labeling and teaching. If no prescriptions are needed, we will ask&#xD;
      caregivers to bring controller medications from home. If controller medications are not&#xD;
      available in the hospital, we will use practice inhalers for inpatient TEACHH activities and&#xD;
      ensure proper medication labeling at the first virtual follow-up (below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient asthma education, medication labeling, and smartphone set-up: A dedicated asthma&#xD;
      educator will deliver inpatient education prior to discharge. We will use Zoom, an encrypted,&#xD;
      HIPAA-compliant web-based program, for follow-up education and home management support. All&#xD;
      major elements (teaching materials, medication labels, Zoom telehealth visits) have been&#xD;
      successfully field tested. The inpatient session will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &quot;Let's Take Control of Asthma,&quot; a brief, scripted overview of asthma, medications, and&#xD;
           action plans that uses visual imagery to communicate essential teaching points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Written information to support home management, including: a) pictorial instructions for&#xD;
           using MDIs with a spacer; and b) a pictorial asthma action plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Color- and shape-coded stickers to distinguish controller and rescue medications (green&#xD;
           star=controller, yellow/red circles=rescue). Labels will be applied by patients with&#xD;
           caregiver assistance. Caregivers will apply matching labels to action plans for home&#xD;
           reference when labeling refills. Additional labels will be provided for home. Teach-back&#xD;
           will be used to ensure caregiver and child understanding of when to use each medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A demonstration of correct technique for using inhaled medications. Teach-back and&#xD;
           show-back methods will be used to verify comprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Prior to discharge, the educator will help families download, install, and log in to&#xD;
           Zoom from a smartphone or other available smart device (e.g., tablet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two videoconferencing sessions will be completed 2-4 days and 3 weeks after discharge by the&#xD;
      same inpatient educator; timing will align with guideline recommendations for follow-up after&#xD;
      hospitalization. Preferred times for visits will be reviewed prior to discharge. These visits&#xD;
      are meant to supplement, not replace, recommended PCP follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First visit (2-4 days after discharge): This visit will reinforce key points of home&#xD;
      management. The educator will show digital images from &quot;Let's Take Control of Asthma,&quot; and&#xD;
      review action plans, color/shape labels (including any medicines that were not available&#xD;
      during hospitalization), and inhalation technique. Teach back will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second visit (3 weeks after discharge): This visit will emphasize ongoing management after an&#xD;
      acute exacerbation, including continued use of controller medication and how to request and&#xD;
      label refills. Session checklists will ensure that all components are delivered; ≥20% of&#xD;
      sessions will be recorded and reviewed by the PI to assure fidelity and provide feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care (SC) comparison condition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the SC group will receive standard impatient management, including pre-recorded&#xD;
      asthma education videos shown prior to discharge and the hospital action plan. PCP follow-up&#xD;
      with be scheduled within a week of discharge. All SC measures will also be provided to&#xD;
      subjects randomized to TEACHH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, including all follow-up assessments, will continue throughout the 2020 calendar&#xD;
      year. We will follow subjects for a total of 6 months. After the baseline assessment,&#xD;
      caregivers will complete 3 telephone-based surveys conducted 2-, 4-, and 6-months after&#xD;
      discharge by a research assistant who is blinded to group allocation. Each assessment will&#xD;
      repeat key measures from the baseline. We will use the electronic medical record (EMR) to&#xD;
      review ACU and prescription fill data. To maintain blinding, we will not ask children about&#xD;
      medications (indications for use, techniques) until the 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-Depth Interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers in both arms will also be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews.&#xD;
      All caregivers will be eligible to participate in this, however we aim to complete 40&#xD;
      interviews altogether. The interview guide will explore family experiences with managing&#xD;
      asthma at home, experiences with asthma education and management support before the index&#xD;
      hospitalization, and caregiver opinions on support received during the index hospitalization&#xD;
      with specific emphasis on components of the TEACHH intervention. Interviews will be conducted&#xD;
      over Zoom (or by telephone if preferred), and audio recordings will be transcribed. Thematic&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted on interview transcripts until saturation is achieved within both&#xD;
      the TEACHH and SC groups; we anticipate completing 20 interviews in each group, that will&#xD;
      take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. In order to best capture feedback on the TEACHH&#xD;
      intervention, we will interview caregivers randomized to this group approximately 1 month&#xD;
      after enrollment (about 1 week after the second virtual visit). We plan to interview&#xD;
      caregivers in the SC group after the final follow-up assessment, approximately 6 months after&#xD;
      enrollment. During interviews with the SC group, we will show educational materials from the&#xD;
      TEACHH intervention to solicit feedback.&#xD;
