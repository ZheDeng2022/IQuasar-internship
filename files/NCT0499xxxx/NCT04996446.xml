      Study design: Prospective, single-center, phase IIa clinical trial; Primary endpoint:&#xD;
      Recurrence free survival; Secondary endpoints: Safety, overall survival; Main characteristics&#xD;
      of patients: Liver malignancy, required (extended) hemihepatectomy, insufficient liver&#xD;
      reserve; Study approaches: The experimental group is treated with ALPPS combined with&#xD;
      Tislelizumab, and the control group was treated with ALPPS; Sample size: 20 (10:10); Study&#xD;
      process: In experimental group, patients who meet the inclusion criteria will receive ALPPS&#xD;
      stage I surgery, treated with Tislelizumab 2-4 weeks after stage I surgery, and receive ALPPS&#xD;
      stage II surgery 2-4 weeks after Tislelizumab treatment, and treated with Tislelizumab q3W&#xD;
      6-12 months after stage II surgery; In control group, patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria will receive ALPPS stage I surgery, and receive ALPPS stage II surgery 3-6 weeks&#xD;
      after stage I surgery.&#xD;
