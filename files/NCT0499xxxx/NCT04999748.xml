  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a cross-sectional survey from adults 18 years of age and older to examine&#xD;
      consumer knowledge, attitudes and behavior towards aging skin.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will perform a cross-sectional survey study to understand the significance of age-related&#xD;
      skin changes to consumers. We will recruit participants through ResearchMatch (a national&#xD;
      free and secure online tool) and collect the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, geographic location, and&#xD;
      yearly household income&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How do participants feel towards their own skin and age-related skin changes?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Which aging-related skin changes are the most significant?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What factors affect how participants feel towards their skin?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What role do age-related skin changes play in other aspects of the participants' lives,&#xD;
           such as their social and work life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What treatments are participants currently seeking, and what are their goals for these&#xD;
           treatments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How much do they prioritize these treatments?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What else are they hoping to do?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the demographic information, we will also analyze whether there are differences with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender identity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Racial/ethnic identity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marital status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geographic location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yearly household income&#xD;
