    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized controlled trial, investigator aim to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      early initiation of CRRT on outcomes in patients with acute liver failure with cerebral edema&#xD;
      and hyperammonemia in improving cerebral edema and clinical outcomes. Investigator also aim&#xD;
      to evaluate the effects of early initiation of CRRT on systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output&#xD;
      and systemic vascular resistive index, extravascular lung water and lung permeability index),&#xD;
      endothelial function and coagulation, microcirculation (as assessed by lactate clearance and&#xD;
      central venous oxygen saturation), mitochondrial function. Patients with ALF who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: CRRT initiation within the first 12 hours Group 2: CRRT would be initiated i) In&#xD;
      patients with worsening hyperammonemia despite two sessions of plasma-exchange ii) Patients&#xD;
      meeting renal indications (hyperkalemia, volume overload, oliguria or metabolic acidosis etc)&#xD;

      Study Population: 60 patients with ALF will be randomized to two groups in 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted on patients admitted to Department of Hepatology from May&#xD;
           2021 to March 2023 at ILBS, New Delhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group will comprise of patients with acute liver failure (ALF) with documented&#xD;
           cerebral edema on CT-scan and arterial ammonia &gt;150 ug/dl Study Period: May 2021 to&#xD;
           March 2023 Sample Size calculation: Currently there are lack of studies investigating&#xD;
           the timing of CRRT in patients with ALF therefore a minimum of 60 patients 30 in each&#xD;
           group would be included in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The detailed cytokine profile, endotoxin assay, markers of endothelial dysfunction and&#xD;
      bioenergetics would be performed in a subset of 10 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Continuous renal replacement therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Assessment: Hourly till the patient is in the intensive care unit then every 7&#xD;
      days for 1 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All variables shall be expressed in median (range)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Variables will be compared by Mann- Whitney U test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Categorical variables - Chi-Square or Fisher's test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival analysis will be done using cox-proportional regression analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Actuarial probability of survival shall be calculated by Kaplan- Meier graph and&#xD;
           compared by log- rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard medical treatment: All patients will undergo plain CT-scan of the brain to screen&#xD;
      for the presence and severity of cerebral edema in the emergency before being shifted to the&#xD;
      L-ICU. In the L- ICU, patients will be managed by a multidisciplinary team. Intubation and&#xD;
      ventilation will be undertaken for standard indications in addition to the development of&#xD;
      grade 3 encephalopathy or evidence of cerebral edema on CT-scan. Ventilation will be managed&#xD;
      by fentanyl and propofol along with the use of atracurium for paralysis wherever required.&#xD;
      All patients will be monitored constantly for macro-hemodynamics, global tissue perfusion,&#xD;
      and microcirculation. The macro-hemodynamic parameters included continuous monitoring of mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate and urine output per hour. The real-time monitoring of&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance (SVR), stroke volume variation (SVV), cardiac index (CI) and&#xD;
      cardiac output (CO) will be done by a hemodynamic monitor (FloTracâ„¢ system 4.0, Edwards&#xD;
      Lifesciences, California, US) wherever feasible. Global tissue perfusion adequacy and&#xD;
      indirect assessment of microcirculation will be done by measurement of arterial lactate.&#xD;
      Fluid management will be done with crystalloids, with the use of colloids (5% albumin) in&#xD;
      patients with severe hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin less than 2.5gm/dl). Norepinephrine will&#xD;
      be the primary vasopressor used to target a mean arterial pressure of 65-70 mm of Hg. with&#xD;
      adjunctive use of intravenous low dose hydrocortisone and vasopressin in patients not&#xD;
      responsive to initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral edema: The monitoring of cerebral edema will be performed measuring the optic nerve&#xD;
      sheath diameter (ONSD) in both the eyes using a 7.5 MHz probe every 6-8 hours. Apart from&#xD;
      this, routine monitoring of pupillary size and reactions, extensor posturing and plantar&#xD;
      reflexes will be performed every 6-8 hrs. Transcranial doppler would be done every 6-8 hours.&#xD;
      Patients will receive 3% hypertonic saline as a continuous infusion, initially started at&#xD;
      25ml /hr and titrated 6 hourly to between 5 and 20 mL per hour (maximum 100 ml/hour) to&#xD;
      achieve serum sodium levels between 145-150 mmol/L. Intravenous 20% mannitol (1 g/kg IV&#xD;
      bolus) over 20 to 30 minutes will be administered to those without renal failure. All&#xD;
      patients will in addition receive intravenous N-acetylcysteine for 5 day.Routine&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) will be done for all patients daily to screen for non-convulsive&#xD;
      seizures which will be managed by intravenous levetiracetam. Assessment of coagulation will&#xD;
      be performed by ROTEM at baseline and subsequently as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for standard-volume plasma-exchange&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Standard-Volume Plasma Exchange: SVPE procedures will be performed using either Spectra&#xD;
           Optia (SPO, Terumo BCT, Lakewood, CO, USA) continuous-flow centrifugal apheresis system&#xD;
           or Haemonetics MCS+ (Braintree, MA, USA) intermittent flow centrifugal apheresis system&#xD;
           via a double-lumen central venous dialysis catheter. All patients will receive&#xD;
           plasma-exchange within first 6 hours of admission to the L-ICU along with a target&#xD;
           volume of 1.5 to 2.0 plasma volumes per session. The replacement fluid used will be 90%&#xD;
           FFP and 10% normal saline.PE will be performed on consecutive days until the desired&#xD;
           response is achieved. [using investigator previously published protocol].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of sessions of SVPE in each patient will be decided based on the clinical&#xD;
           response to SVPE. Dynamic assessment of the clinical parameters (signs of CE as assessed&#xD;
           by pupillary size, reaction, and optic nerve-sheath diameter), INR, lactate and arterial&#xD;
           ammonia will be performed at after each TPE. In patients with an improvement in INR, and&#xD;
           signs of CE along with a reduction in ammonia at 6 hours which was sustained at 12 and&#xD;
           24 hours post-SVPE, subsequent sessions will be discontinued. PE will also be&#xD;
           discontinued in patients who would show worsening in either clinical and/ or biochemical&#xD;
           parameters. In patients who will develop adverse events, the PE procedure will be&#xD;
           resumed or discontinued depending on the severity of adverse event and its resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be done by taking 1:1 ratio by computer-generated sealed envelopes by the&#xD;
      clinical trial co-ordinator Group 1-Preemptive CRRT: In patients randomized to early CRRT,&#xD;
      CRRT would be initiated within 12 hours of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: SMT - In patients randomized to SMT group, CRRT would be initiated as per the&#xD;
      existing standard protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in patients with worsening hyperammonemia despite two sessions of plasma-exchange patients&#xD;
      meeting renal indications (hyperkalemia, volume overload, oliguria or metabolic acidosis&#xD;
      etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to initiation of CRRT would be recorded in both groups after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous renal replacement therapy will be administered as continuous venovenous&#xD;
      hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) using Prisma and Prismaflex (Gambro) devices, with blood flows&#xD;
      ranging from 150-180 mL/hr and target effluent rates of 20 - 25 mL/kg/hr. Anticoagulation was&#xD;
      not used during dialysis. CRRT would be continued until resolution of cerebral edema and in&#xD;
      decrease in ammonia levels below 150 ug/dl or in those who develop adverse effects of&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
