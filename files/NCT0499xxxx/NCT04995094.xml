    <textblock>
      Approximately 50 ABA+ subjects with resectable, Stage III (IIIB, IIIC, or IIID) melanoma will&#xD;
      be included in the study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio to neoadjuvant treatment with Imprime&#xD;
      PGG plus pembrolizumab vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy. A baseline, reference biopsy and a&#xD;
      PET/CT scan will be obtained prior to commencing 3 cycles (9 weeks) of neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with either regimen. During Week 5, subjects will provide another biopsy to assess treatment&#xD;
      effects on the tumor and its microenvironment. At the completion of neoadjuvant treatment and&#xD;
      before surgery, subjects will undergo another PET/CT scan to assess radiological and&#xD;
      metabolic response compared to baseline.&#xD;

      Approximately 50 ABA+ subjects with resectable, Stage III (IIIB, IIIC, or IIID) melanoma will&#xD;
      be included in the study and randomized in a 3:2 ratio to neoadjuvant treatment with Imprime&#xD;
      PGG plus pembrolizumab vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy. A baseline, reference biopsy and a&#xD;
      PET/CT scan will be obtained prior to commencing 3 cycles (9 weeks) of neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      with either regimen. During Week 5, subjects will provide another biopsy to assess treatment&#xD;
      effects on the tumor and its microenvironment. At the completion of neoadjuvant treatment and&#xD;
      before surgery, subjects will undergo another PET/CT scan to assess radiological and&#xD;
      metabolic response compared to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then undergo surgical resection. A pre-surgical assessment of operability will&#xD;
      be done by the responsible surgeon, and the investigator will ensure that adverse events&#xD;
      occurring during the treatment period have resolved to the minimal acceptable level that&#xD;
      would not place the subject at undue risk or delay surgery for more than 1 week after the&#xD;
      last dose of Imprime or 3 weeks after last dose of pembrolizumab, when subjects will undergo&#xD;
      surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical specimen will be locally and centrally assessed by a pathologist to determine&#xD;
      the pathological response (pCR, pMR, pPR) induced by the neoadjuvant treatment (central read&#xD;
      will be blinded). Following surgery, subjects will be followed for safety for 90 days. The&#xD;
      total duration of systemic treatment will be 3 cycles (9 weeks). In the Investigational arm,&#xD;
      surgery should be performed no more than a week after the subject's last dose of Imprime PGG&#xD;
      and in the Control arm, surgery should be performed within 3 weeks of the subject's last dose&#xD;
      of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
