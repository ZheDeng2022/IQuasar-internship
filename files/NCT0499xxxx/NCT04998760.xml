      This is a multi-center clinical study to evaluate dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor (ATG 008) or&#xD;
      selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound (ATG-010) in combination with chemotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or metastatic ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer.&#xD;
      And two cohorts of ATG-008 30 mg QD or ATG-010 80 mg QW in combination with chemotherapy will&#xD;
      enroll subjects with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,&#xD;
      endometrial cancer, and cervical cancer, with about 8-12 subjects in either cohort. A total&#xD;
      of about 64-96 subjects plan to be enrolled.&#xD;
