    <textblock>
      In this project a randomized clinical trial was be conducted to determine the comparison of&#xD;
      gross motor training technique and trunk training therapy on balance, Range of motion and&#xD;
      community participation in children with diplegic cerebral palsy. This study aim to compare&#xD;
      the effects of both the treatments to improve balance, quality of life and community&#xD;
      participation. The sample was being collected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      using a convenient sampling technique within period of 6 months. The participants were be&#xD;
      randomly allocated in two groups' .Group A received gross motor training which included sit&#xD;
      to stand, step up and walking for 1 hour/day/3 days a week for 3 months. Group B received&#xD;
      trunk targeted training for 1 hour/day/3 days a week for 3 months which included treadmill&#xD;
      walking, reaching forward to the limits of stability and specific truncal activities with&#xD;
      vibration and proprioception. The post treatment assessments was done via early assessment of&#xD;
      balance, goniometer, and functional mobility assessment&#xD;

    <description>It classifies the functional mobility of children between ages 4-18 years of age with cerebral palsy. The scale can be used to classify children's functional mobility, document change over time in the same child and to document change. The FMS rates walking ability at three specific distances, 5, 50 and 500 meters, (or 5, 50, 500 yards). This represents the child's mobility in the home, at school and in the community setting</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Balance Scale is a modified version of the Berg Balance Scale that is used to assess functional balance skills in school-aged children and children with cerebral palsy. The scale consists of 14 items that are scored from 0 points (lowest function) to 4 points (highest function) with a maximum score of 56 points.</description>

    <description>Gross motor training activity (1 hour session, 3 times a week for 3 months). Pre ad post assessments will be taken. The Gross motor training activity will include: sit to stand, step-ups and walking. The sit to stand will be performed for 20 minutes involving 20 repetitions. We will progress from high seat sit to stand to low seat sit to stand. The step up will progress initially from a bench having low height to high height and then to stepping of stairs for 20 minutes involving 30 repetitions. The walking will occur from 3m walk and then increasing the distance</description>

    <description>Trunk targeted training (1hour session, 3 times a week for 3 months). Pre and Post assessment will be evaluated. The trunk targeted training will include: weight supported treadmill walk, specific trunk exercises with vibration therapy and reaching forward to the limits of stability.&#xD;
Specific trunk exercises will involve stride sitting to standing, sitting on a roll and moving the roll in diagonal and forward backward directions along with giving vibrational therapy on wobble board, side sitting. This activity will be performed for 30 minutes with 30 repetitions. Reaching forward to the limits of stability exercises will be performed. Asking the children to hold objects from right hand while reaching for an object on left side and vice versa. This will be performed for 20 minutes having 20 repetitions.</description>
