  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated, single-center, open-label, Phase IIb clinical trial with&#xD;
      40 patients (for a total of 80 patients) to assess efficacy of Low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
      using soft mist inhaler in the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease of 2019) induced ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The&#xD;
      patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard treatment protocol plus inhaled&#xD;
      Low molecular weight heparin. The primary objective is to determine the hypoxemia improvement&#xD;
      on a 5-point clinical scale for COVID-19 induced ARDS patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lungs are the major target organ of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Multiple drug options have been evaluated for efficacy&#xD;
      against worsening symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Low molecular weight heparin, known for its&#xD;
      antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect, was determined to be applicable for ARDS-induced&#xD;
      Hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases of viral diseases that primarily targets the lungs, oral drugs and parenteral&#xD;
      applications have shown to be insufficient due to low drug accumulation in the target organ&#xD;
      site. An increase in drug dosage in order to achieve the necessary drug concentration leaves&#xD;
      the patient with intolerable side effects. An inhalation delivery route of the drug would not&#xD;
      only directly target the lungs but would also require less dosage. This is expected to&#xD;
      increase patient tolerability and the efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft mist inhalers are advantageous above the other inhalation devices, for it reaches a&#xD;
      higher retention rate in the lungs. Furthermore, the device to be used in this clinical study&#xD;
      provides an &quot;enclosed system&quot; which decreases the risk of environmental contamination, thus&#xD;
      is meant to protect healthcare professionals or to minimize associated contamination risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase-IIb clinical trial is to include 40 critically ill COVID-19 induced ARDS patients,&#xD;
      that will receive Low molecular Weight Heparin via a soft mist inhaler at a dose of 4000 IU&#xD;
      per administration, twice a day for 10 days in addition to the standard treatment determined&#xD;
      by the Turkish Ministry of Health. A total of 80 patients will be enrolled, in which the drug&#xD;
      receiving group will be assigned. The primary outcome of the clinical study is the&#xD;
      improvement of ARDS induced hypoxemia on a 5-scale determination method at the end of the&#xD;
      10th day. The study inquires to perceive the early effects of inhaled Low molecular weight&#xD;
      heparin on critically ill COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
