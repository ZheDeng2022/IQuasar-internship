  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, researchers want to conduct ambulatory studies in which people (healthy,&#xD;
      with T2D, or at-risk of T2D) will consume a variety of pre-set and conventional meals in&#xD;
      free-living conditions while wearing one or more continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and, to&#xD;
      assess physical activity, a smart watch. With data from these devices, researchers will&#xD;
      develop algorithms that can predict the content of a meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor diet contributes to more than half of premature deaths related to cardiovascular and&#xD;
      metabolic disease, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). At present, the number of adults&#xD;
      developing T2D continues to rise, with over 30 million Americans living with T2D. Another 80&#xD;
      million are currently at-risk of progressing from pre-diabetes to T2D. Improving food choices&#xD;
      remains a cornerstone of modern diabetes care and can decrease the risk of progression to&#xD;
      T2D. However, at present, achieving timely and appropriate lifestyle change in adults with or&#xD;
      at-risk of T2D is challenging. Conventional methods to record meal choice and track&#xD;
      nutritional composition can be inaccurate (e.g., estimating protein content of a meal) and&#xD;
      burdensome (i.e., individuals must manually enter information into a food diary).&#xD;
      Interestingly, the blood glucose profile after a meal depends not only on the carbohydrate&#xD;
      content but also on the amount of fat, protein, and fiber; as an example, adding fat and&#xD;
      protein to carbohydrates generally leads to smaller increases and slower decreases in&#xD;
      achieved glucose levels, lowering risk. This suggests that the shape of the glucose response&#xD;
      to a meal may have the potential to indicate meal content. A unique opportunity to exploit&#xD;
      this information is to use one or more continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). A CGM is a small&#xD;
      sensor that attaches to the skin and measures glucose continuously every 1-15 minutes, making&#xD;
      it possible to automatically record the glucose responses to meals. Researchers anticipate&#xD;
      that findings will help clinicians provide new information to support positive behavior&#xD;
      change to reduce the risk of or progression from pre-diabetes to T2D, and make it easier for&#xD;
      patients to passively and accurately track nutritional components of their diet, potentially&#xD;
      leading to healthier diets and improved health.&#xD;
