    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a daily consumption for 2 weeks of a&#xD;
      sourdough croissant enriched with dietary fibers vs a control sourdough croissant with no&#xD;
      fiber added on daily energy intakes, fasting metabolic parameters, inflammatory status, blood&#xD;
      pressure, anthropometric measures, body composition, appetite sensations, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      functionality and gut microbiota composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Associations between human health, diet and gut microbiota composition and functionality have&#xD;
      been widely highlighted by the scientific literature in this field. Evidence shows that&#xD;
      population adopting a Western dietary model, with a reduced intake of dietary fiber, undergo&#xD;
      an adaptation of the gut microbiota characterized by the loss of some bacterial species and a&#xD;
      general reduction in microbial biodiversity. The national guidelines for a healthy diet&#xD;
      suggest to include daily fruit, vegetables, whole grains and legumes (the main sources of&#xD;
      fiber in the diet) in the habitual diet to reduce the risk of diseases and to improve health.&#xD;
      However, the compliance with these nutritional recommendations is generally low among&#xD;
      individuals. Therefore, the commercial availability of dietary fiber-enriched products could&#xD;
      be advantageous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breakfast is an important meal that should provide at least 20% of the daily calories with an&#xD;
      adequate supply of all nutrients. Having fiber-enriched foods for breakfast could bring&#xD;
      numerous nutritional benefits and if they are made with sourdough may be even better. Indeed,&#xD;
      sourdough leavened baked products provide compounds with potential prebiotic activity, reduce&#xD;
      the glucose and insulin response, increase satiety and reduce gastro-intestinal disorders&#xD;
      upon consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the combination of sourdough and dietary fiber in baked products could&#xD;
      further ameliorate glucose metabolism in consumers compared to sourdough products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a daily consumption at breakfast for 2&#xD;
      weeks of a sourdough croissant enriched with dietary fibers from 10 different sources vs a&#xD;
      sourdough croissant with no fiber added (control) on daily energy intakes, metabolic and&#xD;
      inflammatory status, appetite feelings, body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist and hip&#xD;
      circumferences, body composition, blood pressure, gut microbiota composition and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal functionality in healthy subjects.&#xD;
