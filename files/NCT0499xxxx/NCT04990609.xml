  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the feasibility, tolerability, and treatment&#xD;
      effect of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) plus standard-of-care&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in the treatment of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)&#xD;
      will be performed before tumor resection surgery, with the goal of shrinking a tumor or&#xD;
      stopping the spread of cancer so that surgery might be less invasive and more effective.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of participants who are able to complete neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus EUS-RFA and later undergo surgical tumor resection</measure>

    <measure>Radiographic treatment response as assessed by standard Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months after the initiation of chemotherapy</time_frame>
    <description>Using the RECIST criteria, treatment response is categorized as follows:&#xD;
Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions&#xD;
Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD&#xD;
Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started&#xD;
Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions</description>

    <intervention_name>Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)</intervention_name>
    <description>Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)-guided Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) consists of the application of alternating current with a frequency of 350-500 kilohertz (kHz) to the target tissue via a special electrode located at the tip of an echoendoscope. The alternating current causes the vibratory movement of ionic particles in the abutting and adjoining tissue and results in the generation of heat. However, RFA induces not only local disruption of the tumor by heat, but it also produces localized coagulation necrosis of the tumor which induces the release of large amounts of cellular debris which represent a source of tumor antigens that can trigger a host adaptive immune response against the tumor.</description>
