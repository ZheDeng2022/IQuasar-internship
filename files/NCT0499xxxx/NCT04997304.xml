    <textblock>
      This trial is being completed to determine baseline inhalation parameters and patterns of use&#xD;
      in patients receiving treatment with TEVA digital inhalers, to develop predictive models for&#xD;
      asthma exacerbations and response to biologics using data collected from these devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will complete questionnaires along with other study specific&#xD;
      procedures. Additionally, in-person and phone visits will be performed.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>AirDuo Digihaler</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will receive the AirDuo® Digihaler™ at a dose that is equivalent to the patients current inhaled therapy dose. Most patients will likely require the high dose inhaler: 232/14 device. This medication will be administered twice daily. The study and treatment will last 1 year.&#xD;
Participants will also use a home spirometry device and smart device application (app) will be used to track medication usage and allow users to self-assess their respiratory symptoms on a daily basis.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive the ProAir® Digihaler™ 90mcg at a dose that is equivalent to the patients current inhaled therapy dose. Most patients will likely require the high dose inhaler: 232/14 device. The ProAir® Digihaler™ will be utilized up to six times per day as needed for acute asthma symptoms. The study and treatment will last 1 year.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of severe persistent asthma as defined by European Respiratory Society (ERS)&#xD;
             and American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) criteria which includes the presence of poor&#xD;
             asthma control on high dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting&#xD;
             beta-agonist (CS/LABA) or the need for high dose ICS/LABA to maintain asthma control&#xD;
             or oral steroids for maintenance therapy for more than 50% of the prior year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of current biologic use or planned initiation of biologics following study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be categorized on the basis of asthma control (Asthma Control Test&#xD;
             (ACT)&lt; 19 will be considered poor asthma control). The study will cap the patients&#xD;
             with good asthma control at 30% and will no longer enroll those patients once the&#xD;
             strata have been fully enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to switch maintenance inhalers to AirDuo® Digihaler™ and to use ProAir®&#xD;
             Digihaler™ for rescue therapy. Use of nebulized albuterol will be discouraged but not&#xD;
             prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Can read and communicate in English and is familiar with and is willing to use his/her&#xD;
             own smart device and download and use the study application&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements and&#xD;
             restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma including Chronic obstructive&#xD;
             pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, or&#xD;
             other lung disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any disorder that is either not stable or could in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             affect the ability of the subject to safely participate in the study or could&#xD;
             adversely affect study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus or other immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy other than skin cancer that has occurred within the past year and that will&#xD;
             impact survival thus limit participation in the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic alcohol abuse or drug use&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any life-threatening diseases that will impact the patient's ability to complete the&#xD;
             12-month study period&#xD;
