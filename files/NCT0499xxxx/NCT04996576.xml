  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a minimally invasive, effective surgical&#xD;
      technique that is commonly used to treat chronic rhino sinusitis and nasal polyposis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-operative bleeding obscures the surgical view and increases the likelihood of&#xD;
      iatrogenic complications. There are many factors that can affect the amount of bleeding&#xD;
      experienced during surgery including both patient and surgical factors. These include severe&#xD;
      forms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyposis which is associated with increased&#xD;
      vascularity, use of anticoagulant therapy, bleeding disorders, active infection, vascular&#xD;
      tumor on the surgical site and revision surgery may affect bleeding on surgical site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is the main sensory innervation to the nasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) is one of the regional anesthetic techniques that&#xD;
      were used effectively before removal of nasal packing and in patients undergoing endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery under general anaesthesia to control bleeding or for postoperative analgesia&#xD;

    <description>bloodless clear surgical field will be assessed for each side by surgeon using five categories categories.&#xD;
= uncontrolled bleeding.&#xD;
= severe bleeding, surgical conditions distorted immediately afterwards suctioning.&#xD;
= moderate bleeding, frequent suctioning required, visibility of the surgical field is moderate.&#xD;
= slight bleeding, occasional suctioning required, visibility of the surgical field is good.&#xD;
= no bleeding almost bloodless surgical field.</description>

During the observation period, arterial blood pressure will be continuously monitored every 15 minutes for 1 hour. Patients meeting PACU discharge criteria will be transferred to the surgical ward. blood pressure will be reported every 4 hours for 24 hours.</description>

Pain severity will be divided into 3 groups: mild, score of &lt;4; moderate, score of 4 to 6; and severe &gt;6</description>
