  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatocellular carcinoma,HCC,) accounts for 85% to 90% of primary&#xD;
      liver cancer. Worldwide, there are more than 700000 new cases of liver cancer every year, 55%&#xD;
      of which are concentrated in China, which is the fourth most common malignant tumor and the&#xD;
      third leading cause of death in China. More importantly, the onset of liver cancer is hidden,&#xD;
      and 70% to 80% of patients with liver cancer are in the middle and advanced stage when they&#xD;
      are first diagnosed, so they lose the opportunity for surgical treatment. Therefore, liver&#xD;
      cancer seriously affects the life and health of the people. For these unresectable middle and&#xD;
      advanced liver cancer, that is, Barcelona stage (barcelona clinic liver cancer,BCLC) stage C,&#xD;
      BCLC and the European Association for the study of liver Diseases ((European Association for&#xD;
      the Study of Liver Diseases)) recommended transarterial chemoembolization (transarterial&#xD;
      chemoembolization,TACE) and systematic treatment, respectively. However, a number of clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that the prognosis of patients with advanced liver cancer who underwent&#xD;
      surgical resection is significantly better than that of TACE or systemic therapy alone.&#xD;
      Therefore, how to convert unresectable liver cancer into resectable liver cancer has always&#xD;
      been a hot issue in clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatectomy is to reduce the tumor load and tumor stage through some or several treatments,&#xD;
      so that unresectable liver cancer can become resectable liver cancer and tumor resection.&#xD;
      There are two purposes of translational therapy: one is that translational therapy can reduce&#xD;
      tumor size, reduce tumor stage and improve its biological characteristics; the other is that&#xD;
      translational therapy can select tumors with good biological characteristics. In 1977, Shafer&#xD;
      et al reported that a single unresectable hepatoblastoma was successfully resected after&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and first mentioned the concept of liver cancer transformation&#xD;
      therapy. Subsequently, sitzmann, Tang and fan reported the use of 131I or 90Y labeled anti&#xD;
      ferritin antibody, TACE and TACE in the treatment of unresectable liver cancer. Finally, 8%&#xD;
      to 18% of HCC patients underwent transformation resection. To be sure, the combination of&#xD;
      multiple ways of transformation therapy can improve the success rate of transformation and&#xD;
      prolong the survival of patients. But these studies are retrospective, the sample size is&#xD;
      small, and the treatment plan is lack of unity. In addition, with the continuous emergence of&#xD;
      targeted drugs and immune checkpoint blocking therapy (such as programmed death receptor-1,&#xD;
      PD-1), the treatment mode of liver cancer has changed, and the success rate of transformation&#xD;
      and resection may also be improved. Therefore, a prospective clinical study is urgently&#xD;
      needed to explore the safety and effectiveness of hepatectomy in the new era of molecular&#xD;
      targeted drugs and immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of liver cancer transformation includes local treatment and systemic therapy.&#xD;
      The former includes TACE, transcatheter embolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous&#xD;
      alcohol injection, etc., among which TACE is the most commonly used local treatment. Fan and&#xD;
      other scholars analyzed 65 patients with TACE after operation for liver cancer: the diameter&#xD;
      of median tumor decreased from 9.9cm to 3.7cm, 35.9% (14/39) patients recovered AFP level,&#xD;
      and the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival rate of patients were 80%, 65% and 56%,&#xD;
      respectively. However, the pathological findings showed that 83.1% (54/65) of the tumors&#xD;
      still failed to complete necrosis. Obviously, TACE is difficult to achieve complete necrosis&#xD;
      of tumor as a non radical treatment. Moreover, the lack of 4 blood damage caused by TACE can&#xD;
      induce the up regulation of related molecules (such as vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) which can promote the growth, invasion and metastasis of tumor. Therefore, TACE&#xD;
      combined with antiangiogenic drugs can theoretically inhibit the angiogenesis and tumor&#xD;
      growth induced by TACE, and TACE can reduce tumor effect or permit sensitization of&#xD;
      antiangiogenic drugs. Solafeni and lumbotinib are first-line systemic therapy drugs for&#xD;
      advanced liver cancer patients approved by FDA and CFDA. As a multi-target receptor tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase inhibitor (TKI), they mainly inhibit VEGF receptor-1,2,3, FGF receptor-1,2,3,4, PDGFR&#xD;
      α, RET and kit, thus inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, inducing apoptosis and&#xD;
      playing an anti angiogenesis role. However, compared with solafeni, the binding of lumbotini&#xD;
      with target molecules has stronger affinity. Based on an open label, multicenter, phase III&#xD;
      non inferior effect clinical study, the results showed that the median survival time (13.6&#xD;
      months vs. 12.3 months) of the patients with liver cancer was the same as that of solafeni&#xD;
      group, but the progression time (9.2 months vs. 3.6 months) and objective remission rate&#xD;
      (24.1% vs. 9.2%) were better than those in the solafeni group. Therefore, TACE combined with&#xD;
      lumbotinib may have better clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immune checkpoint blocking therapy may enhance the immune response induced by local&#xD;
      treatment. TACE and other local treatment can make the body produce immune response. Local&#xD;
      treatment leads to tumor cell death, apoptosis (non-cell necrosis) induces specific immunity&#xD;
      of tumor, such as the release of calcium net protein and other endoplasmin on the cell&#xD;
      surface, ATP secretion during the apoptosis and foaming stage, and the release of high&#xD;
      mobility group box associated with cell death of non-histone chromatin group 1 1. HMGB1)&#xD;
      promotes the collection, activation and entry of dendritic cells into the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment. The tumor antigen of tumor cells is phagocyted and the best antigen is&#xD;
      presented to T cells. This process is called immunogenic cell death (ICD). Adriamycin&#xD;
      (epirubicin, doxorubicin) as the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent of TACE can&#xD;
      enhance the immunogenicity of ICD. Therefore, TACE has been shown to promote ICD and induce&#xD;
      tumor associated antigen-specific reactions. Ni Quanfa et al. Found that the levels of CD3 +,&#xD;
      CD4 +, CD4 + / CD8 + increased significantly at 3 and 4 weeks after TACE treatment. Liao Juan&#xD;
      and other researchers found that TACE can correct the low immune function of patients with&#xD;
      HCC and make them partially recover. Kazumasa hiroishi and others studied 20 patients with&#xD;
      HCC receiving TACE and RFA respectively. 80% of patients produced tumor specific antibody and&#xD;
      cd8+ immune response one month later. Lakshmana ayaru et al. Found that APF specific CD4 + T&#xD;
      cells increased after HCC embolization. Immune checkpoint blockade refers to blocking the&#xD;
      inhibitory receptors or ligands on the surface of T cells, such as PD-1 / PD-L1, CTLA4 and&#xD;
      Vista, to partially reverse T cell failure and improve tumor T cell response. This innovative&#xD;
      treatment has been verified in a variety of solid tumors. Sangro et al. Showed that local&#xD;
      treatment combined with immune checkpoint blocking therapy is safe and effective in patients&#xD;
      with liver cancer. Moreover, TACE combined with immune checkpoint blocking therapy can&#xD;
      further enhance the anti-tumor immunity without overlapping toxicity. Subsequently, a large&#xD;
      number of clinical trials, such as nct03572582, nct03383458, nct03397654, were carried out&#xD;
      worldwide to evaluate the efficacy of local treatment combined with immune checkpoint&#xD;
      blocking therapy in patients with liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, current studies have shown that transformation therapy can benefit patients&#xD;
      with unresectable HCC, but there are still some problems, such as low success rate of&#xD;
      transformation, limited treatment options and so on. However, the new first-line drug for&#xD;
      liver cancer is synergistic with TACE, and immune checkpoint blocking therapy may enhance the&#xD;
      immune response induced by TACE. Therefore, this study is to compare the success rate of TACE&#xD;
      combined with lenvastinib and sindilimab in the treatment of advanced unresectable liver&#xD;
      cancer, and to explore the feasibility of the combined regimen in the treatment of liver&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial was monitored and audited by Ethics Committee on biological research, West&#xD;
      China Hospital of Sichuan University.We will arrange special personnel in charge to compare&#xD;
      the research data with the electronic medical records of West China hospital to ensure data&#xD;
      consistency.The indexes we included refer to World Health Organization drug dictionary,&#xD;
      MedDRA.The patients included in this clinical study were unresectable hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma patients. According to the existing guidelines, local treatment (such as TACE) and&#xD;
      / or systemic treatment (lenvastinib) were the preferred treatment. Other treatment options&#xD;
      include other targeted drugs (sorafenib), radiotherapy, chemotherapy and traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine.In addition to regular follow-up and recording of the above examination results,&#xD;
      patients undergoing transformation resection also need to be followed up and recorded in&#xD;
      detail the postoperative combined treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy,&#xD;
      traditional Chinese medicine treatment) and combined medication (anti hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      drugs, interferon, thymosin, other immunity enhancing drugs, Chinese patent medicine) and so&#xD;
      on The starting and ending date, dosage and frequency of medication were analyzed. For the&#xD;
      patients with failure of transformation resection, whether in the experimental group or the&#xD;
      control group, they were still followed up every 3-4 months until the end of the event or the&#xD;
      end of the trial. During each follow-up, the subjects, their family members or local doctors&#xD;
      were asked by telephone or on-site visit. The window was opened for 10 days to collect the&#xD;
      relapse / death (relapse / death date and cause of death) and the combined treatment&#xD;
      information after the study treatment. Each survival follow-up should be recorded in the&#xD;
      follow-up table.71 people are expected to be included in the experimental group and the&#xD;
      control group, and the lost follow-up rate is less than 20%。Whether it is related to the&#xD;
      research measures or not, any adverse medical event that is related to any medical measure in&#xD;
      the study, unexpected, and adverse medical events are adverse events (AE). All observed or&#xD;
