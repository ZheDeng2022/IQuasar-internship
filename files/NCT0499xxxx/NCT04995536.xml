      This phase I trial identifies the best dose and side effects of CpG-STAT3 siRNA CAS3/SS3&#xD;
      (CAS3/SS3) in combination with localized radiation therapy in treating patients with B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). CAS3/SS3 simultaneously targets two molecules, TLR9 receptor and STAT3. This&#xD;
      investigational drug combines a CpG oligonucleotide and an siRNA in one molecule that act&#xD;
      together to interfere with the ability of the cancer cells to grow. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Giving CAS3/SS3 with localized&#xD;
      radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CAS3/SS3 when given in combination with&#xD;
      local fixed-dose radiation therapy (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety and feasibility of intratumoral injections of CAS3/SS3 when combined&#xD;
      with local fixed-dose RT, by evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity,&#xD;
      attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Characterize the clinical activity (overall and per dose level) of CAS3/SS3 through the&#xD;
      assessment of disease response, and response duration. (Clinical) II. Characterize the&#xD;
      biologic activity (overall and per dose level) of CAS3/SS3 when combined with local&#xD;
      fixed-dose RT by assessing. (Biologic [Immunologic Correlative Studies]) IIa. Silencing of&#xD;
      the STAT3 gene and its key downstream genes. IIb. Local and systemic immune responses,&#xD;
      including: evidence/extent of immune cell intratumoral infiltration, immune cell activation&#xD;
      within the tumor and in the peripheral blood, and changes in proinflammatory mediators in&#xD;
      plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1 and 2 tumor-bearing lymph node, and receive&#xD;
      CAS3/SS3 intratumorally on days 2, 4, 16, and 18. Patients assigned to dose level 3 also&#xD;
      receive CAS3/SS3 intratumorally on days 9, 11, 23, and 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
