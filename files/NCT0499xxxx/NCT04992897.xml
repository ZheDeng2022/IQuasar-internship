      Data analysis concerning four sets of metrics: A. Per-treatment patterns of REN use as a&#xD;
      standalone treatment vs. in combination with medications. B. Per-user Intra-individual&#xD;
      consistency of efficacy across multiple treatments (consistency defined as a response to&#xD;
      treatment in at least 50% of treatments). C. Distribution of treatment intensity among users&#xD;
      (the electroceutical equivalent to treatment dose). D. Prevalence and severity of adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

      The REN device The REN device is a wearable device applied to the upper arm and stimulates C&#xD;
      and Aδ noxious fibers using a modulated, symmetrical, biphasic, square pulse with a pulse&#xD;
      width of 400 μs, modulated frequency of 100-120 Hz, and up to 40 mA output current which can&#xD;
      be adjusted by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection As part of the sign-up process to the Nerivio app, all patients accept the&#xD;
      terms of use which specify that providing personal information is done of their own free&#xD;
      will, and that their de-identified data may be used for research purposes. Users were not&#xD;
      obligated to provide personal information and could treat without providing any feedback. The&#xD;
      app includes a secured, personal migraine diary, which enables patients to record and track&#xD;
      their migraines and other headaches. At the beginning of each treatment, and again 2 hours&#xD;
      after the start of treatment, patients are prompted to record their symptoms, including pain&#xD;
      level (none, mild, moderate, severe), functional disability ('No limitation, 'Some&#xD;
      limitation', 'Moderate limitation, 'Severe limitation), and indication of which medications,&#xD;
      if any, were taken within that 2-hour time window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dataset Real-world data of REN treatments collected from patients across the United States&#xD;
      who used the REN device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Treatment' defined as a REN treatment of at least 20 minutes (the nominal duration is 45&#xD;
      minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Evaluable treatment' defined as a treatment in which pain levels were reported at baseline&#xD;
      and post 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for each of the different metrics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. REN-medication combinations: all evaluable treatments. B. Consistent efficacy: all users&#xD;
      that performed at least 2 evaluable treatments. In order to isolate the effect of REN&#xD;
      treatments, this dataset considered only treatments where REN was used as a standalone&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Intensity stability: all treatments. D. Safety: all reported adverse events (AEs) within&#xD;
      the time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respectively, outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. REN-Medication combinations (prevalence &amp; efficacy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication intake outcomes calculated based on the 2h post-treatment report and comprised of&#xD;
      the percentage of treatments in which no rescue medications were used, treatments in which&#xD;
      OTC medications were taken, treatments in which triptans were taken, treatments in which&#xD;
      other prescription medications were taken, and treatments in which medication intake status&#xD;
      was not reported. OTC included acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and combinations of the two, with or&#xD;
      without caffeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy outcomes calculated based on the baseline and post-2h reports and comprised of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) consistency of pain relief (decrease in headache from moderate or severe at baseline to&#xD;
      mild or no pain); (ii) consistency of pain-freedom (decrease in headache from mild, moderate,&#xD;
      or severe at baseline to no pain); (iii) Consistency of improvement in function (improvement&#xD;
      in at least one grade between baseline and 2 hours); and (iv) consistency of return to normal&#xD;
      function (no functional disability at 2 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Consistent efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consistency defined as a response of a patient to the treatment in at least 50% of their&#xD;
      treated attacks, and calculated for the four efficacy outcomes: (i) consistency of pain&#xD;
      relief (ii) consistency of pain-freedom (iii) consistency of improvement in function; and&#xD;
      (iv) consistency of return to normal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Treatment intensity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean intensity of the stimulation collected for all treatments that were 20 minutes or&#xD;
      longer, which were performed within the study's time window.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events that were reported within the study's period, the following information&#xD;
      provided: number of device-related AEs, percentage of the device-related AEs that were mild,&#xD;
      moderate, and severe, and percentage of AEs that were serious vs. not serious.&#xD;
