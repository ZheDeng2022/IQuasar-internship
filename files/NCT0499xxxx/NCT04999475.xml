  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) among sonographers/radiographers are prevalent&#xD;
      in the healthcare industry. This study will evaluate the use of a robotic assisted&#xD;
      ultrasonography system (ROBUST) against the conventional abdominal ultrasound scanning&#xD;
      procedure. The ROBUST will be developed to provide 6 degrees of freedom to allow&#xD;
      radiographers to perform abdominal scanning without having to reach over patients. 6&#xD;
      sonographers with at least 5 years of experience will be recruited from SGH and SKH, to&#xD;
      perform abdominal ultrasound scans on 50 patients. Patients will be screened by the&#xD;
      radiographers in the study team for their suitability in the participation during their&#xD;
      scheduled appointments and will be invited to undergo scanning with the ROBUST upon&#xD;
      agreement. Outcome measures will include ultrasound image quality, sonographer feedback and&#xD;
      comfort level as well as satisfaction feedback from patients. A panel of 4 reviewers,&#xD;
      consisting of 2 radiologists and 2 senior radiographers will be invited to grade the images,&#xD;
      using a 3-point Likert scale to compare the images taken with ROBUST against the images taken&#xD;
      conventionally prior to using the ROBUST. The duration of each session will be recorded. The&#xD;
      comfort level reported by sonographers will be assessed using the SGH Comfort Level Survey.&#xD;
      In addition, the comfort level of participating patients will also be assessed using a&#xD;
      satisfaction questionnaire. The investigators hypothesize that there is no difference in&#xD;
      imaging quality and comfort levels of sonographers and patients between a conventional&#xD;
      ultrasound scan and scanning with the ROBUST. The investigators also hypothesize that there&#xD;
      would be a reduction in the risk of WRMSD among sonographers with reduction in ergonomic risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      6 participating sonographers will be recruited from SGH and SKH to perform abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound scanning. 50 patients of average body habitus with BMI &lt;30, abdominal&#xD;
      circumference &lt;102cm, of whom are able to ambulate independently will be screened for&#xD;
      suitability during their scheduled appointments and recruited. These patients from SGH and&#xD;
      SKH, will be referred by their radiographers for the study and will be screened by the Study&#xD;
      Team Radiographers to obtain consent. Suitable patients for the study are determined after&#xD;
      the scheduled abdominal scans are performed at the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo scanning with participating sonographers using the ROBUST after&#xD;
      completion of their scheduled conventional scans. The same ultrasound scanner and probe type&#xD;
      will be used on all participating patients by all sonographers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of both scans, participating sonographers will be required to complete a survey on&#xD;
      comfort level. At the end of both scans, patients will be required to complete a survey on&#xD;
      satisfaction level. The quality of the images from both scans will be graded by 4 readers: 2&#xD;
      consultant radiologists and 2 senior radiographers. A photometer will be used to ensure all&#xD;
      graders interpret the images directly from a designated monitor under consistent lighting&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first stage, ROBUST intends to scale up to expand across SingHealth institutions via a&#xD;
      commercial partner. Together with the team, the company will engage key opinion leaders, key&#xD;
      stakeholders and key users of respective healthcare institutions in Singapore. The team will&#xD;
      work closely with the identified deployment partners to develop customised solutions to suit&#xD;
      specific requirements based on disease and type of ultrasound services provided by the&#xD;
      healthcare institutions. If successful, the ROBUST can be deployed in all ultrasound&#xD;
      examination rooms to benefit larger population of ultrasound radiographers in managing&#xD;
      manpower limitation and reducing work-related musculoskeletal risks. ROBUST is designed to be&#xD;
      universal and can integrate with existing ultrasound probe, eliminating the need for a new&#xD;
      capital purchase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, ROBUST will further be deployed to other national healthcare cluster&#xD;
      within Singapore. To achieve stage 1 and stage 2 of deployment plan, the ROBUST project team&#xD;
      will seek endorsement from key stakeholders of healthcare clusters, Group CEOs and Group COOs&#xD;
      from NHG and NUHS at the national level to encourage technology adoption by the respective&#xD;
      healthcare clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following success of stage 1 and stage 2, ROBUST will be marketed to key regions in Asia and&#xD;
      Pacific countries especially ageing population nations like Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea,&#xD;
      Australia and New Zealand through strategic distribution partners. In the third stage, based&#xD;
      on a universal platform, ROBUST can be further expanded into the surgical domain to enable&#xD;
      assistive solution to surgeons operating in long duration. Similarly, ROBUST can help to&#xD;
      mitigate risk of musculoskeletal disorders among surgeons and doctors.&#xD;
