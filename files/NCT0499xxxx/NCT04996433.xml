  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of&#xD;
      Psychotherapy (CBASP) conducted over 16 weeks (acute and continuation treatment) with&#xD;
      Behavioral Activation (BA; same dose and duration) in persistently depressed&#xD;
      treatment-resistant inpatients regarding efficacy, moderators and mediators of change.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About half of all psychiatric inpatients with depression suffer from persistent depressive&#xD;
      disorder (PDD). Given their high degree of treatment-resistance (TR), comorbidity,&#xD;
      suicidality, and hospitalization rates, this patient group appears to be particularly&#xD;
      difficult to treat and, from a health economic perspective, constitutes a major challenge.&#xD;
      The Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) is the only psychotherapy&#xD;
      specifically tailored for PDD developed. Originally developed as an outpatient treatment by&#xD;
      James P. McCullough, CBASP has been modified for the severely ill PDD patients with TR as a&#xD;
      multimodal inpatient concept. Pilot studies indicate very good feasibility and promising&#xD;
      outcome. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial is now mandatory for testing the&#xD;
      superiority of the inpatient CBASP program vs. the evidence-based Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT), the 'gold standard' in depression treatment. Behavioral Activation (BA) was&#xD;
      chosen as the control intervention because BA, as a specific variant of CBT, is at least as&#xD;
      effective as standard CBT in severely depressed patients while being easier to train and&#xD;
      implement in inpatient settings. Both therapies will be applied as a treatment-phase program&#xD;
      (5-week inpatient and dayclinic acute treatment followed by 6-week outpatient continuation&#xD;
      group-treatment) in combination with standardized and guideline-based pharmacotherapy. The&#xD;
      proposed prospective, multi-center, randomized study with 396 PDD patients with TR will&#xD;
      therefore address the primary research question: Is the CBASP program more effective than the&#xD;
      BA program in this patient group? The primary hypothesis is that after 16 weeks of treatment,&#xD;
      CBASP will show a significant superiority over BA in reducing depressive symptoms. In&#xD;
      addition, the important psychotherapy research question: what works for whom and why? will be&#xD;
      addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderator analyses will examine whether childhood maltreatment and methylation of exon IV of&#xD;
      the BDNF gene have an impact on the differential efficacy of the treatments. Regarding&#xD;
      mediator analyses, it will be examined whether symptom improvements can be explained by an&#xD;
      amelioration of interpersonal problems in CBASP and an increase of activity levels in BA. A&#xD;
      follow-up survey 48 weeks after the end of the interventions will provide valuable results&#xD;
      regarding the long-term outcome of the treatments. Finally, the health economic potential of&#xD;
      the interventions will be investigated through cost-benefit analyses in order to provide&#xD;
      important information on the cost-effectiveness of implementation in routine care for health&#xD;
      policy. Thus, the results of this study will have the potential to relieve the burden of this&#xD;
      very serious and cost-intensive disorder while improving human health. In addition, moderator&#xD;
      and mediator analyses may guide personalized treatment and enable therapists to more&#xD;
      specifically address psychotherapeutic needs of individual PDD patients in the future.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the nature of interventions, blinding of patients/therapists concerning the treatment program is impossible, but all assessments as well as data analysis will be blinded to treatment allocation. Notably, patients are blinded to the study hypothesis by the Informed Consent process, as patients are told in the patient information and educational discussions about the study that they will in any case receive one of two different scientifically based psychotherapy programs, although it is unclear which of the two programs is more effective. Similarly, the members of the treatment teams of each study ward are not informed about the study hypothesis; however, they are informed that it has not yet been scientifically clarified which therapy is more effective.</masking_description>

    <measure>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-24), 24-item version</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in HDRS-24 item score after 16 weeks will be the primary endpoint. The HRSD-24 is a semi-structured interview which is used to measure the severity of all symptom domains of depression as described by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) over a period of the last 7 days. It shows good psychometric properties. The HRSD-24 will be conducted by blind study raters at every time point. Raters evaluate symptom severity on a scale from 0 to 2 or 0 - 3 or 0 - 4 for each item, with higher number indicating higher symptom severity. The total score ranges from 0 to 75 with higher values indicating higher depression severity.</description>

    <description>This self-report is designed to measure weekly changes in avoidance and activation during treatment with Behavioral Activation for depression. The BADS consists of 25 questions on four subscales, each rated on a seven point scale ranging from 0 to 6. The subscales are activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment, and social impairment. A higher total score represents a higher level of activation and therefore a better outcome, while a high score in the subscale social impairment indicates a higher level of impairment and therefore a worse outcome. Scores range from 0 to 150.</description>

    <ipd_description>In accordance with the Open Science specifications of the German Psychological Association (DGPS), anonymized data will be made available to the public via the Open Data portal of the Open Science Foundation (www.osf.io). The data will be stored when data collection is completed, but not before 01.01.2028. This step allows third parties to reproduce the analyses reported in scientific publications and to perform ad hoc analyses. The data is permanently stored on servers located in Germany. As soon as they are uploaded and published, these anonymized data cannot be deleted and are therefore also excluded from the deletion of the data in case of revocation of the study participation.</ipd_description>
