      4,972 patients who underwent surgery for primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015&#xD;
      at Seoul National University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA19-9 is a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker for CRC when used adjunctively with CEA&#xD;
      and can be a supplementary marker with CEA to improve sensitivity, especially with elevated&#xD;
      preoperative CA19-9.&#xD;

      Introduction: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a main prognostic marker and can detect&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence, but it has low sensitivity. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9&#xD;
      (CA19-9) can be used as a supplemental tumour marker along with CEA. This study investigated&#xD;
      the utility of preoperative and follow-up serum CA19-9 assessment for CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: We retrospectively assessed 4,972 patients who underwent surgery for&#xD;
      primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015 at Seoul National University Hospital.&#xD;
      Data on demographics, preoperative and follow-up CEA and CA19-9 levels, recurrence, and&#xD;
      survival were obtained and analysed with respect to tumour marker levels to ascertain their&#xD;
      prognostic and diagnostic values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The 5-year relapse-free survival rates were 72.2±0.8%, 52.5±2.2%, 55.5±3.2%, and&#xD;
      32.1±2.3% in the normal CEA and CA19-9, high CEA, high CA19-9, and high CEA and high CA19-9&#xD;
      groups, respectively (all p&lt;0.001). Patients whose elevated CEA or CA19-9 reduced to normal&#xD;
      had better survival outcomes than those with postoperatively elevated levels. Elevated&#xD;
      follow-up CA19-9 and CEA levels were related to higher incidences of distant metastasis&#xD;
      (CA19-9: 14.0% vs. 23.1%, p=0.004, CEA: 12.6% vs. 30.1%, p&lt;0.001) but not with local&#xD;
      recurrence. Combined follow-up CEA and CA19-9 increased the sensitivity for recurrence to&#xD;
      31.4%, with a 5% difference compared with CEA alone. In the subgroup with high preoperative&#xD;
      CA19-9 levels, sensitivity increased by 18.2% overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: CA19-9 is a valuable prognostic and diagnostic marker for CRC when used&#xD;
      adjunctively with CEA and can be a supplementary marker with CEA to improve sensitivity,&#xD;
      especially with elevated preoperative CA19-9.&#xD;

        This single-centre retrospective study was based on the analysis of information from a&#xD;
        prospectively maintained database of CRC in Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH CRC&#xD;
        DB). Data were extracted from the SNUH CRC DB for patients who underwent surgery for&#xD;
        primary CRC between January 2004 and December 2015 at our institution. The patients with&#xD;
        missing data for preoperative and follow-up tumour markers were excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
        This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University&#xD;
        Hospital (SNUH IRB; IRB no. 2007-014-1138). The approving authority waived the requirement&#xD;
        for written informed consent owing to the retrospective study design.&#xD;
