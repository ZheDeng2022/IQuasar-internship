  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a web-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention in adolescents with acute or remitted major depressive disorder. We will examine&#xD;
      whether this intervention improves positive affect, reduces stress and alleviates negative&#xD;
      affect and depressive symptoms in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. We will also investigate&#xD;
      the rates of adherence among the adolescents who use this web-based intervention and the&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention with adolescents.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with major depressive disorder often have little knowledge about depression, and do not&#xD;
      receive an appropriate treatment. Besides little knowledge, concerns about social stigma,&#xD;
      confidentiality and limited access to mental health services are some of the main barriers to&#xD;
      seek help. Therefore, highly acceptable and easily accessible information and services as a&#xD;
      complementary strategy to mental health treatment, such as knowledge about depression and&#xD;
      self-help strategies, are urgently needed for young people seeking help for depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed a website, which provides evidence-based information about depression (e.g.,&#xD;
      identification, etiology, treatment, and prevention of depression) and will be launched in&#xD;
      autumn 2021. Furthermore, the website provides information about self-help strategies (e.g.,&#xD;
      reducing stress, doing exercise, undertaking positive activities), which are meant to serve&#xD;
      as an addition to professional treatments of depression or to promote mental health in&#xD;
      adolescents. Target groups of the website are adolescents aged 12 to 18 years seeking help&#xD;
      for depression, as well as healthy adolescents seeking information about mental health&#xD;
      promotion or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the acceptability of the website and the engagement of young people, the website&#xD;
      will integrate continuously updating content consisting of short exercises based on&#xD;
      principles of positive psychology. This web-based self-help intervention is thought to&#xD;
      provide a mode of delivery (the combination: &quot;online&quot; &amp; &quot;positive psychology&quot;), which is&#xD;
      acceptable and engaging to youth. In addition, the provided self-help exercises might be a&#xD;
      complementary approach to professional treatments of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the website targets two different groups, we will evaluate the web-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention accordingly:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target group 1: Adolescents with a major depressive disorder (acute or remitted) Target group&#xD;
      2: Healthy Adolescents (no mental health condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will focus on target group 1. A study focusing on target group 2 can be&#xD;
      found in a separately registered clinical trial on clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      web-based self-help intervention to improve positive affect, reduce stress and alleviate&#xD;
      negative affect and depressive symptoms in adolescents with acute or remitted depressive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating young people will be randomized to either the web-based intervention group or&#xD;
      the web-based control group (i.e. sham intervention / comparator). All participants will be&#xD;
      evaluated at pre- and post-intervention, and at a two-week follow-up.&#xD;

Before starting the intervention, the participants are told that they will receive a daily email with an instruction for a short exercise over the period of two weeks. The participants are instructed to complete the exercises every day and are told that they will be asked to evaluate these exercises at the next appointment (post-test, week 2).</description>
