    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if a video that utilizes a peer to teach self administration of&#xD;
      subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone is both effective and well accepted by adolescent&#xD;
      patients who are already receiving ongoing treatment with depot medroxyprogesterone by a&#xD;
      medical provider via an inter muscular injection. Self administration can be done at home and&#xD;
      therefore offers an alternative to traveling to a medical office.&#xD;

      Means of providing health education are rapidly evolving. Telemedicine has become an&#xD;
      important modality to provide healthcare and improve access, and will likely be increasingly&#xD;
      utilized beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine can effectively provide care and&#xD;
      counseling to all age groups, including adolescents. Studies have demonstrated that over 80&#xD;
      percent of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 spend one to four hours a day online;&#xD;
      searches for health-related information are common. Nevertheless, adolescents may face&#xD;
      obstacles when previously familiar aspects of their medical care are abruptly moved online,&#xD;
      particularly when discussing contraception. Although traditionally administered in the&#xD;
      clinical space, injectable contraception has been shown to be attractive, effective, and&#xD;
      well-tolerated by adolescents when subcutaneously self-administered, and can lead to improved&#xD;
      continuation rates. The investigators have found that remotely teaching a patient how to&#xD;
      self-administer a subcutaneous injection is challenging. The provider may be in a home&#xD;
      office, and may not have access to the actual medication or the supplies to demonstrate&#xD;
      technique. The patient may struggle to understand verbal instruction without a visual&#xD;
      demonstration, resulting in ineffective medication administration. Instructional videos&#xD;
      currently available online are not specific to adolescents who use self-administered&#xD;
      injectable contraception. Peer education can be relatable and effective for adolescent&#xD;
      patients. The investigators propose that self-administration of subcutaneous injectable&#xD;
      contraception may be taught using a peer-to-peer video as a synchronous or asynchronous&#xD;
      adjunct to consultation with the healthcare professional. Adolescents may be instructed to&#xD;
      watch the video demonstration to help inform them about proper technique and ensure safe&#xD;
      administration of their medication while at home. This study aims to validate an existing&#xD;
      video as an effective teaching tool by assessing metrics such as clarity of the instructions,&#xD;
      rate of error, and satisfaction with the video teaching method to the investigators' target&#xD;
      population. The video was filmed in accordance with Tufts Medical Center Department of&#xD;
      Marketing and Communications policies and the adolescent participant in the video was&#xD;
      appropriately consented by a parent/guardian. The video was presented as an oral abstract at&#xD;
      the North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Annual Meeting in March&#xD;
      2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinic schedules for the medical providers on the research team will be reviewed in&#xD;
           advance and any patient that is under the age of 20 and receiving&#xD;
           depot-medroxyprogesterone will be contacted by telephone in advance to offer&#xD;
           participation in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The telephone call will follow the attached script. Two attempts will be made to call&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If subject is interested in participating, a prescription for the subcutaneous version&#xD;
           of depot-medroxyprogesterone will be sent to their pharmacy to be picked up by the&#xD;
           subject prior to the office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects under 18 will be instructed that they must be accompanied by a parent or&#xD;
           guardian. At the office visit, written consent/assent will be obtained. 5. Subject will&#xD;
           be shown the instructional video, which is approximately 3 minutes long. Subject may&#xD;
           view as many times as subject chooses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Once ready, the healthcare provider from the research team will observe, without giving&#xD;
      verbal instruction, the subject self administer a subcutaneous depot-medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. If at any point the provider feels that the subject is not performing the injection safely&#xD;
      or correctly the healthcare provider will intervene to ensure that the medication is given&#xD;
      correctly, and this will be recorded within the REDCap survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. After the injection is given, the subject will fill out the REDCap survey, and the study&#xD;
      team member administering injection will input observational data into REDCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Subject will be asked to repeat another questionnaire in REDCap at the time of the next&#xD;
      injection which will be scheduled for 12 weeks later. The next visit is as per standard of&#xD;
      care scheduling (this medication is routinely administered at approximately 12-week&#xD;
      intervals). If the subject comes into the same office for the injection, the survey will be&#xD;
      filled out in person. If the subject does not come into the same office, a link to the&#xD;
      follow-up REDCap survey will be emailed to the subject with instructions on how to access the&#xD;
      survey. Email addresses will be confirmed at the time of the first visit, as is routine for&#xD;
      medical care.&#xD;
