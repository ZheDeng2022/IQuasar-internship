  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether, during a waiting period in an&#xD;
      emergency department, the patient's participation in a modern art therapy session decreases&#xD;
      the patient's level of anxiety and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary objective, this study aims to explore whether participation in a modern art&#xD;
      therapy session is perceived positively by the patient. This objective will be assessed by&#xD;
      both patient self-report and art therapist heteroreport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, the investigators will therefore seek to demonstrate the potential positive&#xD;
      impact of modern art therapy conducted during times of waiting for examination or results.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After reviewing the patients' medical records in the emergency department, and verifying the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria with the caregivers in charge of the case, the investigators&#xD;
      will introduce themselves to the patients and offer them to participate in the study. The&#xD;
      investigators will explain to the patients that their emergency department experience&#xD;
      involves waiting time and that they are eligible for this study aimed at improving the&#xD;
      well-being of emergency department patients during waiting time. Patients will be informed&#xD;
      that the study aims to investigate the distracting effect of a modern art therapy session. If&#xD;
      the patients ask about the modalities of the session, the investigators will answer that it&#xD;
      will consist of an artistic production in accordance with their tastes and abilities, defined&#xD;
      with the art therapist or a discussion with the research nurse about art therapy and its&#xD;
      place in an emergency department and that they will be randomly assigned to one of the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage, only oral consent will be obtained. After verifying that all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria are met, that none of the exclusion criteria are applicable, and obtaining oral&#xD;
      consent, each patient will be randomized 1:1 between the two study arms using the&#xD;
      randomization module in the RedCapÂ® software. The investigator in charge of data collection&#xD;
      will collect some additional data in a standardized way by following the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The art therapist will then be able to intervene with the patient if the latter is part of&#xD;
      the group participating in an art therapy session. A five- to ten-minute interview with the&#xD;
      patient will allow the art therapist to get to know the patient and to learn more about his&#xD;
      or her tastes and any contraindications the patient may have to certain techniques. This&#xD;
      interview will begin with a discussion of the patient's general condition, both physical&#xD;
      (pain, injury) and mental (mood), with the goal of assessing preserved and mobilizable&#xD;
      abilities as well as affected and non-mobilizable mechanisms. The patient's tastes (artistic&#xD;
      or other) will also be briefly questioned. Since the art-therapeutic intervention that will&#xD;
      be proposed seeks to generate pleasant feelings, it will be important to rely on the&#xD;
      patient's tastes. It is the patient's tastes and choices that will guide the decision of the&#xD;
      dominant artistic elements, in order to maximize the pleasure taken in the activity and the&#xD;
      distracting effect of the proposal. At the end of the interview, modern art therapy will be&#xD;
      presented to the patient and several artistic activities will be proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Origami: paper folding activity requiring good fine motor skills, possible if the&#xD;
           patient can fully use his/her hands. Requires a flat surface to put the paper on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drawing: with dry techniques that will be disinfected after each use. It could be a&#xD;
           drawing of invention, a comic strip to complete, an extension of a photo by a drawing...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Writing: with markers or pens to allow for quick drying and avoid smearing. Creative&#xD;
           writing games working on the imagination can be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All paper elements intended to be contemplated (models or works of art) will be wrapped in&#xD;
      plastic to allow disinfection between each use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the activity has been chosen, the patient will have 15 to 20 minutes to carry it out,&#xD;
      accompanied by the art therapist according to his/her needs (explanations, gestural and&#xD;
      technical support, partial or total realization by the art therapist under the patient's&#xD;
      orders...). During the activity, verbal exchanges will continue. After the 15 to 20 minutes&#xD;
      of the session, 5 minutes will be devoted to the patient's self-evaluation of the past&#xD;
      moment, of his level of anxiety, of the intensity of his pain and of his feelings in relation&#xD;
      to his passage in the Emergency Department and the art therapy session. The question will&#xD;
      then be raised as to what will happen to the production, which will either be discarded or&#xD;
      given to the patient to take with him/her.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The materials used for this study are common plastic arts materials (pencils, markers, paper)&#xD;
      that are non-toxic and non-dirty. Reproductions of artworks in the form of postcards may also&#xD;
      be shown to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group without art therapy, the patient will be left in the usual waiting&#xD;
      conditions for 20 to 30 minutes. After this waiting time, the patient will be asked to&#xD;
      self-assess his or her level of anxiety, pain intensity and feelings about his or her visit&#xD;
      to the emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once all the data has been collected, a complete information sheet and a consent form will be&#xD;
      given to the patient. Additional explanations can be given upon request. Patients will have a&#xD;
      minimum of 15 minutes to sign the consent form.&#xD;
