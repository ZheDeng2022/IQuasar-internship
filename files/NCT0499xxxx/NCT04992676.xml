  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine how frequently sleep disorders such as sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing and insomnia occur in patients with coronary artery disease enrolled in&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation. By reviewing results of a variety of tests, we also hope to learn&#xD;
      more about the cardiovascular effects on people who may have these conditions.&#xD;

      Patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Rochester CR and meeting eligibility criteria (see&#xD;
      Subjects section below) will be recruited and consented. Prior to beginning CR, enrolled&#xD;
      patients will undergo baseline sleep and CV assessment at the Clinical Research and Trials&#xD;
      Unit (CRTU). Home-based sleep monitoring will take place. Patients will also complete&#xD;
      additional cardiometabolic and behavioral evaluation as part of the standard CR clinical&#xD;
      care. Following completion of the 12-week CR program, a post-CR assessment may be conducted,&#xD;
      including the same set of tests/procedures. All patients will be followed up for at least&#xD;
      6-months following enrollment to monitor cardiac recurrence, hospitalization and death.&#xD;

    <description>A water resistant accelerometer with light sensor and event marker will be worn on the nondominant wrist for approximately 7 days. Activity counts from the device will be analyzed by proprietary software algorithms for determination of the following: sleep onset, sleep offset, total sleep time, total wake time, and sleep efficiency.16 Daytime sleep periods will be also scored to determine frequency and duration of naps. Daily data will be averaged across the 7-day period, as well as separately for weekdays and weekend, to compute measures of habitual sleep patterns.</description>
