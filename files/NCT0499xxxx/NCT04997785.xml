    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter single-blinded randomized comparative trial. Adult patients older&#xD;
      than 20 years of age presenting with acute hip fracture in emergency department between&#xD;
      January 1st, 2021 and December 31st, 2021 will be enrolled. Included patients will receive&#xD;
      analgesia with either pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block or parenteral opioids. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure was pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0 to 10). Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were rescue opioids use, complications, length of hospital stay, and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;

      Study design and setting This is multicenter, randomized controlled comparative trial&#xD;
      conducted at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital and Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital, which are academic,&#xD;
      level 1 trauma centers in Taiwan. The investigators plan to conduct the study from January&#xD;
      1st to May 8th, 2022. It will be paused temporarily if local coronavirus disease 2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19) virus pandemic restrictions. The trial is registering on ClinicalTrials.gov&#xD;
      number. The study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board. The study&#xD;
      conforms to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and the CONSORT&#xD;
      extension for trials reporting patient- related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants Patients aged &gt;20 years presenting to the emergency department (ED)&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of traumatic hip fracture from J January 1st to December 31th, 2021 will be&#xD;
      included. Tthe investigators exclude patients who are aged &lt;20 years, have coagulopathy,&#xD;
      injection site infection, allergy to opioids or local anesthetics, initial pulse oximetry&#xD;
      measures of oxygen saturation &lt;92%, initial systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg, chronic opioid&#xD;
      use, non-communicative, experiences major trauma, fractures happened &gt; 24 hours, and request&#xD;
      conservative(non-operative) treatments. The investigators also exclude patients if the nerve&#xD;
      block (NB) providers are unavailable. Written informed consent is acquired from all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization procedures and rationale All the included patients are randomized to either&#xD;
      PENG block or intravenous morphine. Because PENG block is a novel technique for regional hip&#xD;
      analgesia, well-trained emergency physicians are not available every day. Randomizing&#xD;
      patients at the point of ED visit was considered impractical. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      randomize each visit week before the study begins, and well-trained PENG block providers will&#xD;
      be arranged on duty in the weeks randomized for PENG block. The unit of randomization will be&#xD;
      the weeks, using random number generation in Microsoft Excel by a statistician who is not&#xD;
      involved in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention PENG blocks is performed by Emergency Medicine board-certified emergency&#xD;
      physicians (EPs) with standard training program. PENG block is performed using a spinal&#xD;
      needle (BD® 20G × 90 mm) at the level of of anterior superior iliac spine, parallel to the&#xD;
      inguinal crease, with real-time ultrasound guidance, according to the steps published by&#xD;
      Girón-Arango et al in 2018. The investigators used 20 ml of 1% lidocaine for nerve block&#xD;
      because this drug has a short onset time, which is adequate to relieve pain before surgical&#xD;
      intervention. Regimens of regional anesthesia with a longer duration of action are not&#xD;
      preferred in our department because delayed onset of regional anesthesia particularly impedes&#xD;
      orthopedic assessment in EDs. Dosage of intravenous morphine was determined according to 0.1&#xD;
      mg per kg; EPs were instructed to aim to reduce the pain by 50% or per patient request. They&#xD;
      were encouraged to wait for at least 15 minutes after the study procedure before&#xD;
      administering additional analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Primary outcome was postdose NRS pain score. NRS score was assessed as part&#xD;
      of standard care at various timepoints, including at baseline, immediately after the&#xD;
      analgesic treatment, at 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes postdose time points, every 2 h&#xD;
      thereafter until discharge from the ED, and at the time of discharge from the ED and arrival&#xD;
      at the orthopedic ward before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes were postdose quadriceps strength, rescue opiate use, complications,&#xD;
      length of hospital stay, and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps strength was assessed using the knee extension test and Oxford muscle strength&#xD;
      scale. Rescue opioid consumption was measured in morphine milligram equivalents (MME)&#xD;
      administered over all ED visits during the study timeframe.Any complications or side effects&#xD;
      of nerve blocks, including local infection, intravascular injection of local anesthetics and&#xD;
      immediate systemic toxicity, will be recorded. In opioid group, any side effects of opioids&#xD;
      such as drowsiness, desaturation, nausea and vomiting, delirium, or respiratory distress,&#xD;
      will be recorded. Patient-reported outcome defined as patient satisfaction (120 minutes after&#xD;
      initial analgesics, patients were asked whether they would choose the same anesthetic&#xD;
      handling; &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation and statistical analyses Sample size could not be calculated, as&#xD;
      there is no prior trial on comparison of PENG block and intravenous morphine in patient with&#xD;
      hip fractures. This trial will be a pilot trial. Hence, the investigators intend to recruit&#xD;
      200 participants in total using a 1:1 allocation ratio, with 100 participants randomised into&#xD;
      each arm. Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables, and&#xD;
      Student's t-test was used for continuous variable. Logistic regression was used to analyze&#xD;
      data with dichotomous outcomes; p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
