  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common endocrine disorder that affects between 7% and 14% of&#xD;
      women of childbearing age, leading to impaired fertility, clinical and biological&#xD;
      hyperandrogenism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term complications such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease and&#xD;
      hormone-dependent cancers make it a major public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiopathology of this syndrome is complicated and still poorly understood, probably&#xD;
      multifactorial origin, resulting from the interaction between many factors (genetics,&#xD;
      lifestyle, environment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The environment has also an important role in the development of polycystic ovary syndrome :&#xD;
      diet, exposure to pollutants and endocrine disruptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many sources of exposure to environmental toxins and it is essential to better&#xD;
      understand their impact on our health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to assess the association between exposure to endocrine disruptors and&#xD;
      development of polycystic ovary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population involved in the study includes patients aged 18 to 50 years, premenopausal,&#xD;
      consulting in the gynecology department of the university hospital of Reims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;cases&quot; patients will be patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. The &quot;controls&quot; patients&#xD;
      will be patients without polycystic ovary syndrome. Statistical analysis will determine&#xD;
      whether &quot;cases&quot; are more exposed to endocrine disruptors than &quot;controls&quot;.&#xD;

      The &quot;cases&quot; patients will be patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. The &quot;controls&quot; patients&#xD;

      wether &quot;cases&quot; are more exposed to endocrine disruptors than &quot;controls&quot;. &quot;Cases&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;controls&quot; will be matched on age (+/- 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis consists of description of data (mean and standard deviation, number&#xD;
      and percentage) and comparison of exposure to toxicants and endocrine disruptors according to&#xD;
      the &quot;cases&quot; and &quot;controls&quot; group by univariate analysis (tests of Student, Wilcoxon, Chi 2 or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact) then multivariate (logistic regression).&#xD;
