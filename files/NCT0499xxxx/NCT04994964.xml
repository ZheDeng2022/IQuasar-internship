  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost half of newborns undergoing surgery to repair narrowing or interruption of the aortic&#xD;
      arch will suffer injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This causes a weak voice and can&#xD;
      lead to problems with feeding including aspiration of milk feed after the surgery. As these&#xD;
      children can have a vulnerable circulation, aspiration events can reduce survival and poor&#xD;
      weight gain has been shown to correlate with poorer outcomes after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other types of surgery in the neck, monitors can be used to alert the surgeon to when&#xD;
      injury is occurring to the recurrent nerve. To date, this type of monitoring has not been&#xD;
      possible in newborns. This study aims to investigate if this type of monitoring is feasible&#xD;
      in newborns undergoing aortic arch repair, to prevent recurrent nerve injury.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients with parents/ carers able to give informed consent to participation in&#xD;
             the trial will be included. â€¢ Male and female patients will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only Neonates (babies less than 28 days of age) will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients undergoing repair of the aortic arch via median sternotomy will be&#xD;
             included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with severe abnormalities of the airway, such that they are unlikely to be&#xD;
             extubated within 7 days of the aortic arch repair surgery will be excluded from&#xD;
             participation, as assessment of vocal cord function will be difficult/ impossible in&#xD;
             such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with parents/ carers who are unable to give informed consent to participation&#xD;
             in the trial will be excluded from participation.&#xD;
