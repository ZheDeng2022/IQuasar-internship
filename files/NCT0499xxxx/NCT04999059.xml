  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, long-term follow-up study to assess the long-term safety and&#xD;
      durability of AVR-RD-01 treatment in participants who received a single dose administration&#xD;
      of lentiviral gene therapy in Study AVRO-RD-01-201 (treatment study). No investigational&#xD;
      product will be administered in this study. Participants will continue periodic safety and&#xD;
      efficacy assessments in this long-term follow-up study for approximately 14 years.&#xD;

      Participants enrolled in the AVRO-RD-01-201 study will be offered participation in the&#xD;
      AVRO-RD-01-LTF01 study. The Baseline visit for the AVRO-RD-01-LTF01 study will coincide with&#xD;
      the final Week 48 visit in the AVRO-RD-01-201 study. Participants confirmed eligible for the&#xD;
      AVRO-RD-01-LTF01 study will be asked to return for study visits at approximately 6 month&#xD;
      intervals for the first 4 years and annually thereafter for 10 years (for a total of 14&#xD;
      years) during which time continued safety, engraftment, and efficacy of AVR-RD-01 treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed.&#xD;
