  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nipocalimab versus&#xD;
      placebo in participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RA is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that occurs in&#xD;
      approximately 1 percent (%) of the population. Nipocalimab (also referred to as JNJ-80202135&#xD;
      and M281) is a fully human aglycosylated immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 monoclonal antibody designed&#xD;
      to selectively bind, saturate, and block the IgG binding site on the endogenous neonatal&#xD;
      fragment crystallizable (Fc) receptor (FcRn). Nipocalimab has a unique mechanism of action&#xD;
      whereby it blocks the IgG binding site on endogenous FcRn and is expected to decrease&#xD;
      pathogenic IgG antibody concentrations. A significant involvement of pathogenic IgG&#xD;
      antibodies has been demonstrated in autoimmune diseases including RA. The primary hypothesis&#xD;
      is that treatment with nipocalimab intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (q2w) is superior to&#xD;
      placebo in participants with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as assessed&#xD;
      by the mean change from baseline in the disease activity index score 28 using C-reactive&#xD;
      Protein (DAS28-CRP) at Week 12. The study consists of a Screening Period (less than or equal&#xD;
      to [&lt;=] 6 Weeks), Double-blind Treatment Period (12 Weeks), and a Safety Follow-up Period (6&#xD;
      Weeks). Key safety assessments will include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs), adverse events of special interests (AESIs), clinical laboratory safety tests&#xD;
      (hematology, chemistry, and lipid profile), vital signs, and physical examination. The total&#xD;
      duration of the study is up to 24 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>DAS28-CRP is a composite index used to assess rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity, calculated based on the tender joint count (out of 28 evaluated joints), swollen joint count (out of 28 evaluated joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and CRP. Change from baseline in DAS28-CRP measures the change in disease activity, where a negative change indicates an improvement, and a positive change indicates a worsening.</description>
