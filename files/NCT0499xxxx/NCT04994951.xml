  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a non-contagious erythematous scaly skin disease characterized by epidermal&#xD;
      proliferation and inflammation. The etiology is related to heredity, infection, allergies,&#xD;
      metabolic disorders and autoimmunity. The incidence of psoriasis in the survey was about 1.2‰&#xD;
      in 1984 in China, and 2.6% in the United States. In recent years, the incidence of psoriasis&#xD;
      has been on the increase trend, mostly in the young to middle age adults, and it can last a&#xD;
      lifetime. The characteristic of the disease is that it usually spreads all over the body, or&#xD;
      gradually aggravates, or is fixed and difficult to subside,or the disease course is long,&#xD;
      lingering and difficult to heal, and it brings great harm to the patient's body and mind. At&#xD;
      present, there is no effective treatment for psoriasis. Although western medicine has good&#xD;
      short-term curative effects, prolonged use is not advocated because of adverse side effects&#xD;
      and poor long-term effects. Besides, it is easy to relapse and aggravate after stopping the&#xD;
      medicine. Psoriasis belongs to the category of &quot;baibi&quot; in Chinese medicine. Doctors of the&#xD;
      past dynasties mostly treated it from blood heat, blood stasis, and blood deficiency&#xD;
      syndrome. Researcher Zhu Renkang believes that &quot;blood with heat&quot; is the main cause of&#xD;
      psoriasis and famous TCM dermatologists such as Zhang Zhili, Gu Bohua, Xu Yihou and others&#xD;
      all regard &quot;blood-heat syndrome&quot; as the basic pathogenesis of psoriasis. We used Qingre&#xD;
      Liangxue Recipe Granules to observe the treatment of 31 patients with blood-heat type&#xD;
      psoriasis vulgaris, and found that the PASI index of the patients after treatment was&#xD;
      significantly lower than before treatment (P &lt;0.01), and the serum VEGF level was&#xD;
      significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01), the correlation analysis between the two showed a&#xD;
      significant correlation. This study aims to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Qing-Re-Liang-Xue Decoction in comparison with commonly used glucocorticoids and calcipotriol&#xD;
      ointment in patients with blood-heat type psoriasis vulgaris.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled pilot study of Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine (Qing-Re-Liang-Xue Decoction) as a complementary therapy to treat psoriasis vulgaris&#xD;
      of blood-heat syndrome during a 10-week period. We estimate to enroll 200 subjects (treatment&#xD;
      group(N=100); controlled group(N=100)).&#xD;

    <description>Healed: TCM syndromes and skin lesions disappeared, only pigmentation spots or depigmentation spots remained, and no new skin rashes. The TCM syndrome score is reduced by more than 90%; markedly effective: TCM syndromes and skin lesions have basically disappeared or only a few intractable small pieces remain, and the skin lesions are still slightly infiltrated. TCM syndrome scores are reduced by 60-89%; effective: TCM syndromes are significantly reduced, and skin lesions have subsided by more than 30%. TCM syndrome scores are reduced by 30-56%; ineffective: after 3 courses of treatment, the skin lesions still have no progress or the skin lesions have subsided by less than 30%. The reduction of TCM syndrome points is less than 30%.</description>
