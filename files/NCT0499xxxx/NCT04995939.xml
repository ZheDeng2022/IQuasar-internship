  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) emerge as a major risk that determines the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of patients after surgery. PPCs affect the length of hospital stay&#xD;
      and increase health costs. Because of this reason, it is important to predict PPCs before&#xD;
      surgery. There are many studies on scoring systems that can be effective in predicting PPCs.&#xD;
      The most frequently used ones are the Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in&#xD;
      Catalonia (ARISCAT) risk index, the Nutritional Risk Score (NRS), and the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologist (ASA) score. ARISCAT risk index is mostly evaluated in operations performed&#xD;
      other than thoracic surgery. Since the thoracic wall, mediastinum or lungs are directly&#xD;
      intervened in thoracic surgery operations, the expected PPCs in these patients may be&#xD;
      different from those expected in other surgical groups. Therefore, the ARISCAT risk index may&#xD;
      be insufficient to evaluate PPCs in thoracic surgery.&#xD;
