  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate intensity titrated dose anticoagulation has been used in patients receiving&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to prevent thromboembolism and thrombotic&#xD;
      mechanical complications. As technology has improved, however, the incidence of&#xD;
      thromboembolic events has decreased, leading to re-evaluation of the risks of&#xD;
      anticoagulation, particularly during venovenous (V-V) ECMO. Recent data suggest that bleeding&#xD;
      complications during V-V ECMO may be more strongly associated with mortality than&#xD;
      thromboembolic complications, and case series have suggested that V-V ECMO can be safely&#xD;
      performed without moderate or high intensity anticoagulation. At present, there is&#xD;
      significant variability between institutions in the approach to anticoagulation during V-V&#xD;
      ECMO. A definitive randomized controlled trial is needed to compare the effects of a low&#xD;
      intensity fixed dose anticoagulation (low intensity) versus moderate intensity titrated dose&#xD;
      anticoagulation (moderate intensity) on clinical outcomes during V-V ECMO. Before such a&#xD;
      trial can be conducted, however, additional data are needed to inform the feasibility of the&#xD;
      future trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the inception of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO), moderate intensity&#xD;
      titrated dose anticoagulation has been used to prevent clinically harmful thromboembolism and&#xD;
      thrombotic mechanical complications. The impact of thromboembolic events on clinical outcomes&#xD;
      during venovenous (V-V) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), however, is unclear, and&#xD;
      complications related to bleeding are common and associated with increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. These findings have led many experts to suggest that anticoagulation strategies&#xD;
      during V-V ECMO should be re-evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical illness, in general, is associated with both coagulopathy and impaired hemostasis.&#xD;
      These problems are compounded during ECMO by the artificial interface between blood and the&#xD;
      non-biologic surface of the circuit components, which leads to activation of the coagulation&#xD;
      system, consumptive thrombocytopenia, fibrinolysis, and thrombin generation. The sheer stress&#xD;
      on blood components during ECMO also lead to destruction of high-molecular-weight von&#xD;
      Willebrand multimers, interrupting primary hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both bleeding and thromboembolism are common complications during ECMO. Bleeding events have&#xD;
      been associated with poor clinical outcomes, likely mediated by an increased incidence of&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage during ECMO. During intra-operative cardiopulmonary bypass and&#xD;
      venoarterial (V-A) ECMO, ischemic strokes are a common and potentially deadly complication.&#xD;
      During V-V ECMO, however, the majority of thromboembolic events are cannula-associated DVT&#xD;
      and circuit thromboses requiring exchange, which are of unclear clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various anticoagulation strategies have been proposed to balance the risks of bleeding and&#xD;
      thromboembolism during V-V ECMO, including high intensity anticoagulation, moderate intensity&#xD;
      anticoagulation, and low intensity anticoagulation (the equivalent of DVT prophylaxis).&#xD;
      Observational studies have suggested that, compared to moderate intensity anticoagulation,&#xD;
      low intensity anticoagulation reduces transfusion requirements without affecting the&#xD;
      incidence of thrombosis, hemorrhage, or death. In one case series of 60 patients who were&#xD;
      treated with only low-intensity subcutaneous heparin during V-V ECMO, rates of transfusions&#xD;
      were lower than historical controls without any effect on the rate of thrombotic events.&#xD;
      Similarly, a recent systematic review suggested that the rates of thromboembolism and circuit&#xD;
      thrombosis among patients managed with a moderate intensity anticoagulation strategy during&#xD;
      V-V ECMO were comparable to the rates reported among patients managed with a less intense&#xD;
      anticoagulation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing low intensity to moderate&#xD;
      intensity anticoagulation during V-V ECMO. Guidelines from the Extracorporeal Life Support&#xD;
      Organization (ELSO), the pre-eminent group for ECMO education and research, provide little&#xD;
      guidance for the selection of anticoagulation strategy, and anticoagulation practices are&#xD;
      highly variable across institutions. A large, multicenter, randomized trial is needed to&#xD;
      determine the ideal strategy to anticoagulation during V-V ECMO. Before such a trial can be&#xD;
      conducted, however, additional data are needed on the feasibility of randomizing patients to&#xD;
      a specific anticoagulation strategy and study measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate a large, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing low intensity&#xD;
      anticoagulation to moderate intensity anticoagulation during V-V ECMO, a pilot trial is&#xD;
      needed to establish feasibility and the performance of the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim of the study: To demonstrate feasibility of a future large, multi-center&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial comparing low intensity to moderate intensity anticoagulation&#xD;
      among adults receiving V-V ECMO by demonstrating the ability to recruit and randomize&#xD;
      participants, adhere to assigned anticoagulation strategy, and demonstrate adequate&#xD;
      separation between groups in therapy delivered and intensity of anticoagulation achieved with&#xD;
      the assigned anticoagulation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim of the study: To define and estimate the frequency of the primary efficacy,&#xD;
      primary safety, and secondary outcomes of a future large, multi-center randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial comparing low intensity vs moderate intensity anticoagulation among adults receiving&#xD;
      V-V ECMO.&#xD;
