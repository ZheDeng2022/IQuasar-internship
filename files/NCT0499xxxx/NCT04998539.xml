  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wheelchair skills training is an important step in the wheelchair provision process.&#xD;
      Caregivers play an important role in the lives of wheelchair users but very little is known&#xD;
      about wheelchair skills training for caregivers. The goal of the study is to understand the&#xD;
      effect of wheelchair travel direction, wheelchair occupant body position and technique used&#xD;
      by caregivers on the ease of getting an occupied wheelchair over a soft surface.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      Able bodied participants will be used to simulate caregivers and wheelchair occupants.&#xD;
      Participants simulating caregivers will be asked to move the occupied wheelchair over a 5 m&#xD;
      soft surface. Participants will be randomly assigned a direction to move the wheelchair&#xD;
      (forward or backwards), wheelchair occupant body position (upright or leaning forward) and&#xD;
      technique in moving the wheelchair (upright with all 4 wheels on ground or in a wheelie&#xD;
      position with the wheelchair tipped backwards and balanced on the rear wheels). The ease of&#xD;
      getting the occupied wheelchair over the soft surface will be evaluated by the amount of time&#xD;
      taken to complete the task, how well the participant completed the task and the ease of&#xD;
      performing the task as evaluated by the participant.&#xD;
