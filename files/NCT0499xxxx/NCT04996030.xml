  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SY-2101 is being studied as a treatment for participants with a type of leukemia called acute&#xD;
      promyelocytic leukemia (APL). SY-2101 is an oral form of a drug called arsenic trioxide&#xD;
      (ATO). ATO is already used to treat APL in a form that is given as an intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      infusion (through a needle in the arm). SY-2101 is a different form of ATO that is taken&#xD;
      orally (by mouth).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include participants with low-risk APL in remission, who are receiving&#xD;
      standard of care treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and intravenous ATO, during&#xD;
      the consolidation phase of chemotherapy with low-risk APL. The participants in this trial&#xD;
      will get continued treatment with ATO and ATRA to help keep their cancer from coming back.&#xD;
      There will be some weeks when participants receive intravenous ATO and others when they&#xD;
      receive SY-2101 (ATO taken orally).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes 3 parts: during one part, enrolled participants will receive a single&#xD;
      dose of IV ATO, and a week later a single dose of SY-2101 either in the fed or fasted&#xD;
      condition, and a week after that, a single dose of SY-2101 in the fed or fasted condition.&#xD;
      After each of these doses, blood draws and safety assessments will be performed. In another&#xD;
      part of the study, enrolled participants will receive IV ATO according to the standard of&#xD;
      care, with collection of blood and safety assessments. In the third part of the study,&#xD;
      enrolled participants who are documented to be in molecular remission will receive SY-2101 in&#xD;
      place of IV ATO during the 4th cycle of consolidation, with the collection of blood and&#xD;
      safety assessments throughout the cycle. Participants do not need to participate in all parts&#xD;
      of the study to enroll.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of low risk APL characterized by the presence of&#xD;
             the t(15;17) translocation or PML/RARA gene expression via reverse transcription&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or&#xD;
             cytogenetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have received ATO plus ATRA induction therapy and must have received&#xD;
             or are eligible and planning to receive consolidation therapy with ATO plus ATRA in&#xD;
             alignment with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for low-risk&#xD;
             APL prior to their enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to tolerate full dose ATO per NCCN guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be in morphological complete remission (CR) at the end of induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a serum/urine pregnancy test (for females of childbearing&#xD;
             potential) that is negative at the Screening Visit and immediately prior to initiation&#xD;
             of study treatment (first dose of study drug).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have demonstrated relapse and therefore are not eligible for further&#xD;
             consolidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently receiving treatment for a non-APL malignancy (not including&#xD;
             basal cell carcinoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, or&#xD;
             localized prostate cancer treated with hormone therapy). Participants with history of&#xD;
             other cancers should be free of disease for at least 2 years prior to the Screening&#xD;
             Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with an active, life-threatening, or clinically-significant uncontrolled&#xD;
             systemic infection requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunocompromised participants with increased risk of opportunistic infections,&#xD;
             including known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive participants with cluster&#xD;
             of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts ≤350 cells/millimeters (mm^3) or history of&#xD;
             opportunistic infection in the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a known active or chronic hepatitis B or active hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV) infection. Participants with a history of HCV infection who have completed&#xD;
             curative therapy for HCV at least 12 weeks before the Screening Visit and have a&#xD;
             documented undetectable viral load at the Screening Visit are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have not adequately recovered from a major surgery within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             starting study drug administration.&#xD;

             cardiac function abnormalities. Participants who experienced other severe and&#xD;
             life-threatening clinically-significant ATO-related AEs that are considered, in the&#xD;
             judgement of the investigator, to increase participant risk with continued ATO&#xD;
             treatment are also excluded.&#xD;
