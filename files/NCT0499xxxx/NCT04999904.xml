  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ROCKY REHAB trial will provide a pragmatic approach to evaluate if incorporating a rocky,&#xD;
      uneven terrain treadmill into the proprioceptive rehabilitation received during physical&#xD;
      therapy can improve outcomes and reduce reinjury rates in patients with ankle instability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb sprains and strains are three-times more prevalent than any other acute injury in&#xD;
      the Armed Forces, with lateral ankle sprains being the most common injury sustained during&#xD;
      active-duty. Many individuals who experience an ankle sprain will go on to develop chronic&#xD;
      ankle instability. Training and rehabilitation programs that incorporate proprioceptive&#xD;
      training are particularly effective at improving outcomes and reducing re-injury rate.&#xD;
      However, current programs do not help individuals &quot;train to the tasks&quot; that will be&#xD;
      encountered once those individuals leave physical therapy. The proposed intervention&#xD;
      evaluates the use of a rocky, uneven terrain treadmill that specifically targets aspects of&#xD;
      the real-world environment for restoring and improving short-term function and performance&#xD;
      and reducing the long-term risk of re-injury. This trial will randomly allocate 312&#xD;
      individuals with ankle sprains and chronic ankle instability to standard of care physical&#xD;
      therapy or the standard of care supplemented with the uneven treadmill intervention. Patient&#xD;
      reported outcome, performance measures, and biomechanical measures of muscle activations and&#xD;
      plantar pressures will be evaluated. Patient reported outcomes and reinjury rates will be&#xD;
      tracked for 18 months.&#xD;
