      EFFECTIVENESS OF COMBINED ANTICOAGULATION AND ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY VS ANTITHROMBOTIC&#xD;
      THERAPY ALONE AFTER LOWER EXTREMITY REVASCULARIZATION FOR PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy is a crucial part of PAD management as it prolongs&#xD;
      the patecy of grafts in open surgical revascularization procedures so its proper dosage and&#xD;
      duration without increasing risks to the patient and maximizing the benefits is very&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently literature in Pakistan regarding this problem couldn't be found so this study would&#xD;
      help assessing the outcomes of anticoagulation and antithrombotic therapy in this population&#xD;
      with respect to treatment options available and presentation variability of the peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease. Patients with PAD would be enrolled for 6 months and would be followed upto&#xD;
      12 months and then upto 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily plus&#xD;
      aspirin 75 mg once daily or rivaroxaban-matching placebo twice daily plus aspirin 75 mg once&#xD;
      daily stratified by type of procedure; the treatment assignment will be double-blinded.&#xD;
      Randomization and study treatment will begin as soon as possible but no later than 10 days&#xD;
      after a successfull lower extremity revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be prohibited from taking any additional antithrombotic therapy other drugs,&#xD;
      including anticoagulants, doses of aspirin &gt;100 mg daily, vorapaxar, ticagrelor, prasugrel,&#xD;
      or cilostazol. Enrolled subjects will be having symptomatic PAD defined by evidence of an&#xD;
      abnormal ankle-brachial index ≤0.80 in either limb with an anatomy of occlusive disease of&#xD;
      involving segments. Subjects would be randomized who had undergone a technically successful&#xD;
      endovascular, hybrid, or surgical LER within 10 days and had achieved adequate hemostasis&#xD;
      before randomization.&#xD;
