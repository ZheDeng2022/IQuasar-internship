  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this double blind, randomized phase III trial is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of T89 in preventing Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) and relieving the symptoms of&#xD;
      AMS after rapid ascent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a common ailment in people venturing over 2,500 meters&#xD;
      altitude. It is a pathological effect of high altitude on humans, caused by acute exposure to&#xD;
      low partial pressure of oxygen at high altitude. It presents with a cluster of nonspecific&#xD;
      symptoms including headache and one of the following: gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue&#xD;
      and/or weakness, dizziness/ lightheadedness or difficulty sleeping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T89 capsule is a modernized industrialized version of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine.&#xD;
      It is a botanical drug product for oral use. Previous clinical studies showed T89 has&#xD;
      substantial benefits in the prevention or amelioration of symptoms associated with acute&#xD;
      mountain sickness (AMS).This is double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled pivotal phase 3&#xD;
      study. After informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the&#xD;
      3 study groups (T89 high dose, T89 low dose and placebo control). The study drug will be&#xD;
      given orally for 5 days (2 days at sea level and 3 days at high altitude). The clinical&#xD;
      assessment of Lake Louise Scoring System (LLSS), blood oxygen saturation, the exercise&#xD;
      tolerance, blood pressure and heart rate will be performed at sea level and altitude. A total&#xD;
      of 846 subjects will be enrolled with 282 subjects in each treatment arm, and a minimum of&#xD;
      756 subjects are expected to complete the study.&#xD;
