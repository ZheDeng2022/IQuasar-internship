  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent's poor sleep habits have been linked to adverse outcomes. Recent advances in&#xD;
      activity tracking have provided researchers with cost-effective and non-invasive measurements&#xD;
      of sleep in a free-living environment. The primary objective is to determine the mean&#xD;
      differences in Fitbit accelerometer sleep quantity (mins) between High School&#xD;
      student-athletes and non-athletes during a competitive academic semester over continuous&#xD;
      monitoring for two weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives are to measure and determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a relationship exist between self-reported Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)&#xD;
           sleep scores and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores compared to mean Fitbit&#xD;
           accelerometer sleep quantity and efficiency (sleep quality) based on heart rate, time&#xD;
           awake or restless over two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If dietary habits have a significantly correlated relationship to subject group, sleep&#xD;
           quantity, sleep efficiency and steps/day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If mean differences exist in Fitbit steps counted between student-athletes and&#xD;
           non-athletes over two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a relationship exists between mean Fitbit accelerometer steps counted and mean sleep&#xD;
           quantity and efficiency over two weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Fitbits are monitored remotely by the Principal investigator. This is a fully remote&#xD;
      study (no physical study sites). Participants are recruited from 3 high schools (IRB&#xD;
      approved). Consent, study forms and other e-mail communication and texting is directly&#xD;
      between the participant and the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
