  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The existing alcohol intervention studies are mainly conducted in developed countries, few&#xD;
      studies have focused on alcohol consumption among ethnic minority migrant people in&#xD;
      developing countries. To address this gap, the investigators aim to evaluate the effects of a&#xD;
      brief intervention combined with a small financial incentive on alcohol consumption and&#xD;
      health outcomes among the migrated population in Liangshan Prefecture. This study was&#xD;
      conducted in Liangshan Prefecture for two reasons: first, Liangshan is a region located in&#xD;
      the southwestern of Sichuan province and is populated by Yi minority, and the average income&#xD;
      in Liangshan is just about two-thirds of the national average income. Second, a study found&#xD;
      that the drinking rate of the Yi minority (47.9%) is higher than that of other regions in&#xD;
      China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of alcohol consumption among the ethnic&#xD;
      populations in China and to test the feasibility and efficacy of small financial incentives&#xD;
      with brief advice intervention targeting the reduction of harmful drinking behaviors among&#xD;
      poor people.&#xD;

    <description>No information or cash incentives are provided to the participants in the control group, but it is also necessary to collect the information of the participants in the control group and perform an alcohol test. Therefore, the project team will provide a certain degree of compensation for participants in the control group (participants of the intervention group also will receive this part of compensation).</description>

A total of three counsels are conducted, which are set on the second week, sixth and tenth week after the baseline survey.</description>
