      This study is an exploratory clinical study to observe the improvement of lung function&#xD;
      before and after the treatment by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and&#xD;
      the purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of human umbilical cord-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells on non-cardiac surgery-induced lung injury in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease. The study is a randomized parallel controlled study. Patients receive a review&#xD;
      of which main content includes symptom improvement, lung function improvement, and adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

      This study is an exploratory clinical study to observe the improvement of lung function&#xD;
      before and after the treatment by human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, and&#xD;
      the purpose is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of human umbilical cord-derived&#xD;
      mesenchymal stem cells on non-cardiac surgery-induced lung injury in patients with ischemic&#xD;
      heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized parallel controlled study. The research process is as follows: 1.&#xD;
      Sixteen eligible patients with ischemic heart disease were recruited, fully informed, and&#xD;
      signed a consent form, and randomly divided into placebo control group (n=8) or hUC-MSCs&#xD;
      treatment group (n=8); 2. Knee replacement was performed under general anesthesia in both&#xD;
      groups. In the cell therapy group, 1×10^6/kg human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells were intravenously injected to the patient immediately after the surgery and at day 3&#xD;
      after the surgery. Before the operation, 6 hours, 3 days, 7days, 14 days, and 28 days after&#xD;
      the MSCs injection, all patients receive a review of which main content includes symptom&#xD;
      improvement, lung function improvement, and adverse events.&#xD;
