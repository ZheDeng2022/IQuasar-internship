  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at how well semaglutide helps people lose weight. This study will look at&#xD;
      the change in the participants' body weight from the start to the end of the study. The study&#xD;
      compares the weight loss in people who get semaglutide to the weight loss in people who get&#xD;
      placebo. Placebo is a &quot;dummy&quot; medicine that looks like the study medicine, but has no effect&#xD;
      on the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will either get semaglutide or &quot;dummy&quot; medicine - which treatment participants&#xD;
      get is decided by chance. Participants will need to take 1 injection once a week. The study&#xD;
      medicine is injected with a thin needle in a skin fold in the stomach, thigh or upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have talks with study staff about healthy food choices, how to be more&#xD;
      physically active and what participants can do to lose weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about a year (50 weeks). Participants will have 10 clinic visits and&#xD;
      8 phone calls. At 6 of the clinic visits participants will have blood samples taken. At 3 of&#xD;
      the clinic visits participants cannot eat and drink (water is allowed) for 8 hours before the&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants cannot take part if participants have or have had diabetes. Women cannot take&#xD;
      part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to get pregnant during the study period.&#xD;
