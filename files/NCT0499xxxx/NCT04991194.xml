      This was a single-centre, open-label, parallel group, non-randomised, two-part multiple dose&#xD;
      10-day study in healthy young and elderly male and female subjects. The study comprised a&#xD;
      screening evaluation between 2 and 28 days before the first Investigational Medicinal Product&#xD;
      (IMP) administration, a hospitalisation period of 15 days comprising a treatment period of 10&#xD;
      days, and a follow-up visit approximately 7 days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: Subjects received 1200 mg of BIA 5-1058 once a day (od), in fasting conditions, for&#xD;
      10 days Part 2 : Subjects received 400 mg of BIA 5-1058 od, in fasting conditions, for 10&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
