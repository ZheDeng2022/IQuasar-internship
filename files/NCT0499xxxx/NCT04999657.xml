  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-invasive tibial nerve stimulator for the treatment&#xD;
      of overactive bladder under the premise of ensuring the safety of the subjects and ensuring&#xD;
      the scientific nature of the clinical trial. The primary safety endpoint will be&#xD;
      device-related adverse events. The primary effectiveness endpoint will be the improvement&#xD;
      value of overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS) after 12-week treatment.&#xD;
