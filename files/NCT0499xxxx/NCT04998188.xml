  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare the 6 months clinical outcome of the treatment with a&#xD;
      single intra-articular collagen injection versus a single placebo (saline solution)&#xD;
      infiltration in the infiltrative treatment of knee osteoarthritis. The evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed through clinical, subjective and objective assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      204 patients affected by knee osteoarthritis will be included in a double-blinded randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. Patients in the experimental group will be treated with a single&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of collagen (solution of low molecular weight peptides derived from&#xD;
      hydrolyzed collagen) instead patients in the control arm, will be treated with a single&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of placebo (saline solution). All patients will be evaluated by&#xD;
      clinical examination before the infiltrative procedure and they will follow-up at 1,3,6&#xD;
      months. During the follow-up visits ,will be evaluated the inflammatory status of the knee by&#xD;
      thermographic assessment and questionnaires, filled out by patients, will be utilized for&#xD;
      clinical evaluations. After 6 months, patients in the control arm (saline solution&#xD;
      injection), have the possibility to cross-over into the treatment arm (collagen) in which&#xD;
      case they will be followed for an additional 6 months.&#xD;
