      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best doses of buparlisib, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride, and cisplatin in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body. Buparlisib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride&#xD;
      and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing&#xD;
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving buparlisib, gemcitabine hydrochloride,&#xD;
      and cisplatin may be a better treatment for solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities, maximally tolerated dose, and identify the&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination of BKM120 (buparlisib), gemcitabine&#xD;
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride), and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe safety and tolerability of the combination of BKM120, gemcitabine, and&#xD;
      cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe preliminary evidence of efficacy with this combination. III. To describe any&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) effect of gemcitabine and cisplatin on the plasma concentrations of&#xD;
      BKM120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha&#xD;
      (PIK3CA) mutations as predictive biomarkers of efficacy for the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms and polymorphisms in BKM120 transport and metabolism as&#xD;
      predictors of toxicity and/or efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, gemcitabine&#xD;
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin IV over 2&#xD;
      hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL); patients&#xD;
             with elevated hCG at baseline that is judged to be related to the tumor are eligible&#xD;
             if hCG levels do not show the expected doubling when repeated 5-7 days later, or&#xD;
             pregnancy has been ruled out by vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient who does not apply highly effective contraception during the study and through&#xD;
             the duration as defined below after the final dose of study treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Sexually active males should use a condom during intercourse while taking drug&#xD;
                  and for 8 weeks after the final dose of study treatment and should not father a&#xD;
                  child in this period, but may be recommended to seek advice on conservation of&#xD;
                  sperm; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
                  prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
                  becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and&#xD;
                  through at least 4 weeks after the final dose of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective contraception is defined as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Total abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual&#xD;
                       lifestyle of the subject; (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation,&#xD;
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable&#xD;
                       methods of contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Female sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or&#xD;
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking&#xD;
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy&#xD;
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study&#xD;
                       subjects, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                       patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use a combination of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                            cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                            suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, and&#xD;
                            implanted) are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child-bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago; for women with&#xD;
             therapy-induced amenorrhea, oophorectomy or serial measurements of&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol are needed to ensure&#xD;
             postmenopausal status; NOTE: ovarian radiation or treatment with a luteinizing&#xD;
             hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist (goserelin acetate or leuprolide acetate) is&#xD;
             not permitted for induction of ovarian suppression&#xD;
