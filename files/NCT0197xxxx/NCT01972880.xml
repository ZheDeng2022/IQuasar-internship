  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the bioequivalence of a single dose of ASP1941 between tablet-1 and tablet-2 in a&#xD;
      two-way crossover method in non-elderly healthy male subjects. In addition, the safety of&#xD;
      these products will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a open-label randomized two-way crossover study. A single dose of two types of&#xD;
      ASP1941 tablets are given to non-elderly healthy male subjects (16 subjects for each group,&#xD;
      32 subjects in total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the bioequivalence of the 2 formulations cannot be proved in this study due to&#xD;
      insufficient number of subjects, an add-on subject study will be conducted in this clinical&#xD;
      trial as needed. Same design and methodology are to be applied to this study and the add-on&#xD;
      subject study. The add-on subject study may not be conducted.&#xD;
