      This study is to evaluate the performance of the Articulinx ICMC&#xD;
      (InterCarpoMetacarpalCushion) in the carpometacarpal joint (CMC joint) and to describe the&#xD;
      clinical results in patients who have been treated with this device. Expected results include&#xD;
      the relief of symptoms and improvement of function in patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the CMC-1 joint. Evaluation of device performance will be achieved&#xD;
      through measurements of pain, pain medication use, and joint function in up to 40 subjects.&#xD;
      Each subject will be compared to their pre-surgery status for each endpoint.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Articulinx ICMC is intended to be implanted into the basilar, or first carpometacarpal&#xD;
      (CMC) joint, as an interpositional spacer between the first metacarpal and trapezium bones.&#xD;
      The device is intended to be used in the treatment of thumb disabilities resulting from&#xD;
      osteoarthritis of the CMC-1 joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to document the performance of the Articulinx ICMC by evaluating&#xD;
      pain relief in the CMC joint following device implantation. CMC-1 joint function will be&#xD;
      assessed by measurement of lateral key and tripod pinch strength, grip strength, and range of&#xD;
      motion. Patient reported physical functioning and symptoms will be measured by DASH scores.&#xD;
      Trapezial height will be measured on standard PA xrays of the CMC joint. Incidence of&#xD;
      unanticipated device and procedure related adverse events will be documented intraoperatively&#xD;
      through one year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary and secondary outcomes will be evaluated through one year and subjects will continue&#xD;
      to be followed for two years for evaluation of longer term performance.&#xD;
