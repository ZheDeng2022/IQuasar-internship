  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is a stress on the body and recovering well after surgery is very important to&#xD;
      patients and their doctors. It is therefore important to prepare patient's bodies for the&#xD;
      stress of surgery, and one way to do this is to provide proper nutrition. In the past,&#xD;
      patients were asked to prepare for surgery by fasting from midnight before surgery. Today, it&#xD;
      is known that this practice is not beneficial to patient's recovery. In fact, it has been&#xD;
      recognized that drinking a sugary beverage (e.g., juice) before surgery stimulates the&#xD;
      production of insulin, which is a hormone that helps make the proteins needed for wound&#xD;
      healing after surgery. This is currently practiced at the MUHC. It might also be beneficial,&#xD;
      however, to drink a beverage that contains sugar and whey proteins (a protein isolated from&#xD;
      milk) before surgery. In fact, whey proteins stimulate insulin and may also have the added&#xD;
      benefit of improving muscular strength. In this study, investigators will measure the level&#xD;
      of insulin produced after drinking a carbohydrate (i.e., sugar)-whey protein beverage to&#xD;
      determine how it compares to the level of insulin produced after drinking the sugary beverage&#xD;
      used at the MUHC.&#xD;

      It is hypothesized that the increase in plasma insulin following a mixed carbohydrate whey&#xD;
      protein drink is significantly greater than that elicited by a carbohydrate drink.&#xD;

    <description>The acetaminophen absorption test, as an indirect assessment of gastric emptying.Since gastric emptying is the rate-limiting step in delivering the drug to its absorption site, it is believed that the rate of appearance of acetaminophen in the blood reflects the rate of gastric emptying.&#xD;
