  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the 4th&#xD;
      cause of mortality in the US. Central to COPD pathogenesis is &quot;ciliopathy&quot;, dysfunction of&#xD;
      the airway ciliated cells that mediate transport of mucus to remove inhaled pathogens. The&#xD;
      focus of this study is to carry out metabolic profiling of banked biologic samples and assess&#xD;
      the hypothesis that COPD is associated with a unique metabolome in serum and lung epithelial&#xD;
      lining fluid, and that subsets of the COPD metabolome are linked to the ciliopathy of COPD.&#xD;

      Cigarette smoking is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the 4th&#xD;
      cause of mortality in the US. Central to COPD pathogenesis is &quot;ciliopathy&quot;, dysfunction of&#xD;
      the airway ciliated cells that mediate transport of mucus to remove inhaled pathogens. The&#xD;
      COPD ciliopathy leads to mucus accumulation, impaired host defense and recurrent infections.&#xD;
      Using a state-of-the-art platform for global metabolite profiling and unique cohorts with&#xD;
      serum and lung biologic samples, our deliverables are to identify a metabolome focused on&#xD;
      biomarkers related to airway ciliopathy in COPD, and use the observed metabolic changes to:&#xD;
      (1) direct mechanistic studies to define ciliopathy at a molecular level; (2) identify novel&#xD;
      targets for therapeutic intervention in COPD; and (3) identify smokers at high risk for COPD.&#xD;
      Preliminary metabolic data led to our first clues - COPD smokers have decreased serum&#xD;
      citrulline levels, consistent with a deficiency in lung nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity,&#xD;
      and thus lung nitric oxide (NO) deficiency. This, together with supporting data of a&#xD;
      smoking-induced NOS/NO-related ciliopathy, and knowledge that smokers have significant&#xD;
      oxidant-related changes in the airway epithelial transcriptome, led to our aims, combining&#xD;
      metabolomics of defined cohorts, murine and human mechanistic studies and computational /&#xD;
      statistical integration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To carry out metabolic profiling of banked biologic samples of our characterized&#xD;
      cohorts to assess the hypothesis that COPD is associated with a unique metabolome in serum&#xD;
      and lung epithelial lining fluid, and that subsets of the COPD metabolome are linked to the&#xD;
      ciliopathy of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To combine metabolic profiling and in vitro studies of human and murine airway&#xD;
      epithelium to evaluate the hypothesis that there is a link between the COPD metabolome&#xD;
      (focusing on the inferred NO deficiency) and mechanisms underlying the ciliopathy of COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. Characterize and quantify the cigarette smoke induced &quot;redoxome&quot; in lung and serum and&#xD;
      assess its role in ciliated cell dysfunction. Studies seek to identify a link between&#xD;
      smoking, a burden of oxidants to the lung epithelium and the pathogenesis of COPD -&#xD;
      potentially providing biomarker(s) that predict which smokers will develop COPD and&#xD;
      identifying new targets for therapy of COPD.&#xD;
