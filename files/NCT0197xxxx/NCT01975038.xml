      Determining Fitzpatrick skin phototypes (FST) allows physicians to assess a person's risk of&#xD;
      developing sunburn, and thus the need for sun protection to prevent the development of skin&#xD;
      cancer. Reflectance spectrophotometry objectively measures the melanin index (MI) and can&#xD;
      assist in determining the accuracy of self-reported FST compared with&#xD;
      dermatologist-determined FST. At present, we seek to determine the accuracy of an adapted&#xD;
      Skin Sun Sensitivity Scale for individuals of all pigmentation varieties (FST I through VI)&#xD;
      as compared with spectrophotometric measurements assessing FST. Our principal objective is to&#xD;
      correlate the MI under usual conditions by spectrophotometry with the adapted Fitzpatrick SPT&#xD;
      as determined by the patients' responses to the adapted questionnaire.&#xD;

      1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We extended the pilot study (IRB STU27549) of our objective measurement of skin&#xD;
           pigmentation with correlation to the self-reported skin reaction to sun exposure to a&#xD;
           larger sample with special emphasis on people with skin of color and compare the results&#xD;
           to those obtained by spectrophotometry. We found that forty-two percent (114 of 270) of&#xD;
           the participants' responses to the burning and tanning questions could not be classified&#xD;
           using standard Fitzpatrick skin phototype (FST) definitions. At present, we seek to&#xD;
           determine the accuracy of an adapted Skin Sun Sensitivity Scale for individuals of all&#xD;
           pigmentation varieties (FST I through VI) as compared with spectrophotometric&#xD;
           measurements assessing FST.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fitzpatrick Skin Phototyping Skin phototyping has usually been determined subjectively&#xD;
           by trained investigators or clinicians using sun burning and/or sun tanning responses.&#xD;
           In addition, subject self-report of ease of sunburning and tanning is used in surveys to&#xD;
           determine the risk of developing skin cancer. (Table 1) Responses to the Fitzpatrick&#xD;
           Skin Phototype (SPT) questions may be unreliable due to recall bias, subjective bias by&#xD;
           clinicians and subjects, lack of cultural sensitivity of the questions, and the&#xD;
           subjects' use of sun protection behaviors from early childhood such that the subject may&#xD;
           not have experienced sunburn.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Table 1. Skin type; Erythema and Tanning Reactions to the First Summer Exposure I Always&#xD;
           burns, never tan (painful burn at 24 hrs and no tan at 7d) II Burn easy, then develop&#xD;
           light tan (painful burn at 24 hrs and a light tan at 7d) III Burn moderately, then&#xD;
           develop light tan (slightly tender burn at 24 hrs, moderate tan at 7d) IV Burn&#xD;
           minimally-rarely, then develop moderate tan (no burn at 24 hrs and a good tan at 7d) V&#xD;
           Never burns, always develops dark tan VI Never burns, no noticeable change in appearance&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unreliable Sunburning History A limitation of the 6 integer Roman numeral Fitzpatrick&#xD;
           SPT was reliance upon a history of sunburn after the first exposure of the summer. For&#xD;
           those who reside in regions that have sun exposure all year (e.g. Arizona, Florida,&#xD;
           California), the sunburning-tanning question after the first exposure of the summer was&#xD;
           often irrelevant. Lastly, in the 1990s people began to use sunscreens to prevent&#xD;
           sunburns, thus, those with sun sensitive skin may never have experienced sunburn and&#xD;
           were unable to answer the question about ease of sun burning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multi-ethnic Populations There has been a tendency to group all people of a similar&#xD;
           ethnic group into a single category of SPT, which introduces potential bias into the&#xD;
           subjective assessment of SPT by investigators. For example, Hispanic whites are often&#xD;
           considered &quot;brown&quot; and assigned to Skin Type IV (Table 2). The heterogeneity of those&#xD;
           with multi-ethnic backgrounds makes it difficult to assess susceptibility to skin cancer&#xD;
           on the basis of skin color, which is predominantly determined by pigments such as&#xD;
           hemoglobin, melanin, bilirubin, and carotene.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Skin Phototyping by Sunburning Ability. Skin Phototype Appearance Sunburning ability I&#xD;
           Very white or freckled Always burn II White Usually burn III White to Olive Sometimes&#xD;
           burn IV Brown Rarely burn V Dark brown Very rarely burn VI Black Never burn&#xD;
&#xD;
           Over the last 3 decades, the Fitzpatrick SPT evolved from its original purpose of&#xD;
           determining the amount of ultraviolet light (UVL) for treatment of psoriasis patients&#xD;
           living in New England to become an assessment tool for skin cancer risk. As part of this&#xD;
           evolution, the original 4 skin types (I-IV), that assessed sun reactivity with&#xD;
           standardized questions about the ease of sun burning and tanning reactions to the first&#xD;
           summer sun exposure, were modified by adding SPT V and VI to include those with brown&#xD;
           and black skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Our research demonstrated that the SPT modifications to include people with skin of&#xD;
           color were neither culturally sensitive nor accurate as people of color were unable to&#xD;
           respond to the questions about their experience with sunburn and tanning. People with&#xD;
           skin of color did not report becoming red or pink but rather experienced &quot;irritation&quot;&#xD;
           after sun exposure. In our recently reported work, we proposed a modification of the FST&#xD;
           questions to allow people with skin of color to be able to respond (Survey questions&#xD;
           1and 2). We now wish to test the responses of people to these self-report questions and&#xD;
           compare the responses with the melanin index as determined by spectrophotometry.(Survey&#xD;
           question 9)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Spectrophotometry The &quot;gold standard&quot; method of assessing skin pigmentation is&#xD;
           reflectance spectrophotometry (RS). Pershing et al performed seminal research comparing&#xD;
           the area under the curve obtained by RS to profile the constitutive skin color with&#xD;
           clinicians' assessment of SPT. For skin types I-III, Pershing et al (2008) found&#xD;
           inconsistency between clinicians' and reflectance spectrophotometric (RS) assessments of&#xD;
           SPT. The clinicians adjusted the patients' SPT as determined by their historical sun&#xD;
           burning and tanning response by factoring in observed hair and eye color. For example,&#xD;
           red-haired individuals determined by RS to be SPT III were listed as SPT I by clinical&#xD;
           dermatologists. Subjective assessment of SPT by clinicians was heavily influenced by&#xD;
           patients' hair and eye color. The Pershing study, which accrued 125 subjects did not&#xD;
           accrue sufficient numbers of subjects with skin of color (Skin types III-VI) to be able&#xD;
           to report meaningful results. (I 20; II 53, III 21, IV 10, V 16, VI 5)&#xD;
&#xD;
           It should be noted that the area under the curve obtained by RS includes the red&#xD;
           reflectance, thus, it is does not solely represent skin pigmentation. Skin pigmentation&#xD;
           or melanin provides photoprotection and can be calculated as melanin index, MI. (see&#xD;
           following section on Melanin Index) Even as early as 1961, the potential for confounding&#xD;
           of the MI obtained by RS by dilatation of superficial blood vessels was recognized. The&#xD;
           device, Mexameter MX 18, internally corrects for the red reflectance in calculating the&#xD;
           melanin index. The melanin index is derived from the multilayered skin model and&#xD;
           Lambert-Beer's law.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           While those that are at risk to develop skin cancer have less melanin content (skin type&#xD;
           I) than those at low risk (skin type VI), people with skin phototypes in the mid-range&#xD;
           (III and IV) believe that their natural skin tone is protective against sunburns, thus,&#xD;
           they fail to use sun protection. When people with skin type III and IV are exposed to&#xD;
           more intense ultraviolet light in more southern latitudes than Chicago they are&#xD;
           surprised by the sunburn they experience. In our proof of principle research, people&#xD;
           with skin type III and IV, who viewed the image of their skin on the computer screen,&#xD;
           perceived that the &quot;color was grainy&quot; and made the conclusion that the &quot;holes&quot; in their&#xD;
           skin pigment made it possible for them to burn&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will further objectively measure the MI of people with skin of color. Thus,&#xD;
           it is essential that we accrue a representative sample of people with skin of color with&#xD;
           all ethnic groups represented over the greatest range of skin types for those&#xD;
           self-identifying themselves as members of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our principal objective is to correlate the melanin index under usual conditions by&#xD;
      spectrophotometry with the adapted Fitzpatrick SPT as determined by the patients' responses&#xD;
      to the adapted questionnaire.&#xD;
