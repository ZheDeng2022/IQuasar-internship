  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of CXD101 (a novel histone&#xD;
      deacetylase inhibitor) that can be safely administered to patients with advanced tumours. The&#xD;
      study will also investigate the use of HR23B expression in tumour as a biomarker of response&#xD;
      to treatment with CXD101. Patients with solid tumours, lymphoma and myeloma can be considered&#xD;
      for this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with CXD101 administered orally starting at 1mg twice a day (ie:&#xD;
      2mg/day). Dose escalation will proceed according to a standard 3+3 phase 1 scheme. Adverse&#xD;
      experiences will be evaluated according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events, version 4.0. Dose escalation will continue until dose limiting toxicity is&#xD;
      encountered in &gt;1/3rd of patients at any dose level. The dose level below this will be&#xD;
      determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. Patients will be treated, at the discretion of&#xD;
      the Principal Investigator, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or the&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent. At the maximum tolerated dose a further 20 patients, defined by tumour&#xD;
      HR23B expression will be enrolled.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. ECOG performance score of ≤ 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant tumour with the potential to&#xD;
             benefit from HDAC inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. High HR23B expressing tumour sample on IHC (expansion cohort only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the&#xD;
             study, including scheduled follow-up visits and examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have recovered from effects of prior treatments, including surgeries&#xD;
             (persistent grade 1 toxicities are permitted at the discretion of the Chief&#xD;
             Investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to start of trial. Both women and men must agree&#xD;
             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the treatment period&#xD;
             and for 16 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Oral contraception and parenteral&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (patches, injectables and implants) that may be affected by&#xD;
             enzyme-inducing drugs should only be used in combination with a barrier method. All&#xD;
             males with partners of childbearing potential or whose partners are pregnant must use&#xD;
             barrier contraception for the duration of dosing and for 16 weeks post-dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Able to give written (signed and dated) informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Haematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges as detailed in study&#xD;

             methods of contraception are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding or a&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers would make the patient a poor&#xD;
             trial candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation of&#xD;
             trial results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who are known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or&#xD;
             HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;

             period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). Limited field&#xD;
             radiotherapy to an isolated lesion in bone or soft tissue must be completed 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to trial entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must not receive any concurrent anti-cancer therapy, including&#xD;
             investigational agents, while on-study. Patients may continue the use of&#xD;
             bisphosphonates for bone disease or corticosteroids providing the dose is stable&#xD;
             before and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting the study.&#xD;

             illness deemed clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with known brain metastases, unless these are shown to be stable&#xD;
             (symptomatically and/or radiologically) over a period of 2 months or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic GI diseases (eg: inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease) or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption of&#xD;
             oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients who are unable to swallow oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with corrected QT interval &gt;450msec.&#xD;
