  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early changes associated with the development of smoking-induced diseases, e.g., COPD and&#xD;
      lung cancer (the two commonest causes of death in U.S.) are often characterized by abnormal&#xD;
      airway epithelial differentiation. Airway basal cells (BC) are stem/progenitor cells&#xD;
      necessary for generation of differentiated airway epithelium. Based on our preliminary&#xD;
      observations that epidermal growth factor receptor, known to regulate airway epithelial&#xD;
      differentiation, is enriched in BC and its ligand EGF is induced by smoking, we hypothesized&#xD;
      that smoking-induced EGF alters the ability of BC to form normally differentiated airway&#xD;
      epithelium. To test this, airway BC will be purified using a cell-culture method established&#xD;
      in our laboratory and responses to EGF will be analyzed using genome-wide microarrays and an&#xD;
      in vitro air-liquid interface model of airway epithelial differentiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Airway epithelium is composed of 4 major cell types, including ciliated cells, secretory&#xD;
      cells, undifferentiated columnar cells, and basal cells (BC). The earliest changes associated&#xD;
      with the development of smoking-induced lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) and lung cancer, occur in the airway epithelium, including BC hyperplasia,&#xD;
      squamous metaplasia, mucous cell hyperplasia and metaplasia, impaired ciliated cell structure&#xD;
      and function, loss of Clara cells, and increased epithelial permeability due to impaired&#xD;
      junctional barrier. We hypothesize that fundamental to these changes are smoking-induced&#xD;
      derangements of BC, the stem/progenitor cell population that can self-renew and differentiate&#xD;
      into ciliated and secretory cells. Using technologies established in our laboratory to&#xD;
      culture pure population of BC from the human airway epithelium, to induce differentiation of&#xD;
      these BC in air-liquid interface, and to assess the transcriptome of purified BC compared to&#xD;
      that of the complete differentiated airway epithelium, our preliminary data indicates that:&#xD;
      (1) airway BC exhibit a distinct gene expression signature relevant to stem/progenitor cell&#xD;
      function, including high expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); (2)&#xD;
      airway BC from healthy smokers have a different gene expression pattern compared to&#xD;
      nonsmokers, with enrichment of functional categories related to cell cycle and proliferation&#xD;
      and down-regulation of differentiation-associated genes; and (3) constitutive EGF expression&#xD;
      in BC and differentiated cells is barely detectable, but smoking selectively up-regulates EGF&#xD;
      expression in differentiated cells of the airway epithelium in vivo. Based on these data and&#xD;
      on the knowledge that EGFR signaling plays a central role in the regulation of cell&#xD;
      proliferation and differentiation in the airway epithelium, the central concept of this&#xD;
      proposal is that smoking-induced expression by differentiated cells activates BC via EGFR&#xD;
      altering the molecular phenotype of airway BC and impairing their ability to generate normal&#xD;
      differentiated airway epithelium. To assess this concept, the following aims will be&#xD;
      addressed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To determine whether stimulation of airway BC from healthy nonsmokers with EGF induces&#xD;
      genes and pathways related to smoking-associated phenotypes, e.g. BC hyperplasia, squamous&#xD;
      metaplasia, mucous metaplasia, abnormal cilia, decreased Clara cell number and compromised&#xD;
      junctional integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that stimulation of airway BC from healthy nonsmokers with EGF&#xD;
      alters BC differentiation in air-liquid interface culture, with generation of&#xD;
      smoking-associated phenotypes (see Aim 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that upon apical exposure to cigarette smoke extract,&#xD;
      differentiated airway epithelial cells derived from BC of healthy nonsmokers release&#xD;
      increased amounts of EGF into the apical supernatant, which will alter the ability of BC of&#xD;
      healthy nonsmokers to generate normal differentiated airway epithelium, and that blocking EGF&#xD;
      in this supernatant will abolish this effect.&#xD;
