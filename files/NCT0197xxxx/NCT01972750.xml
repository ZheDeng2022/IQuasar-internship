  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite intensive treatment efforts combining surgery, radio- and chemotherapy, the prognosis&#xD;
      of patients suffering from glioblastoma (GBM) remains poor. Virtually all GBMs progress&#xD;
      despite therapy. Patients receiving the standard therapy at primary disease have a median&#xD;
      overall survival of 12-15 months. There is currently no defined standard treatment regimen&#xD;
      for recurrent GBM. Tyrosine kinase receptor-targeted therapy is widely used in preclinical&#xD;
      and clinical experimental brain tumor research. Increased tyrosine kinase activity has been&#xD;
      asssociated with GBM oncogenesis and several tyrosine kinase receptors, e.g. VEGFR, FGFR,&#xD;
      PDGFR are upregulated in malignant glioma. In the past and in the present, targeting of VEGF-&#xD;
      and PDGF-signaling (amongst others) has shown promising preclinical and clinical results in&#xD;
      human glioblasto-ma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In that context our own in vitro studies lead to the assumption that application of a&#xD;
      multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor could be a most effective treatment approach for GBM&#xD;
      patients. We were able to demonstrate that GBM cells from different tumor regions express&#xD;
      different set of tyrosine kinase receptors that all could be targeted by the multi-targeted&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258, including PDGFRß, CSF 1R, KIT, FLT3, VEGFR, TrkA, RET and&#xD;
      FGFRs. In combination with its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), the&#xD;
      exploration of TKI258 for patients with recurrent GBM appears very promising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, safety and feasibility of TKI258 was demonstrated in adult patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid malignan-cies. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined and a recommended dose&#xD;
      for phase II trials was established. Meanwhile, TKI258 is in phase III development in renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, and in phase II devel-opment in advanced breast cancer, relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma and urothelial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the toxicity profile for compounds that could cross the BBB might be different in&#xD;
      patients with CNS diseases/disorders (e.g. brain tumors) compared to patients with&#xD;
      malignancies outside the CNS, we here propose a phase I trial exploring TKI258 in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study with a modified 3+3 dose finding design, a safe and tolerable dose of TKI258 in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed glioblastoma should be established.&#xD;
