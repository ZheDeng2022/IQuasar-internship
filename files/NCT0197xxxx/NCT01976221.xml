  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The referral letter is used for different purposes: a request for a special diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment or medical treatment that the GP cannot perform for the patient, an invitation to&#xD;
      have a second opinion about a clinical problem or a wish for mutual responsibility for the&#xD;
      medical handling. The individual referral rate between GPs varies greatly, and is an&#xD;
      important determinant of secondary care utilization. We wanted to study the various elements&#xD;
      and factors having an impact on the referral process, from the moment the GP decides to refer&#xD;
      the patient until the hospital consultant assess the referral and prioritise the patient for&#xD;
      further investigation or treatment. How and why are we, the GPs who refer, so different? We&#xD;
      wanted to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. identify and describe general practitioners' reflections on and attitudes to the&#xD;
           referral process and cooperation with hospital specialists&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. identify and describe hospital consultants' reflections on and attitudes to the referral&#xD;
           process and cooperation with general practitioners&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. identify typologies characterising GPs in the referral practice&#xD;

      Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We did two qualitative and one quantitative study. The first was a focus group study with GPs&#xD;
      in CPD groups, the second an individual study with hospital consultants, both analyses by&#xD;
      using systematic text condensation. The third was a quantitative registration of impressions,&#xD;
      facts and feelings in the referral process using a principal component analysis to find&#xD;
      typologies for GPs who refer to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GPs referring to Stavanger University Hospital. Hospital consultants at Stavanger University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;

      Intervention: No intervention was performed.&#xD;
