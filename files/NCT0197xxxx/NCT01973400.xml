  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that the tocotrienols have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects and that both&#xD;
      type 1 and type 2 diabetes can lead to peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment, the&#xD;
      present study aims to determine the beneficial effects of tocotrienols in ameliorating such&#xD;
      neurological related events in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy affects approximately 30-50% of all diabetic patients and is the commonest form of&#xD;
      neuropathy in the developed world. Pain is the most distressing symptom of neuropathy and the&#xD;
      main factor that prompts the patient to seek medical advice. About 16-26% of diabetes&#xD;
      patients experience chronic neuropathic pain. An animal study revealed that treating rats&#xD;
      with α-tocopherol and tocotrienol for 10 weeks significantly improved all the biochemical and&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes of alcohol-induced neuropathy in a dose-dependent manner with more potent&#xD;
      effects observed with tocotrienols. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of tocotrienols&#xD;
      in attenuation of alcoholic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive dysfunction is a less addressed and not as well recognized complication of&#xD;
      diabetes. Patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have been found to have cognitive&#xD;
      deficits that can be attributed to their disease. Both old age and diabetes are independently&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction; the risk is even greater for&#xD;
      older adults with diabetes. Cognitive Function is the term used to describe a person's state&#xD;
      of consciousness (alertness and orientation), memory, and attention span. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that Vitamin E, including tocopherols and tocotrienols, can help to improve&#xD;
      cognitive function and stall cognitive decline through its antioxidant effects. A reason for&#xD;
      this nutrient's success at preventing oxidative damage in brain cells is its fat-soluble&#xD;
      criteria. During the World Alzheimer's Congress held in July 2001, it was reported that high&#xD;
      intakes of vitamin E effectively lessened memory loss and cognitive dysfunction among more&#xD;
      than 6,000 elderly subjects who were generally taking Vitamin E between 200 to 400 IU per&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tocotrienols, in particular α-tocotrienol have been shown to possess neuroprotective effect&#xD;
      independent of anti-oxidant activity. Using cell-based studies, α-tocotrienol but not&#xD;
      α-tocopherol was shown to prevent glutamate-induced neuronal cell death at nanomolar&#xD;
      concentrations. Later studies showed that α-tocotrienol conferred protection against&#xD;
      glutamate and stroke-induced neurodegeneration in rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the above neuroprotective property of tocotrienols, researchers have proceeded to&#xD;
      demonstrate that tocotrienols supplementation helped to reverse neuropathic pain in diabetic&#xD;
      rats. It has been postulated the beneficial properties of tocotrienols are due to their&#xD;
      suppressive effects on the oxidative-nitrosative stress, inflammatory cytokine release and&#xD;
      caspase-3 which are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same year, tocotrienols were shown to prevent cognitive deficits and attenuate&#xD;
      alcoholic peripheral neuropathy associated with selective neuronal damage due to chronic&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Moreover, the beneficial effects were found to be more pronounced with&#xD;
      tocotrienols compared to tocopherols. It has been postulated that the anti-oxidants property&#xD;
      of tocotrienols, the suppression of nitrosative stress and elevated cytokines levels together&#xD;
      with acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain regions contributes significantly in&#xD;
      preventing the chronic alcohol-induced cognitive deficits in rats.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yuen and his group are currently conducting a clinical study in human subjects on&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects of tocotrienols (NCT00753532). In the study, subjects were followed&#xD;
      up for 2 years to determine the volume of white matter lesions on repeated MRI after&#xD;
      treatment with tocotrienol as compared to placebo. White matter lesions are related to&#xD;
      vascular events in the brain and represent subclinical infarcts, resulting in death/&#xD;
      degeneration of neurons and are positively correlated to cognitive impairment. Preliminary&#xD;
      results from an interim analysis are encouraging; patients on tocotrienols shown significant&#xD;
      reduction in volume of white matter lesion (confidential communication).&#xD;
