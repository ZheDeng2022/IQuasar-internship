      This is a longitudinal, observational, non-interventional registry study, designed to collect&#xD;
      both retrospective and prospective data, in order to acquire real-world data on product&#xD;
      prescribing, product use by patients, and product performance for patients receiving α1-PI&#xD;
      therapy in a homecare and/or a Coram ambulatory infusion suite. There is no limit on the&#xD;
      number of subjects that may participate in the registry. The AL1TER Registry will be overseen&#xD;
      by the Principal Investigator listed on the first page of this protocol. No less than 40&#xD;
      physicians in the US will participate in this registry; there will be no upper limit to this&#xD;
      number. All patients ≥18 years old, not members of a vulnerable study population, and who&#xD;
      require α1-PI therapy may be invited to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the AL1TER Registry will continue as long as the subject is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being treated with α1-PI therapy using Coram's infusion services, Using an insurance carrier&#xD;
      for which Coram is an approved provider, Willing to participate in this registry, and Until&#xD;
      the Sponsor, Principal Investigator or subject decides to terminate their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection for this study differs from other registries in that data going into the&#xD;
      AL1TER Registry is being collected by homecare agency personnel (i.e., pharmacists and&#xD;
      nurses). The data will be collected from standard Coram homecare forms. AL1TER Registry data&#xD;
      will be entered into Coram's standard patient database and processed in the same manner as&#xD;
      for non-registry patients but will be extracted in a systematic fashion for incorporation&#xD;
      into the AL1TER Registry. Data collected from the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire&#xD;
      (SGRQ), and the Life Quality index Questionnaire (LQIQ), and subject medical chart review may&#xD;
      also be entered into the AL1TER Registry database. All data will be de-identified for use&#xD;
      when reporting results of the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects participating in the AL1TER Registry will be informed about the Registry by the&#xD;
      submitting investigators, or their designee. Additionally with physician permission, registry&#xD;
      staff can contact patients via mail and phone to consent, only after patients have been&#xD;
      accepted on Coram's service and agreed to start therapy. Collection of subject data for&#xD;
      incorporation into the AL1TER Registry will begin only after the subject signs the informed&#xD;
      consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard visit/data collection already carried out by Coram, subjects will&#xD;
      also be asked to complete two short quality of life questionnaires every six months beginning&#xD;
      with 30 days after the date subject signs informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry study will continue until such time as the sponsor, Coram Clinical Trials,&#xD;
      makes the decision to terminate data collection. At such time all submitting investigators,&#xD;
      subjects and the IRB will be notified of study termination. Subject participation will begin&#xD;
      from the date they sign informed consent and will continue until the sponsor, Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, submitting investigator, or subject decides to terminate their participation or&#xD;
      the registry itself is terminated. The authorization by a subject for use of their Protected&#xD;
      Health Information (PHI) for the AL1TER Registry has no expiration date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AL1TER Registry involves compilation of the standard data collected for all patients&#xD;
      receiving α1-PI therapy within the Coram system; data collected from the SGRQ and LQIQI, and&#xD;
      relevant items from patient medical history, including pulmonary function tests. Since the&#xD;
      registry is both retrospective and prospective, forms from the start of the patients care,&#xD;
      through to the end of their care will be made available for entry into the registry, even&#xD;
      forms that predate the signing of the ICF. Sample forms of the standard data collected for&#xD;
      Coram patients are included in the appendices. The information that is captured for each&#xD;
      α1-PI patient using Coram's standard forms may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Start of Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information (contact, date of birth, height, weight, gender, tobacco/alcohol/drug&#xD;
      use) Age at time of development of symptoms, and age at time of diagnosis Medical/surgical&#xD;
      history Alpha-1 Genotype Baseline FEV1 value Therapy and safety review (diagnosis, therapy,&#xD;
      administration method, PICC length, date of insertion, etc.) Care plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing Patient Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information Changes in dosing Infections/illness Antibiotic use Primary care&#xD;
      physician visits Emergency room visits Hospitalizations Effects from infusions Other changes&#xD;
      in health Care plan update(s) Clinical monitoring (lab values, weight, nutrition screen, FEV1&#xD;
      values.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Visit Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient information Therapy information Medical history and medications (initial and ongoing)&#xD;
      Vital signs/weight Patient/home safety Access device for infusion therapy Nursing&#xD;
      interventions Assessments: respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary,&#xD;
      musculoskeletal, neurosensory, integumentary, endocrine, pain Medication administration&#xD;
