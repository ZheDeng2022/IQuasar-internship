      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and ability to stimulate&#xD;
      hGCC-specific antibody and killer T cell immune responses of an Ad5-hGCC-PADRE vaccine in&#xD;
      stage I and stage II Caucasian and African American colon cancer patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There is an unmet need for improved therapeutic paradigms in colorectal cancer, the 3rd&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer and 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. This need is&#xD;
      underscored by the populations in jeopardy, including the ~100 million people in the US over&#xD;
      50 y that have a 1:8 risk associated with a disease-specific mortality of 50%. Mortality&#xD;
      reflects metastatic disease: ~50% of patients initially present with regional or distant&#xD;
      metastases, while ~20% present with occult metastases. Beyond the general population risk,&#xD;
      there is an established stage-specific difference in outcomes in pN0 (node negative) African&#xD;
      Americans with colorectal cancer, who exhibit ~40% excess mortality attributable to race.&#xD;
      Reductions in mortality have been hampered by the absence of effective chemo-, radio-, and&#xD;
      immuno- therapeutic approaches to metastatic disease. In that context, immunotherapy has been&#xD;
      disappointing, in part, reflecting the absence of antigens that are tumor-specific,&#xD;
      immunogenic, and universally associated with neoplasia. Moreover, the gap in survival between&#xD;
      African Americans and Caucasians specifically reflects the inability to identify those with&#xD;
      occult metastases who are at increased risk for developing recurrent disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study advances an emerging paradigm in colorectal cancer cell detection and eradication,&#xD;
      employing GCC as a molecular marker and immunological target. GCC is a protein whose&#xD;
      expression is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial cells, but universally expressed&#xD;
      by metastatic colorectal tumors. We have clinically validated the detection of occult&#xD;
      metastases in lymph nodes by quantifying GCC mRNA (messenger RNA) by reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      (RT)-PCR (qRT-PCR). This study revealed that occult metastases were the most powerful&#xD;
      independent predictors of survival in pN0 patients. Further, there is a disproportionate&#xD;
      burden of occult disease in African American, compared to Caucasian, patients. This new&#xD;
      molecular staging platform provides a unique opportunity to identify occult metastases&#xD;
      underlying racial disparities in disease recurrence, which could be prevented by&#xD;
      tumor-targeted immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of ideal tumor antigens, immunotherapy has been directed to tissue-specific&#xD;
      proteins. Barriers to employing self-antigens include tolerance, which limits anti-tumor&#xD;
      immunity, and autoimmunity. The present study advances an emerging paradigm exploiting&#xD;
      immunological compartmentalization of mucosally-restricted antigens to generate systemic&#xD;
      antitumor immunity without autoimmunity. Asymmetry in immunological cross-talk between&#xD;
      compartments, wherein systemic T and B cell responses rarely extend to mucosae, suggest that&#xD;
      proteins normally expressed in mucosae, but which are expressed systemically by tumors, may&#xD;
      serve as vaccine targets for metastases. Advantages of these cancer mucosa antigens include&#xD;
      unique systemic immunoreactivity profiles supporting highly effective durable antitumor&#xD;
      immunity in the context of absent immunological cross-talk between compartments restricting&#xD;
      autoimmunity. Here, this paradigm will be advanced employing the tumor marker GCC, which&#xD;
      induces immune responses that oppose metastatic colorectal cancer in preclinical models,&#xD;
      without autoimmunity. This study will define the safety and immunological efficacy of&#xD;
      adenoviral GCC vaccine in African American and Caucasian pN0 colon cancer patients with&#xD;
      excess recurrence risk reflecting occult lymph node metastases identified by GCC qRT-PCR.&#xD;
      This study will be the first step in translating GCC into a vaccine for the secondary&#xD;
      prevention of metastases in African American and Caucasian colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
