  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label flexible-dose pilot study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      tolerability of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) in outpatient subjects diagnosed with Generalized&#xD;
      Anxiety Disorder (GAD) with or without comorbidities that are secondary to the GAD. Primary&#xD;
      trial objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) SNRI treatment 50 to&#xD;
      100 mg once daily in the treatment of GAD with or without comorbidities. Secondary trial&#xD;
      objective is to determine whether or not treatment outcome in GAD is related to changes in&#xD;
      cortical prefrontal activity of norepinephrine.&#xD;

    <description>At the screening visit those who are eligible will enter a randomized trial with Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) 50 to 100 mg. The study will begin with a single week of Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) 50mg. Subsequently, tablets will be administered in a flexible dose fashion and patients will be followed up weekly (biweekly after week 8) and at the investigators discretion. After the first week the patients' dosage will be increased up to a maximum of 100 mg daily. This dose will remain fixed after 8 weeks of treatment until week 16.</description>
