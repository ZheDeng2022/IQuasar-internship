      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin&#xD;
      treatment in the treatment of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream&#xD;
      infections (BSI) due to isolates with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC)&#xD;
      (i.e. &gt; or equal to 1.5 ug/ml) in terms of reducing all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary aim is to compare clinical failure rates of daptomycin treatment versus&#xD;
      vancomycin treatment and to compare time to microbiological clearance in patients treated&#xD;
      with daptomycin versus those treated with vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary hypothesis is that Daptomycin treatment is superior to vancomycin treatment in&#xD;
      reducing mortality from BSIs due to MRSA with high vancomycin MIC from 25% to 10%.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction/Clinical Significance Vancomycin is the standard first-line treatment for&#xD;
      methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. In recent years however, there&#xD;
      has been an increase in the number of MRSA isolates with high vancomycin minimum inhibitory&#xD;
      concentrations (MIC). Recent consensus guidelines recommend clinicians consider using&#xD;
      alternative agents such as daptomycin for MRSA infection when the vancomycin MIC is greater&#xD;
      than 1 ug/ml. To date however, there has been no head to head randomized trial comparing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of daptomycin and vancomycin in the treatment of blood stream infections&#xD;
      (BSIs) due to MRSA with high vancomycin MICs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is to compare the efficacy of daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin&#xD;
      treatment in the treatment of MRSA BSIs due to isolates with high vancomycin MICs (i.e. &gt; or&#xD;
      equal to 1.5 ug/mL) in terms of reducing all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary aim is to compare clinical failure rates of daptomycin treatment versus&#xD;
      vancomycin treatment and to compare time to microbiological clearance in patients treated&#xD;
      with daptomycin versus those treated with vancomycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daptomycin treatment is superior to vancomycin treatment in reducing mortality from BSIs due&#xD;
      to MRSA with high vancomycin MIC from 25% to 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology We will conduct a prospective open label randomized controlled phase 2B pilot&#xD;
      study in 3 major Singaporean hospitals, with balanced treatment assignments within each&#xD;
      hospital achieved by permuted block randomization. There will be 21 subjects per arm, with&#xD;
      the control arm receiving vancomycin and the experimental arm receiving daptomycin. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to compare the efficacy of daptomycin treatment versus vancomycin&#xD;
      treatment in the treatment of MRSA BSIs due to isolates with high vancomycin MICs (i.e. &gt; or&#xD;
      equal to 1.5 ug/mL) in terms of reducing all-cause mortality 60 days from positive index&#xD;
      blood culture. Secondary outcomes include rates of clinical failure, time to microbiological&#xD;
      clearance, and rates of nephro- and muscular toxicities in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pilot study proves our hypothesis that indeed , we aim to proceed with a larger scale&#xD;
      trial&#xD;
