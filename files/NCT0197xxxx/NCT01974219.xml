      In cigarette smokers that are HIV+, one of the most common HIV-associated non-AIDS conditions&#xD;
      is the accelerated development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disorder&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Based on the knowledge that COPD in&#xD;
      smokers starts in the small airway epithelium, this study is focused on examining the&#xD;
      hypothesis that the accelerated development of COPD associated with HIV infection results, in&#xD;
      part, from an interaction of HIV directly on the small airway epithelium or through infection&#xD;
      of cellular components of the immune system, with mediators released by these immune cells&#xD;
      evoking premature biologic aging of the small airway epithelium. By identifying the early&#xD;
      events in the pathogenesis of the HIV-associated accelerated COPD in smokers, we aim to&#xD;
      identify biologic targets to which pharmacologic therapies could be addressed.&#xD;

      While the epidemiologic data linking HIV infection to an increased risk for COPD is clear,&#xD;
      the pathogenesis of the accelerated development of COPD in HIV infected smokers is not&#xD;
      understood. We have focused on the SAE as the central target for the accelerated development&#xD;
      of COPD in HIV infected smokers, as there is extensive data pointing to the SAE as the&#xD;
      initial site of lung pathology in cigarette smokers and the small airways are the major site&#xD;
      of airflow obstruction in COPD. Further, the emphysema associated with COPD begins in alveoli&#xD;
      surrounding the SAE, and prior to the development of clinical evidence of lung disease, the&#xD;
      SAE of smokers exhibit marked disordered biology, including changes in DNA methylation and&#xD;
      gene expression, and disordered differentiation. Importantly, we have observed that HIV&#xD;
      infection &quot;ages&quot; the SAE, with exaggerated shortening of SAE telomeres in individuals&#xD;
      infected with HIV compared to HIV - smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that the early events in the pathogenesis of the accelerated development of COPD&#xD;
      in smokers with HIV infection results from the premature biologic aging of the small airway&#xD;
      epithelium (SAE) mediated by the effects of direct HIV infection of the SAE and/or through&#xD;
      the interaction of HIV-infected T cells and/or alveolar macrophages (AM) with the SAE,&#xD;
      resulting in the disordered biology of the SAE that is central to the pathogenesis of COPD.&#xD;
