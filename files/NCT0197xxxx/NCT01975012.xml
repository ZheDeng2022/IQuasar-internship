  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of tolerable and effective antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for use in children and&#xD;
      adolescents remains a high priority. First-line therapy with non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) has proven to be effective for HIV-1-infected infants,&#xD;
      children, and adolescents. This study will evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and dosing&#xD;
      levels of the NNRTI rilpivirine (RPV) when given with two other ARV drugs in treatment-naive,&#xD;
      HIV-1-infected children less than 12 years of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll HIV-1-infected children less than 12 years of age who are naive to&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) (have never taken ARV drugs). Study participants will be&#xD;
      assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on age. Cohort 1 will include children at least 6 years of&#xD;
      age to less than 12 years of age. Cohort 2 will include children at least 2 years of age to&#xD;
      less than 6 years of age. Each cohort will consist of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Stage&#xD;
      1 will be the initial dose finding stage. Participants will begin treatment with daily RPV&#xD;
      and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The 2 NRTIs will be selected by&#xD;
      the site investigator but will not be provided through the study. This stage of the study&#xD;
      will involve intense pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      antiviral activity of RPV, which will allow for the selection of an RPV dose to use in Stage&#xD;
      2 of the study. Participants in both cohorts will remain on RPV-based therapy for up to 48&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study enrollment will begin with Cohort 1. Once data from Cohort 1 has been reviewed and an&#xD;
      RPV dose has been approved, enrollment for Cohort 2 will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation will include at least 12 study visits over 48 weeks. Participants who&#xD;
      complete 48 weeks of RPV treatment and are benefiting from the drug will continue on the&#xD;
      study and receive RPV as part of a long-term safety follow-up for a minimum of 4 additional&#xD;
      years. Study visits in this stage of the study will occur every 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At most visits, participants will give a medical history and undergo a physical exam, blood&#xD;
      collection, and urine collection. At some visits, participants will also undergo an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test (consisting of&#xD;
      blood collection and an injection of ACTH), and determination of the participant's stage of&#xD;
      sexual development.&#xD;

             only, if their baseline VL does not meet the entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the judgment of the investigator, it is appropriate to initiate ARV therapy based&#xD;
             on the participant's medical condition and taking into account guidelines for the&#xD;
             treatment of HIV-1 infection in children&#xD;
