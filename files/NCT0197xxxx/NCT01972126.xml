      The MAGNetic QRS-Fragmentation in Patients with Myocardial InfarcTion and Moderately RedUceD&#xD;
      Ejection Fraction (MAGNITUDE) study will assess in MI survivors with moderately reduced left&#xD;
      ventricular function, whether non-invasive MFI QRS Fragmentation alone or in combination with&#xD;
      parameters derived from a Holter recording can be used to identify a group of patients at&#xD;
      high risk for SCD/life threatening ventricular arrhythmia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac disease is the most common cause of natural death in the Western hemisphere. Half of&#xD;
      cardiac deaths are sudden, arrhythmic. Myocardial infarction (MI) survivors have a four to&#xD;
      five-fold higher risk of SCD compared to persons without a history of MI. Current risk&#xD;
      assessment approaches fail to identify the majority of patients at risk of sudden, arrhythmic&#xD;
      death. Given these facts, this patient population represents a relevant proportion of the&#xD;
      total population at risk of developing sudden death and is currently not indicated for&#xD;
      preventive therapy. The post-MI population with moderate LV function, specifically with a&#xD;
      Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) between 35% and 50%, is therefore an appropriate&#xD;
      group in which to assess SCD prevention strategies. It has been shown that an increased QRS&#xD;
      fragmentation assessed by Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) correlates with a higher incidence of&#xD;
      arrhythmic deaths. MAGNITUDE is a prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational&#xD;
      cohort study, which will provide detailed information about event rates and MFI threshold for&#xD;
      the prediction of SCD/life threatening cardiac arrhythmic events. Target enrollment is 1000&#xD;
      patients, but enrollment may be extended until minimally 24 events are accrued (with a&#xD;
      maximum of 1500 patients). All patients will be followed until at least 12 months after&#xD;
      enrollment closure, but follow-up duration may be extended until minimally 40 events are&#xD;
      accrued. Interim analysis will be performed after 10, 20 and 30 events, and also after 40&#xD;
      events if this milestone is reached 6 months or more before end of follow-up. Final analysis&#xD;
      will be done at end of follow-up.&#xD;
