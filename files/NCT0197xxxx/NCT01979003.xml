  <brief_summary>

      To determine if Fluorescein systemic injection during hysterectomy procedure can be useful in&#xD;
      revealing the depth of endometrial cancer invasion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All research participants will receive fluorescein injection through their existing&#xD;
      intravenous line during their operative procedure for endometrial cancer staging. This will&#xD;
      consist of one ampule (5 cc) injected intravenously prior to ligation of the uterine&#xD;
      arteries. After the uterus is removed it will be sent to surgical pathology for evaluation as&#xD;
      per routine care. The pathologist will open the uterus and evaluate the endometrium. He or&#xD;
      she will then cut into the myometrium in an area most suspicious for invasion. The cross&#xD;
      section of the myometrium and endometrium will be photographed while exposed to a Woods lamp.&#xD;
      The normal myometrium will have a yellow fluorescent appearance under the Woods lamp. The&#xD;
      cancerous tissue will have minimal fluorescence. The measurement will be taken estimating the&#xD;
      depth of invasion of the cancer into the myometrium on the basis of its physical appearance&#xD;
      under the Woods lamp. Cross-sectioning of the uterus is routine procedure by pathology for&#xD;
      the intra-operative evaluation of endometrial cancer. This information routinely is provided&#xD;
      in order to determine if lymph node staging is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The area that was measured and photographed will then be prepared for a frozen section to&#xD;
      document depth of invasion. This is the standard procedure performed during an endometrial&#xD;
      staging. The depth of invasion on the frozen section will be recorded. This same area will&#xD;
      undergo histologic confirmation by permanent pathology to determine depth of invasion. The&#xD;
      frozen section is part of routine standard of care in evaluation of endometrial cancer.&#xD;
