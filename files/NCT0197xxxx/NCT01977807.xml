             cylinder between +0.5 D up to +4.0 D (not corneal astigmatism) and SE up to +6.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For all treatments with the Zyoptix algorithm, the high-order-aberration must be at&#xD;
             least 0.35µm.&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Myopic subjects must have up to -7.0 diopters (D) of absolute spherical myopia (not&#xD;
             spherical equivalent), with up to -4.0 D of refractive astigmatism (NOT corneal&#xD;
             astigmatism) by manifest subjective refraction. The spherical equivalent and must be&#xD;
             no more than -9.0 D.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hyperopic subjects must have up to +4 diopters (D) of absolute spherical hyperopia&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned&#xD;
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Hyperopic eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a&#xD;

             0.50 D in cylinder power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees&#xD;
             compared to the baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of&#xD;
             less than ±0.75 D, the differ-ence in cylinder axis would not be taken into&#xD;
             consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts,&#xD;
             which in the Investigator's opinion would interfere with best spectacle-corrected&#xD;
             visual acuity or a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with evidence of retinal vascular disease. Subjects with any residual,&#xD;
             recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal abnormality that in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion would interfere with BSCVA or a successful treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with signs of keratoconus or Subjects with unstable central keratometry&#xD;
             readings with irregular mires.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who had previous intraocular or corneal surgery of any kind, including any&#xD;
             type of Excimer laser surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have a history of Herpes simplex or Herpes zoster keratitis or history of&#xD;
             glaucoma or glaucoma suspect, corneal edema, or increased IOP &gt; 22mmHg or risk for&#xD;
             angle closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects immunocompromised or carrying diagnosis of connective tissue disease,&#xD;
             clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other acute&#xD;
             or chronic illnesses that will increase the risk to the subject or confound the&#xD;
             outcomes of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject taking systemic medications likely to affect wound healing such as&#xD;
             corticosteroids or antimetabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are known to be pregnant, lactating, or who plans to become pregnant over&#xD;
             the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with an ocular muscle disorder including a strabismus or nystagmus, or other&#xD;
             disorders affecting fixation.&#xD;
