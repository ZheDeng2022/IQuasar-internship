      This is an open label phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients who&#xD;
      have demonstrated safety and clinical benefit on the original ONT-10-001 phase 1 study.&#xD;

      Open label Phase 1b maintenance therapy study to evaluate the long-term safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, and anti-tumor effects of repeat-dose vaccination with ONT-10 in patients&#xD;
      with previously treated Stage 3 or 4 solid tumors with histologies that have been associated&#xD;
      with expression of the MUC1 antigen as described in the medical literature. Patients must&#xD;
      have previously been enrolled on the Phase 1 clinical trial ONT-10-001, completed all&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up through at least 12 weeks, experienced no dose limiting toxicity, and&#xD;
      experienced no progression of disease per the immune-related Response Criteria. Patients will&#xD;
      receive maintenance ONT-10 every 6 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  completed all treatment and follow-up through at least 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  experienced no dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  experienced no progression of disease per the irRC1&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients enrolling in the retreatment cohort may have experienced localized&#xD;
                  disease progression that was treated with definitive therapy to return the&#xD;
                  patient to a state of stable disease. Examples include localized disease&#xD;
                  progression treated with complete surgical resection, a solitary brain metastasis&#xD;
                  treated with complete surgical resection or curative intent stereotactic&#xD;
                  radiosurgery, or a solitary bone metastasis that is treated with curative-dose&#xD;
                  radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients enrolling on the retreatment cohort must have locally and systemically&#xD;
                  stable disease following the definite local treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Last received ONT-10 a maximum of 6 months (unless approved by the medical monitor)&#xD;

             hypogammaglobulinemia, or dysgammaglobulinemia; and/or other hereditary or congenital&#xD;
             immunodeficiencies&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy (except for low dose corticosteroids for&#xD;
