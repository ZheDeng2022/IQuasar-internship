    <textblock>
      Mycobacterium Vaccae for Injection (Trade Name &quot;Vaccae&quot;) is a kind of bio-products developed&#xD;
      by Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co.,Ltd.,and got &quot;The New Drug Certificate &quot;in&#xD;
      1999. Vaccae has been approved for adjuvant therapy of tuberculosis(TB), and is also the only&#xD;
      recommended drug in TB immunotherapy by WHO. It was approved for production and sale by Anhui&#xD;
      Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical Co.,Ltd. in 2001, and got favourable comment in therapy of&#xD;
      tuberculosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to add new indications for Vaccae, mainly to prevent&#xD;
      Tuberculosis for high risk groups of Tuberculosis Infection . In December 2012, China Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration approved of the plan &quot;Phase III Clinical Study of Efficacy and Safety&#xD;
      of Mycobacterium Vaccae to Prevent Tuberculosis in high risk groups of Tuberculosis&#xD;
      Infection&quot;. In the test, 10,000 cases whose skin tests of PPD are strongly positive are&#xD;
      enrolled. Using random, double-blind, and placebo-controlled methods, the study is carried&#xD;
      out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vaccae in preventing Tuberculosis. Meanwhile, in&#xD;
      this test, TB incidence and degree of pathological changes of experimental group are lower&#xD;
      than that of control group, and no drug-related SAEs are reported in treatment groups.&#xD;

      The Main Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Evaluation of efficacy of Vaccae to prevent Tuberculosis in high risk groups of&#xD;
      Tuberculosis Infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Purpose of the Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of Lesion Degree ( Bacteriology Indicators, Cavity) of patients and its&#xD;
           relationship with Skin Test results of TB-PPD after Injection of Vaccae into the high&#xD;
           risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of Changes in Humoral Immunity and Cellular Immunologic Response Before and&#xD;
           After Injection of Vaccae&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the test, TB incidence and degree of pathological changes of experimental group are lower&#xD;
      than that of control group, and no drug-related SAEs are reported in treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding and Random:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using random, double-blind, and placebo-controlled methods, evaluation of the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Vaccae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using block randomization method, a random sequence was generated by the statistics personnel&#xD;
      in Fourth Military Medical University Clinical Evaluation Center using SAS9.1.3 statistical&#xD;
      software&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Unblinding includes the first time of Unblinding and the second time of Unblinding. The&#xD;
      first time of Unblinding only distinguish groups , and the second time of Unblinding will&#xD;
      uncover the final Blind Codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Blind Codes of the design produce at one time, and unblinding will be carried out&#xD;
      respectively at the first year and the second year after the beginning of the experiment.&#xD;
