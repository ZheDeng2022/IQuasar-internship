    <textblock>
      The mechanism governing how blood flows from the heart to the lungs depends on many factors&#xD;
      including the pumping function of the right ventricle, properties of the arteries that carry&#xD;
      the blood from the right ventricle to the lungs (pulmonary arteries), and the lungs&#xD;
      themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Under normal conditions the pressure in the pulmonary arteries is well controlled and&#xD;
      significantly lower than in the systemic circulation, however there are a number of&#xD;
      conditions that lead to abnormally high pressures and significant morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However different patients respond differently to similarly elevated pressures, leading&#xD;
      doctors to believe that there must be differences in either the right ventricles, the&#xD;
      properties of the arteries, or the lungs themselves. It can be difficult to determine the&#xD;
      relative contributions of each of these factors on blood flow because their effects are&#xD;
      superimposed on each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One approach that has been used to look at this in other parts of the circulation (including&#xD;
      in the systemic circulation and the coronary arteries) is to measure simultaneous pressure&#xD;
      and flow, and apply a technique called wave intensity analysis (WIA). This technique can&#xD;
      amongst other things, quantify the separate effects of wave reflection and the 'reservoir&#xD;
      function' (or compliance) of the arteries, and in the systemic circulation WIA has increased&#xD;
      the understanding of the mechanisms behind hypertension and the physiological changes of&#xD;
      ageing. The pulmonary arteries are accepted to be very different from the systemic&#xD;
      circulation and the mechanisms behind pulmonary hypertension are thought to be very different&#xD;
      to those of systemic hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol aims to determine the major influences on blood flow in the pulmonary arteries&#xD;
      in health and disease, to help to understand why some patients are affected more than others&#xD;
      by elevated pulmonary pressures.&#xD;

      Purpose Currently best clinical practice for the investigation of pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      (raised pulmonary pressures) involves patients attending the catheter laboratory and&#xD;
      catheters being passed under fluoroscopic guidance via the femoral vein to measure right&#xD;
      heart pressures (and generally also via the femoral artery and aorta to measure left sided&#xD;
      pressures). Wave intensity analysis using simultaneous pressure and flow measurements gives&#xD;
      additional information about the upstream and downstream effects on haemodynamics, and we&#xD;
      propose will lead to a more detailed assessment of the influences both causing and&#xD;
      exacerbating pulmonary hypertension. Until recently it has not been possible to assess these&#xD;
      effects formally: the standard technique measures only local pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This protocol will involve passing catheters as per usual practice into the pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries and aorta. A Combiwire (a standard pressure and flow measurement wire which has been&#xD;
      available commercially and used worldwide for the past 5 years for making physiological&#xD;
      measurements in the coronary arteries) will then be advanced approximately 1cm beyond the end&#xD;
      of the catheter. Participants will have the usual clinical protocol of left and right heart&#xD;
      catheterisation (and coronary angiography if clinically indicated) and the simultaneous&#xD;
      pressure and flow measurements will be made in addition. Participants will also have&#xD;
      noninvasive imaging (echocardiography and, if clinically indicated, cardiac MRI) and serum&#xD;
      biochemical measures, as per usual clinical practice. They will also undergo cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      exercise testing to assess their lung and cardiac capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment The investigators will recruit patients with pulmonary hypertension from the&#xD;
      National Pulmonary Hypertension Service who are awaiting right and left heart catheterisation&#xD;
      studies as part of their routine diagnostic work up. Patients with normal pulmonary pressures&#xD;
      will be recruited from patients who are on the waiting list awaiting routine cardiac&#xD;
      catheterisation for the investigation of shortness of breath and chest pain. Recruitment will&#xD;
      involve a discussion with the patient and printed material that the patient can refer to.&#xD;
      They will be fully aware of the additional measurements being made, and no therapeutic&#xD;
      promises will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of Research Proposal Interventional cardiologists, pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      specialists, clinical scientists and basic scientists have been involved with the development&#xD;
      of this protocol. All members have been involved in critiquing the proposal. The&#xD;
      investigators have also consulted patients who have been involved in previous research&#xD;
      conducted during angiography regarding the number of hospital visits and additional time&#xD;
      required during the procedure for data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent All patients will be consented for the study by the research Fellow who will be a&#xD;
      Cardiology SpR (MBBS, MRCP) or Pulmonary Hypertension Specialist. She will be able to assess&#xD;
      capacity and understand the ethical principles underpinning informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, burdens and benefits The risk of using pressure and flow wires: The wires will be&#xD;
      advanced approximately 1cm outside the guide catheter that is used in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. In the pulmonary artery the wire will be positioned approximately 15cm more&#xD;
      proximal than where the balloon is inflated during conventional pulmonary capillary wedge&#xD;
      pressure measurement. In a recently published study of &gt;7000 patients undergoing right heart&#xD;
      catheterisation, there was only one incidence of pulmonary artery dissection. Damage to the&#xD;
      arteries will be minimised by using an experienced interventional cardiologist to perform the&#xD;
      procedures. The investigators have extensive knowledge in making these measurements resulting&#xD;
      in minimal risk to the patient. To date no patient has had an adverse event secondary to the&#xD;
      use of the pressure and flow wires in either the pulmonary arteries, aorta or coronary&#xD;
      arteries. A pilot safety and feasibility study in 23 patients undertaken at the Royal&#xD;
      Brompton Hospital in both normal subjects and those with pulmonary hypertension of various&#xD;
      aetiologies showed that measurements of pressure and flow using Combiwires in the pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries are possible in patients studied and there were no complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The Caldicott Principles for use of identifiable data will be used. In&#xD;
      accordance with University and NHS policy, to ensure satisfactory integrity both of research&#xD;
      data and confidential patient information, the procedural data will be stored in anonymised&#xD;
      form on a fully archived hard disk drive, with additional backup on long term optical storage&#xD;
      media, while patient identifiable data will be stored on computers located within the NHS&#xD;
      facility. Linkage between them will be in the form of paper records, which will be retained&#xD;
      within the NHS premises. If confidentiality needs to be broken we will seek advice from the&#xD;
      local ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conflict of Interest We have no conflict of interest. The patients involved in this study&#xD;
      will be informed via an information leaflet of the results and what they mean at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
