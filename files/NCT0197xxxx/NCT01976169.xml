      Standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with Trastuzumab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental:&#xD;
&#xD;
      21-Day Cycle of Combination therapy with T-DM1 intravenously on Day 1 and oral PD-0332991 on&#xD;
      Days 5-18&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1B inter-patient dose escalation study of PD-0332991 in combination with&#xD;
      T-DM1 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after prior&#xD;
      trastuzumab or other HER2-directed therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be administered T-DM1 by intravenous infusion at 3.6 mg/kg for 90 minutes&#xD;
      on day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Infusion timing may vary from 30-90 minutes depending on how&#xD;
      well the subject tolerates the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard 3+3 trial design will be used for PD-0332991 dose escalation cohorts.The dosing of&#xD;
      PD-0332991 will be divided into 3 cohorts, the subjects will receive PD-0332991 on days 5-18&#xD;
      of each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1 : PD-0332991 - 100 mg daily (oral) Cohort 2 : PD-0332991 - 150 mg daily (oral)&#xD;
      Cohort 3 : PD-0332991 - 200 mg daily (oral)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3+3 design entails that if one patient out of the first three patients has a DLT, up to&#xD;
      three additional patients will be entered at that dose level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment cycles will continue until disease progression or withdrawal from study.&#xD;

      This is a phase 1B inter-patient dose escalation study of PD-0332991 in combination with&#xD;
      T--DM1 in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after prior&#xD;
      trastuzumab or other HER2-directed therapies. A standard 3+3 trial design will be used for&#xD;
      PD-0332991 dose escalation cohorts. The 3+3 design entails that if one patient out of the&#xD;
      first three patients has a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), three additional patients will be&#xD;
      entered at that dose level. The PD-0332991 dose levels will start at 100 mg po daily; the&#xD;
      second cohort will receive 150mg po daily; the third cohort 200mg po daily. Patients receive&#xD;
      PD-0332991 on days 5-18 of each 21 day cycle. T-DM1 will be given intravenously at 3.6 mg/kg&#xD;
      on day 1 of each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE)&#xD;
      version 4.0 grading scale. Dose- limiting toxicity-DLT is defined as any drug-related grade 3&#xD;
      non-hematologic toxicity or grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting &gt;28 days after the last day&#xD;
      of therapy. If two patients experience drug-related DLT, the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for&#xD;
      the combination in HER2-positive breast cancer patients has been exceeded, enrollment to that&#xD;
      dose will stop, and the next lower dose will be designated the MTD. An additional 15 patients&#xD;
      will be treated at the MTD or the maximal 200mg po daily PD-0332991 dose in combination with&#xD;
      T-DM1 to confirm safety. Treatment cycles will continue until disease progression or&#xD;
      withdrawal from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study End-points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and assess Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the clinical response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate baseline HER2 positivity biomarkers by analyzing pretreatment tumor Ki67,&#xD;
           phospho-RB, cleaved caspase 3, phospho-histone H3, cycline E, MCM7, HER2, p27Kip1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate post-treatment Ki67, phospho-RB, cleaved caspase 3, phospho-histone H3,&#xD;
           cyclin E, MCM7, HER2, p27Kip1, Rb, p16ink4c, CDK4, CDK6 in order to establish biomarker&#xD;
           response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for PD-0332991 and T-DM1 including Cmax,&#xD;
           AUC, t1/2&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1.All subjects must be informed about the study and have signed a current IRB&#xD;
             (Institutional Review Board) approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All subjects must have recurrent or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.&#xD;
             diagnosed by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All subjects must have previously received trastuzumab or other HER2 targeted&#xD;
             therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4.Tumor must be HER2-positive and RB-proficient. RB (Retinoblastoma&#xD;
             protein)-proficiency is determined by tumor biopsy demonstrating RB normal and p16in4a&#xD;
             low by immunohistochemistry. RB proficiency means that there is an intact RB pathway&#xD;
             indicative of responsiveness to PD-0332991. RB staining is scored on an absent (no&#xD;
             nuclear staining), weak (nuclear staining less than observed in endothelial cells and&#xD;
             stromal cells surrounding the tumor), positive (nuclear staining at or above&#xD;
             surrounding tissue) (0, 0.5, 1 respectively). P16ink4a is a routine clinical stain&#xD;
             that is scored using absent, weak, positive, strong (0,1,2,3 respectively). Tumors&#xD;
             will be scored using [p16]/[RB], where a score of less than 3 is required for&#xD;
             inclusion. RB loss is expected to occur in less than 15% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Subjects must have a performance status of ≤ 2 on the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
             Oncology Group)Performance scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Subjects must have bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dl, transaminases &lt;2.5x upper limit of normal,&#xD;
             albumin &gt;3gm/dl, creatinine &lt;1.3mg/dl, adequate cardiac reserve (EF&gt;50%), ANC&#xD;
             (Absolute neutrophil count) &gt;1,000/mcL (microliter), and Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Must be willing to be treated at the University of Texas Southwestern Hospital,&#xD;
             University of Pennsylvania and affiliated clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Subjects must be willing to use an approved form of birth control while on this&#xD;
             study and for 90 days after completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Age &gt; 18 years. 10. Subject must be able to swallow capsules and have no surgical&#xD;
             or anatomic condition that will preclude the subject from swallowing and absorbing&#xD;
             oral medications on an ongoing basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormonal therapy within 3 weeks ( 6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas, mitomycin C or bevacizumab), or who have not recovered from the adverse&#xD;
             events to &lt; grade 2 due to previous agents administered more than 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             Study Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects less than 4 weeks post major surgery. 3. Known active CNS metastases or&#xD;
             carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with CNS (Central Nervous System) metastases&#xD;
             including brain metastases who have completed a course of radiotherapy are eligible&#xD;
             for the study provided they are clinically stable. However, oral corticosteroids for&#xD;
             control of CNS symptoms are not allowed.&#xD;
