  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment&#xD;
      safe? and 2) Is treatment effective in improving cardiac function and clinical outcomes?&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate in patients recovering from acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (&lt; 8 days after the index infarction) both the safety profile of&#xD;
      intramyocardial ASCs and the preliminary efficacy of ASCs therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized patient sponsored multi-center study of ASC&#xD;
      implantation using a catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's&#xD;
      adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen&#xD;
      for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for&#xD;
      delivery of the ASCs therapy.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a minimum myocardial wall thickness of 5mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Need or feasibility for re-vascularization has been ruled out by coronary angiogram or&#xD;
             noninvasive stress testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Up to date on all age and gender appropriate cancer screening per American Cancer&#xD;
