      Purpose of this study is to compare the astigmatic power of the toric IOL obtained from the&#xD;
      AcrySof toric calculator, TECNIS toric calculator, and iTrace toric calculator in a group of&#xD;
      patients with preoperative with-the-rule (WTR) and against-the-rule (ATR) corneal&#xD;
      astigmatism. The study included 100 eyes with cataract and greater than 0.75 diopter of&#xD;
      corneal astigmatism, and the subjects were divided into WTR and ATR group. Keratometric value&#xD;
      was measured using autokeratometry, IOLMaster partial coherence interferometry (PCI), iTrace&#xD;
      incorporating corneal topography and ray-tracing aberrometry. Based on measured values, toric&#xD;
      IOL power calculations were performed using AcrySof, TECNIS and iTrace toric calculators.&#xD;
