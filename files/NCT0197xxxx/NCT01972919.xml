  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for people who have pancreas cancer for which surgery is not&#xD;
      recommended. Potential patients must have already received several months of chemotherapy&#xD;
      before they are eligible for this study and there will not have been any detectable spread of&#xD;
      their tumor on imaging studies following this chemotherapy course.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to find out more about the efficacy of giving higher&#xD;
      doses of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy in controlling unresectable pancreas cancers&#xD;
      than are used in either the pre-operative or post-operative setting. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess acute and late side effects (problems and symptoms) of radiation therapy given at&#xD;
      these higher doses of radiation (dose escalated) following full dose chemotherapy given&#xD;
      before the radiation and with concurrent chemotherapy for pancreas cancer. Radiation therapy&#xD;
      is given in higher doses that are limited by the proximity of normal organs to the radiation&#xD;
      dose distribution to improve the likelihood of controlling the tumor in the pancreas while&#xD;
      minimizing the risk of radiation injury to these organs. There are two chemotherapy drugs,&#xD;
      Capecitabine is an oral drug taken twice per day on the same day that radiation therapy is&#xD;
      given and Gemcitabine is an intravenous drug given once per week, during radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Everyone in this study will have already received chemotherapy alone first. Everyone in this&#xD;
      study will receive radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
