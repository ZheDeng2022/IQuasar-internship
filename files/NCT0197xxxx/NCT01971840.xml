      Coordinated project whose objectives are: a) to assess the effectiveness of a physical&#xD;
      activity intervention (MOVI-KIDS) on preventing obesity and improving fitness during the&#xD;
      adiposity rebound period; and b) to examine the effectiveness of MOVI-KIDS on reducing the&#xD;
      carotid intima-media thickness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight in Spanish children in the puberty age is among the highest in&#xD;
      the world and increasing quickly. Our group has done so far two interventions based on&#xD;
      after-school programs of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in primary school children (8-to-11 years)in Cuenca, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first edition, called MOVI, showed moderate effect in reducing adiposity and improving&#xD;
      the lipid profile, but did not significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk, mainly&#xD;
      because of did not reduce blood insulin levels. A second edition (MOVI-2), increased duration&#xD;
      and intensity of the sessions and was more focused on increased muscle strength. Preliminary&#xD;
      analysis also show a decrease in body fat, a reduction of global cardiometabolic because of&#xD;
      decreased insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project integrates a multidimensional intervention to promote physical activity, with a&#xD;
      mixed design (cross-over randomized trial, and a qualitative study) and consist of two&#xD;
      sub-projects that share the same study population: &quot;Effectiveness of an intervention of&#xD;
      physical activity promotion in schoolchildren on preventing obesity during the adiposity&#xD;
      rebound period: a cross-over randomized cluster trial&quot; and &quot;Effectiveness of physical&#xD;
      activity intervention to prevent obesity and improve academic performance in children with&#xD;
      and without ADHD risk&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two interventions are based on a cross-over randomized trial aimed to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an intervention to promote physical activity in the school environment&#xD;
      (MOVI-KIDS) during two-years in 22 schools (20 public and two private schools) in the&#xD;
      provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This principal subproject consisted of a mixed study including both the trial cited above and&#xD;
      a nested qualitative study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to physical activity&#xD;
      in children in the school environment (social and family factors, urban planning, etc.), and&#xD;
      produce knowledge about the perceptions of children, parents and teachers on how you can&#xD;
      improve conditions of physical and social environment to facilitate physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this third edition are that a multidimensional intervention promoting&#xD;
      physical activity in children at the adiposity rebound period (4-7 years),in the school&#xD;
      environment (MOVI-KIDS), lasting two-years, will to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduce the body fat percentage in the intervention group versus the control group in 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve the several components of fitness: aerobic capacity, strength, speed and&#xD;
           agility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduce the carotid intima-media thickness and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Reduce fat, increase fat free mass, and reduce sedentary behavior.&#xD;
