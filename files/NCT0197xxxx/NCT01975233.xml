      An observational post-market, open label, multicenter Observatory. The decision to use a WEB&#xD;
      device to treat the patients has been made before and independently of the decision to&#xD;
      include the patient in the French Observatory.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened for Observatory eligibility after giving informed consent. The&#xD;
      embolization procedure will be performed in the digital angiographic suite using standard&#xD;
      angiographic techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial analysis of Observatory data will be performed at completion of 12 month follow-up&#xD;
      for the first thirty-five (35) subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed per Institution's standard of care.&#xD;
