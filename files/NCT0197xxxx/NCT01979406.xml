      The purpose of this study is to evaluate 2 vaccine candidates against anthrax compared to the&#xD;
      positive (vaccine) control as studied in normal healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, positive controlled, increasing dose clinical trial in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects at multiple sites. The study will assess safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      two adenovirus vaccine candidates against anthrax compared to the positive control, Anthrax&#xD;
      Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA). The trial will enroll 108 subjects in the anthrax vector vaccine arms&#xD;
      and 12 subjects in the AVA positive control subjects. The study will look at three different&#xD;
      dose of oral dosages of Ad4-PA (protective antigen) and Ad4-PA-GPI (10^9, 10^10, 10^11&#xD;
      vp/dose)as well as 3 vaccine administration schedules (1 and 15 days; 1 and 29 days; 1, 15,&#xD;
      and 29 days); 2 of 3 schedules will include an intramuscular (IM) AVA booster immunization, 1&#xD;
      schedule will include 3 vaccine administrations of Ad4-PA or Ad4-PA-GPI&#xD;
      (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) alone, and 1 schedule will include 3 vaccine administrations&#xD;
      of AVA alone.&#xD;
