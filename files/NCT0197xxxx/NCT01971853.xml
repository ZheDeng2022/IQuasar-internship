  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All healthcare providers strive continually to improve the outcome of their treatment&#xD;
      approaches. The investigators hypothesize that preventive analgesics administered before a&#xD;
      child is sedated with a Demerol-Vistaril regimen will improve the outcome of a sedation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To increase outcomes for patients receiving dental sedation by providing significant evidence&#xD;
      that the new regimen improves the quality of sedation and results in an improved post&#xD;
      sedation ability to eat, drink, resume normal activities and require less additional pain&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;
