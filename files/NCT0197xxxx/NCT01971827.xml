      Coordinated project whose objectives are: a) to test the effectiveness of a promotion of&#xD;
      physical activity intervention (MOVI-KIDS) on preventing obesity; and b) to improve the&#xD;
      academic performance in both children with and without attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight in Spanish children in the puberty age is among the highest in&#xD;
      the world and increasing quickly. Our group has done so far two interventions based on&#xD;
      after-school program of recreational physical activity to control obesity and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors in primary school children (8-to-11 years) in Cuenca.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention, in its first edition showed moderate effect in reducing adiposity and&#xD;
      improving the lipid profile, but did not significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      by not reduce blood insulin. In a second edition (MOVI-2), increased duration and intensity&#xD;
      of the sessions and worked over the development of muscle strength. Preliminary analysis also&#xD;
      show a decrease in body fat, a reduction of global cardiometabolic because of decreasing&#xD;
      insulin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project integrates a multidimensional intervention to promote physical activity, with a&#xD;
      mixed design (cross-over randomized trial, and a qualitative study) and two sub-projects&#xD;
      share the same study population, &quot;Effectiveness of an intervention of physical activity&#xD;
      promotion in schoolchildren on preventing obesity during the adiposity rebound period: a&#xD;
      cross-over randomized cluster trial&quot; and &quot;Effectiveness of physical activity intervention to&#xD;
      prevent obesity and improve academic performance in children with and without ADHD risk&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two interventions are based on cross-over randomized trial to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an intervention to promote physical activity in the school environment (MOVI-KIDS), two-year&#xD;
      in 22 schools (20 public and two private schools) in the provinces of Cuenca and Ciudad Real,&#xD;
      Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This subproject (subproject-2) will assess the effectiveness of the intervention of the&#xD;
      MOVI-KIDS Program in improving attention and cognition in students at risk for ADHD.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this project will evaluate the effectiveness of MOVI-KIDS Program in improving&#xD;
      motor skills and academic achievement in the overall sample, and the impact that changes in&#xD;
      the year have on the amount of physical activity that the students in the sample performed&#xD;
      during recess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses of this third edition are that a multidimensional intervention promoting&#xD;
      physical activity in children at the adiposity rebound period (4-7 years),in the school&#xD;
      environment (MOVI-KIDS), lasting two-years, will to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduce body fat percentage in the intervention group versus the control group in 2% in&#xD;
           children adiposity rebound age (4-7 years),&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve academic performance and motor skills in children with and without attention&#xD;
           deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Reduce adiposity and sedentary time, improve academic performance, quality of life and&#xD;
           the duration and quality of sleep in children with and without ADHD.&#xD;

Body fat percentage is estimated with an eight-electrode BC-418 MA bioimpedance analysis system (Tanita Corp. Tokyo, Japan) using the mean of two readings made under controlled temperature and humidity conditions.</description>

    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>It will assess the different basic psychological processes involved in learning (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention, and perception) by using the Differential Aptitude Battery-BADyG-I General scale for children aged 3-6 years (Yuste C, 2008) and the E1 BADY scale for children 6-to-8 years old (Yuste C, 2008). Both scales include a) global academic predictors (eg general intelligence), b) non-verbal tests (eg reasoning and logical puzzle figures), c) verbal tests (eg numerical quantitative concepts), and d) additional tests (eg auditory perception).</description>

    <measure>Motor skills</measure>
    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>Motor Skills will be assessed by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children - Second Edition [Movement Assessment Battery for Children 2 (M-ABC 2)]. This battery has been validated to identify and describe deficiencies in motor performance in children and adolescents aged 3-to-16 years old. It consists of eight tests for each age group (3-6, 7-10, and 11-16) measuring three dimensions: manual skills, throws and catches and equilibrium (static and dynamic). Children can score between 0 and 5 in each of the tests. The total score is obtained as the sum of the scores of all tests (range 0-40). A lower score indicates better motor performance. It allows classifying: children with motor problems, children with motor risk and children with normal motor development</description>

    <description>Quality of life related to health: Kiddy-KINDL, this questionnaire has been validated in Castilian version for children ages 4-7 and parents (Rajmil L, 2004). The KINDL is a generic HRQOL instrument for children and adolescents developed in Germany for use both in clinical practice and in healthy children. Kiddy-KINDL questionnaire contains 12 questions (with 3 response options; range of 1-3, where 1 = never, 2 = sometimes and 3 = many times) in six dimensions: physical, emotional, self-esteem, family, friends and school. The children's version will be administered by interview, and parents will be self-administered version.</description>

    <time_frame>One year (interim analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>It will be assessed by using the Spanish version of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire ( CSHQ ) ( Owens JA . 2000 ) completed by parents. The CSHQ is focused on common sleep disorders for children 4-to-10 years old. The questionnaire allows parents indicate on each item if they consider sleep habits are a problem for their child. It will also four questions about the time to go to bed, wake up, get up , and total number of hours of sleep. Finally, latency, amount, duration of sleep and number of awakenings will also be measured by accelerometer in the subsample of 200 schoolchildren. During a week, children will completed a sleep diary.</description>
