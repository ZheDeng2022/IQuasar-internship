  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to use music and movement (MWM) to reduce anxiety and behavioral symptoms&#xD;
      of people with early dementia (PWD) and their family carers in the community. It also aims to&#xD;
      examine whether MWM can enhance the sleep quality of PWD and their family caregivers and&#xD;
      promote their well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed methods study with the quantitative paradigm being the main research&#xD;
      approached used. The quantitative arm will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The&#xD;
      qualitative arm will adopt a naturalistic approach through interviewing for data collection.&#xD;
      Recruited subjects from the community centres of non-government organizations (NGOs) will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to the intervention and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures of the PWD will include Rating Anxiety in Dementia (RAID), Geriatric&#xD;
      Depression Scale (GDS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Pittsburgh Sleep&#xD;
      Quality Index (PQSI), Quality of Life - Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD), Mini-Mental State&#xD;
      Examination (MMSE), Revised Life Event Scale (RLES), Modified Brathel Index (MBI) and&#xD;
      Non-pharmacological Therapy Experience Scale (NPTES), whereas the outcome measures of the&#xD;
      family caregivers will be Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Zarit Burden Scale (ZBD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Reverse&#xD;
      Life event Scale (RLES), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the research questions, data will be collected at baseline (T0), immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention at 8-weeks (T1), and 8 post-intervention (T2). The qualitative arm of this&#xD;
      study will contribute to the understanding of issues and effects of MWM as an intervention.&#xD;
      Its finding will complement the results obtained from the RCT.&#xD;
