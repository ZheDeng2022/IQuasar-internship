  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate what the body does to single doses of Sativex (i.e. the pharmacokinetics [PKs]&#xD;
      of four sprays containing 10.8 mg Δ9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and 10 mg cannabidiol [CBD])&#xD;
      when mild, moderate or severe oral mucositis is induced. This will be done by looking at the&#xD;
      effects of the body on the drug before and after oral mucositis is induced. The study&#xD;
      participants will have Non-surgical Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC), and oral&#xD;
      mucositis will be induced with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy.&#xD;
