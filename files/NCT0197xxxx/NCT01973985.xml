  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusion is an extremely common problem with multiple causes; its subsequent&#xD;
      investigation with thoracocentesis and treatment with drainage represent two of the most&#xD;
      frequently performed diagnostic and therapeutic medical procedures. The role of thoracic&#xD;
      ultrasonography in the management of pleural effusion is a modern and rapidly expanding one,&#xD;
      having become effectively mandatory and part of the &quot;gold standard&quot; over the past decade due&#xD;
      to its diagnostic and patient safety benefits. By contrast, the measurement of intra-pleural&#xD;
      pressure using sequential manometry has failed to convincingly demonstrate its clinical value&#xD;
      beyond physiological studies despite its availability for over a century. Previous work has&#xD;
      shown a potential role for pleural manometry in predicting the presence of un-expandable lung&#xD;
      and success of talc pleurodesis but these studies have not been replicated or clinically&#xD;
      validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to combine the old and new in an observational study comparing findings on thoracic&#xD;
      ultrasonography and pleural manometry during thoracocentesis with patient-reported symptoms&#xD;
      and the key clinical outcomes of presence of un-expandable lung and success of talc&#xD;
      pleurodesis. The investigators hypothesise that the previously described variations in&#xD;
      pleural elastance can be correlated with appearances and anatomical changes visualised on&#xD;
      thoracic ultrasonography; and in combination can be reliably utilised to predict clinical&#xD;
      outcome. The study may allow the proposal of a treatment algorithm that allows patients with&#xD;
      pleural effusion to be managed in a more expeditious and efficient manner.&#xD;

      Study-specific interventions will be the monitoring of intrapleural pressure using an&#xD;
      electronic pleural manometer (Mirador Biomedical CompassTM Thoracentesis Assist Device) and&#xD;
      thoracic ultrasonography. Both of these are considered non-invasive and low-risk to the study&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of their standard usual clinical care, participants will undergo a diagnostic and/or&#xD;
      therapeutic pleural intervention in the form of thoracocentesis or pleural aspiration;&#xD;
      intercostal chest drain insertion; and/or talc pleurodesis. All of these procedures are&#xD;
      invasive and associated with potential complications that participants will be informed about&#xD;
      as part of standard informed consent procedures. These interventions will however be&#xD;
      clinically indicated and carried out whether or not an individual chooses to participate in&#xD;
      this study. For those individuals who do participate in the study, any complications of these&#xD;
      standard clinical care procedures will be recorded as part of the data collection process for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
