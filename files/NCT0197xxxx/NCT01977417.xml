  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes, characterized by elevated fasting blood sugar or exaggerated blood sugar&#xD;
      response to sugar ingestion, effects over 79 million adult Americans and is a precursor to&#xD;
      the development of Type 2 diabetes. Importantly, approximately 42% of Iowans (950,000) have&#xD;
      diabetes and 32% (670,000) have prediabetes with the majority of those with prediabetes going&#xD;
      undiagnosed. Adults with prediabetes demonstrate early signs of cardiovascular and nervous&#xD;
      system abnormalities and are at high risk for developing overt diabetes unless aggressive&#xD;
      lifestyle (weight loss, exercise) or pharmacological interventions are employed.&#xD;
      Interestingly, data in recent years has linked obesity and diabetes to chronic inflammation&#xD;
      of the blood vessels and brain areas that regulate blood pressure. Therefore, the current&#xD;
      study will test whether a commonly used aspirin-like anti-inflammatory drug called salsalate,&#xD;
      will improve blood vessel health and nervous system dysfunction in adults with prediabetes.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will have measurements of blood pressure, blood vessel function in the arms&#xD;
      and eyes, assessments of nerve activity, and blood samples taken before and after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      ingesting an FDA approved aspirin-like drug called salsalate. The study is important because&#xD;
      it will identify a potentially new pharmacological strategy to treat vascular and nervous&#xD;
      system abnormalities in overweight and obese adults with early stage type 2 diabetes using an&#xD;
      inexpensive, generically available drug with an excellent safety record that has been used&#xD;
      for decades to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. If proven&#xD;
      effective, this will provide preliminary support for the concept of targeting inflammation as&#xD;
      a new clinical approach to treating early diabetes related complications. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      current pilot study will provide support for developing a larger clinical trial using&#xD;
      salsalate that could potentially then be extended to patients with type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, as well as lead to the development of new anti-inflammatory agents&#xD;
      with greater specificity for selective inflammatory pathways.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30 healthy men and women ages 18-79 years who are obese defined as body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater and with prediabetes (defined as fasting blood glucose between&#xD;
      100-126 mg/dl, a fasting blood glucose of 140-199 mg/dl at 120 min during an oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test; or HbA1C of 6-6.5%) will be enrolled and randomized to 4-5 weeks of salsalate&#xD;
      or placebo in the study. CONTROL GROUP: Another n=10 healthy obese men and women age 18-49&#xD;
      WITHOUT prediabetes will be enrolled for baseline testing but will not undergo randomization&#xD;
      to the salsalate/placebo intervention. Therefore, total enrollment will be n=40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have no history of cardiovascular, metabolic or pulmonary disease as&#xD;
      determined from medical history and physical exam, and a resting 12-lead ECG. Subjects may be&#xD;
      on anti-hypertensive medications but will be asked to hold the medication on the morning of&#xD;
      testing. Subjects on medications for Type I or II diabetes mellitus or for hyperlipidemia&#xD;
      will be excluded (see complete list below). Subjects will be non-smokers or quit smoking at&#xD;
      least one year ago. Women will have regular menses and will be tested during the early&#xD;
      follicular phase of their menstrual cycle (within 8 days of onset of menses) to control for&#xD;
      differences in circulating estradiol concentrations. Aim 1 will measure microvascular&#xD;
      function and aortic wall stiffness in obese prediabetic adults before and after 1 month of&#xD;
      salsalate or placebo. Hypothesis 1 is that chronic inflammation inhibition will improve&#xD;
      microvascular and large elastic artery function in obese adults with prediabetes. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      measure muscle sympathetic nervous system activity (MSNA) and baroreflex sensitivity in obese&#xD;
      prediabetic adults before and after 1 month of salsalate or placebo. Hypothesis 2 is that&#xD;
      chronic inflammation inhibition will decrease MSNA and improve baroreflex sensitivity in&#xD;
      obese adults with prediabetes.&#xD;
