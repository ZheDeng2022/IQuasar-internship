    <textblock>
      RV1162 is a new medicine being developed for possible treatment of smoking related lung&#xD;
      disease (also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - COPD). The main purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single and&#xD;
      repeat doses of RV1162.&#xD;
