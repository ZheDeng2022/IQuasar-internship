      Recruiting, retaining and gathering complete data on participants in research projects, be&#xD;
      they patients or health professionals, can be extremely difficult. These problems increase&#xD;
      the risk that research will be abandoned before its true value is appreciated, or lead to&#xD;
      delays in resolving uncertainty for decision makers, while further studies are done. Poor&#xD;
      recruitment, retention and outcome collection frequently lead to many prospective studies&#xD;
      being extended, increasing costs. Researchers need to use strategies that are themselves&#xD;
      evidence-based. This study proposes to link with an existing longitudinal ageing study called&#xD;
      NICOLA to provide evidence on what research participants prefer in relation to providing&#xD;
      personal information through a self-completed questionnaire. NICOLA is a large study of&#xD;
      people over the age of 50 that is being conducted in Northern Ireland. NICOLA is aiming to&#xD;
      recruit 8500 people and will ask them questions about participation in social activities,&#xD;
      including organised structured and informal activities; relationship quality; loneliness;&#xD;
      stress; resilience; quality of life; alcohol intake; food poverty and assess their health and&#xD;
      wellbeing. Participants in NICOLA agree to having an interviewer visit them at home to ask&#xD;
      questions about their lives, complete questionnaires in their own time and attend a health&#xD;
      assessment appointment. They also agree to being followed up over a course of at least 10&#xD;
      years. The research described here will examine the impact of differing times and formats of&#xD;
      a self assessment questionnaire on completion rates, specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of being given a questionnaire during a face to face interview with&#xD;
           a researcher compared to receiving it by post&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the potential impact of interview fatigue on completion rates&#xD;

      The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) is an opportunity&#xD;
      to conduct methodology research relevant to many features of a large prospective study.&#xD;
      NICOLA will begin in earnest in Northern Ireland in 2013 and is being conducted by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team in the Centre for Public Health at Queen's University Belfast. It is&#xD;
      an omnibus programme of research on ageing that will continue for at least 10 years and will&#xD;
      recruit 8500 middle-aged people in Northern Ireland and follow them into old age, providing a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of their physical and mental health, their lifestyles, and their&#xD;
      social and economic decision making. NICOLA will look at how they perceive disability and&#xD;
      health, and how this differs between well-off and disadvantaged groups. NICOLA will also&#xD;
      study various genetic, biological and psychological factors, including how participants&#xD;
      perceive risk and value their time, and the effect of this on their retirement behaviour&#xD;
      (including how they manage their money and their health). People over the age of 50 will be&#xD;
      invited to take part and asked to complete detailed interviews and questionnaires every 2&#xD;
      years and health assessments every 4 years. In this randomised trial, we will assess the&#xD;
      effect of given them the self-assessment questionnaire at different time points, and on paper&#xD;
      or online.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort and other studies with longitudinal designs often struggle to maintain their recruited&#xD;
      participants across all the study time points and to obtain complete data. The problems&#xD;
      reduce the effective sample size quality of the evidence and robustness of the findings, and&#xD;
      can undermine the often substantial investment in such studies. Researchers are devoting&#xD;
      increasing amounts of time and resources to understand how participants decide to take part&#xD;
      in research and what researchers can do to make their work appeal to potential participants.&#xD;
      We will explore some of these issues within NICOLA and, to our knowledge, no similar work has&#xD;
      been conducted solely within an over 50 population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Establishing rapport with the participants has been mentioned as another method to increase&#xD;
      response rate and we will explore this by examining whether receiving a questionnaire in a&#xD;
      face-to-face exchange increases the likelihood of completion - a topic that was not addressed&#xD;
      in the aforementioned systematic review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our randomised comparison of online versus paper questionnaires will gauge the interest in&#xD;
      online methods among the over 50s, and the effects of the different modes on completion and&#xD;
      completeness. Embedding this research at the beginning of a large cohort study allows the&#xD;
      opportunity to test different methodologies to discover what works best at with regards to&#xD;
      the delivery of questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this research is to examine the impact of differing times and formats of a&#xD;
      self assessment questionnaire on completion rates. Specific objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessing the effect of being given a questionnaire during a face to face interview with&#xD;
           a researcher compared to receiving it by post&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploring the potential impact of interview fatigue on completion rates&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study is a randomised trial of different timings and methods of offering a&#xD;
      self-completion questionnaire. It will be embedded in an ongoing cohort study. All&#xD;
      participants who complete the CAPI (Computer Assisted Personal Interview) will be invited to&#xD;
      fill in a self-completion (paper) questionnaire whose contents will include measures of:&#xD;
      participation in social activities, including organised structured and informal activities;&#xD;
      relationship quality (partners/relatives/friends); loneliness; perceived stress; resilience;&#xD;
      quality of life; alcohol intake and a measure of food poverty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants have agreed to take part in the study, they will be randomised into one of&#xD;
      two different trial arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Receive a paper based questionnaire immediately after their CAPI, handed to them by&#xD;
           their Interviewer&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Receive a paper based questionnaire in the post approximately one week after their CAPI&#xD;
           interview&#xD;
