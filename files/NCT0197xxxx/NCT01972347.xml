      This is an open label, single centre, phase II study of neoadjuvant drug treatment with&#xD;
      dabrafenib + trametinib in patients with resectable American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
      Stage IIIB-C BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to find out if giving of a new combined drug treatment to&#xD;
      patients with melanoma that has spread to the lymph nodes BEFORE they have surgery, will&#xD;
      result in improved clinical and pathological response of the melanoma tissue after 12 weeks&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy has been demonstrated to improve outcome in the management of patients of&#xD;
      multiple different solid tumours. The advantage of a neoadjuvant therapy in melanoma is that&#xD;
      it provides in vivo assessment of tumour responsiveness to systemic therapy, potentially&#xD;
      eradicates micrometastatic disease, and may improve the surgical result. It also provides an&#xD;
      opportunity to obtain tumour samples before and after treatment to study variation of&#xD;
      response and effects of treatment on tumour characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study explores pathological response rates, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) response rates and biomarkers for a 12-week duration of neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      with combined MAP kinase inhibition (MAPKi) with dabrafenib and trametinib and to establish&#xD;
      guidelines for an expanded Phase II or III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarker component of this study will compare pre-treatment (PRE) with day 4-7, 'early&#xD;
      during treatment' biopsies (EDT) and 12 week lymphadenectomy samples (POST). The tissue will&#xD;
      be interrogated for immunologic, proteomic and genetic (RNA and DNA) features and changes in&#xD;
      tissue and blood. The baseline PRE specimen will consist of at least two core, excisional or&#xD;
      incisional biopsies taken prior to commencing combined dabrafenib and trametinib. The EDT&#xD;
      specimen will consist of at least two core, excisional or incisional biopsies taken at days&#xD;
      4-7, very early after commencing combined dabrafenib and trametinib. The POST specimen will&#xD;
      be the complete lymph node dissection specimen performed after 12 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      combined dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EDT specimen provides a unique opportunity to investigate the early changes that occur in&#xD;
      a melanoma tumour with MAPK inhibitors that may set up for later resistance or complete&#xD;
      response, and that may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation. For example, EDT samples&#xD;
      collected on patients treated with single agent BRAF inhibitors showed increased T cell&#xD;
      infiltrate that was associated with a better response in the lesion. The T cell infiltrate&#xD;
      has also been associated with increased expression of melanoma antigens, a decrease in&#xD;
      immunosuppressive cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8] and an increase in markers of&#xD;
      T-cell cytotoxicity. Additional studies have shown the expected suppression in pERK, and in&#xD;
      paired PRE-EDT samples, the decreased ERK suppression is associated with a better RECIST&#xD;
      response. There have been no reports of the effects of BRAF and MEK inhibitors as single&#xD;
      agent or in combination on responding melanoma tissue taken more than 15 days after&#xD;
      commencement of treatment. As the median PFS for the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
      is 9.4 months, &gt;95% of the POST samples will be responding, and provide an opportunity to 1)&#xD;
      compare the responding POST with the EDT sample (and the baseline PRE samples prior to&#xD;
      treatment) to investigate how signalling pathways (as determined by RNA gene expression and&#xD;
      protein expression) alter with time, and 2) how the changes in signalling pathways correlate&#xD;
      with clinical and pathological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued as adjuvant therapy. The goal is to improve the cure rate&#xD;
      after surgery through eradication of occult micrometastatic disease. Notable successes have&#xD;
      been achieved in oncology when highly effective therapies were available for advanced stage&#xD;
      disease (e.g., breast cancer, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, embryonal tumours,&#xD;
      osteosarcoma). High-risk, resected BRAF V600 mutation positive melanoma represents another&#xD;
      attractive setting for testing this paradigm since: 1) the population is at high risk for&#xD;
      relapse and death without further therapy and 2) the BRAF/MAP-ERK kinase combination is&#xD;
      highly effective in the metastatic setting and can be targeted to the population most likely&#xD;
      to benefit. The study design will test the efficacy of study treatment in both the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for the first time in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 168 patients have received combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib&#xD;
      at the proposed study doses (150 mg BID dabrafenib and 2 mg once daily trametinib) with a&#xD;
      median follow-up time of 12.8 months. In the dose-escalation phase, PFS was longest for the&#xD;
      group receiving the highest doses of dabrafenib and trametinib with an acceptable safety&#xD;
      profile. Based on these data the combination of 150 mg BID of dabrafenib and 2.0 mg once&#xD;
      daily of trametinib has been selected for this study. Mature randomized phase 2 trial (Part C&#xD;
      in Figure 2 above) with a median follow up of 14.1 months showed a higher response rate (76%&#xD;
      versus 54%, p=0.03) and a longer median PFS (9.4 months vs 5.8 months, hazard ratio (HR)&#xD;
      0.39, p&lt;0.001) in MAPK inhibitor-naïve patients on the combination of the full dose of&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib compared with dabrafenib monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of therapy (12 months) is based upon expert consensus and does not exceed that&#xD;
      administered in other pivotal studies of adjuvant treatment in similar populations where&#xD;
      treatment ranged from 12 to 60 months. In the absence of a reliable biomarker for minimal&#xD;
      residual disease, empiric dosing for durations much shorter than the predicted median relapse&#xD;
      free interval (median of 15 months) may increase the risk of treatment failure. The design&#xD;
      does include predictive biomarkers which may allow further refinement of dosing once a phase&#xD;
      III study of this design has been completed. Safety of continuous dosing of dabrafenib and&#xD;
      trametinib for over a year as monotherapies has been established along with preliminary&#xD;
      safety of combination dosing for a similar interval. Safety precautions will include clear&#xD;
      guidelines for management of toxicity, including enhanced surveillance for adverse events of&#xD;
      special interest along with instructions for dose modification. The inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will also serve to minimize participation of those at greatest risk for known or&#xD;
      suspected toxicities of the combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neoadjuvant studies in patients with macroscopic stage III melanoma have been performed using&#xD;
      the immunotherapies interferon and ipilimumab. Interferon has no activity in stage IV&#xD;
      melanoma, yet there was an objective clinical response in 11 of 17 (55%) patients with stage&#xD;
      III melanoma when given neoadjuvantly. Furthermore, 3/17 (15%) had a complete pathological&#xD;
      response. Clinical responders had significantly greater increases in endotumoral CD11c and&#xD;
      CD3 cells and significantly greater decreases in endotumoral CD83 cells compared with&#xD;
      nonresponders. In contrast, ipilimumab confers an overall survival benefit for patients with&#xD;
      stage IV melanoma over vaccine or chemotherapy, however the objective response rate is low at&#xD;
      11-15%. In the neoadjuvant study with macroscopic stage III melanoma, pathological responses&#xD;
      were not reported, however objective clinical responses were observed in 3/29 (10%) patients.&#xD;
      Immune infiltrate cells were noted in most tumours after treatment with ipilimumab, and&#xD;
      results correlating biomarker changes with response are awaited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In stage IV melanoma patients, over 73% of patients who respond to BRAF inhibitors, will&#xD;
      achieve a RECIST response by the time of the first scan (8 weeks), and the median time to&#xD;
      best response is 12 weeks in the poorest prognosis patients. The progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) for the combination is 9.4 months, and &lt;5% of patients have progression as their best&#xD;
      RECIST response. Therefore, 12 weeks was chosen for the period of neoadjuvant combination&#xD;
      therapy to optimise tumour shrinkage, without compromising patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons at the Melanoma Institute Australia perform approximately 120 lymphadenectomies each&#xD;
      year for patients with palpable lymphadenopathy. The sample size of 35 patients is achievable&#xD;
      within the anticipated 12 to 18 month recruitment phase. Neoadjuvant therapy with combined&#xD;
      dabrafenib + trametinib for these high-risk melanoma patients with bulky regional stage&#xD;
      IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result in improved rates and duration of local control with&#xD;
      reduced surgical morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyrexia Sub-Study Combined therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib is associated with pyrexia&#xD;
      in over two-thirds of patients. There are no identifiable clinical correlates of pyrexia and&#xD;
      the mechanism remains unknown. Management involves the use of corticosteroids in 25% of&#xD;
      cases. Further investigations of this drug-associated pyrexia are urgently required,&#xD;
      particularly for facilitating the use of these drugs in the adjuvant setting. The context of&#xD;
      this single institution study with its close and uniform patient monitoring provides an ideal&#xD;
      opportunity to study drug-induced pyrexia, its mechanisms, prevention and management, and&#xD;
      correlation of pyrexia with parent drug and metabolite plasma levels compared with those who&#xD;
      do not develop pyrexia.&#xD;
