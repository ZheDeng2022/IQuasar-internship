  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve rectal cancer management, there is a need for better visualization of drug targets&#xD;
      in rectal cancer to identify patients who might benefit from specific targeted treatments.&#xD;
      Molecular imaging of rectal cancer associated targets is a promising technique to accommodate&#xD;
      this need. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), which is differentially expressed in&#xD;
      normal versus malignant colon tissue, has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging.&#xD;
      Fluorescent labeling of bevacizumab (a VEGF targeting humanized monoclonal antibody currently&#xD;
      used in anti-cancer therapy) using IRDye800CW (a fluorescent dye) has potential advantages in&#xD;
      view of safety, infrastructure, costs, stability and imaging resolution. Therefore, the&#xD;
      fluorescent tracer bevacizumab-IRDye800CW has been developed at the University Medical Center&#xD;
      Groningen (UMCG) and was recently approved to be administered to patients in a tracer dose.&#xD;
      To detect this tracer in vivo in patients with colorectal cancer, a newly developed flexible&#xD;
      near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence endoscope and optoacoustic endoscope have been developed&#xD;
      which can be used in clinical studies. Optical fluorescence imaging may support response&#xD;
      evaluation following chemoradiotherapy and give insight which patient might benefit from&#xD;
      anti-VEGF targeted therapy in future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective, single center feasibility study, patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced rectal cancer who are included in the RAPIDO study (NL36315.042.11)&#xD;
      will undergo two times epi-illumination endoscopy (in other words flexible NIR fluorescence&#xD;
      endoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of a total of five study procedure related visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1: During a screening visit, eligibility will be evaluated and patient&#xD;
           characteristics will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2: During the second visit 4.5 mg of bevacizumab-IRDye800CW will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously. The patient will then be observed for 1 hour post administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3: First endoscopy will be performed at baseline (two days after tracer&#xD;
           administration); before the start of chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4: After chemoradiotherapy patients will receive a second dose of 4.5 mg of&#xD;
           bevacizumab-IRDye800CW (second tracer administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5: A second flexible NIR fluorescence endoscopy procedure will be performed&#xD;
           (two-three days after the second tracer injection), preferably right before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optionally and when available, we will ask patients if they would like to undergo&#xD;
      optoacoustic endoscopy. This is a form of endoscopic ultrasound which is able to detect&#xD;
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW up to 2 cm in depth. The procedure is comparable with NIR fluorescence&#xD;
      endoscopy. If patients agree, after removal of the NIR fluorescence endoscope the&#xD;
      optoacoustic endoscope will be introduced in the rectum of the patient for detection of&#xD;
      bevacizumab-IRDye800CW in deeper areas of the tumor.&#xD;
