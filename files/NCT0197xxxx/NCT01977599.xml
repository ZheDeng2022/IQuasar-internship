  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is the single most common cancer, and the third leading cause of cancer cancer&#xD;
      deaths, in the United Kingdom. Breast screening is able to detect breast cancer in the early&#xD;
      stages of development, during which time it is more easily treatable. Unfortunately, many&#xD;
      patients do not attend screening, and surveys issued to these women consistently report&#xD;
      &quot;forgetfulness&quot; as the primary reason for missing the appointment. Both telephone reminders&#xD;
      and postal reminders have been shown to reduce non-attendance, however, these are time&#xD;
      consuming and expensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobile telephones are becoming an increasingly popular tool for communication between&#xD;
      healthcare professionals and patients, one which might offer an inexpensive solution for&#xD;
      delivering reminders. Text message reminders have been able to prevent missed appointments in&#xD;
      other areas of healthcare, and the same might be true for breast screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a trial to confirm whether this is the case or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators will send some women a text message to reminder them of&#xD;
      their appointment, and other women no reminder for their appointment. The investigators will&#xD;
      then compare the number of women in each group that went to their breast screening&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the single most common cancer in the United Kingdom, accounting for 16% of&#xD;
      all cancer incidences and 7% of all cancer deaths. Fortunately, the natural progression of&#xD;
      this malignancy can be beneficially changed through mammographic screening techniques, which&#xD;
      enable early detection and treatment of benign and malignant breast disease. However, the&#xD;
      success of screening programmes depends not only on the analytical specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity of the screening test itself, but also its ability to attract the &quot;at risk&quot;&#xD;
      population. In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme&#xD;
      attracts about three quarters of the invited population every three years. In the last&#xD;
      screening round (2007-2010), all but one region reported a triennial coverage of more than&#xD;
      75%; London was the exception, reporting a regional coverage of 69%. London consistently&#xD;
      fails to meet the national target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missed appointments are a primary cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery, with adverse&#xD;
      clinical implications for the non-attending patient, and substantial monetary costs to the&#xD;
      health service. To ensure the future success of the breast screening programme it is&#xD;
      imperative that strategies for improving uptake of hard to reach populations be developed.&#xD;
      Research has demonstrated that receiving an appointment reminder by text message has been&#xD;
      successful in improving uptake in other areas of healthcare; the same might be true for&#xD;
      breast screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim: To establish whether text message reminders can significantly improve the uptake&#xD;
      of breast screening by women on an &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; basis in the London Borough of&#xD;
      Hillingdon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: To evaluate whether text message reminders are an effective intervention for&#xD;
      improving uptake of the breast screening programme by hard to reach patients such as women&#xD;
      living in deprived areas, and those of Black and Minority ethnic backgrounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A single blind randomised controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness,&#xD;
      efficacy, and acceptability of sending a text message appointment reminder to prevalent women&#xD;
      (women aged 47-53 years) living in the London Borough of Hillingdon 48 hours prior to their&#xD;
      first breast screening appointment. 2,239 women without a history of breast screening,&#xD;
      implant, or bilateral mastectomy were included in the study and randomly assigned in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to either the control group (n= 1,118) or the intervention group (n= 1,121). Women in&#xD;
      the control group were invited to screening but received no reminder for their appointment,&#xD;
      whilst women in the intervention group received a text message reminder 48 hours in advance.&#xD;
      All women received an information letter about the study with their invitation from the West&#xD;
      of London Breast Screening Service, which included a patient &quot;opt-out&quot; request form. Patients&#xD;
      were not told whether they would be receiving a text message reminder or not. iPlato Patient&#xD;
      Care Messaging was used to deliver the text-message reminders.&#xD;
