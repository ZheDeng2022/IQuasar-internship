    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to a.) evaluate whether early serum infliximab levels are predictive&#xD;
      of avoidance of colectomy, b) evaluate whether serum albumin levels correlate with serum&#xD;
      infliximab levels, and c) evaluate whether serum tumor necrosis factor levels are inversely&#xD;
      correlated with serum infliximab levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients hospitalized for severe ulcerative colitis and treated with high-dose infliximab,&#xD;
      we predict that early serum infliximab levels (24, 48, and 72 hour) will be positively&#xD;
      associated with clinical response and avoidance of colectomy.&#xD;

      The American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) recommends infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody to human tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) who don't achieve adequate clinical response despite treatment with&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Infliximab is an FDA approved therapy for ulcerative colitis based on&#xD;
      two large randomized trials, ACT I and ACT II. For patients who respond to induction therapy,&#xD;
      scheduled maintenance therapy has been demonstrated to be both durable and safe. However,&#xD;
      these trials did not include hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe flares, or fulminant ulcerative colitis, remain highly morbid and potentially fatal&#xD;
      presentations of disease. Traditionally, hospitalized patients who failed high-dose&#xD;
      intravenous corticosteroid therapy require life-saving colectomy. Although the advent of&#xD;
      infliximab has presented an alternative rescue therapy, some patients with severe ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis are non-responders to anti-TNF induction therapy and proceed to colectomy. In the ACT&#xD;
      I and II trials, outpatients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis were randomized to&#xD;
      placebo, 5mg/kg infliximab therapy, or 10mg/kg infliximab therapy. At 54 week follow-up,&#xD;
      patients receiving infliximab had a 41% reduced risk of colectomy compared to the placebo&#xD;
      group. Although infliximab at 5mg/kg was associated with a reduced risk of colectomy, only&#xD;
      the 10mg/kg infliximab dosing yielded a statistically significant risk reduction. There were&#xD;
      no differences in safety between the 5mg/kg and 10mg/kg infliximab groups; similar rates of&#xD;
      serious adverse events, infections, and infusion reactions were reported. Thus, at our&#xD;
      institution (University of California at San Francisco), it is our standard of care to&#xD;
      administer infliximab at 10mg/kg IV for patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation from 5mg/kg to 10mg/kg is routinely prescribed to recapture clinical response&#xD;
      in subsets of patients with inflammatory bowel disease who experience loss of response during&#xD;
      maintenance therapy and is supported in the FDA label for Crohn's disease. Loss of response&#xD;
      to infliximab maintenance therapy is a well-recognized phenomenon, and there is abundant&#xD;
      literature suggesting that durable and efficacious infliximab therapy is dependent upon&#xD;
      optimizing serum infliximab levels. Specifically, high serum infliximab trough levels predict&#xD;
      clinical response, but low serum trough levels and presence of infliximab antibodies are&#xD;
      associated with loss of response. However, serum infliximab levels are not dependent upon&#xD;
      drug dose and pharmacokinetics alone. Concurrent immunomodulator use may reduce&#xD;
      immunogenicity against monoclonal antibody therapies, and more recently, there has been&#xD;
      increased recognition of the importance of patient factors as well. Specifically, variability&#xD;
      in drug metabolism and clearance has been associated with body-mass index, sex, and severity&#xD;
      of inflammation - as measured by C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and tumor necrosis factor&#xD;
      alpha levels. It has been demonstrated that patients with higher serum albumin levels&#xD;
      maintain higher infliximab concentrations, lower clearance, and longer drug half-lives than&#xD;
      patients with lower serum albumin levels; and low serum albumin correlates with poorer&#xD;
      clinical response. Severe colonic disease is associated with higher early fecal infliximab&#xD;
      concentration, which is inversely associated with serum infliximab levels and response to&#xD;
      therapy. Moreover, high serum tumor necrosis factor alpha levels prior to infliximab infusion&#xD;
      predict poorer clinical outcomes and need for dose escalation in patients with Crohn's&#xD;
      disease and rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis can least afford suboptimal infliximab&#xD;
      therapy, but are at highest risk given their malnutrition and uncontrolled inflammation.&#xD;
      There is a growing trend towards the use of high dose of infliximab as the first line therapy&#xD;
      in these severe, hospitalized patients as they have just one infusion (dose) to demonstrate&#xD;
      clinical response before they are referred for colectomy. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data to support this practice. There is only a small body of literature that&#xD;
      serum infliximab trough levels may predict clinical outcomes in acute ulcerative colitis. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, there are no studies regarding the use of early infliximab levels - within the&#xD;
      first 72 hours - to predict clinical response in the vulnerable subset of patients&#xD;
      hospitalized for severe ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a pilot study investigating the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis with&#xD;
      high-dose infliximab (10mg/kg infusions), which is the standard of care at UCSF for severe,&#xD;
      hospitalized ulcerative colitis. This will be a prospective, multi-site study which will&#xD;
      consecutively enroll hospitalized ulcerative colitis patients meeting inclusion criteria from&#xD;
      anyone of four UCSF-affiliated hospitals. Per routine care, enrolled subjects will undergo&#xD;
      infectious work-up, receive intravenous corticosteroids in addition to supportive care, and&#xD;
      undergo evaluation by a Colorectal Surgeon. Subjects that are eligible for anti-TNF therapy&#xD;
      after routine screening will begin infliximab induction therapy on hospital day 3 at 10mg/kg.&#xD;
      We will perform standardized pre- and post-treatment assessments of disease activity&#xD;
      (Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index - UCDAI), including acquisition of biochemical and&#xD;
      endoscopic data. We will measure serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha, infliximab, and&#xD;
      infliximab antibody throughout the course of treatment. The primary outcome will be avoidance&#xD;
      of colectomy. This study will be the first to our knowledge to examine the empiric use of&#xD;
      high-dose infliximab combined with early therapeutic drug monitoring to guide the care of&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with severe ulcerative colitis. Our ultimate goal is to develop a&#xD;
      rational approach to maximizing infliximab therapy in the setting of severe ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis to minimize and predict primary non-response to infliximab induction therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from drawing infliximab and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, all other procedures&#xD;
      and treatments provided to these patients are part of routine care for the patient with&#xD;
      severe ulcerative colitis. Routine care of the patient hospitalized with severe ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis is summarized in the following protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On hospital days 1-2, hospitalized patients with severe ulcerative colitis undergo diagnostic&#xD;
      evaluation including bloodwork (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte&#xD;
      sedimentation rate, and serum albumin), infectious work-up (Clostridium difficile, stool&#xD;
      cultures, stool ova and parasites, cytomegalovirus), and standardized assessment of disease&#xD;
      activity (flexible sigmoidoscopy and calculation of UCDAI score). Patients are started on&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy (Solumedrol 40mg intravenous daily), and screened for eligibility for&#xD;
      anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy (hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B core antibody,&#xD;
      hepatitis B surface antigen, tuberculin skin test, Quantiferon gold test, and chest&#xD;
      radiograph). The Quantiferon gold tests are ordered for inpatients. Intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
      are given therapeutically in the event of documented infection or clinical toxicity, but not&#xD;
      prophylactically administered. Subcutaneous heparin is administered for deep vein thrombosis&#xD;
      prophylaxis per standard of care. On hospital day 3, a positive or negative response to&#xD;
      intravenous corticosteroids is determined prior to initiation of high-dose infliximab.&#xD;
      Responders to medical therapy continue with an infliximab induction regimen (week 0, 2, and 6&#xD;
      infusions). After completing the induction regimen, patients undergo repeat flexible&#xD;
      sigmoidoscopy and calculation of UCDAI score at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible study subjects will receive their first induction dose of infliximab (10mg/kg&#xD;
      intravenous infusion) on hospital day 3. A pre-infusion tumor necrosis factor alpha level and&#xD;
      an immediate post-infusion serum infliximab will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On hospital day 4, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 24 hour serum infliximab level&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On hospital day 5, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 48 hour serum infliximab level&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On hospital day 6, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a 72 hour serum infliximab level&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week after initial infusion, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a serum infliximab&#xD;
      level will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two weeks after initial infusion, a serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and a serum infliximab&#xD;
      level will be measured.&#xD;
