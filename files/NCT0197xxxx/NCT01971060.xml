      Premenopausal Women ages 18-42 will undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy. Prior to the&#xD;
      myomectomy, adhesions will be assessed using a modified AFS scoring technique. All&#xD;
      investigators will provide usual and customary care to research subjects during the first&#xD;
      look laparoscopy. This includes the use of all standard practice anti-adhesive agents and&#xD;
      heparinized irrigation fluids.V-Loc 180 suture will be utilized in all patients. All patients&#xD;
      will then be evaluated by means of a second look laparoscopy (SLL) 6-12 weeks after the&#xD;
      initial surgery and reevaluated via modified American Fertility Society scoring techniques.&#xD;
      An independent reviewer will also score adhesions utilize a video recording made from the&#xD;
      second look laparoscopic surgery. Patients will be contacted both 1 and 4 weeks post -op and&#xD;
      assessed for complications. It is the expectation that patients will show no greater&#xD;
      post-operative adhesion formation and a &lt;1% complication rate. Time and ease of suturing will&#xD;
      also be evaluated. It is expected that the V-Loc suturing technique will show significantly&#xD;
      reduced suturing time, be easier to use, and will be associated with minimal adhesions.&#xD;

      This is a post-market, controlled, single-center study to evaluate V-Loc suture. 10 subjects&#xD;
      will be included in this study. Premenopausal women ages 18-42 will undergo a laparoscopic&#xD;
      myomectomy. Adhesion scoring will be done prior to the myomectomy using a modified American&#xD;
      Fertility Society scoring technique. V-loc 180 suture will be utilized in all patients for&#xD;
      closure of all uterine defects. All patients will then be evaluated by means of a second look&#xD;
      laparoscopy (SLL) 6-12 weeks after the initial surgery and evaluated via modified American&#xD;
      Fertility Society scoring techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent reviewer will also score adhesions utilizing video recordings made from the&#xD;
      second look laparoscopic surgery , using the same scoring techniques employed by the PI..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo routine preoperative blood tests in accordance with the Primary&#xD;
      Investigators' usual standard of practice. All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be considered. Patients will be consented prior to entry into the operating room. Surgical&#xD;
      time will be measured from start of procedure, start of myomectomy, and start and finish time&#xD;
      of each individual uterine closure. All investigators will provide usual and customary care&#xD;
      to research subjects during the first look laparoscopy. This includes the use of all standard&#xD;
      practice anti-adhesive agents and heparinized irrigation fluids&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Physicians will be surveyed on ease of use and any problems that occur with V-Loc suture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated with post-operative antibiotics per the Primary Investigator's&#xD;
      usual standard of care. Patients will be contacted both one and 4 weeks post surgery and&#xD;
      evaluated for complications using a phone survey for pain and bowel functioning. The patient&#xD;
      will also have a standard post operative exam with the physician 4-6 weeks post-operatively.&#xD;
      A second look laparoscopy will be performed 6-12 weeks following the initial myomectomy.&#xD;
      Adhesions will be evaluated using a modified American Fertility Society evaluation tool. Any&#xD;
      adhesions seen at the time of SLL will be treated using the physician's preferred method of&#xD;
      adhesiolysis. A recording will be obtained of the second look laparoscopy and will be&#xD;
      reviewed and scored by an independent reviewer as to the level of adhesions seen .&#xD;
