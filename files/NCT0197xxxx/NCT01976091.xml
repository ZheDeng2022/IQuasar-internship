      Dose escalation study of self-complementary (sc) AAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA delivered to single leg&#xD;
      (low dose n=2) and bilaterally (n=6) via a major lower limb artery to the whole lower limb of&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial is a dose escalation study of self-complementary&#xD;
      scAAVrh74.tMCK.hSGCA to LGMD2D (alpha-sarcoglycan deficient) subjects delivered via a major&#xD;
      lower limb artery of each leg sequentially by isolated limb perfusion (ILP). Three cohorts&#xD;
      (Cohorts 1A, 1B, and 2) will undergo gene transfer in a dose escalation scheme to establish&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using toxicity. Two (n=2) adult wheelchair-dependent patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled in Cohort 1A and three (n =3) ambulatory subjects will be enrolled in Cohort&#xD;
      1B. Three (n =3) ambulatory subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2. The first cohort (1A) will&#xD;
      receive a dose of 1E12 vg/kg in a single limb with delivery to the whole limb. This same dose&#xD;
      will be delivered to both limbs in Cohort 1B. Cohort 2 will receive a total dose escalation&#xD;
      of 3E12vg/kg per limb delivered to both extremities. The vector will be infused into an&#xD;
      indwelling catheter in the femoral artery. This will be a one-time vector infusion to an&#xD;
      isolated limb with a 10-minute dwell time. The total vector genome dose for each subject will&#xD;
      be adjusted by rounding down to the closest 10 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring during infusion will include: activated clotting times, limb gases, real&#xD;
      time monitoring of arterial and venous access pressures, and perfusate temperature. Safety&#xD;
      endpoints will be assessed by changes in hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, immunologic&#xD;
      response to rAAVrh74 and hSGCA, and reported history and observations of symptoms. Efficacy&#xD;
      will be measured by the six minute walk test as well as direct muscle testing for strength&#xD;
      (MVICT) of lower limb muscles. These quantitative measures will be done at baseline, day 30,&#xD;
      60, 90, 180, and at the end of 1st and 2nd years. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline,&#xD;
      infusion visit (days 0-2), and return for follow up visits on days 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and&#xD;
      180. On Day 180, subjects will undergo a muscle biopsy on the injected muscles in one leg to&#xD;
      compare with the pre-treatment biopsy done at baseline screening in the opposite leg to&#xD;
      establish the size of muscle fibers and any potential toxicity from gene transfer.&#xD;
