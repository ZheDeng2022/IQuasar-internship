      Cardiac resynchronization therapy may reduce central sleep apnea, but there is no prospective&#xD;
      randomized study so far demonstrating such an effect in patients with conventional pacemaker&#xD;
      undergoing upgrading to CRT because of heart failure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the last decade cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been proven to be an&#xD;
      effective therapy to reduce morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure patients with&#xD;
      wide QRS complex, in particular complete left bundle branch block. New indications have&#xD;
      recently been established, including patients with mild symptoms and patients in need of&#xD;
      conventional pacing such as high-grade atrioventricular block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than half - up to 80% - of patients with heart failure suffer from concomitant sleep&#xD;
      apnea (SA), which further worsens symptoms and prognosis. Cardiac resynchronization therapy&#xD;
      may ameliorate sleep apnea, but only the central form of sleep apnea (CSA). However, only&#xD;
      very small uncontrolled studies with mainly less than 20 patients have been reported so far&#xD;
      concerning the interactions between CRT and sleep apnea, and no data are available in&#xD;
      patients with conventional right ventricular pacing undergoing upgrading to CRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we want to perform a study called UPGRADE which is characterized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  being the first randomized study comparing the effects of new-onset cardiac&#xD;
           resynchronization therapy on moderate and severe central sleep apnea, defined by an AHI&#xD;
           ≥ 15/h as assessed by polysomnography in patients with conventional right ventricular&#xD;
           pacing which is known to decrease cardiac function, induce heart failure and atrial&#xD;
           fibrillation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  using a new technology called AP Scan® which enables continuous and reliable monitoring&#xD;
           of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB); this technology is further validated with&#xD;
           polysomnography, the gold standard in the diagnosis and follow-up in patients with sleep&#xD;
           apnea&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, one third of patients still do not benefit from CRT (so-called&#xD;
      non-responders). On the other hand, up to 20% of patients greatly benefit and completely&#xD;
      recover in terms of normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction and/or functional&#xD;
      capacity (so-called super-responders). Research is urgently needed to decrease the number of&#xD;
      non-responders and increase the number of super-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection is still based on QRS duration and its morphology. Echocardiography and&#xD;
      other imaging techniques for mechanical dyssynchrony assessment have failed to be a useful&#xD;
      predictor for adequate patient selection. Therefore, we further want to test whether CRT&#xD;
      itself does not only improve concomitant sleep apnea, but also if preexisting sleep apnea&#xD;
      predicts the response to CRT in patients with previously conventional right-ventricular&#xD;
      pacing undergoing an upgrade to CRT by additional implantation of a left ventricular lead.&#xD;
