      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).&#xD;
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs treat HIV infection. They generally decrease&#xD;
      the amount of HIV virus in the blood (called viral load) to very low levels. This happens&#xD;
      only if the drugs still fight HIV and if taken every day exactly as prescribed. When not&#xD;
      taken as directed, or if the ART drugs are not strong enough, the virus can become resistant&#xD;
      to them, and the ART will not work to control the virus. Researchers want to know how to&#xD;
      control HIV in people who can t lower their viral load with their current ART drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -&lt;TAB&gt;To better control HIV in people who can t get a lower viral load even with ART drugs&#xD;
      and to learn more about why the HIV is not under control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People at least 18 years old and with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People who have been on at least two combinations of ART drugs (including current ART).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  People whose last two viral loads were greater than 1,000 copies/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then have a baseline visit. They will have another physical exam,&#xD;
           blood tests, plus answer questions about what they know about HIV and ART, and how they&#xD;
           take their ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will arrange to stay in the NIH hospital for 7 8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  They will take their medications as usual. At the time to take the ART drugs, they will&#xD;
           have to ask a nurse to bring them. If they forget, the nurse will bring them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will meet with a doctor, pharmacist, social worker and nurse to discuss&#xD;
           ways to help participants remember to take their drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have blood drawn about every other day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will study the test results. Some participants will be put on different ART&#xD;
           drugs. If that happens, participants will have another NIH hospital stay for 7-8 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 4 follow-up visits over 12 weeks, then every 3 months for 2 years&#xD;
           or more.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved survival in individuals&#xD;
      with human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) infection. Despite recent development of more&#xD;
      potent regimens with fewer toxicities and lower pill burden, there remains a subpopulation of&#xD;
      subjects who fail to achieve and maintain viral suppression while on treatment. Factors known&#xD;
      to contribute to virologic failure include suboptimal adherence, drug resistance, suboptimal&#xD;
      regimen potency, sequential introduction of single drugs to a failing regimen, and reduced&#xD;
      ART exposure due to impaired drug absorption or pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a natural history protocol with intensive observation intended to characterize and&#xD;
      manage HIV-infected subjects who have documented virologic failure on their current regimen&#xD;
      and who have experienced virologic failure in meeting one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented virologic failure on at least 1 prior ART regimen and at least 2 consecutive&#xD;
           HIV RNA plasma measurements of &gt;1,000 copies/mL, including the last documented value,&#xD;
           while on the current prescribed ART regimen for at least 6 months; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented extensive resistance to at least 3 ARV drug classes, and has persistent&#xD;
           plasma viremia (HIV RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL for &gt; 6 months) despite multiple regimen&#xD;
           changes, regardless of how long the subject has been prescribed his or her current&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that, for a large proportion of the subjects enrolled in this protocol,&#xD;
      nonadherence, with or without drug resistance, is the most common reason for the virologic&#xD;
      failure. Another objective for the study is to assess the impact of a 7-day, inpatient,&#xD;
      selfguided directly observed therapy (DOT) on HIV RNA kinetics, when subjects will receive&#xD;
      their pre-enrollment ART regimens. During the DOT period, subjects will request their&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs at a pre-arranged time reflecting their home medication schedule.&#xD;
      Failure to do so will be recorded and the medications will then be provided by the nursing&#xD;
      staff. Adherence and psychosocial assessments will also be performed. Plasma concentrations&#xD;
      from at least one of the antiretroviral drugs in the regimen will be measured on the first&#xD;
      and last day of DOT to determine if suboptimal drug plasma concentration was a contributing&#xD;
      factor to virologic failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within approximately 2 weeks, but no later than 4 weeks, after DOT (post-DOT phase), the&#xD;
      research team will review the results from the HIV-1 viral load kinetics, current and&#xD;
      cumulative genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance tests, ART history and responses, and other&#xD;
      identified factors that could have contributed to the treatment failure (such as concomitant&#xD;
      medications, history of antiretroviral AEs, and psychosocial barriers). The team will then&#xD;
      design a new, individualized treatment plan for each subject. Subjects will either continue&#xD;
      on their pre-enrollment ART regimen, or they will receive a new, individually tailored&#xD;
      regimen. Only FDA-approved therapeutic agents will be offered on this protocol. Subjects may&#xD;
      be co-enrolled in an experimental protocol for optimal management of HIV disease, if one is&#xD;
      available and eligibility criteria are met. New regimens will be monitored during a second&#xD;
      7-day, inpatient, self-guided DOT. Subjects will be followed after the DOT at week 2&#xD;
      (plus/minus 3 working days), 4 (plus/minus 3 working days), 8 (plus/minus 7 days), and 12&#xD;
      (plus/minus 7 days), and then every 3 months (plus/minus 2 weeks) for up to 2 years, with the&#xD;
      option of extending participation longer if necessary. The same treatment plan may be&#xD;
      repeated if a subject fails to respond to a new regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a select group of subjects who fail to achieve viral suppression, advanced HIV-1 variant&#xD;
      analysis may be used to attempt to identify the presence of minority drug resistant variants.&#xD;
      This analysis will be used as supplemental information to construct new regimens for this&#xD;
      group of subjects. Samples of plasma, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be&#xD;
      stored for further evaluation of virologic evolution and other factors that may be&#xD;
      contributing to treatment failure in this population.&#xD;
