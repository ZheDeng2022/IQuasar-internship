      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and immune response to three different sets&#xD;
      of HIV vaccines in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to&#xD;
      three different HIV-1 prime-boost vaccine regimens in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults. The&#xD;
      regimens will differ by the type of HIV-1 envelope insert (Nat-B env, CON-S env, or Mosaic&#xD;
      env) contained in both the DNA prime vaccine and the NYVAC boost vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 180 healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults in two stages (Part A and Part B).&#xD;
      After Part A of the study is fully enrolled, study researchers will evaluate study&#xD;
      immunogenicity data to determine whether to enroll participants into Part B. The study design&#xD;
      and vaccination schedule for both parts of the study will be the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and receive either one of the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine regimens or a placebo vaccine regimen. Participants will receive four&#xD;
      total injections: on Day 0 and Day 28 (DNA vaccine or placebo) and on Day 84 and Day 168&#xD;
      (NYVAC vaccine or placebo). Group 1 participants will receive DNA Nat-B env and NYVAC Nat-B&#xD;
      env vaccines, Group 2 participants will receive DNA CON-S env and NYVAC CON-S env vaccines,&#xD;
      and Group 3 participants will receive DNA Mosaic env and NYVAC Mosaic env vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration will be either 3 years after enrollment (for participants in the United&#xD;
      States) or 5 years after enrollment (for participants in Switzerland). For all participants,&#xD;
      study visits will occur on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 84, 98, 168, 175, 182, 273, 357, and 364.&#xD;
      After the last study visit, participants will be contacted annually by phone or e-mail for a&#xD;
      total of 3 (U.S. participants) or 5 (Switzerland participants) years to answer questions&#xD;
      about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, participants will give a medical history; undergo a complete physical exam,&#xD;
      blood collection, urine collection, and an electrocardiogram (ECG); and receive risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling. At most follow-up visits, participants will undergo an abbreviated&#xD;
      physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, and receive risk reduction counseling.&#xD;
      Participants will have additional ECGs on Days 98 and 182. At all visits, female participants&#xD;
      who were born female will be assessed for pregnancy prevention, and at select visits, will&#xD;
      undergo a pregnancy test.&#xD;
