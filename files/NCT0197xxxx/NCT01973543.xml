      Safety study of AADC gene transfer (VY-AADC01) in subjects with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder involving loss of neurons that release&#xD;
      dopamine in the striatum. To compensate for the loss of dopamine, patients are typically&#xD;
      prescribed levodopa medication which is converted to dopamine by the enzyme Aromatic L-Amino&#xD;
      Acid Decarboxylase (AADC). As Parkinson's disease progresses, levodopa therapy becomes less&#xD;
      effective and is associated with motor fluctuations, involuntary movements and other&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will primarily investigate the safety of increasing AADC levels in the striatum&#xD;
      via AADC gene delivery. The hAADC gene is packaged into a gene transfer vector derived from a&#xD;
      common, non-pathogenic virus (AAV2) to which &gt;90% of humans have been exposed. This&#xD;
      investigational drug, termed VY-AADC01, will be injected directly into the striatum during a&#xD;
      neurosurgical procedure that is performed with real-time MRI imaging to monitor delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will continue to take Parkinson's disease medications, including levodopa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and potential clinical responses to VY-AADC01 will be assessed by repeated&#xD;
      clinical evaluations of Parkinson's disease, cognitive tests, laboratory blood tests and&#xD;
      neuroimaging. Clinical evaluations will be performed over a 3 year follow-up period. A test&#xD;
      to specifically assess the clinical response to levodopa will be performed once before AADC&#xD;
      gene delivery and approximately 6 months after.&#xD;
