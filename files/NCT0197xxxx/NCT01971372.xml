      Specific Aim 1: To identify differences in pain perception and satisfaction with pain control&#xD;
      in women undergoing urogynecologic surgery receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS)&#xD;
      postoperatively by oral ibuprofen, intravenous ibuprofen, or intravenous ketorolac. Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the differences in narcotic usage and medication side effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patient will be informed that they may receive either ibuprofen or ketorolac and that the&#xD;
      medication may be given (IV) or per os (PO). Patients were also informed that their pain may&#xD;
      improve or worsen during the study, and that they could request additional pain medication&#xD;
      (as a rescue medication) at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, all patients will be placed initially on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA)&#xD;
      of hydromorphone with standardized settings of allowing the patient to dispense 0.2 mg of&#xD;
      medication every 6 minutes (lockout rate) and an hourly maximum of 2.0 mg/hour. A one-time&#xD;
      nursing bolus of 0.4 mg will also be ordered. The PCA will be discontinued on the morning&#xD;
      after surgery no later than 12:00 noon. The patient will then be started on PO pain&#xD;
      medication, either hydrocodone/acetaminophen or oxycodone/acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after surgery, patients will then be assigned to one of three treatment arms with&#xD;
      a computer-generated randomization schedule that is to be based on their order of enrollment.&#xD;
      Patients were informed they could withdraw at any point. Three visual analog scores (VAS)&#xD;
      will be obtained from the patient before noon on the first day after surgery. One scale to&#xD;
      assess pain at rest, one scale to assess pain with ambulation, and one scale to assess&#xD;
      satisfaction with pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medications will each be given every 8 hours in order to keep all medications on a&#xD;
      similar doing regimen. This will allow the patients to receive a total of three doses of&#xD;
      medication over 24 hours, regardless of which arm of the study they are randomized to.&#xD;
