      Purpose: To compare the hemodynamic effects of dobutamine and milrinone in hospitalized&#xD;
      patients who are receiving Beta Blocker Participants: Patients who are admitted to the&#xD;
      General Cardiology and Heart Failure Services at the University of North Carolina Hospitals&#xD;
      with acute decompensated heart failure, who have maintained steady state concentrations of&#xD;
      beta blocker therapy (carvedilol or metoprolol), and who are deemed by the health care team&#xD;
      to require pulmonary artery catheter placement and inotropic therapy with dobutamine or&#xD;
      milrinone by continuous infusion. Patients that are not currently receiving beta blocker&#xD;
      therapy will be enrolled for comparative purposes; however, any patient not at steady state&#xD;
      (on or off beta blocker therapy) will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: After obtaining informed consent, patients will be assigned to the appropriate&#xD;
      sub-study group based on beta blocker use (Study A: patients on stable doses of metoprolol&#xD;
      and Study B: patients on stable doses of carvedilol). All patients should receive dobutamine&#xD;
      followed by milrinone as outlined in the dosing algorithm (see inotrope dosing algorithm&#xD;
      attached, as part of the usual standard of practice). Baseline pulmonary artery catheter&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters will be collected prior to administration of inotrope trial of&#xD;
      dobutamine followed by milrinone. Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded per the dosing&#xD;
      algorithm following initiation and dose titration. Dose titration will be determined by the&#xD;
      health care team based upon patient response or lack thereof and tolerability. Changes in&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters in response to dobutamine or milrinone will be compared within study&#xD;
      groups. Additionally, data will continue to be collected on patients receiving not beta&#xD;
      blocker therapy for comparative purpose.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First-line management of chronic heart failure includes beta blockers and angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as these agents have been shown to have significant&#xD;
      benefits on morbidity and mortality in large clinical trials. Therefore, a substantial number&#xD;
      of patients with chronic heart failure are receiving chronic beta blocker therapy, most&#xD;
      commonly metoprolol succinate and carvedilol. However, despite significant advancements in&#xD;
      the treatment of chronic heart failure, the natural history of the disease remains&#xD;
      progressive and many patients develop acute decompensations requiring hospitalization. In the&#xD;
      setting of acute decompensated heart failure, the use of inotropic agents may be required for&#xD;
      hemodynamic support. The two most widely used inotropes are dobutamine and milrinone.&#xD;
      Dobutamine primarily acts as a beta-1 receptor agonist with some effects on beta-2 and&#xD;
      alpha-1 receptors. Milrinone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, thus inhibiting the&#xD;
      breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. As such, milrinone works at a site that is&#xD;
      distal to beta receptors and may be less influenced by chronic beta blocker therapy. As such,&#xD;
      one may speculate that the presence of a beta blocker would influence the hemodynamic&#xD;
      response to dobutamine, but to a much lesser extent to milrinone, if at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two small studies have assessed the hemodynamic response to dobutamine in the presence and&#xD;
      absence of beta blocker therapy in patients with chronic heart failure. In addition, one of&#xD;
      these studies assessed the response to enoximone, another phosphodiesterase III inhibitor.&#xD;
      Both studies demonstrated that metoprolol did not significantly affect the hemodynamic&#xD;
      response to dobutamine infusion, including its effect on cardiac index, heart rate, stroke&#xD;
      volume, and systemic vascular resistance. Conversely, carvedilol was shown to have&#xD;
      significant inhibitory effects on cardiac index, heart rate, and stroke volume during&#xD;
      dobutamine infusion. In addition, carvedilol appeared to increase mean arterial pressure at&#xD;
      higher doses of dobutamine. In the setting of an enoximone infusion, metoprolol increased the&#xD;
      cardiac index and stroke volume responses, while maintaining other hemodynamic parameters.&#xD;
      There was no significant difference in the hemodynamic response to enoximone infusion in the&#xD;
      presence of carvedilol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why This Study is Needed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Published studies that assessed the hemodynamic response to inotropes in the presence and&#xD;
      absence of beta blockers included less than 50 patients combined. As such, the replication of&#xD;
      their results is warranted in order to use this data to drive changes in clinical practice.&#xD;
      Additionally, and equally as important, no study has been published, to the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, which has assessed the hemodynamic response to milrinone in the presence of&#xD;
      metoprolol. . Although enoximone is a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor and is theoretically&#xD;
      similar to milrinone, it is not approved for use in the United States, thus making it&#xD;
      difficult to extrapolate these findings to milrinone. Lastly, the severity of illness in&#xD;
      patients included in current literature does not reflect individuals who will receive the&#xD;
      most benefit from therapy i.e. patients with acute decompensated heart failure.&#xD;
