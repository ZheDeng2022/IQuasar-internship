      This trial seeks to prove the safety and efficacy of photothermal stimulation treatment to&#xD;
      diabetic macular edema, chronic central serous retinopathy, macular edema secondary to branch&#xD;
      retinal vein occlusion and macular telangiectasia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub-visible, non-damaging photothermal stimulation (532nm) exposures of 100 ms in duration&#xD;
      resulted in enhanced expression of heat shock proteins in the retina. To test clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of sub-visible retinal therapy using ms-range exposures of visible lasers one needs&#xD;
      first to establish proper titration methods necessary to assure on one hand the lack of&#xD;
      tissue damage, and on the other hand sufficient hyperthermia to elicit cellular response. We&#xD;
      used an algorithm based on computational and experimental data to provide parameters that can&#xD;
      cause photothermal stimulation to the retinal pigment epithelium without causing collateral&#xD;
      damage to photoreceptors or choroid. This method will be used to treat macular diseases such&#xD;
      as diabetic macular edema, branch retinal vein occlusion macular edema, chronic central&#xD;
      serous retinopathy and macular telangiectasia.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have macular edema involving the center of the macula with a&#xD;
             corresponding leakage on fluorescein angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Thickening of the fovea of at least 300 microns (thickness of the central point in OCT)&#xD;
        with a standard deviation of the center point &lt;10% and signal strength of ≥ 5 OCT ILM and&#xD;
        borders (internal limiting membrane) and RPE (retinal pigment epithelium) properly&#xD;
        identified. Also, the initial OCT must be confirmed by repeated measurements on the same&#xD;
        day, with the thickness of the central point being within 10% between measurements. In&#xD;
        cases where the OCT imaging program can not properly define the limits of ILM and RPE, if&#xD;
        the investigator can obtain an estimate of the thickness of the manual by OCT central point&#xD;
        of at least 300 microns, the patient will be considered eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The distance visual acuity in the better eye corrected the study must have an index between&#xD;
        70 and 35 letters inclusive (Snellen equivalent of 20/40 to 20/200).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Clear media and eye pupil dilation adequate to allow fundus photography with good quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Intraocular pressure not exceeding 21 mmHg. The ophthalmologist should feel comfortable&#xD;
        with the delay of the focal laser treatment (direct and grid, as needed) by at least 12&#xD;
        weeks in the study eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with diabetes Type I or Type II as defined by WHO criteria of any gender and age ≥&#xD;
        18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to provide a written consent. Ability to return for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eyes with scatter photocoagulation (PRP) one month prior the enrollment, or eyes where&#xD;
             scatter photocoagulation is required now, or it likely to be needed over the next&#xD;
             6months (for example, eyes with high risk PDR DRS not properly treated with&#xD;
             photocoagulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Presence of any abnormality that is likely to confound the assessment of the improvement in&#xD;
        visual acuity in eyes with macular edema to resolve or improve as an area of hard exudates&#xD;
        involving the foveal avascular zone (FAZ - involving 2 or more quadrants centered around&#xD;
        the foveal avascular zone), epiretinal membrane associated with signs of contraction and /&#xD;
        or significant opacification (ie, striations within the diameter of a disc from the center&#xD;
        of the fovea), or the presence of chorioretinal atrophy involving the center of the macula.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vitreomacular traction determined clinically and / or OCT, which in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, contributes to macular edema (associated or cause a detachment of the fovea)&#xD;
        and prevents the improvement with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Atrophy / scar / fibrosis involving the center of the macula, including evidence of atrophy&#xD;
        treated with laser within 200 microns of the FAZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who received panphotocoagulation, YAG laser, or peripheral retinal cryoablation&#xD;
        (for retinal tears) or focal or grid photocoagulation within the last 12 weeks or more of&#xD;
        treatment with focal or grid laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Significant opacities of the optical medium, including cataracts, which may interfere with&#xD;
        visual acuity, assessment of toxicity or photography background. Patients will not be&#xD;
        included if they have high probability of requiring cataract surgery within the next year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Any intraocular surgery within 6 months prior to study entry. Prior peeling of epiretinal&#xD;
        membrane or inner limiting membrane. Any major surgical procedure within one month of study&#xD;
        entry Prior irradiation of the head region of the eye under study. Any previous&#xD;
        pharmacological treatment for DME, BRVO, CSR or MacTel (including corticosteroid&#xD;
        intravitreal, subconjunctival or subtenon) or at any time during the last 90 days for any&#xD;
        other condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Important known allergies to sodium fluorescein dye used in angiography. Acute ocular or&#xD;
        periocular infection.&#xD;
