    <textblock>
      New-onset diabetes (NODAT) after solid organ transplantation is an important clinical&#xD;
      challenge associated to increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. In end-stage renal&#xD;
      disease (ESRD) patients, the impact of arterial stiffness on all-cause and CV mortality has&#xD;
      been clearly documented. Arterial stiffness has a pivotal role in the genesis of high blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP), increased left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and consequently CV mortality.&#xD;
      Both LVH and arterial stiffness are independent determinants of CV disease in patients with&#xD;
      ESRD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between post-transplant new-onset&#xD;
      diabetes and arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;

      All patients' data were recorded from clinical charts. Visits in out patient clinic were&#xD;
      organized as follows: three visits per week during the first 2 weeks; two visits per week&#xD;
      until day 60; weekly visits until day 120; monthly visits during the first year; one visit&#xD;
      every other month during the second year; and four visits per year thereafter until death or&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease (i.e. dialysis or retransplantation). The following parameters were&#xD;
      collected; 1) age, 2) gender, 3) posttransplantation duration, 4) pretransplant hemodialysis&#xD;
      duration, 4) acute rejection episodes, 5) use of statins, ace inhibitor (ACE) or angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blocker (ARB), 6) immunosuppressive treatment (mycophenolate, cyclosporine,&#xD;
      tacrolimus, and sirolimus use), 7) pretransplant lipid profile (values in the last month&#xD;
      before transplantation), 8) posttransplant lipid profile (mean value), 9) FPG and HbA1c&#xD;
      levels (mean value), 10) office blood pressure measurements, 11) hemoglobin, calcium,&#xD;
      phosphorus, albumine and parathyroid hormone levels, 12) creatinine and estimated GFR (MDRD&#xD;
      equation) and, 13) cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection history. Mean values were arithmetic means&#xD;
      of each parameter that were collected from patient charts at 3 monthly basis after the first&#xD;
      posttransplant 6 months while other parameters (12-16) were collected as single values at&#xD;
      study inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were under 5 mg prednisolone treatment within the immuno suppressive regimen.&#xD;
      Maintenance immunosuppressive treatment included prednisone with a gradual tapering and&#xD;
      mycophenolate mofetil or sodium associated with cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus in most&#xD;
      patients. Target through levels at 3 months were 150-250 ng/ml for cyclosporine and 8-12&#xD;
      ng/ml for tacrolimus and sirolimus. Anti-diabetic treatment modalities (diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      changes, oral anti-diabetic drugs or insulin) were also recorded for patients with NODAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body compositions of all patients were analyzed by using the Body Composition Analyzer&#xD;
      (Tanita BC-420MA). Fat mass, fat free mass, muscle mass, visceral fat mass and body mass&#xD;
      index were calculated for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent echocardiographic examinations (Siemens Acuson C256, Mountain view,&#xD;
      California 2000 with 3V2c transducer probe) by the same operator and left ventricular mass&#xD;
      was calculated according to the Devereux formula and indexed to body surface area to give&#xD;
      LVMI (g/m2). Left ventricular mass index values greater than 130g/m2 (n: 57) were defined as&#xD;
      high left ventricular mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulse wave velocity (PWv) is defined as the velocity of the arterial pulse for moving along&#xD;
      the vessel wall. Pulse wave velocity along the aorta was measured by using two ultrasound or&#xD;
      pressure sensitive transducers fixed transcutaneously over the course of a pair of arteries&#xD;
      separated by a known distance: the femoral and right common carotid arteries. PWV was&#xD;
      calculated from measurements of pulse transit time and the distance, according to the&#xD;
      following formula: PWV (m/s)= distance (m)/transit time (s). Measurement of PWV values was&#xD;
      con-ducted after abstinence from caffeine or smoking and after an overnight fast without&#xD;
      intake of antihypertensive drugs. PWV was determined by using the SphygmoCor CvMs V9 system&#xD;
      and values &gt; 7 m/s was defined as increased.&#xD;
