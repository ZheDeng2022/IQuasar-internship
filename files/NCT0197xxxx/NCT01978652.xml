  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterise the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB017&#xD;
      (Peginterferon Beta-1a) administered as a single 125 μg subcutaneous (SC) dose in Japanese&#xD;
      and Caucasian adult healthy participants. The secondary Objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of a single 125 μg subcutaneous (SC) dose of BIIB017 in Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;
      adult healthy participants.&#xD;

             [HBsAg]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a history of malignant disease, including solid tumours and haematologic&#xD;
             malignancies (except basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have&#xD;

             stage 0 if completely excised).&#xD;
&#xD;

             use of over-the-counter pegylated products, including cosmetics, is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with any interferon product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to paracetamol, ibuprofen, or naproxen,&#xD;
