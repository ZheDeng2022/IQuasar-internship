  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate in an 'all-comers' population with&#xD;
      coronary artery disease whether treatment with a novel everolimus eluting stent (EES) with a&#xD;
      biodegradable polymer is superior to a durable polymer zotarolimus eluting stent (ZES), with&#xD;
      respect to the long term vascular response to treatment These data are important to ascertain&#xD;
      the superiority of a new generation DES with bioabsorbable polymer coating to reduce the long&#xD;
      term development of in-stent neoatherosclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last decade a considerable clinical experience has been accumulated with the use&#xD;
      of drug eluting coronary stents with durable polymers, that permanently cover the metallic&#xD;
      stent scaffold, allowing the local delivery of anti-restenotic agents. However durable&#xD;
      polymers have been associated with an increased risk of late and very late stent thrombosis&#xD;
      and the anticipated development of in stent neo-atherosclerosis. Since permanent polymer&#xD;
      coatings may have pro-inflammatory effects, with delayed healing and prolonged endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, current research on DES has focused on the use of biodegradable polymer&#xD;
      coatings, which disappear after a short period of drug-release (3-4 months). Current clinical&#xD;
      guidelines recommend at least 6-12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after DES&#xD;
      implantation,in order to prevent ST. Recent data obtained by pooled analyses of ZES, support&#xD;
      a significant reduction of the DAPT to the same range used with bare metal stents. The&#xD;
      substantial delays in DES healing observed from multiple human pathology series and in-vivo&#xD;
      studies using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) were not assessed as risk factors for&#xD;
      prolonged used of DAPT. However different patient cohorts might have different responses to&#xD;
      stent implantation. In addition, there is no comparative evidence on long term development of&#xD;
      neo-atherosclerosis in bioabsorbable versus permanent polymer DES. OCT allows precise&#xD;
      assessment of stent strut apposition and coverage and accurate measures of different tissue&#xD;
      components of neoatherosclerosis. This study is the first attempting to characterize the&#xD;
      early and late vascular responses to novel bioabsorbable polymer EES (SYNERGY™) compared with&#xD;
      a permanent polymer benchmark novel generation ZES (RESOLUTE INTEGRITY™) .The stent&#xD;
      comparator has been selected due to the large use across the interventional cardiology&#xD;
      community and the recent approval from European Regulators Authorities to update the CE&#xD;
      (Conformité Européenne) mark labeling to only one-month duration of dual anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
