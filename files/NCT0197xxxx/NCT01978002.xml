  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bladder pain and discomfort, as well as urinary urgency and frequency, are bothersome&#xD;
      symptoms seen frequently in the general population. Clinical diagnostic terms used to&#xD;
      describe these symptoms include interstitial cystitis (IC), bladder pain syndrome (BPS),&#xD;
      chronic prostatitis, and overactive bladder (OAB), but there is tremendous overlap between&#xD;
      these entities, and the distinction between them is based more on eminence than evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and/or sensory sensitivity has been suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of both&#xD;
      bladder pain and urinary urgency/frequency. However, no previous studies have investigated&#xD;
      whether entities such as IC/BPS and OAB might merely represent different points in a&#xD;
      continuum of bladder sensory sensitivity. Moreover, we know of no studies that have directly&#xD;
      compared sensory sensitivity in the bladder to global (i.e. CNS-mediated) sensory&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, a team of investigators with complementary expertise will perform a&#xD;
      population-based study assessing bladder and overall sensory sensitivity, in a cohort of&#xD;
      women representative of the population with respect to the entire continuum of bladder pain&#xD;
      (from none to severe), and symptoms of urgency/frequency. These individuals will undergo&#xD;
      urodynamics to measure sensory sensitivity in the bladder, as well as pressure pain and&#xD;
      auditory loudness thresholds. The Specific Aims are to demonstrate: 1) sensory sensitivity in&#xD;
      the bladder is related to sensory sensitivity elsewhere in the body, suggesting a CNS-driven&#xD;
      mechanism, and 2) individuals in the population with greater global sensory sensitivity will&#xD;
      display: a) more bladder pain, b) more urgency/frequency, and c) other symptoms of&#xD;
      centrally-mediated pain states, such as pain in regions other than the bladder, fatigue, and&#xD;
      insomnia.&#xD;

        Group 1 will be women with a clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS or OAB, at least 18 years of age,&#xD;
        who have had urodynamic testing performed within the preceding 6 months. All of these&#xD;
        subjects will complete the questionnaires, mechanical sensitivity testing, and auditory&#xD;
        sensitivity testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2 will be women recruited from the community sample, at least 18 years of age. All of&#xD;
        these subjects will complete the questionnaires, mechanical sensitivity testing, and&#xD;
        auditory sensitivity testing. Half of the subjects (n=30) will also undergo urodynamic&#xD;
        testing to measure bladder sensitivity.&#xD;
