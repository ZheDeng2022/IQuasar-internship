  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are frequent after surgery and anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is widely used as antiemetic for the prevention of PONV. Little is known about&#xD;
      the efficacy of antiemetic drugs for the treatment of established PONV symptoms. No single&#xD;
      randomised trial has been published so far that tests the efficacy of dexamethasone for the&#xD;
      treatment of established PONV symptoms. In this trial the investigators want to test the&#xD;
      antiemetic efficacy of three different doses of intravenous dexamethasone for the treatment&#xD;
      of established PONV symptoms. In adjunct protocols of this study the investigators aim to&#xD;
      establish a novel method to quantify the anti-nausea efficacy of an antiemetic drug, to study&#xD;
      pharmacogenetics of PONV, and to further our understanding on the smoking status as a&#xD;
      predictive factor of PONV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is divided into a main study and three adjunct protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are frequent adverse effects of surgery and&#xD;
      anesthesia. Dexamethasone is well established for the prophylaxis of PONV, but the efficacy&#xD;
      of dexamethasone for the treatment of established PONV symptoms remains unknown. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the main study is to test the antiemetic efficacy of dexamethasone for the&#xD;
      treatment of established PONV in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia, and to&#xD;
      test for dose-responsiveness. The secondary objective is the evaluation of the potential&#xD;
      adverse effect profile of dexamethasone, No prophylactic antiemetics are allowed.&#xD;
      Premedication, conduct of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia will be at the discretion of&#xD;
      the responsible anesthesiologist. Patients who have received their assigned study drug and&#xD;
      who continue to experience PONV will receive antiemetic rescue treatment (ondansetron,&#xD;
      droperidol). The minimum delay between administration of the study drug and rescue is 60 min&#xD;
      (to ensure that dexamethasone has the scope to show antiemetic efficacy). Primary efficacy&#xD;
      endpoint: Complete absence of any nausea and/or vomiting (including retching) in a previously&#xD;
      nauseated or vomiting patient within 24 hours after administration of the study treatment.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: Time to treatment failure; quality of sleep during the first&#xD;
      postoperative night (numerical rating scale ranging from 0 = no sleep at all to 10 =&#xD;
      excellent sleep); blood glucose (in the morning after administration of study drug); any&#xD;
      minor or major adverse effects during 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunct protocol 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In therapeutic PONV trials, efficacy is usually quantified using a dichotomous outcome, i.e.&#xD;
      a previously nauseous or vomiting patient stays totally PONV-free over a given period of time&#xD;
      (for instance, 24 hours). This outcome is valid for the endpoint vomiting (including&#xD;
      retching): a previously vomiting patient stays completely vomiting-free after treatment. For&#xD;
      nausea, the situation is different. A patient may suffer from severe nausea, and, after&#xD;
      treatment, the degree of nausea may significantly decrease although nausea may not disappear&#xD;
      completely. Nevertheless, such a treatment may be regarded as efficacious. A very similar&#xD;
      context can be found in the postoperative pain setting where an efficacious analgesic may&#xD;
      decrease the degree of pain to a significant extent although the pain does not disappear&#xD;
      completely. In analgesic trials, efficacy is therefore not expressed as a dichotomous outcome&#xD;
      (pain - no pain) but as a continuum on a 0 to 100 mm visual analogue scale. Patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe postoperative pain (VAS ≥3/10) would be randomised to receive an&#xD;
      experimental or a control (placebo) intervention and relief would be then recorded over time.&#xD;
      Outcomes are expressed as maximum pain relief, area under the time-analgesic effect curve for&#xD;
      pain intensity (i.e. summed pain intensity difference, or SPID), or summed pain relief&#xD;
      (TOTPAR). AIM: To apply the methodology acute pain trials to the measurement of the&#xD;
      anti-nausea efficacy of antiemetic drugs. To investigate the variability of responses based&#xD;
      on measurement of nausea intensity using a visual analogue scale compared with a 4-point&#xD;
      categorical scale. METHODS: Patients of the main study protocol will be asked to rate their&#xD;
      degree of &quot;baseline&quot; nausea on a 100 mm visually analogue scale ranging from 0 mm = no nausea&#xD;
      at all to 100 mm = worst possible nausea, and on a 4-point categorical scale (none, moderate,&#xD;
      severe, intolerable). Subsequently, after having received the assigned study drug, patients&#xD;
      will be asked to score their degree of nausea on VAS every 15 minutes until 60 minutes after&#xD;
      administration of the study drug (i.e. until they would receive the rescue medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunct protocol 2: Pharmacogenetics of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in PONV is needed to&#xD;
      better identify patients who are at risk of PONV. Some of the variability seen with nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting in cancer or migraine without aura may be associated with genetic variation&#xD;
      either in genes related to the mechanisms of nausea/vomiting or in genes related to opioid&#xD;
      action. In cancer patients receiving opioids, the inter-individual differences in nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting were associated with genetic markers represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      of candidates in the opioid- or nausea/vomiting signalling pathways that modulate&#xD;
      neurotransmission by metabolising the catecholamine dopamine. A possible role has been&#xD;
      suggested for catechol-O-methyl-transferase (COMT) which is a key modulator in the metabolism&#xD;
      of endogenous monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and hence of opioidergic neurotransmitters.&#xD;
      The COMT enzyme possesses a frequent non-synonymous polymorphism that encodes for the&#xD;
      substitution of valine (Val) by methionine (Met) at codon 158 (Val158Met). The SNP rs4680&#xD;
      (c.472G &gt; A) is a missense mutation leading to a four-fold reduction of the COMT enzyme.&#xD;
      Individuals with the Val/Val genotype have the highest activity of COMT, those with the&#xD;
      Met/Met genotype have the lowest activity of COMT, and heterozygous individuals are&#xD;
      intermediate.11,12 Pathways involving specific neurotransmitters and their receptors are&#xD;
      likely to be involved in PONV, for instance, dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine,&#xD;
      cannabinoids, substance P, and 5-hydroxytryptamine. The role of dopamine is pivotal in nausea&#xD;
      and vomiting; dopamine D2 receptor blockade, in the area postrema, has an antiemetic effect.&#xD;
      In patients receiving COMT inhibitors, the enhanced dopaminergic activity leads&#xD;
      dose-dependently to frequent and severe nausea and vomiting. AIM: To compare COMT genotype of&#xD;
      patients with PONV to PONV-free controls and to assess the possible relationship between&#xD;
      genetic factors and dexamethasone response. A greater proportion of COMT-deficient allele is&#xD;
      expected in PONV patients as compared to PONV-free controls. METHODS: The study population&#xD;
      consists in all patients with PONV that are included in the main study (n=560). The control&#xD;
      group will be 560 consenting patients but who do not develop PONV. COMT genotyping: Genomic&#xD;
      DNA will be extracted from 200 µl of whole blood using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (QIAGEN,&#xD;
      Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). The COMT Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) will be genotyped using&#xD;
      a commercially available TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay (C_25746809_50, Applied Biosystems,&#xD;
      Warrington, UK). Twenty-five µl reactions will be performed using 50 ng of template DNA,&#xD;
      pre-designed PCR primers and TaqMan® MGB probes (FAMTM and VIC® dye-labelled) according to&#xD;
      the manufacturer's instructions in TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix using an iCycler iQ&#xD;
      detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Analyses: The investigators will analyse allele and&#xD;
      genotype frequencies, Hardyweinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium and haplotypes. The&#xD;
      individual SNPs and haplotypes association with of occurrence of PONV will be categorized and&#xD;
      will be analyzed by Fisher exact test or Chi-square test and regression analysis (logistic,&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate). Gene-gene interactions relation with that of PONV will be&#xD;
      assessed by multivariate regression analysis. Analyses will be performed using Haploview&#xD;
      software v1. (Broad Institute, Cambridge, USA) and SPSS (version 19; SPSS Inc, Chicag0, IL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunct protocol 3: Role of non-smoking status as a predictive factor of PONV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Non-smoking status has consistently been reported to be an independent predictive&#xD;
      risk factor of PONV. At first view, this empirical observation is interesting. However, there&#xD;
      are two unresolved issues. Firstly, it remains unclear, why non-smoking patients are at a&#xD;
      increased risk of PONV, and consequently, smoking patients are &quot;protected&quot;. For instance, the&#xD;
      investigators failed to show any benefit of (short-term) perioperative transcutaneous&#xD;
      nicotine administration for the prevention of PONV. Secondly, no PONV risk score has shown&#xD;
      satisfactory sensitivity and specificity, largely limiting their clinical applicability. It&#xD;
      has been argued that one weakness of these scores was that non-smoking status was ill defined&#xD;
      and was treated in a purely dichotomous fashion. For instance, it remains unclear from what&#xD;
      length of abstinence the formerly PONV-protective effect will be lost in an ex-smokers. Also,&#xD;
      it remains unknown whether &quot;heavy&quot; smokers&quot; are more protected. Finally, there are various&#xD;
      ways to consume tobacco; tobacco snuffing was also shown to decrease the risk of PONV. AIMS:&#xD;
      1. To test whether the risk of PONV differs between non-, ex- and current smokers. 2. To test&#xD;
      whether there is a dose-effect relationship between the amount of tobacco smoking, and the&#xD;
      risk of PONV. 3. To test in ex-smokers for a relationship between the duration of smoking&#xD;
      cessation and the risk of PONV. METHODS: Patients who participate in the main study will be&#xD;
      asked, pre-operatively, to fill in a questionnaire regarding smoking habits. Patients will be&#xD;
      classified into non-smokers (exposed or not to passive smoking), ex-smokers (stop &gt;1 month;&#xD;
      exposed or not to passive smoking; substituted), and smokers. Variables related to PONV and&#xD;
      to smoking (potential confounders) will be recorded.&#xD;
