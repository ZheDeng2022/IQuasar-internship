  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test a new groundbreaking treatment for narrowing of the voicebox and&#xD;
      upper windpipe, which can be due to injury, inflammatory disease or cancer treatment.&#xD;
      Narrowing of the voicebox or upper windpipe can leave patients dependant on a tracheostomy&#xD;
      tube to breath through (a tube or hole in the neck), which can require a high level of care&#xD;
      with regular hospital visits and can lead to recurrent chest infections. Regular surgical&#xD;
      procedures may be necessary to widen the airway. Speaking may be very difficult or not even&#xD;
      possible, breathing is usually a struggle and swallowing can also be affected. Patients feel&#xD;
      very tired all the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new treatment tested by this study is an implant that will partially replace the voicebox&#xD;
      or upper windpipe in order to cure the narrowing. The implant is based on a human donor&#xD;
      voicebox or windpipe that has been processed with detergents and enzymes in order to remove&#xD;
      all the cells from the donor, leaving a 'scaffold' of connective tissue. The patient's own&#xD;
      stem cells are removed from the bone marrow, then are grown on the scaffold in the&#xD;
      laboratory. These cells will form the cartilage in the wall of the scaffold. A split skin&#xD;
      graft from the patient may be needed to line the inside of the implant. The implant can be&#xD;
      considered 'living' due to the cells grown on it, and this type of treatment is referred to&#xD;
      as 'tissue engineering' or 'regenerative medicine'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once these cells have attached and started to grow on the scaffold, it is ready to be&#xD;
      implanted into the patient, and an operation is performed which occurs in two separate&#xD;
      stages. The final stage of the operation involves removing the narrow section of voicebox or&#xD;
      upper windpipe and implanting the scaffold to reconstruct it. Patients will be followed up&#xD;
      for two years after this operation, with investigations such as CT scans, examination of the&#xD;
      voicebox and windpipe with a flexible camera (bronchoscopy) and blood tests performed at&#xD;
      specific times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended that this treatment will significantly improve patients' symptoms resulting in&#xD;
      better breathing, swallowing and voice function, reducing the need for repeated hospital&#xD;
      visits and procedures and enhancing patients' quality of life.&#xD;

      The RegenVOX trial is a phase I/IIa safety and potential efficacy clinical trial of&#xD;
      tissue-engineered laryngotracheal replacement using autologous-derived cells and&#xD;
      decellularised human donor scaffolds in 10 patients with severe acquired laryngotracheal&#xD;
      stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current solutions for the treatment of advanced structural disorders of the larynx such as&#xD;
      trauma, inflammatory disorders or following cancer treatment are suboptimal and patients with&#xD;
      such problems require frequent hospitalisation. A regenerative solution that restores the&#xD;
      anatomy of the larynx would provide a definitive treatment for these patients, improve the&#xD;
      outcome of resection for malignant disease, avoid some laryngectomies and would reduce the&#xD;
      threshold for performing surgery over administering chemotherapy thereby reducing morbidity.&#xD;
      Giving patients a once-only therapy of a life-time functional living replacement would allow&#xD;
      patients to lead tracheostomy-free lives with improved breathing, swallowing and speech and a&#xD;
      lower requirement for hospital follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is a clinical trial of tissue engineered partial laryngeal replacements in 10&#xD;
      patients with end-stage laryngeal stenosis. The intervention is based on a human donor graft&#xD;
      scaffold which is decellularised and then seeded with autologous mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cell-derived chondrocytes externally. Following expansion of these cells ex-vivo, the graft&#xD;
      is implanted. This is the first clinical trial to our knowledge of a stem-call based organ&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged &gt;=18 years with sufficient numbers of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) in their&#xD;
      human Bone Marrow (hBM) aspirate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Myer-Cotton Grade 3 or 4 laryngotracheal stenosis or malacia due to traumatic,&#xD;
      inflammatory, iatrogenic, or idiopathic causes who have exhausted conventional therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy. Patients positive for HIV 1, HIV 2, Hepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis B (HBV), syphilis&#xD;
      or Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus (HTLV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those unable to provide informed consent. Co-morbid severe chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (according to NICE criteria) Patients with active / uncontrolled chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis) and&#xD;
      sarcoidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any current or previous cancer within 5 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer, adequately&#xD;
      treated carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, laryngeal malignancy treated locally with no&#xD;
      local recurrence and no metastases, or low grade airway malignancy such as chondrosarcoma&#xD;
      which may be causing airway obstruction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Life expectancy less than 5 years unless this limitation is principally due to the airway&#xD;
      obstruction to be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent enrollment in any other Clinical Trial of Investigational Medicinal Product&#xD;
      (CTIMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is safety as determined by morbidity and mortality as measured by&#xD;
      occurrence of adverse events. Secondary outcome is efficacy as determined by&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Absence of tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Absence of non-absorbable stent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improvement in mean airway diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Improvement in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Improvement in global quality of life (EQ-5D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Improvement in maximum phonation time (MPT) as measured by Voice Analysis Operavox&#xD;
           (VAO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Improvement in self assessment of voice handicap (VHI-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Improvement in swallowing function (EAT-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Improvement in airway, dyspnoea, voice, swallowing index (ADVS index).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Improvement in the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) as per Video Fluoroscopic Swallow&#xD;
           (VFS) or Functional Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health economics. Patients will be followed up for 2 years within this study. Key milestones&#xD;
      will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. The follow-up regimen includes bronchoscopy and airway&#xD;
      brushings taken at 1 week post implantation and full physical assessment including CT&#xD;
      imaging, pulmonary function tests, blood tests and bronchoscopy at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months. Telephone follow-up will take place in between these assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will provide a level of insight into the real clinical potential for stem&#xD;
      cell/tissue engineering combined technologies. The results will have wide implications for&#xD;
      the development of hollow organ- replacements such as those for oesophagus, bowel and&#xD;
      vascular disorders. We will also develop new pathways for maximising discovery science and&#xD;
      health economic benefit from complex regenerative medicine therapies (a reverse translational&#xD;
      route map), with important generic benefits for scientists and clinicians.&#xD;
