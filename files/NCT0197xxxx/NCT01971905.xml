  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of diagnoses of renal cell carcinoma has increased over the past two decades&#xD;
      because of the incidental detection of small renal tumours resulting from increased use of&#xD;
      computed tomography [1,2]. There are distinct subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and the&#xD;
      biological aggressiveness and prognoses for these subtypes have been documented. Clear-cell&#xD;
      RCC is the most common RCC subtype, followed by papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC and&#xD;
      unclassified RCC. Collecting duct carcinoma is a rare and highly malignant type of RCC.&#xD;
      Although most enhancing renal masses in adults are RCC, a significant percentage are benign&#xD;
      (commonly oncocytoma), and these benign tumours cannot be distinguished from malignant&#xD;
      tumours based on our standard imaging technology alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benign primary renal masses include simple renal cysts, psuedotumours, angiomyolipomas,&#xD;
      oncocytomas, juxtaglomerular tumours, multilocular cystic nephromas, mesoblastic nephromas&#xD;
      and papillary adenomas. In a recent surgical series of 228 patients who underwent partial or&#xD;
      radical nephrectomy with lesions ≤4 cm, 26.3% were benign [3]. The relatively high percentage&#xD;
      of patients with benign renal cortical neoplasms who undergo surgery highlights the&#xD;
      importance of new diagnostic technology in avoiding over-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound (US) and CT scanning guided biopsy is the most commonly used method to diagnosis&#xD;
      RCC. The sensitivity of biopsy for small masses (≤3 cm) is lower than for large masses [4].&#xD;
      Sensitivity is limited by false-negative results, which are due to a failure to properly&#xD;
      target a small mass or the presence of impossible-to-differentiate benign from malignant&#xD;
      cells due to insufficient cells, morphological overlap or cellular heterogeneity. Non&#xD;
      diagnostic biopsy is not necessary benign, as repeated biopsy reveals malignancy diagnosis in&#xD;
      the majority[5]. There is no radiologic criteria consistent with oncocytoma because of a lack&#xD;
      of sensitivity and specificity [6]. MR-scanning and CT-scanning are not feasible diagnostic&#xD;
      methodologies for oncocytoma because of the possibility of overlapping results from&#xD;
      oncocytoma and RCC [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses: To investigate the ability of perfusion CT/US-scanning to facilitate recognition&#xD;
      of different tumour sub-types in small renal masses less than 7 cm by non-invasive imagining&#xD;
      technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To recognize different subtype's renal tumor by non invasive scanning. Design: A&#xD;
