  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tolvaptan is one of new class of medications approved for treatment of low blood sodium&#xD;
      (hyponatremia). It works by interfering with the effect of the antidiuretic hormone,&#xD;
      vasopressin, thereby increasing urine output and decreasing body water. However, the&#xD;
      magnitude of these effects vary from person to person. Thus, the efficacy of tolvaptan is&#xD;
      less reliable than an infusion of a concentrated salt solution for emergency, short term&#xD;
      treatment of hyponatremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to test 3 hypotheses about the variable efficacy of tolvaptan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The variable effect on urine output is due to individual differences in blood&#xD;
           vasopressin which counteracts the effects of tolvaptan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The differences in blood vasopressin are due to individual differences in the amount&#xD;
           secreted in response to a rise in blood sodium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The variable effect on blood sodium is due mainly to the variable effect on urine output&#xD;
           and can be corrected by maintaining water intake below urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts and will be performed in 12 healthy adult males.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Six subjects will receive tolvaptan at a dose of 60 mg by mouth and six subjects will&#xD;
           receive tolvaptan at 30 mg by mouth. Blood and urine will be collected hourly for 6&#xD;
           hours and water will be ingested in prescribed amounts. For the next 16 hours, subjects&#xD;
           will drink at will and blood and urine will be collected 4 more times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One week later, the same subjects will receive a concentrated salt solution (3% saline)&#xD;
           by vein for 6 hours. During this time, blood and urine will be collected hourly but&#xD;
           drinking will not be permitted. For the next 4 hours, subjects will be allowed to drink&#xD;
           at will while blood and urine are collected twice more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volume, concentration and creatinine content of each urine will be determined. Blood will&#xD;
      be analyzed for sodium, vasopressin and, in the first study, tolvaptan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects:12 healthy adult males, age 21-55,will be recruited via posters in medical center.&#xD;
      They must pass screening history &amp; physical examination and abstain from ingestion of&#xD;
      grapefruit products for 3 days prior to study and from all caffeinated beverage for 24 hours&#xD;
      before study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Each subject will receive two different treatments one week apart. Each time,they&#xD;
      will fast overnight, present to the Northwestern University Clinical Research Unit at&#xD;
      Northwestern Memorial Hospital at about 0700 hours and be given a light breakfast. At 0900&#xD;
      hours, staff will collect a completely voided urine (U0)and venous blood sample of 20 mL&#xD;
      (B0)then weigh subject to nearest 0.1 kg, record vital signs (pulse rate and blood pressure),&#xD;
      obtain a thirst score (rating from 1 to 10)and begin the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The treatment on the first admission will be tolvaptan. Six subjects will receive&#xD;
           tolvaptan at a dose of 60 mg by mouth and six subjects will receive tolvaptan at 30 mg&#xD;
           by mouth. Hourly for the next 6 hours (i.e. until 1500 hours), all the measurements and&#xD;
           samples obtained at baseline will be repeated as before. In addition, the subject will&#xD;
           drink a volume of water that is 5 mL/kg body weight lower than the volume of urine just&#xD;
           voided. This is expected to raise plasma sodium by about 7 millimoles/L in 6 hours. For&#xD;
           the next 16 hours, subjects will remain and be allowed to drink at will. In addition,&#xD;
           they will be served dinner at approximately 1700 hours and all the measures obtained at&#xD;
           baseline will be repeated again at 1700, 1900, 2300 and 0700 hours when subjects will be&#xD;
           discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. On the second admission one week later, the procedures will be identical to the first&#xD;
           admission with following exceptions: (a) instead of tolvaptan, at 0900 hours, subjects&#xD;
           will be started on an infusion of 3% saline at a rate of 0.033 mL/min/kg body weight.&#xD;
           This infusion will continue for 6 hours (i.e. until 1500 hours) and is expected to raise&#xD;
           plasma sodium about 7 millimoles/L), the same as the tolvaptan treatment;(b) the volume&#xD;
           of blood removed each time will be smaller (10 mL) since they will not be assayed for&#xD;
           tolvaptan; (c)subjects will not be permitted to drink during the infusion. In addition,&#xD;
           subjects will remain in the unit for only 4 more hours (until 1900 hours). During this&#xD;
           time, they will be permitted to drink at will, will be served dinner at about 1700 hours&#xD;
           and will have all baseline measurements repeated at 1700 and 1900 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected during these two tests will be obtained as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. weight in kg to the nearest 0.1 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. thirst intensity as rated by the subject on a scale of 1 to 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. pulse and blood pressure recumbent&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. urine volume to the nearest 5 mL&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. urine osmolarity by freezing point depression in Clinical Research Unit Core Laboratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. urine creatinine in clinical chemistry laboratory of Northwestern Memorial Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. blood placed on ice, centrifuged immediately at 4 C, plasma removed for:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. osmolarity by freezing point depression in Clinical Research Unit Core Lab (STAT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. sodium by ion specific electrode in Northwestern Memorial Hospital chemistry&#xD;
                laboratory after sealed storage at 4 degrees C for 2-16 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. vasopressin by radioimmunoassay in Clinical Research Unit Core Laboratory after&#xD;
                sealed storage at -4 C for approximately 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. tolvaptan (first study only) by reverse phase, high performance liquid&#xD;
                chromatography at ICON Labs (Dublin) after storage at -20 C for approximately 6&#xD;
                months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA analysis and interpretation will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that the variable effect of tolvaptan on urine concentration and&#xD;
           flow depends on the level of plasma vasopressin as well as plasma tolvaptan, the&#xD;
           relationship between the osmolarity of the first 9 urine collections after treatment to&#xD;
           the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma vasopressin, for plasma tolvaptan and for the&#xD;
           ratio of plasma tolvaptan/plasma vasopressin during the concurrent time periods will be&#xD;
           determined by regression analysis in each of the 12 subjects. The same analysis will be&#xD;
           performed using urine volume instead of urine osmolarity. Hypothesis 1 predicts that in&#xD;
           all subjects, the best correlation (r value)will be between urine osmolarity and the&#xD;
           ratio of tolvaptan/vasopressin. It also predicts that the slopes of every individual&#xD;
           regression line will be negative (i.e. the higher the ratio of tolvaptan to&#xD;
           vasopressin)the lower the urine osmolarity). However, the slopes may differ between&#xD;
           subjects owing to individual differences in the concentrating capacity of the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that the individual differences in plasma vasopressin during&#xD;
           treatment are due to the inherent,genetically determined differences in the secretory&#xD;
           response to osmotic (sodium) stimuli that are known to exist in humans, the relationship&#xD;
           of plasma vasopressin to plasma sodium (or osmolarity)during the first 6 hours of&#xD;
           treatment with tolvaptan or 3% saline will be determined separately by regression&#xD;
           analysis and compared. Based on previous findings, the correlation of plasma vasopressin&#xD;
           to plasma sodium (or osmolarity) should be very high (r&gt;0.9) in every subject during 3%&#xD;
           saline infusion but the slopes will vary markedly between subjects. The hypothesis&#xD;
           predicts that these correlations and marked differences in slopes will not differ after&#xD;
           tolvaptan treatment. This prediction will be tested by regressing the slope during&#xD;
           tolvaptan against the slope in the same subject during 3% saline infusion in all 12&#xD;
           subjects. If the hypothesis is correct, the correlation coefficient between the&#xD;
           individual slopes will be greater than 0.8 and the line describing the relation will&#xD;
           have a slope approximating 1 with an intercept near zero on both axes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test the hypothesis that the variable effect of tolvaptan on plasma sodium can be&#xD;
           reduced by continuously adjusting fluid intake to a level below urine output by a&#xD;
           constant amount (5 mL/kg each hour), the relation of plasma sodium to elapsed time over&#xD;
           the 6 hour period after tolvaptan and during saline infusion will be calculated&#xD;
           separately for each subject by regression analysis and compared. If the hypothesis is&#xD;
           correct, the correlation coefficients for the tolvaptan and saline treatments should be&#xD;
           uniformly high e.g. greater than 0.9 in all subject even though the slopes of the lines&#xD;
           describing these relationships may differ.&#xD;
