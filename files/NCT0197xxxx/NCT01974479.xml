  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern therapy for patients with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is based on&#xD;
      intensive administration of multiple drugs. In patients with relapsed disease, treatment&#xD;
      response is generally poor; for most patients, particularly those who relapse while still&#xD;
      receiving frontline therapy, the only therapeutic option is hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HSCT). There is no proven curative therapy for patients who relapse after&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural killer (NK) cells have powerful anti-leukemia activity. In patients undergoing&#xD;
      allogeneic HSCT, several studies have demonstrated NK-mediated anti-leukemic activity. NK&#xD;
      cell infusions in patients with leukemia have been shown to be well tolerated and void of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NK cell cytotoxicity is most powerful against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas&#xD;
      their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low. We have developed a novel method to expand&#xD;
      and redirect NK cells towards CD19, a molecule highly expressed on the surface of B-lineage&#xD;
      ALL cells but not expressed on normal cells other than B-lymphocytes. In this method, donor&#xD;
      NK cells are first expanded by co-culture with the cell line K562-mb15-41BBL and interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-2. Then, the expanded NK cells are transduced with a signaling receptor that binds to&#xD;
      CD19 (anti-CD19-BB-zeta). NK cells expressing these receptors showed powerful anti-leukemic&#xD;
      activity against CD19+ ALL cells in vitro and in an animal model of leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of infusing expanded, activated&#xD;
      redirected NK cells into research participants with B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease&#xD;
      after intensive chemotherapy . In this same cohort, we will study the in vivo lifespan and&#xD;
      phenotype of these redirected NK cells.&#xD;

      1.0. Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the well-established cytotoxicity of NK cells against AML cells, their&#xD;
      capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low and difficult to predict. We sought to overcome&#xD;
      this intrinsic resistance by transducing CD56+ CD3- NK cells with chimeric receptors directed&#xD;
      against CD19, a molecule widely expressed by malignant B cells. Expression of anti-CD19&#xD;
      receptors linked to CD3zeta overcame NK resistance and markedly enhanced NK cell-mediated&#xD;
      killing of leukemic cells. This result was significantly improved by adding the 4-1BB&#xD;
      costimulatory molecule to the chimeric anti-CD19-CD3zeta receptor: the cytotoxicity produced&#xD;
      by NK cells expressing this construct uniformly exceeded that of NK cells whose signaling&#xD;
      receptors lacked 4-1BB, even when natural cytotoxicity was apparent (Imai et al., Blood&#xD;
      2005). NK cells expressing anti-CD19 receptors also exerted vigorous anti-ALL activity in a&#xD;
      murine model of leukemia (Shimasaki et al., Cytotherapy 2012). Our findings indicate that&#xD;
      enforced expression of signaling receptors by NK cells might circumvent inhibitory signals,&#xD;
      providing a novel means to enhance the effectiveness of anti-ALL NK cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The great anti-leukemic efficacy of genetically modified NK cells shown in our preclinical&#xD;
      studies, together with the demonstrated feasibility of infusing durable haploidentical NK&#xD;
      cells in a non-HSCT setting and the established expertise by the NUH team in cell therapy&#xD;
      (the only center in Asia accredited by Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy,&#xD;
      FACT), form a compelling rationale for the clinical testing of these NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preparation of the key reagent (anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA) is finalized in the Tissue&#xD;
      Engineering &amp; Cell Therapy (TECT) Laboratory at NUH, where the GMP-compliant MaxCyte&#xD;
      electroporator is located. The feasibility of large-scale expansion of NK cells has been&#xD;
      demonstrated (Shimasaki et al. Cytotherapy 2012), and the feasibility of large-scale&#xD;
      electroporation validated in the TECT laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use flow cytometric and MRD technologies, to determine the presence of persistent&#xD;
      disease , and will include in this study only patients with a limited amount of residual&#xD;
      disease (&lt;1% leukemic lymphoblasts among normal bone marrow cells). We will use the same MRD&#xD;
      methods to monitor the effects of treatment infusions. We do not expect that the conditioning&#xD;
      regimen will have much effect by itself on leukemic cell counts, as the patients eligible for&#xD;
      the study will have disease that is resistant to many anti-leukemic drugs. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      because the conditioning regimen itself may have some salutary effects, it will be important&#xD;
      to screen the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow for the presence of leukemic blast cells&#xD;
      through all stages of the procedure, i.e., before, during, and after conditioning and after&#xD;
      the NK cell infusion. The presence of leukemic cells in will be closely monitored by flow&#xD;
      cytometry or PCR amplification of antigen-receptor genes (sensitivity for either method: 1&#xD;
      leukemic cell in 10,000) to shed some light on the relative effect of each intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0. Hypothesis and Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that infusion of NK cells expressing&#xD;
      anti-CD19-BB-zeta receptors by electroporation can produce measurable clinical responses in&#xD;
      patients with resistant B-lineage ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0. Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility and safety of redirecting NK cells with an anti-CD19&#xD;
           chimeric antigen receptor by mRNA electroporation in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of anti-CD19 redirected NK cells in research participants with&#xD;
           B-lineage ALL who have persistent disease as determined by MRD methods after intensive&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the persistence and phenotype of redirected NK cells in research participants&#xD;
           with B-lineage ALL who have residual disease after intensive chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0. Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, treatment response will be measured by comparing MRD levels before and at&#xD;
      several intervals after NK cell infusion.Achievement of MRD negativity in bone marrow, i.e.,&#xD;
      &lt; 0.01% blasts by flow cytometry or PCR, will be regarded as a complete response. Partial&#xD;
      response will be defined as â‰¥ 1 log decrease in MRD levels, while &lt; 1 log decrease in MRD&#xD;
      levels will be regarded as a no response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous studies, donor NK cells will be eliminated in most cases by the resurgent&#xD;
      cellular immunity of the haploidentical recipient after the effects of the transient&#xD;
      immunosuppression caused by the conditioning regimen have ceased (typically within 1 month of&#xD;
      infusion). Conceivably, however, NK cell engraftment may persist for a longer period with the&#xD;
      possible risk of prolonged pancytopenia owing to NK cell killing on normal hematopoietic&#xD;
      cells. Because of this possibility, we will plan for HSCT rescue in patients receiving&#xD;
      redirected NK cell infusions. Indeed, for most of the patients eligible for this study, HSCT&#xD;
      would be the treatment intervention regardless of whether they receive NK cell infusions or&#xD;
      not. Because of these considerations, the potential benefits of NK cell therapy should&#xD;
      outweigh its risks for those patients eligible for this study, i.e., patients with persistent&#xD;
      leukemia for whom no other proven effective treatment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because CD19 is universally expressed on B cells including early B cell precursors, normal&#xD;
      recipient B cell will also be a target for the donor NK cells transduced with the anti-CD19&#xD;
      chimeric receptors. Therefore, transient B-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobinemia are&#xD;
      expected. We will monitor the CD19+ blood cell count and measure the Ig levels once a month&#xD;
      and will give the participants intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) if their IgG level is lower&#xD;
      than age-specific ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0. Summary of Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral blood cell will be collected by apheresis from donors. After ex vivo expansion for&#xD;
      10 days by coculture with irradiated K562-mb15-41BBL cells (Fujisaki et al, Cancer Res 2009;&#xD;
      Lapteva et al. Cytotherapy 2012) and T-cell depletion, haploidentical NK cells will be&#xD;
      electroporated with anti-CD19-BB-zeta mRNA. Before infusion, patients will receive&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy to promote temporary engraftment of NK cells. After infusion, they&#xD;
      will receive IL-2 to support NK cell viability and expansion in vivo. The effects of NK cell&#xD;
      infusion will be determine by comparing MRD levels before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receptor expression after electroporation is transient and typically declines after 48 hours&#xD;
      becoming undetectable after 96 hours. Because the aim of NK cell therapy is not to induce&#xD;
      durable immunity but to rapidly reduce tumor cell burden, and the infused NK cells are&#xD;
      rejected by the host immune system after approximately 2 weeks of infusion, the transient&#xD;
      nature of the expression should not significantly affect anti-tumor potential. Moreover, by&#xD;
      using this strategy, safety concerns regarding insertional mutagenesis and long-term&#xD;
      persistence of transduced residual T cells do not apply. In any case, we will minimize the&#xD;
      number of residual T cells in the final product as much as possible by depleting the expanded&#xD;
      product of T cells by using the CliniMACS device, and by limiting the number of T cells in&#xD;
      the graft to &lt;0.05 x 10^6/kg.&#xD;
