    <description>Part 1: MSC2363318A will be administered orally once daily for repeated 21-day cycles until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Additional dose escalations will continue until Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached, the food effect will be investigated in a separate group.&#xD;
Part 2 (Cohort 1): MSC2363318A will be administered orally once daily for repeated 21-day cycles until intolerable toxicity or disease progression in subjects with PAM pathway alterations.&#xD;
