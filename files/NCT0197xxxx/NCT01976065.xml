      This multi-center exploratory clinical trial is a randomized trial designed to test whether a&#xD;
      regenerative endodontic procedure using tissue engineering principles (REGENDO), or a&#xD;
      revascularization (REVASC) endodontic procedure, in comparison to standard apexification&#xD;
      treatment using a mineral trioxide aggregate barrier (apexification; APEX), produces a&#xD;
      significantly better composite clinical outcome for the treatment of immature permanent teeth&#xD;
      with pulpal necrosis.&#xD;

      This is a multi-center randomized clinical trial designed to test whether a regenerative&#xD;
      endodontic procedure using tissue engineering principles (REGENDO), or a revascularization&#xD;
      (REVASC) endodontic procedure, when compared to the standard apexification treatment using&#xD;
      mineral trioxide aggregate barrier-MTA apexification (APEX), produces a significantly better&#xD;
      composite clinical outcome for the treatment of immature permanent teeth with pulpal&#xD;
      necrosis. This study will use an antibiotic mixture called Triple Antibiotic Paste (TAP),&#xD;
      consisting of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and minocycline, in the tooth for disinfection of&#xD;
      the root canal in study arms REGENDO and REVASC. The FDA has issued an Investigational New&#xD;
      Drug (IND) number allowing use of the triple antibiotic mixture in this trial. Other dental&#xD;
      materials used in this study have already been FDA approved for use in humans to provide a&#xD;
      matrix for the promotion of tissue growth in the root canal space. The study will also&#xD;
      attempt to identify the type of bacteria within the root canal space and surrounding tissues&#xD;
      by analyzing a small sample collected on a cotton-tip applicator. This clinical trial hopes&#xD;
      to determine which of the three treatment methods helps the tooth to grow stronger and&#xD;
      survive for at least two years after treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 6-20&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a permanent tooth with a necrotic pulp (as defined by lack of&#xD;
             responsiveness to both electrical pulp tests and cold [EndoIce] tests). If the tooth&#xD;
             was traumatized, then pulpal necrosis is defined as either: 1) no response to both&#xD;
             electrical pulp test and cold [EndoIce] test by three months after trauma, or 2)&#xD;
             presence of a periapical lesion, or 3) radiographic evidence of root resorption, or 4)&#xD;
             discoloration of the crown.&#xD;
&#xD;
