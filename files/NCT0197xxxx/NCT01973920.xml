  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism&#xD;
      caused by an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin, an anabolic hormone. The current&#xD;
      methods of insulin therapy for diabetic patients are multiple daily injection therapy and&#xD;
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an external pump. This rout of administration&#xD;
      may lead to hyperinsulinemia as insulin is administered in a non physiological way, targeting&#xD;
      mainly extra hepatic tissues (muscle, fat). A method of providing insulin without the need&#xD;
      for injections has been a goal in drug delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oshadi Drug Administration Ltd. has developed oral carrier for proteins based on biochemistry&#xD;
      and quantum theory of biochemical reactions. The carrier enables the absorption of proteins&#xD;
      from the gastrointestinal tract in their full structure. Oshadi has also developed the Oshadi&#xD;
      Icp - insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide in Oshadi carrier, administrated orally. This study&#xD;
      was design in order to evaluate the safety and feasibility of multiple administrations of&#xD;
      Oshadi Icp for home use. The study will be a multiple-dose, open-label non-randomized study&#xD;
      in patients with Type 1 diabetes, with periodic dose adjustments. The study will include 4&#xD;
      weeks of multiple-dose administration of Oshadi oral insulin (Oshadi Icp) at home and in&#xD;
      study center for the determination of the efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic effects of&#xD;
      Oshadi Icp.&#xD;
