      To examine the efficacy and safety of treatment with desvenlafaxine for vascular depression.&#xD;
      Primary efficacy, as it pertains to depressive symptoms, will be assessed by overall change&#xD;
      in symptom severity score from baseline to 12-weeks, measured by the Geriatric Depression&#xD;
      Scale. The primary efficacy measure of cognition will be the Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
      and analysis of change between baseline and 12-week scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of desvenlafaxine as a first-line treatment for vascular&#xD;
      depression in a sub-group of patients who have experienced a TIA greater than 6 weeks prior&#xD;
      to baseline. Mean differences between baseline and 12-week efficacy measures will be examined&#xD;
      within the sub-group.&#xD;

      The trial will involve 30 subjects (N=30). The study population is defined on the basis of&#xD;
      the broader concept of vascular depression, but not including post stroke depression (PSD).&#xD;
      Vascular depression (VaD) is described in patients of age equal or greater than 60 years with&#xD;
      clinical symptoms of MDD, evidence of deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH) on MRI and&#xD;
      cognitive deficits not meeting criteria for dementia (based on a score equal or less than 21&#xD;
      on MMSE and 0.5 on CDR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of a screening assessment subjects will begin treatment with desvenlafaxine.&#xD;
      For subjects who are currently prescribed an alternate SSRI or SNRI, they will be titrated&#xD;
      off their current medication and begin desvenlafaxine, according to the clinical judgment of&#xD;
      the investigator based on proven best practices. All subjects will begin on a dose of 50 mg&#xD;
      of desvenlafaxine and after 4 weeks of active treatment may be titrated up to 100 mg daily.&#xD;
      At the 8-week visit, individuals assessed as partial-responders, in the judgment of the&#xD;
      investigator, may be titrated up to 150 mg daily. Personal clinical experience of the&#xD;
      principal investigator has shown desvenlafaxine can be safely increased above a dose of 100&#xD;
      mg daily in partially responsive patients. The decision to titrate is based on a risk benefit&#xD;
      analysis, as 150 mg is shown to be effective with limited side effects in younger patient&#xD;
      populations. The principal investigator is comfortable with a daily dosage of 150mg and will&#xD;
      assess for potential side effects. Blood pressure will be monitored at baseline and every 4&#xD;
      weeks as there is evidence that an increase in these values is more likely with dose&#xD;
      escalation. It is estimated that 5-15% of the 30 patients may require 150 mg of&#xD;
      desvenlafaxine as partial or non-responders to 100 mg daily. Patients prescribed 150mg&#xD;
      desvenlafaxine and requiring downward titration will move to 100mg/d for 7 days, then 50mg/d&#xD;
      for 7 days, followed by 50mg every other day for 7 days before discontinuation. Patients&#xD;
      prescribed 50mg/d or 100mg/d will undergo similar downward titration prior to study drug&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline assessment will be conducted on all subjects, followed by assessments at week 4,&#xD;
      8, and a close out assessment at week 12. Additionally, enrolled subjects will undergo an MRI&#xD;
      of the head, unless MRI results within the past 6 weeks can be made available, to confirm the&#xD;
      presence or absence of DWMH.&#xD;
