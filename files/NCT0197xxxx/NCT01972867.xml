  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and short-term safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the NanoKnife System when used to ablate localized prostate cancer in&#xD;
      intermediate risk subjects with organ-confined prostate cancer. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the NanoKnife System as a focal therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve six (6) subjects who meet the intermediate risk prostate cancer&#xD;
      criteria defined by this protocol. The biopsy and imaging techniques that we will adopt&#xD;
      within this trial are multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and transperineal prostate biopsy (template&#xD;
      mapping and/or limited targeted). The subjects' prostate cancer foci, the location of which&#xD;
      will be determined by ultrasound guided transperineal prostate biopsy, will be targeted for&#xD;
      treatment with the NanoKnife System. The primary objective of this the study will be to&#xD;
      evaluate procedural and short-term post treatment safety of the NanoKnife treatment via&#xD;
      incidence of adverse events and evaluation of effect on urologic (urinary and erectile)&#xD;
      function. The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the short term efficacy of the&#xD;
      NanoKnife treatment. Local efficacy in the area of treatment will be assessed by histological&#xD;
      evaluation of transperineal prostate biopsy cores at six (6) months post NanoKnife treatment,&#xD;
      to evaluate the ablation zone created by the NanoKnife treatment. Other secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include health-related quality of life levels evaluated using validated patient&#xD;
      questionnaires. Following the 6 month transperineal prostate biopsy and mpMRI assessment, the&#xD;
      data from these 6 subjects will be submitted to FDA for confirmation of short term safety and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
