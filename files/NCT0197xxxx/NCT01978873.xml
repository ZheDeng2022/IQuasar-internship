  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed on the basis of an unmet clinical need, as well as other&#xD;
      factors including: 1) the ability to identify subjects at high risk of dying early from their&#xD;
      disease, 2) the fact that hormonal therapy has already been shown to improve survival when&#xD;
      applied early in the natural history, 3) the availability of chemotherapy such as cabazitaxel&#xD;
      that can improve survival in subjects with advanced disease and 4) that chemotherapy&#xD;
      (docetaxel) given concomitant with hormone treatment has proven to prolong time to&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigators hypothesis that a more appropriate group of patients who may benefit&#xD;
      from the curative potential of systemic chemo-hormonal modality is that with minimal, but&#xD;
      detectable disease who have a high probability of developing metastatic disease, clinical&#xD;
      symptoms and eventually death from prostate cancer in a defined time frame. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize further that the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal&#xD;
      tumour burden, resulting in minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality&#xD;
      of life while on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before&#xD;
      hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or&#xD;
      high risk disease.&#xD;

      tumour burden, resulting in minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality&#xD;

&#xD;
      This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before&#xD;
      hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or&#xD;
      high risk disease. Two therapeutic approaches will be compared in this two-arm randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. The control Arm A provides hormonal therapy alone. The experimental Arm B&#xD;
      involves treatment with hormone therapy + Cabazitaxel 25 mg / m² / day on day 1 every 3 weeks&#xD;
      continued if the patient has stable or responding disease up to 10 cycles. For the schematic&#xD;
      representation of study design please see Section 7.3.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with primary metastatic or N+ or high risk disease (PSA&gt;100) will be eligible. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the yearly number of prostate cancer patients who are diagnosed with metastatic or&#xD;
      high risk disease, approximately 1200 men per year (if +15% improvement)are potential&#xD;
      candidates for this approach in the Scandinavian countries .&#xD;

Hormones will be initiated in conjunction with the last cycle of chemotherapy. Consists of the administration of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist + antiandrogens for 30 days OR surgical castration OR complete androgen blockade (CAB) by LHRH agonist + antiandrogen device. G-CSF treatment according to ASCO guidelines is recommended.</description>
