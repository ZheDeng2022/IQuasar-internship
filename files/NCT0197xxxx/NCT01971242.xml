  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical trial in patients with Parkinson's disease, of a drug called&#xD;
      Exenatide which is already licensed for the treatment of patients with Type 2 Diabetes. There&#xD;
      have been several groups that have confirmed that Exenatide has beneficial effects on nerve&#xD;
      cells when tested in the laboratory, that raises the possibility that Exenatide may slow down&#xD;
      or stop the degenerative process of Parkinson's disease. In an open label trial in patients&#xD;
      with Parkinson's disease who self administered the drug for 1 year, we have previously shown&#xD;
      that the drug is well tolerated and shows encouraging effects on the movement and&#xD;
      non-movement aspects of the disease, even 2 months after patients stopped administering the&#xD;
      drug. The next step is therefore to formally evaluate whether Exenatide really is a potential&#xD;
      &quot;neuroprotective&quot; drug, i.e. stops the nerve cells dying in Parkinson's disease, by&#xD;
      conducting a double blind, placebo controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to generate further data to explore whether 48 weeks exposure to Exenatide&#xD;
      has an advantage over placebo based on a standard validated assessment of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      severity (the MDS UPDRS part 3 motor subscale). This will be measured during the &quot;practically&#xD;
      defined OFF medication state&quot; i.e. after patients have withheld their conventional PD&#xD;
      medication overnight. The hypothesis is that Exenatide will be associated with reduced MDS&#xD;
      UPDRS part 3 scores at the study end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further examine the safety and tolerability of 48 weeks exposure to Exenatide in patients&#xD;
      with moderate severity PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect Pharmacokinetic data regarding the degree of penetration of Exenatide across the&#xD;
      blood brain barrier. We hypothesise that any central effects of Exenatide will be mediated&#xD;
      through penetration of Exenatide across the blood brain barrier. Data obtained from rodents&#xD;
      suggests that blood brain barrier penetration is excellent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to use a simple parallel group randomised controlled trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No double blind data to support the use of Exenatide are currently available therefore&#xD;
      equipoise exists. The null hypothesis is that Exenatide (as Bydureon) has no effect on&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial identification of potential participants- patients attending their routine follow up&#xD;
      appointments will be informed about the trial by their neurologist and given a participant&#xD;
      information sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who wish to be considered for inclusion in the trial will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, according to inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria. A narrative of what trial participation entails together with the&#xD;
      participant information sheet will be used to educate potential participants. Each patient&#xD;
      will be aware that they have a 50% chance of being allocated active drug or placebo. They&#xD;
      will confirm their willingness to attend the clinic after an overnight period without their&#xD;
      conventional PD medication. As part of the informed consent, the contact details of the&#xD;
      research team will be given to each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient prior to enrollment into the&#xD;
      trial. All potential patients will be properly informed as to the purposes of the trial and&#xD;
      the potential risks/ benefits known, or that can be reasonably predicted or expected, by an&#xD;
      Investigator trained in Good Clinical Practice. The investigator will retain the original&#xD;
      copy of the Informed Consent Form signed by the patient, a duplicate will be given to the&#xD;
      patient, and a third copy will be filed in the patient's hospital notes. Only the consent&#xD;
      form approved by the relevant trial ethics committee will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation Eligible consenting patients will be randomly allocated into 2 groups to&#xD;
      receive either; Bydureon 2mg subcutaneous injection once weekly for 48 weeks n=30, or&#xD;
      Bydureon placebo subcutaneous injection once weekly for 48 weeks n=30. Randomisation lists&#xD;
      will be sufficiently long to enable continued randomisation should any patients drop out&#xD;
      within the first 12 weeks of the study (prior to the first follow up visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal of medications All patients will continue to have optimal conventional PD&#xD;
      medication administered throughout the trial period with the exception of &quot;off medication&#xD;
      assessments to be performed at 0,12,24,26,48 and 60 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed evaluations of all patients will take place at these time points at the National&#xD;
      Hospital for Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery (NHNN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each assessment the patient will attend the research clinic after an overnight withdrawal&#xD;
      from their conventional PD medications to allow an objective measurement of their PD&#xD;
      disability. Patients unable to tolerate being off medication will not undergo randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests will be performed at each visit. At baseline, Blood tests will include full blood&#xD;
      count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, glucose, HBA1c,&#xD;
      amylase and saved serum. At follow up visits, urea and electrolytes, thyroid function, serum&#xD;
      amylase will be checked and serum will be stored. These samples are to check both safety and&#xD;
      to allow measurement of Exenatide levels to be performed after trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine tests A urine sample will be collected at each visit to allow measurement of exenatide&#xD;
      levels after trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy test will also be performed for females of child bearing potential at the&#xD;
      baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical scales Clinical assessments will be performed at each visit using validated scales&#xD;
      to assess movement and non movement aspects of PD. Vital signs and weight will be measured at&#xD;
      each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS UPDRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3 of this scale (motor subscore) will be scored in the absence and presence of&#xD;
      conventional PD medication. Part 1,2 &amp; 4 of the scale will also be evaluated in the presence&#xD;
      of conventional PD medication (ON state) to evaluate any change in some of the non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms of PD, activities of daily living and the complications of chronic PD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unified Dyskinesia Rating scale. This is considered to be the most useful and objective way&#xD;
      of quantifying dyskinesia severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 day Hauser diary of PD state (Time- On, Off, Troublesome Dyskinesia, Non-troublesome&#xD;
      dyskinesia, Asleep). Diary data allows quantification of the amount of time during a 7 day&#xD;
      period that patients spend in the varying states of movement ability. Patients will bring&#xD;
      with them diaries to quantify their PD control for the preceding 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mattis Dementia Rating scale (DRS-2). This scale is a validated global measure of cognitive&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). This scale allows for physician&#xD;
      quantification of Depression severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PDQ39 (Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39). This is the standard disease specific&#xD;
      measure of quality of life in PD comprising 39 questions. It has been extensively validated&#xD;
      in previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) severity scale. This validated scale is a tool to collect data on&#xD;
      the frequency and severity of 30 non-motor symptoms sometimes experienced by PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EQ5D (a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome). This is a simple 5&#xD;
      question form and visual analogue scale that allows calculation of quality adjusted life&#xD;
      years (QALY) to enable health economic analyses to be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed motor tests Patients will be asked to perform a Sit-stand-walk timed test and timed&#xD;
      keyboard taps with left and right hand separately, in both the OFF medication and ON&#xD;
      medication condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timed Sit-stand-walk test will incorporate time taken from seated position to stand and&#xD;
      walk 10 metres, turn and return to original seated position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed keyboard taps will use online website Braintaptest.com to quantify number of alternate&#xD;
      taps from key &quot;S&quot; to key &quot;;&quot; using a conventional QWERTY (keyboard layout) keyboard in a 30&#xD;
      second period with each hand in turn. The software is validated and records number of key&#xD;
      strokes, dwell time, accuracy &amp; rhythmicity in an automated fashion, is freely available&#xD;
      online, allows for coded repeatable assessments which are pseudo-anonymised, and date/time&#xD;
      stamped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture will be performed at 12 weeks and 48 weeks to allow&#xD;
      measurement of exenatide levels after trial completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DaTSCAN A nuclear medicine scan (DaTSCAN) will be performed at baseline and at the final&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teaching injections Patients will be taught how to self administer injections using online&#xD;
      teaching video with support of trained member of the trial team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant treatments Trial participants will be permitted to use any licensed PD medication&#xD;
      throughout the course of the trial that is recommended by their referring neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses Adverse events will be reviewed at quarterly trial management group (TMG) meetings&#xD;
      and 6 monthly independent Data Monitoring committee (iDMC) meetings. An interim analysis will&#xD;
      be performed when the last patient has reached 24 weeks follow up and results presented to&#xD;
      the iDMC who will make recommendations to the TMG.&#xD;
