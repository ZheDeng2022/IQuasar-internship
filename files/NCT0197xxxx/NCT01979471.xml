  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (disease of the heart and blood vessels) is one of the leading causes&#xD;
      of death in Canada. It also carries a financial burden on the Canadian economy with a yearly&#xD;
      cost close to $21 billion divided between loss of productivity and healthcare costs. The&#xD;
      majority of cardiovascular disease cases (90%) are caused by factors that can be controlled&#xD;
      and modified. These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes (high&#xD;
      blood sugar), tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity, physical inactivity and high alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. Such factors are very common and not very well controlled and so individuals who&#xD;
      have any of these factors would be at risk of having cardiovascular disease. As such&#xD;
      controlling these factors will reduce the risk of having cardiovascular disease and improve&#xD;
      the individuals' quality of life. Pharmacists frequently work with patients and their family&#xD;
      doctor to provide cardiovascular care. Having a pharmacist involved in cardiovascular care&#xD;
      may help patients with cardiovascular disease or at risk of having the disease because they&#xD;
      are more accessible and may have more opportunities to educate people about cardiovascular&#xD;
      medications. This might lead to better prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study will assess if a community pharmacy cardiovascular risk reduction&#xD;
      intervention can help reduce cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual has an elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, waist&#xD;
      circumference or body weight or is physically inactive, have an unhealthy diet, a smoker or&#xD;
      taking medications for any of the previously mentioned conditions, the pharmacist will assess&#xD;
      the cardiovascular disease risk [risk of having a cardiovascular event (e.g. heart attack or&#xD;
      a stroke)] using a computer program. If the individual is at high risk s/he will be asked to&#xD;
      take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual agrees to take part in the study s/he will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the Usual Care Group or the Advanced Care Group. All participants have an equal chance of&#xD;
      being assigned to either group. If assigned to the Usual Care Group, the individual will&#xD;
      receive the care and services that would normally be provided by the pharmacist. At 3 months,&#xD;
      the pharmacist will see the individual who will be offered the Advanced Care at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If assigned to the to Advanced Care Group, the individual will be asked to meet with the&#xD;
      pharmacist every 3-4 weeks over a 3 month period. During these meetings, the pharmacist will&#xD;
      conduct an assessment that may include blood pressure, waist circumference, height and weight&#xD;
      measurements and talk to the individual about their cardiovascular risk and medications. The&#xD;
      individual and the pharmacist will come up with a plan for how to try to lower his/her&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. The pharmacist will discuss this plan with their family doctor. The&#xD;
      individual will be asked to conduct some laboratory tests before the 3 months visit; these&#xD;
      tests may include HbA1c (a blood test to measure blood sugar control over the last 3 months)&#xD;
      and cholesterol to assess the effect of the intervention on cardiovascular risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide accounting for nearly&#xD;
      one third of the total deaths. The majority (90%) of the CVD cases are caused by modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors. These factors include tobacco smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,&#xD;
      physical inactivity, high fat diet and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Canada CVD rates have decreased drastically over the last few decades, yet it is still one&#xD;
      of the leading causes of death. It also carries a financial burden on the Canadian economy&#xD;
      with a cost close to $ 21 billion every year divided between loss of productivity and&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the risks associated with the major CVD risk factors and the treatment advancement,&#xD;
      their prevalence is still substantial in North America. Treatment gaps were also reported&#xD;
      amongst such factors. Al Hamarneh and colleagues (2012) reported that almost 50% of the&#xD;
      community dwelling patients with type 2 diabetes were not at their HbA1c target. Leiter and&#xD;
      colleagues (2013) reported that almost half of the patients with type 2 diabetes did not&#xD;
      achieve their HbA1c or cholesterol target, slightly more than one third achieved their blood&#xD;
      pressure targets and only 13% achieved the composite triple target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The guidelines recommend using cardiovascular risk assessment equations to guide CVD&#xD;
      prevention and management. Despite being recommended by the guidelines, it has not been&#xD;
      integrated in the clinicians' daily routine; in fact the majority of the patients attending&#xD;
      physicians' clinics reported that they have never had a cardiovascular risk assessment. This&#xD;
      indicates the need for new avenues for the patients to get their cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community pharmacists are front-line primary healthcare professionals who see patients with&#xD;
      chronic diseases more frequently than family physicians; as such, they are well positioned to&#xD;
      identify patients at high risk for CVD, determine their CVD risk and assist in their disease&#xD;
      management. The efficacy of pharmacists' intervention in chronic disease has been well&#xD;
      demonstrated in the literature. Two of the largest randomized controlled trials in community&#xD;
      pharmacy setting were conducted by our group. Both studies reported positive impact of the&#xD;
      pharmacist intervention on the patients' lipid panel and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of a community pharmacy-based case finding and intervention program in&#xD;
      patients at high risk for cardiovascular events on reduction in estimated risk for major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvements in individual risk factors: LDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, HbA1c (among&#xD;
           patients with diabetes), and smoking cessation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achievement of recommended cholesterol, blood pressure and glycemic control targets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in proportion of patients receiving appropriate BP, cholesterol and diabetes&#xD;
           medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increase in number of high risk patients screened for cardiovascular risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of various case-finding mechanisms and vulnerable patient population&#xD;
           reach&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assure sustainability by exploring enabling and barrier forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Randomized controlled trial with patients as the unit of randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Community pharmacists in Alberta for recruitment and follow up, engaging both&#xD;
      patients and family physicians&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients/Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults (≥18 years of age) at high risk for cardiovascular events, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with chronic kidney disease [eGFR &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2 and/or (ACR &gt;= 30 mg/mmol&#xD;
           or two consecutive ACR tests which are &gt;= 3 mg/mmol)]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with established atherosclerotic vascular disease including cerebrovascular&#xD;
           disease (prior stroke or transient ischemic attack), cardiovascular disease (myocardial&#xD;
           infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, or revascularization), or peripheral&#xD;
           arterial disease (symptomatic and/or ankle brachial index &lt;0.9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary prevention patients with multiple risk factors and Framingham risk score &gt;20%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to qualify for inclusion, all patients must have at least one uncontrolled risk&#xD;
           factor (i.e., blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, HbA1c, or current smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unwilling to participate/sign consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unwilling or unable to participate in regular follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacists and pharmacy staff are going to use the following methods to recruit patients in&#xD;
      the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      · Proactive recruitment by case-finding facilitators (trained pharmacy technicians,&#xD;
      assistants or pharmacy/medical/nursing students who focus on target prescriptions for oral&#xD;
      hypoglycemic, anti-hypertensive and lipid lowering medications). Pharmacists will check the&#xD;
      most recent lab results for those patients in the course of routine care. If the patient has&#xD;
      not had an eGFR or proteinuria test done over the last 12 months he/she will be given a&#xD;
      request to do those tests with a copy sent to his/her family physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study the patient will be asked if he/she&#xD;
      wants to participate in the study. If the patient agrees on participating he/she will be&#xD;
      asked to sign a written informed consent form. After signing the consent form the patient&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's family physician is going to receive a letter from the pharmacist to inform&#xD;
      him/her that his/her patient agreed to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed written consent is obtained, the patients will be randomized (via a centralized&#xD;
      secure website to ensure allocation concealment) in a 1:1 ratio to either advanced care or&#xD;
      usual care groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the patients randomized to the advanced care group the pharmacist will complete a&#xD;
      Comprehensive Annual Care Plan (CACP) or Standard Medication Management Assessment (SMMA),&#xD;
      which will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient assessment (blood pressure measurement according to CHEP guidelines, waist&#xD;
           circumference, weight and height measurements)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory assessment of HbA1c and lipids (if not done within 3 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual assessment of CVD risk and education about this risk&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Calculation of cardiovascular risk will be facilitated by an online tool in which&#xD;
                the pharmacist enters patient demographics such as age, gender, cholesterol, blood&#xD;
                pressure, smoking status, diabetes, etc and the system will use the appropriate&#xD;
                risk engine based on the patient's medical history. UKPDS, International model to&#xD;
                predict recurrent cardiovascular disease and Framingham will be used for patients&#xD;
                with diabetes, previous vascular disease, CKD or high Framingham risk (&gt;20%)&#xD;
                respectively (see appendix for risk engines score sheets). In the case where a&#xD;
                patient has more than one co-morbidity the risk engine estimating the highest risk&#xD;
                will be used&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discussion of CVD risk with the patient using the interactive online tool which&#xD;
                explains his/her individual cardiovascular risk and targets for intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proving the patient with education on cardiovascular risk factors and healthy&#xD;
                lifestyle options&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Providing treatment recommendations (C-CHANGE and up to date Canadian clinical practice&#xD;
           guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription adaptation(s), and/or prescribe where necessary to meet lipid, blood&#xD;
           pressure and glycemic control targets and smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular communication with the patient's family physician after each contact with the&#xD;
           patient using the physician contact form which will be developed by the research team&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regular follow-up with all patients a minimum of every 3-4 weeks for 3 months (Interim&#xD;
           telephone follow-up may be performed at the discretion of the pharmacist; however&#xD;
           telephone follow-up cannot be used for 2 consecutive visits or for the final visit (3&#xD;
           months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to the usual care group will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual pharmacy care with no specific interventions for 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the end of the 3 months of the usual care period, all patients will cross over to&#xD;
           receive the advanced care outlined above for 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of the results from patients who cross over from the usual care group into the&#xD;
      advanced care group will be conducted separately on before and after design basis.&#xD;
