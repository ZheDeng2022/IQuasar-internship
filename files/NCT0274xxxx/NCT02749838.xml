      Purpose of the Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively identify cancer patients whose tumors express specific molecular&#xD;
           markers targeted by therapeutic agents, for the purpose of selecting the most clinically&#xD;
           appropriate anticancer therapy, including clinical trial opportunities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect and analyze biospecimens from cancer patients, using primarily standard of&#xD;
           care laboratory methods, for the purpose of determining the expression of specific&#xD;
           genotypic and phenotypic disease markers of scientific and medical interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a protocol database, including case and disease stage-matched clinical and&#xD;
           therapeutic history data in addition to patient biomarker profiles, to serve as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a systematic collection of data for comparing patient data to clinical trial&#xD;
                selection criteria for the purpose of informing a clinical investigative site of&#xD;
                available clinical trials matching patient clinical status;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a collection of clinically matched, comprehensive molecular results for scientific&#xD;
                and research and development applications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The molecular understanding of cancer is advancing rapidly, and a new generation of more&#xD;
      effective, targeted cancer drugs are taking center stage in cancer care. Yet the&#xD;
      investigators system for clinical testing of new agents has not kept pace with the revolution&#xD;
      in cancer biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification by genotypic and phenotypic abnormalities further divides histological cancers&#xD;
      into a myriad of clinically distinct subtypes. As cancer therapies become more selective, and&#xD;
      the intent to treat populations and the predictability of patient presentation decrease,&#xD;
      clinical trial enrollment becomes more difficult by traditional methods. A breakout solution&#xD;
      is needed in clinical research methodology, to create a more efficient means of developing&#xD;
      new cancer drugs in the US. Improved methods for the systematic, prospective screening of&#xD;
      cancer patients are needed to identify the subsets of patients whose tumors express molecular&#xD;
      markers targeted by precision therapeutics. This protocol will evaluate clinical samples of&#xD;
      cancer tissue to identify the molecular abnormalities present in individual patients' cancer.&#xD;
      In this context the investigators objective will be to enable physicians to more thoroughly&#xD;
      characterize the molecular abnormalities underlying cancer and to connect eligible patients&#xD;
      to precision treatments as part of optimal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By making trials more accessible and utilizing technology wisely, it should be possible to&#xD;
      match cancer patients to appropriate treatments, including clinical trials, within a&#xD;
      clinically relevant timeframe to bring research opportunities into consideration for best&#xD;
      clinical care.&#xD;
