      The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of strength training on sleep apneas in&#xD;
      the elderly. Individuals aged between 65 and 80 years and that presenting apnea-hypopnea&#xD;
      index between 20 and 50 events per hour, measured by out-of-center portable polysomnography,&#xD;
      will be recruited. Those included will be randomized to two groups: Intervention: consisted&#xD;
      of 12 weeks, twice a week, of strength training; or control: consisted of lifestyle&#xD;
      recommendations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder that exposes the individual to repeated periods&#xD;
      of hypoxia and awakenings during sleep. OSA occurs in up to one third of the population,&#xD;
      constituting a public health problem. The prevalence of sleep apnea increases with age,&#xD;
      reaching up to 90%. Its consequences include sympathetic nervous system activation, increased&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate, myocardial contractility overload, decline in parasympathetic&#xD;
      activity, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, platelet activation, and impaired vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function. OSA is a risk factor for hypertension, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
      peripheral artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. The classical treatment options&#xD;
      for OSA are the use of continuous positive airway pressure, oral appliances for mandibular&#xD;
      advancement, surgery, weight reduction, and lifestyle change, including recommendation of&#xD;
      regular practice of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise is accepted culturally and scientifically as a non-pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention beneficial to health. Aerobic and resistance exercises improve the quality of&#xD;
      sleep. There is evidence of improvement in the general well-being and, particularly in sleep.&#xD;
      Promote or improve sleep through exercise is healthy, safe, and simple. A sedentary lifestyle&#xD;
      is linked with a higher incidence and severity of sleep apnea. Increase in the number of&#xD;
      hours of exercise reduces these problems. Exercise has been used with consistent results to&#xD;
      treat OSA. The effect size of exercise in treatment of OSA ranges between 0.4 and 1.5&#xD;
      standard deviations. In a meta-analysis, totaling 129 participants, the mean effect was the&#xD;
      reduction of 7 events per hour. Although the results of randomized clinical trials and other&#xD;
      studies pointing to the decrease in AHI after physical training, all studies involved adult&#xD;
      populations with an average age between 42 and 54 years. The role of exercise in the elderly&#xD;
      with OSA, the most affected population, remains uninvestigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research question is: What is the effect of strength training on the apnea-hypopnea index&#xD;
      (AHI) in elderly with OSA? The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of strength&#xD;
      training on OSA in the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will recruit individuals aged 65 to 80 years ascribed to a primary care unit linked&#xD;
      to the university hospital. Individuals that accept to participate in the study, will undergo&#xD;
      out-of-center polysomnography in order to detect and quantify the severity of OSA.&#xD;
      Individuals with AHI between 20 and 50 events per hour will be eligible, and will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to the intervention or the control group. Randomization will be performed by&#xD;
      sequence numbers generated by computer at randomization.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals allocated to the intervention group will hold two sessions per week of strength&#xD;
      training consisted of exercises for legs, arms, chest, back, and abdomen in the university&#xD;
      Physical Education High School, during 12 weeks. The individuals allocated to the control&#xD;
      group will receive advice on lifestyle and will participate in the meetings of an elderly&#xD;
      social group in the basic health unit. All individuals from both groups will perform an&#xD;
      evaluation consisting of body composition by bioelectrical impedance, maximum dynamic force&#xD;
      by 1-repetition maximum strength test, quality and muscle thickness by ultrasound, and&#xD;
      physical function by Sit-to-stand test, Timed up and go test and Handgrip strength test. All&#xD;
      evaluations will be repeated at the end of the 12-week period.&#xD;
