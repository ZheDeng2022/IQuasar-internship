  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a naturalistic study of 100 migraineurs and 75 post concussive headache patients who&#xD;
      will be asked to record their headaches, medications, sleep and other behaviors in a&#xD;
      smartphone app called Curelator. The software was developed to identify possible headache&#xD;
      triggers. We seek to determine whether there might be protective headache factors. Patients&#xD;
      will be given audio files with relaxation therapies. We seek to understand whether this self&#xD;
      relaxation therapy and/or traditional evidence based behavioral treatment recommended during&#xD;
      a patient visit is protective against migraine attacks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients will be given a link to audio files on dropbox which they can download onto their&#xD;
      smartphone. They consist of breathing techniques, imaging, progressive relaxation, and more.&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to perform 20 minutes of relaxation therapy at least 3 times a week.&#xD;
      Patients will record their headache frequency and intensity, in addition to other symptoms,&#xD;
      and the frequency of practicing the behavioral therapy using Curelator Headache. ™ Curelator&#xD;
      Inc. (Cambridge USA) has developed a proprietary, non-pharmaceutical, digital platform,&#xD;
      called Curelator Headache,™ to collect daily data, identify trigger-attack associations and&#xD;
      propose 'tests' of trigger modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Curelator approach requires high quality data from the individual, entered on a daily&#xD;
      basis. Compliance is expected to be enhanced because the study if being offered by the&#xD;
      individual's healthcare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This a pilot study of an initial 90 days use of a digital platform to identify potential&#xD;
      migraine protective factors (Curelator Headache™) in subjects with physician-diagnosed&#xD;
      episodic or chronic migraine or post-concussive headache. Subjects are recruited to Curelator&#xD;
      Headache use by a physician and enter data each day. The baseline period (90 days) is&#xD;
      followed by a test period (90 days) during which, under Curelator guidance, subjects make one&#xD;
      or more modifications to their behaviors based on the data from the 90 day period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include up to 100 patients with chronic or episodic migraine and 75 patients&#xD;
      with postconcussive headache. At clinics, investigators will offer participation to&#xD;
      consecutive migraine patients with 6-20 headache days a month and to consecutive concussion&#xD;
      patients complaining of headache more than 1 month post concussive event.&#xD;

    <description>This will be analyzed by means of univariate Cox Proportional Hazards (PH) models. At the end of the study period (Day 90) significant trigger factors (HR/RR&gt;1 and p-value ≤ 0.05) will be identified for each individual: the number and percentage of subjects with at least one significant relationship between a trigger and occurrence of migraine attacks and the number of trigger-migraine attack significant relationships per individual will be estimated by means of descriptive statistics.</description>
