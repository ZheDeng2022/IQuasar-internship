    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of different doses of&#xD;
      ExPEC4V (JNJ-63871860) in healthy Japanese participants greater than or equal to [&gt; =] 20&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1 double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the&#xD;
      treatment), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), placebo-controlled (an&#xD;
      inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has a&#xD;
      real effect in a clinical study) parallel group, single center study in healthy Japanese&#xD;
      participants aged greater than or equal to [&gt; =] 20 years. A target of approximately 48&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled that are stratified according to their age in 2 groups: 24&#xD;
      participants &gt; = 20 to less than [&lt;] 50 years of age and 24 participants &gt; = 50 years of age.&#xD;
      Both groups will be randomized to a single vaccination with 1 of the 3 study dose levels of&#xD;
      ExPEC4V or placebo (vaccine buffer). Participants will be enrolled in a dose ascending&#xD;
      approach. Blood samples will be drawn on Days 1 (prevaccination), 15 and 30 for the&#xD;
      assessment of immunogenicity. The study duration per participant will be approximately 38&#xD;
      days (Screening period and postvaccination follow-up included). Participants' safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
