      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Excessive salinity is common in groundwater aquifers across south-western coastal&#xD;
           Bangladesh. Higher adult mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure and increased risk&#xD;
           of gestational hypertension has been observed among those who drank tube-well water with&#xD;
           high sodium content.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) systems, that inject freshwater into shallow aquifers,&#xD;
           reduce drinking water salinity, have been successfully installed in the south-western&#xD;
           area, providing year-round freshwater. However, the health benefits and risks of MAR&#xD;
           water have not been measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If drinking MAR water can reduce hypertension in adults and pregnant women, while showing&#xD;
      minimal risk of microbiological and chemical contamination, scale up can be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis (if any):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be lower among the adult population who drink&#xD;
      MAR water compared to people drinking saline or brackish groundwater Objectives: To determine&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If providing access to MAR water for drinking and food preparation reduces blood&#xD;
           pressure among the adult population &gt; 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If providing access to MAR water for drinking and food preparation during pregnancy can&#xD;
           reduce blood pressure among pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If MAR water is contaminated with E coli and fecal coliforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether the MAR water is contaminated with dissolved constituents mobilized from aquifer&#xD;
           sediments that are known to be harmful to human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A stepped-wedge RCT will be conducted among communities before and after the intervention&#xD;
      roll out. Study investigators will collect baseline information from all sites in the first&#xD;
      monthly block (step) when no one will drink MAR water. There will be promoters who will&#xD;
      convey messages regarding exclusive use of MAR water for drinking and cooking, at home and&#xD;
      elsewhere. Measurements will be made by trained research assistants once every month. MAR&#xD;
      water, pond water, groundwater and household stored water samples will be collected and&#xD;
      tested once every month.&#xD;

      Study sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a stepped-wedge RCT that will be implemented in 20 MAR communities&#xD;
      All 20 MAR communities will gradually have access to MAR water, but their access will be at&#xD;
      different time periods or steps. Therefore, each MAR site will contribute data for both the&#xD;
      intervention and the control time periods. There will be five, monthly steps in the stepped&#xD;
      wedge trial. In the first monthly step, none of the communities will have MAR water available&#xD;
      for drinking and the baseline information will be collected from all communities. During each&#xD;
      subsequent month, five MAR communities will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention.&#xD;
      In the last (fifth) monthly step, all the communities will have access to MAR drinking water.&#xD;
      Blood pressure of all enrolled participants will be measured during each step. Animal and&#xD;
      human studies suggest change in salt load changes blood pressure within few hours, and a&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized trials suggest modest reduction in salt intake for four or more&#xD;
      weeks causes significant reduction in blood pressure at the population-level. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators will use an interval of at least one month between access to MAR water and&#xD;
      first post-intervention blood pressure measurement, and between two consecutive blood&#xD;
      pressure measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study protocol has been approved by the icddr,b Ethical Review Committee. Informed&#xD;
      written consent will be taken from all participants and household heads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site selection and randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 30 MAR communities that are ready to roll out intervention (access to MAR water to the&#xD;
      community) are located in rural areas in the three districts and 20 MAR communities which can&#xD;
      be reached most effectively based on geographical location will be selected. Water samples&#xD;
      from the selected 20 MAR sites will be collected every month for one year from June, 2016 to&#xD;
      May, 2017 to capture the seasonal variation of microbiological and chemical water quality.&#xD;
      Human health data and biological specimens from the enrolled participants from within the&#xD;
      catchment area of the selected 20 sites will be collected from December, 2016 to May, 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation The sample size of the stepped wedge trial was calculated based on&#xD;
      the primary objective: reduction of systolic blood pressure. Data from southwest Bangladesh&#xD;
      suggest a 7 mmHg lower mean systolic blood pressure among pregnant women who drank pond water&#xD;
      compared to those who drank brackish water, and a 17 mmHg lower mean systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      for pregnant women who drank rainwater compared to those who drank brackish water. The mean&#xD;
      reduction in systolic blood pressure following long term modest salt reduction is 4.2 mmHg.&#xD;
      At least three mmHg of systolic blood pressure reduction has been considered for the current&#xD;
      study among the communities who will have access to MAR water for drinking and cooking&#xD;
      purposes compared to those who will use brackish water. The entire population under the&#xD;
      catchment area of an MAR community will be considered as one cluster. Each MAR community&#xD;
      serves approximately 300 people, constituting 60-70 households in the catchment area. The&#xD;
      mean household size in southwest coastal Bangladesh is 4.2; approximately 52% of household&#xD;
      members are ≥ 20 years. Since blood pressure will be collected for all household members ≥ 20&#xD;
      years, an average of 2.2 participants has been estimated to be in this age group per&#xD;
      household. About 28 households per cluster (28 *2.2 = 60 people per cluster) will be selected&#xD;
      for the study. A previously published study in Bangladesh reported standard deviation (SD)&#xD;
      for systolic blood pressure as 13.51. The sample size of the stepped wedge trial has been&#xD;
      estimated adopting the formula used by Woertman et al. 2013 and Hemming et al. 2015. Woertman&#xD;
      et al. proposed the usual approach of initially calculating the sample size for a simple&#xD;
      unadjusted trial (NU), and then multiplying by the design effect for stepped wedge trial&#xD;
      (DESW). The sample size of simple unadjusted trial was 1,868 participants (effect size= 3,&#xD;
      standard deviation of 20 for both groups, 80% power, and 5% Type I error). The DESW was 3.046&#xD;
      based on formula provided by Woertman et al 2013. Considering a fixed cluster size of 60 and&#xD;
      5% loss-to-follow up, the proposed study will need 20 MAR communities, with five communities&#xD;
      randomized to access MAR water in each step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for the pregnant women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean SBP of the pregnant women south-western coastal Bangladesh is 102.4 mmHg among&#xD;
      individuals who drank rainwater, 112.7 mmHg among filter users, 112.6 among pond water users&#xD;
      and 119.4 among brackish groundwater users (tube-well water). The investigators assumed that&#xD;
      drinking tube-well water may correspond with the dry season information and rainwater data&#xD;
      correspond to the wet season information. Therefore, the assumption is that drinking MAR&#xD;
      water would be able to reduce 17 mm Hg of systolic blood pressure. Considering crude birth&#xD;
      rate of 26/1000 population, the assumption is there may be 88 birth during the seven months&#xD;
      duration of the proposed study. Considering 88 pregnancies, the investigators will have 95%&#xD;
      power to detect the effect of MAR in our main study. Stata command: sampsi 119.4 102.4,&#xD;
      sd1(26.7) sd2(16.2) n1(44) n2(44) Data Analysis Blood Pressure The investigators will conduct&#xD;
      an intention-to-treat analysis. Since the data will be longitudinal and on individual&#xD;
      participants, generalized estimating equations (GEE) will be used with an appropriate&#xD;
      autoregressive correlation structure, to account for repeated measures within individual&#xD;
      study participants, and robust standard errors to allow for possible misspecification of the&#xD;
      variance structure. The outcome is continuous blood pressure, which will be regressed on an&#xD;
      indicator variable for access to MAR water, and dummy variables for the study sites to&#xD;
      account for mean differences between communities... The interpretation of such a GEE model's&#xD;
      output is the population average association of MAR with blood pressure, conditional on study&#xD;
      site. The study investigators will further adjust for age, sex, body mass index, smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol intake, family history of hypertension, and hypertensive medication of the&#xD;
      participants. In secondary analyses, the association between drinking MAR water and urinary&#xD;
      sodium and protein concentrations will be evaluated. For the pregnant women, we will control&#xD;
      for the gestational week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water Quality Metrics T-test will be done to compare the microbial water quality as measured&#xD;
      by the mean log10 MPN count/100 ml water during each monthly step between the MAR water and&#xD;
      nearby pond water samples. The investigators will determine whether the concentration of each&#xD;
      chemical constituent in water samples during each monthly step exceed the WHO recommended&#xD;
      level. We will use similar GEE models as above for the outcomes of the log10 MPN count/100 ml&#xD;
      water, and natural log-transformed (if skewed) concentration of each chemical constituent of&#xD;
      water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referral of hypertensive patients- If research staff members identify hypertensive patients&#xD;
      or cases of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, they will refer patients to the&#xD;
      government health facilities for further management. In addition, research staff will train&#xD;
      pregnant women and family members to recognize the danger signs during pregnancy, and will&#xD;
      also instruct them where to seek medical care if such danger signs appear. During household&#xD;
      visits research staff will encourage pregnant women to attend prenatal visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management All data will be protected confidentially and only delinked personal&#xD;
      information dataset will be used for analysis. The delinked dataset will be publicly&#xD;
      available following publication of the primary result of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative Arrangements This project was co-developed by scientists affiliated with&#xD;
      icddr,b, Emory University, Dhaka University, University College London, and Stanford&#xD;
      University and has been funded by the Wellcome Trust, Our Planet, Our Health Award (GR&#xD;
      01336).. icddr,b will be responsible for implementing the protocol, collecting the data, and&#xD;
