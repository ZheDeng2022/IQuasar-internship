  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of preterm infants less than 32 weeks require respiratory assistance at the&#xD;
      time of transition at birth. For that stabilization during resuscitation is successful, it is&#xD;
      essential for proper ventilation. This transition is performed with non-invasive respiratory&#xD;
      support and administration of positive pressure ventilation to establish adequate functional&#xD;
      residual capacity. The problem is that a peak inspiratory fixed during ventilation, and&#xD;
      adequate tidal volume is assumed, but usually not measured, unable to correct the peak&#xD;
      pressure to optimize ventilation and reduce lung damage. In addition, frequent adverse events&#xD;
      may hinder or impair the effectiveness of the ventilation, with the consequent deterioration&#xD;
      in the prognosis of the newborn.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESIS The ability to visualize the parameters and curves respiratory flow, tidal volume&#xD;
      and air pressure by respiratory monitoring with MFR during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in&#xD;
      newborns in the delivery room, decreases at least 10% surfactant need in first 72 hours of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION Data collection will be made prospectively. Investigators will measure the&#xD;
      parameters of lung mechanics (tidal volume expiratory airflow (TVe), peak inspiratory&#xD;
      pressure (PIP), pressure at the end of exhalation (PEEP), inspiratory time (iT)), in each of&#xD;
      inflations administered to preterm with VPP or during the administration of continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP) in spontaneous breathing, in the first 10 minutes after&#xD;
      birth, recording the air leakage through the mask and obstructions. Investigators also&#xD;
      measure parameters of respiratory status and hemodynamic (FIO 2, oxygen saturation, end tidal&#xD;
      CO2, respiratory rate, heart rate), patient monitoring during the implementation of the&#xD;
      protocol, blood gases, manipulations of the airway during intervention and the onset of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomize in a Group 1, where these parameters of lung mechanics would be&#xD;
      visible and other Group 2, where the parameters of TVe and respiratory flow would not be&#xD;
      visible by the rescuer (the usual parameters of PIP and PEEP will be visible). Always, in&#xD;
      both groups, current recommendations ventilation measures included in cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation of newborns of the Spanish Society of Neonatology, based on international&#xD;
      recommendations (1-3.5) apply. In turn, the results analyzed in two subgroups between 24 and&#xD;
      27 + 6 weeks gestational age and 28 to 32 + 6 weeks.&#xD;
