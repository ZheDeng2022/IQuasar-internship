      The aim of the study is to examine the degree of concordance between presurgical&#xD;
      neuronavigation guided TMS (nTMS) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in identifying hand&#xD;
      motor cortex in adults undergoing epilepsy surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigated transcranial magnet stimulation (nTMS), MagStim RapidStim2 Magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      will be delivered to hand primary motor cortex, with positive and negative functional sites&#xD;
      determined through surface electromyography (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve patients ages 12-60 years, with planned neurosurgery involving&#xD;
      implantation of intracranial subdural electrodes including over the precentral gyrus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigated transcranial magnet stimulation (nTMS), MagStim RapidStim2 Magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      will be delivered to hand primary motor cortex, with positive and negative functional sites&#xD;
      determined through surface electromyography (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be spatial correlation between topographic maps of hand&#xD;
      motor representation obtained through nTMS compared to direct, extra-operative cortical&#xD;
      stimulation performed as part of routine clinical care. A secondary outcome measure will be&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of TMS in the epilepsy patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label feasibility study which applies nTMS to subjects with&#xD;
      incoming epilepsy surgery and pre-surgical motor mapping. No study-related medication changes&#xD;
      are expected -- participants will remain compliant with their regular anticonvulsant regimen&#xD;
      throughout each study phase. All patients will have undergone a complete history and&#xD;
      neurological exam as part of their routine clinical care at the New York University (NYU)&#xD;
      Comprehensive Epilepsy Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fourteen (14) patients will undergo epilepsy surgery with expected subdural grid coverage&#xD;
      over primary motor cortex. Potential subjects will be identified at the weekly&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary epilepsy conference. Subjects must have a recent (&lt;2 years) MRI scan, and&#xD;
      registration of the TMS coil to the MRI scan via the Brainsight neuronavigation system will&#xD;
      be utilized to guide TMS coil placement (Gugino et al 2001). When a presurgical fMRI&#xD;
      (functional magnetic resonance imaging) is available which demonstrates the patient's hand&#xD;
      knob, the fMRI will be used with the Brainsight neuronavigation system. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited and consented during a presurgical clinical visit where the patient's primary&#xD;
      epileptologist will introduce members of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      nTMS mapping&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a session of single-pulse TMS mapping of the motor area, at the&#xD;
      outpatient TMS clinic at NYU Neurology Ambulatory Care Center, at 240 E 38th St 20th Floor&#xD;
      prior their epilepsy surgery according to the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determination of the motor threshold by (1) finding the most excitable region in the&#xD;
           hand knob which elicits the strongest compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in the APB&#xD;
           muscle; (2) finding the motor threshold by determining output stimulation intensity&#xD;
           which generates peak to peak CMAP response above 50 mV (Millivolts) in 5/10 stimulation&#xD;
           cycles (Rossini et al., 1994).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Concurrent EMG will be measured with electrodes placed at APB (abductor policis brevis&#xD;
           atrial premature beat), abductor digiti minimi, flexor carpiradialis muscles. Reference&#xD;
           electrode will be placed at the ipsilateral elbow above the brachial biceps muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mapping of the upper extremity. After determination of the MT (motor threshold), mapping&#xD;
           of the UE(Upper Extremity) will be performed at 110% of the rMT (resting motor&#xD;
           threshold). All positive and negative stimulation sites will be recorded and saved.&#xD;
           Patients will be closely monitored during TMS stimulation. Each subject will have a&#xD;
           complete neurological examined by a neurologist before and immediately after nTMS.&#xD;
           Patients will also be provided a side effects questionnaire after TMS mapping. Patients&#xD;
           will then be asked to keep a 7 day seizure diary after the nTMS session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After epilepsy surgery patients will receive the standard care for post-operative patients&#xD;
      which including close monitoring in ICU overnight. Patients will be transferred to the floor&#xD;
      for further clinical evaluation before discharge. Clinical outcome will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      post-operative clinic visit within 1 month after discharge. The value of a clinical follow up&#xD;
      is to evaluate for any discrepancy between nTMS and DCS, to determine which modality better&#xD;
      predicts functional outcome. Any seizure recurrence or neurological deficit will be recorded&#xD;
      at the follow-up clinical visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to detect strength of spatial correlation between topographic maps of&#xD;
      hand motor representation obtained through noninvasive nTMS compared to direct,&#xD;
      extra-operative cortical stimulation obtained as part of usual clinical evaluation during&#xD;
      epilepsy surgery, as measured by (a) average distance between positive motor mapping sites of&#xD;
      DCS compared to nTMS and (b) degree of concordance between positive and negative motor&#xD;
      mapping sites between DCS and nTMS, to generate positive and negative predictive values, and&#xD;
      (c) average distance between positive motor functional sites of fMRI compared to nTMS.&#xD;
