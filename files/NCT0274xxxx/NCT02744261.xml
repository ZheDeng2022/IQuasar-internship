      The purpose of this study is to (a) adapt existing user sensory perception and experience&#xD;
      (USPE) items/instruments generated for rectal gel/cream formulations to include USPEs&#xD;
      specific to suppository forms for rectal and vaginal use; (b) for both male and female&#xD;
      cohorts: to capture the experience of suppository use in the context of receptive anal&#xD;
      intercourse (RAI); and (c) for female cohort only: to capture the experience of suppository&#xD;
      use in the context of vaginal-penile intercourse (VI), and to compare USPEs of suppository&#xD;
      use in the context of RAI to USPEs of suppository use in the context of vaginal-penile&#xD;
      intercourse.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      HIV prevention is a global public health priority. Providing efficacious prevention methods&#xD;
      that have the greatest likelihood of use will have a profound impact on the public's health.&#xD;
      Critical to their use is &quot;acceptability.&quot; However, current conceptualizations of adherence&#xD;
      and acceptability fail to fully articulate and account for patterns of use and non-use.&#xD;
      Formulation properties are critically important to both drug delivery and the user&#xD;
      experience. Microbicide developers thus have the opportunity to directly control a&#xD;
      formulation's impact on acceptability and adherence to product use, as well as biological&#xD;
      product performance. Microbicide products can and should be developed such that they achieve&#xD;
      performance standards for both these behavioral (user experience) and biological (efficacy)&#xD;
      functions. By incorporating the user experience early on in the product development process,&#xD;
      developers will have the greatest chance of providing at-risk individuals with the best&#xD;
      prevention methods science can provide. Developing prevention products that can be used in&#xD;
      the vagina and/or the rectum and that optimize the user experience in both compartments&#xD;
      increases the likelihood that these products will be used consistently and correctly. The&#xD;
      impact on global public health has the potential to be far-reaching, decreasing HIV and&#xD;
      sexually transmitted infections (STI) incidence and prevalence in both women and men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and Data Collection: This is a formative mixed methods design in which volunteers&#xD;
      (N~20-30; ~10-15 males; ~10-15 females) will first be prescreened for basic study eligibility&#xD;
      using a brief questionnaire. Those who are interested in the study and are eligible based on&#xD;
      their responses to the prescreen will then complete a STI/HIV screening and pregnancy test&#xD;
      (for females).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, participants will evaluate 3 products: 2 distinct suppository&#xD;
      formulations and 1 gel formulation that represent a range of rheological and other&#xD;
      biophysical properties of potential microbicides being designed for rectal/dual compartment&#xD;
      use. Participants will evaluate the experience of suppository use (as compared to gel use) in&#xD;
      the context of receptive anal intercourse (RAI) among males and females, and in the context&#xD;
      of vaginal intercourse (VI) (females). Each participant will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      order in which they will evaluate the 3 products. Participants will be required to complete a&#xD;
      brief phone survey (&lt;3 minutes) every day, beginning the day after they start their first&#xD;
      product evaluation period and continuing until they complete their final study visit&#xD;
      (approximately 10-20 weeks). The phone survey includes a short set of questions about sexual&#xD;
      behavior and product use during the time since the last phone survey (about 24 hours). After&#xD;
      a sexual encounter that includes RAI/VI and study product use, participants will be required&#xD;
      to complete a web survey about their experience with the study product. After a participant&#xD;
      has evaluated all three products, participants complete an individual in-depth interview with&#xD;
      study staff about their experiences with the study products.&#xD;
