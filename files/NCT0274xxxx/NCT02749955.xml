      This study evaluates the feasibility (reach, adoption, safety and implementation) and initial&#xD;
      efficacy (higher linkage to care) of the Partner Services Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PS-PrEP)&#xD;
      intervention versus phone based Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) treatment at 3 months post&#xD;
      randomization among a sample of high risk individuals 18 - 35 years from clinic-based&#xD;
      recruitment and internal referrals from social network based projects. The evaluation of the&#xD;
      intervention will be used to strengthen routine department of public health services linkage&#xD;
      to PrEP care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 150 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seronegative contacts&#xD;
      presenting to sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics for HIV testing and referrals&#xD;
      from the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination (CCHE) network-based projects, ages 18 - 35, in&#xD;
      this study over a period of 18 months referred from University of Chicago clinics and&#xD;
      outreach space that perform HIV Partner Services as well as Expanded HIV testing and Linkage&#xD;
      to Care (XTLC) and Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) partner notification services&#xD;
      on the South Side of Chicago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will undergo consent and complete the baseline assessment within 14&#xD;
      days of eligibility. Subjects will be taken through the baseline assessment includes survey&#xD;
      modules described in detail below (demographics, substance use, mental health and stigma). At&#xD;
      the baseline visit, the investigators will collect data on demographics and sex and&#xD;
      drug-using risk variables. From the common electronic medical record at both clinics, the&#xD;
      investigators will collect data on participants' care providers and health care utilization.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to sign a medical release form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whenever possible, the investigators selected measures: (1) previously tested in HIV&#xD;
      implementation studies, particularly among younger and minority populations and (2) to&#xD;
      maximize comparability to other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Following the baseline assessment, study participants will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of two groups: the Partner Services Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PS-PrEP) intervention group&#xD;
      or the standard of care practice PrEPLine control condition. Study staff will discuss pros&#xD;
      and cons, ethical basis of assigning participants to different arms of a study, of control&#xD;
      and intervention with participants (equipoise induction) to balance the desirability of the&#xD;
      two intervention conditions. Block randomization will be used for allocation to ensure&#xD;
      balanced representation in the two treatment arms (control and intervention) as recruitment&#xD;
      progresses. The randomization assignment will be generated using the R program. Once&#xD;
      randomized, each participant will be given a study identification number and will be&#xD;
      allocated to their respective study condition to begin the trial. Due to the nature of this&#xD;
      intervention, complete masking of participants, investigators, and interventionist is not&#xD;
      possible. The research staff will work directly with the linkage and support group. To help&#xD;
      mitigate possible bias in interviewing, baseline data collection will occur prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, those who are in the intervention group will be taken through the&#xD;
      Session I of the intervention. This may take place on the same day as the consent and&#xD;
      baseline visit, or it may be scheduled at a different time depending the subject's&#xD;
      availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 Week Visit (Intervention Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two week visit is post baseline survey and enhanced linkage to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis&#xD;
      (PrEP) care. During the two week visit the interventionist and the participant will engage in&#xD;
      Session II of the intervention: follow-up sessions to promote PrEP linkage and retention.&#xD;
      During this session, the interventionist will check-in with participant in-person or&#xD;
      telephonically. This follow-up visit will be integrated into Components 2 &amp; 3 of the&#xD;
      intervention, mini-booster sessions and best linkage practices, as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the three-month visit the control and the intervention arms will come in to take their&#xD;
      survey. The survey is composed entirely of survey instruments taken from the baseline survey,&#xD;
      including those that capture attitudes towards PrEP, HIV, risk behaviors, and self-perception&#xD;
      of risk. This survey will allow the research staff to track changes over time with&#xD;
      intermittent assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 Month Visit (Intervention Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention arm will be contacted after six months for a scheduled&#xD;
      mini-booster session. At that time, those participants who report significant barriers to&#xD;
      PrEP adherence, or who express a desire to engage (or re-engage) in linkage to PrEP care will&#xD;
      be scheduled for an additional in-person intervention session. The purpose of this follow-up&#xD;
      sessions is to assess (and re-assess) the success of the linkage to PrEP care, to address&#xD;
      barriers to PrEP adherence, and to refine participants' &quot;linkage roadmap&quot; to support future&#xD;
      PrEP adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 Month Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the twelve month visit the control and the intervention arms will come in to take&#xD;
      their survey. The survey is composed entirely of survey instruments taken from the baseline&#xD;
      survey, including those that capture attitudes towards PrEP, HIV, risk behaviors, and&#xD;
      self-perception of risk. This survey will allow the research staff to track changes over time&#xD;
      with intermittent assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linkage and Support Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 1 Face to face intervention Session 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first and main component of the PS-PrEP intervention consists of an intervention session&#xD;
      with the study participant which takes approximately 65 minutes. The structure and content of&#xD;
      the face to face session is theoretically and empirically grounded, and review four primary&#xD;
      content areas: (1) to provide information on PrEP and an overview of the linkage to care&#xD;
      process; (2) to introduce participants to the cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) framework;&#xD;
      (3) to use Motivational Interviewing techniques to build upon participants' motivation to&#xD;
      reduce their HIV risk; and (4) to develop a plan to address barriers to PrEP linkage through&#xD;
      the development of a Linkage Roadmap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conceptual framework guiding this session is the Information Motivation Behavior (IMB)&#xD;
      model, designed to target the client's knowledge, personal and social motivation to engage in&#xD;
      linkage, and their self-efficacy and objective ability (i.e., behavioral skills) to follow&#xD;
      through with linkage to PrEP care. In addition, the session also provides clients with the&#xD;
      knowledge and skills necessary to target their motivational readiness (i.e., their stage of&#xD;
      change), expectancies and self-efficacy to get linked to care, thus, targeting determinants&#xD;
      of linkage to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first area is informational and reviews PrEP in general and linkage to PrEP care. PrEP&#xD;
      knowledge is adapted from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) training modules that are part&#xD;
      of the Sustainable Health Center Implementation PrEP Pilot (SHIPP) project. Linkage best&#xD;
      practices are based upon linkage to HIV care and our current practices within the University&#xD;
      of Chicago, XTLC and the CDPH linkage to care working group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second area is based on the CBT framework that focuses on examining one's relationship&#xD;
      between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. CBT has been shown to be an effective intervention&#xD;
      technique to improve both psychosocial outcomes as well as medical adherence in a variety of&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third area of Motivational Interviewing focuses on motivational processes that facilitate&#xD;
      change within an individual Motivational Interviewing is a fundamentally client-centered and&#xD;
      collaborative clinical approach, which honors patients' autonomy and is guided by patients'&#xD;
      own intrinsic motivation for change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the fourth component of this session, the Linkage Roadmap, is adapted from the&#xD;
      intervention research of Safren et al. and utilizes CBT techniques to promote health and&#xD;
      medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS. Through the vehicle of the Linkage&#xD;
      Roadmap, the client and interventionist will collaboratively develop an individualized PrEP&#xD;
      linkage, adherence, and retention plan. In the process, the interventionist will lead the&#xD;
      client through a problem-solving activity to identify and address anticipated barriers to&#xD;
      PrEP linkage. This interactive activity targets the behavioral skills component of IMB and&#xD;
      the expectancies and self-efficacy, and has been utilized in a wide range of HIV/AIDS-related&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 2 (Weeks 1-12) Mini-Booster Sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The booster sessions, as outlined in the final section of the Intervention Manual, will be&#xD;
      conducted by the using a method selected by the subject which can include a by phone call,&#xD;
      text messaging, or private message through social networking such as Facebook and will be&#xD;
      relatively short in duration (5-6 minutes). This second component will be completed in tandem&#xD;
      with component 3 below. The primary purposes of the boosters are to &quot;check-in&quot; with the&#xD;
      client about their experience getting linked to care, to answer any questions they may have&#xD;
      with respect to the, to review the Linkage Roadmap, and to problem solve with them if they&#xD;
      have been experiencing any difficulties enacting the Linkage Roadmap. The structured content&#xD;
      of each booster session will map directly onto a component of the face to face intervention&#xD;
      session that lasted for 25 minutes (therefore four 5-6 minute structural content components).&#xD;
      In our experience, a combination of synchronous and asynchronous communication has been&#xD;
      effective in piloting the mini-boosters. A large body of research indicates that brief&#xD;
      telephonic booster sessions (synchronous communication) offered as supplemental support to&#xD;
      multi-component interventions similar to the proposed PS-PrEP protocol are associated with&#xD;
      increased and sustained behavior change. The idea is to keep intervention content and form&#xD;
      salient and to provide the participant with individualized support to utilize the skills and&#xD;
      information imparted during the face-to-face intervention. In total, the investigators will&#xD;
      deliver 4 booster sessions. The first two booster sessions will occur once every week for the&#xD;
      first two weeks and the second two boosters monthly thereafter. Booster sessions will&#xD;
      continue until the client has either been linked to care (completed 2 clinic visits) or the&#xD;
      three month linkage to care window has closed. The flexibility of the booster sessions are&#xD;
      designed to tailor the intervention to participants who may need a higher level of support to&#xD;
      adhere to the Linkage Roadmap. All booster sessions will begin according to procedures to&#xD;
      maintain confidentiality reviewed by the interventionist at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 3 (Weeks 1-12) Best linkage practices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the entire intervention period, research staff will engage the participant in best&#xD;
      linkage practices, as introduced in Module C of Session I of the intervention, the &quot;Linkage&#xD;
      Roadmap,&quot; and incorporated into subsequent follow-up and booster sessions. This component&#xD;
      will be conducted in tandem with component 2 above. Best linkage practices have been&#xD;
      developed by the CDPH linkage working group have been adopted by HIV Focus. The linkage&#xD;
      includes accompanying participants to the first and second PrEP clinical appointment. The&#xD;
      research staff is not permitted to transport participants in their personal vehicle, however,&#xD;
      will provide transportation vouchers as needed. The research staff will accompany&#xD;
      participants to their first two medical appointments, unless participants state that they do&#xD;
      not want to be accompanied. When at the clinic, the research staff will ask the participant&#xD;
      if they would like to be accompanied when in the exam room. While waiting for the first&#xD;
      appointment, the research staff will clearly explain the role of the clinic staff and the&#xD;
      purpose of the additional clinic testing. The participants will be introduced to new faces&#xD;
      and information during the first appointment. The research staff will continually clarify&#xD;
      their role (ie. that they will not serve as participant's health care provider or case&#xD;
      manager) and that any questions or concerns should be directed to the health care provider.&#xD;
      During the second appointment, the research staff will help facilitate provider efforts to&#xD;
      engage the participant, clarifying and addressing patient and provider concerns. The&#xD;
      participant will be gently reminded during this second appointment that it will be the last&#xD;
      appointment that the research staff will attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL CONDITION (Low Threshold Prevention Group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control condition for clients testing HIV negative through clinic-based recruitment and&#xD;
      internal referrals includes a brief risk assessment, (which will occur prior to consenting of&#xD;
      a subject on the study) conducted by the University of Chicago, CDPH clinic staff, and&#xD;
      referral for additional STI testing and provision of information regarding other HIV&#xD;
      prevention programming (including PrEP). Clients will receive low threshold intervention&#xD;
      through the PrEP Line, a phone-based PrEP linkage intervention. The PrEPLine Linkage to Care&#xD;
      Specialist (LTC) will establish contact with client, facilitate an initial interview to&#xD;
      provide PrEP education, collect necessary patient information and build rapport. Once&#xD;
      relevant information is collect, if the participant is interested and eligible for PrEP, LTC&#xD;
      specialist will collaboratively determine most appropriate PrEP provider (based on location,&#xD;
      insurance, and patient preference) and will offer to schedule initial PrEP appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once clients engage in PrEP care, routine care is comprehensive and is adapted from the CDC's&#xD;
      and Fenway Institute's interim guidance for clinicians considering the use of PrEP (with an&#xD;
      update for injecting drug users).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Chicago faculty clinicians at both clinical PrEP sites, University of&#xD;
      Chicago and Access Grand Boulevard, also provide HIV primary care services and include mental&#xD;
      health services and psychosocial support services. The initial visit of an eligible PrEP&#xD;
      client is primarily to receive information on PrEP and undergo an initial medical assessment,&#xD;
      usually with follow-up 2 weeks later. In contrast to Ryan White HIV/AIDS Programming for HIV&#xD;
      infected clients, there is no formal intake visit with case management follow-up which&#xD;
      affords a much more streamlined process for care provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The referral to STI testing and HIV prevention programming (including PrEP) by disease&#xD;
      intervention specialist staff, potential visits with PrEP care providers including any&#xD;
      required mental health services that occur during the first 2 weeks and then at 3 month&#xD;
      intervals thereafter constitute treatment as usual.&#xD;
