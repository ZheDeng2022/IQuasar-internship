  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study of continuous oral dosing of AZD4635&#xD;
      administered to patients with advanced solid malignancies. Dosing will be escalated until a&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) is determined in patients. The MTD will be defined by&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity. The study design allows an escalation of dose with intensive safety&#xD;
      monitoring to ensure the safety of the patients. Expansion cohorts will further assess safety&#xD;
      and preliminary anti-tumor activity in a variety of advanced solid tumor malignancies. Other&#xD;
      dosing schedules and/or combinations may be evaluated based on the emerging PK and safety&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 monotherapy when given orally (PO) to&#xD;
           patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD4635 monotherapy&#xD;
           capsule formulation when given to patients with advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 PO when given in combination with&#xD;
           durvalumab, durvalumab plus oleclumab, or docetaxel to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           malignancies and to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 in combination&#xD;
           with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of AZD4635 in combination with abiraterone&#xD;
           acetate or enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and immune effects of AZD4635 when administered in&#xD;
           combination with durvalumab to patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have&#xD;
           previously received immunotherapy (Phase 1b portion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 capsule formulation in combination&#xD;
           with durvalumab and oleclumab when given to patients with mCRPC or advanced solid tumor&#xD;
           malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the RP2D of AZD4635 capsule formulation in combination with durvalumab and&#xD;
           oleclumab when given to patients with mCRPC or advanced solid tumor malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD4635 capsule formulation in combination&#xD;
           with docetaxel when given to patients with mCRPC or advanced solid tumor malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the RP2D of AZD4635 capsule formulation in combination with docetaxel when given&#xD;
           to patients with mCRPC or advanced solid tumor malignancy.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in two segments. The first segment of the study, designated Phase&#xD;
      1a, will be a dose escalation design in order to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ascending doses of AZD4635 as&#xD;
      monotherapy, in combination with durvalumab or durvalumab plus oleclumab, in combination with&#xD;
      docetaxel, and in combination with either abiraterone acetate or with enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A capsule formulation of AZD4635 will be evaluated in 3 arms (arms CA, CB, and CC). An oral&#xD;
      nanoparticle suspension in water constituted extemporaneously by the patient will be&#xD;
      administered in all other treatment arms. Most patients who started therapy with the&#xD;
      nanoparticle suspension will transition to the capsule dosage form depending on the arm they&#xD;
      are assigned to and emerging data. Active patients in arms C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, KD, and&#xD;
      L should be offered the option to transition to the capsule formulation at the discretion of&#xD;
      the Investigator in discussion with the Medical Monitor. Patients in study arms AA and AE&#xD;
      receiving AZD4635 as the nanoparticle suspension should change over to the capsule&#xD;
      formulation as soon as possible at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation arms are described as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms A, B, and C (dose escalation of AZD4635 monotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms CA, CB, and CC. In arm CA, the safety, tolerability and PK of the capsule&#xD;
           formulation will be assessed in approximately 6 patients with advanced solid&#xD;
           malignancies to ensure at least 5 patients have evaluable pharmacokinetic sampling. An&#xD;
           additional 12 patients will be enrolled in this arm. Arm CB will assess the safety and&#xD;
           tolerability and determine the RP2D of the AZD4635 capsule plus durvalumab and oleclumab&#xD;
           in approximately 12 patients. Arm CC will assess the safety, tolerability and determine&#xD;
           the RP2D of AZD4635 capsule plus docetaxel in approximately 12 patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arms D and E [dose escalation of AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab anti-programmed&#xD;
           death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arms A through E enrolled 38 patients in Phase 1a in order to establish the Recommended Phase&#xD;
      2 Dose (RP2D) of the nanoparticle suspension formulation of AZD4635 as a single agent or in&#xD;
      combination with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ● Arms EA and AA. Arms EA and AA [dose escalation of AZD4635 in combination with either&#xD;
      abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mRCPC)]. The AZD4635 plus hormonal therapy cohorts will&#xD;
      enroll concurrently. Patients who previously received abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, or&#xD;
      apalutamide as part of their prior treatments for mCRPC may be enrolled to the enzalutamide&#xD;
      plus AZD4635 arm (Cohort EA) or the abiraterone acetate plus AZD4635 arm (Cohort AA) at the&#xD;
      discretion of the Investigator. Approximately 24 to 48 patients with mCRPC will be treated in&#xD;
      the AZD4635 plus hormonal therapy arms in order to establish the RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase 1a approximately 90-132 patients will be treated with AZD4635 as a single agent or&#xD;
      in combination with durvalumab, durvalumab plus oleclumab, docetaxel, abiraterone acetate or&#xD;
      enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second segment of the study, designated Phase 1b, will further assess the safety and&#xD;
      preliminary activity in the expansion arms described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm F - AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab. Post-immunotherapy non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer (NSCLC). [15 patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm G - AZD4635 monotherapy. Post-immunotherapy NSCLC. [15 patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm H - AZD4635 monotherapy. Immune checkpoint resistant malignancies, previously&#xD;
           treated with approved immunotherapy and progressed or responded and then stopped&#xD;
           responding (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, or MSI high cancers&#xD;
           which have approved settings for anti-PD-1 treatment).[20 patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I - AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab. Immune checkpoint naïve mCRPC.[40&#xD;
           patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm J - AZD4635 monotherapy. Immune checkpoint naïve CRPC. [40 patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm K - AZD4635 monotherapy. Immune checkpoint naïve colorectal carcinoma (CRC). CRC,&#xD;
           excluding MSI high, which has not been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. [20&#xD;
           patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm KD - AZD4635 in combination with durvalumab. Immune checkpoint naïve CRC. CRC,&#xD;
           excluding MSI high, which has not been treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. [20&#xD;
           patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm L - AZD4635 monotherapy. Other solid tumours immune checkpoint naïve.&#xD;
           Relapsed/refractory tumors which have not been treated with immune checkpoint&#xD;
           inhibitors. [20 patients]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned between open-label arms with AZD4635 monotherapy and&#xD;
      AZD4635 combined with durvalumab in NSCLC (Arms F/G) and mCRPC (Arms I/J) in order to&#xD;
      minimize bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CRC, excluding MSI high, will be enrolled to AZD4635 monotherapy (Arm K) and&#xD;
      AZD4635 combined with durvalumab (Arm KD) in patients with CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some arms will have a mandatory biopsy subgroup to ensure sufficient tissue is collected to&#xD;
      assess the mechanism of action in tissue without excluding patients with nonbiopsiable&#xD;
      disease. Biopsies are optional in all other arms.&#xD;
