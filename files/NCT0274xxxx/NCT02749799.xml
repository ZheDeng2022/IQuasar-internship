      The purpose of this study is to assess clinical response and patient satisfaction when DFD-01&#xD;
      is used topically twice a day for moderate plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, multi-dose, open-label study was designed to assess clinical response and&#xD;
      patient-reported satisfaction after dosing with DFD-01 twice daily for 28 days. The product&#xD;
      was approved for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis by the FDA on February 5,&#xD;
      2016 before the first patient was enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty five (45) adult males and females, 18 years of age and older with a clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      of moderate plaque psoriasis who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized at the&#xD;
      Baseline Visit. Each site attempted to enroll 50% of the patients with 3% to 10% body surface&#xD;
      area (BSA) involved and 50% of the patients with &gt; 10% BSA involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial dose of study product was self-administered by the patient and supervised by&#xD;
      clinic staff during the Baseline Visit. Patients continued to apply the study product to all&#xD;
      affected areas (avoiding the face, scalp, groin, axillae or other intertriginous areas) twice&#xD;
      daily (approximately 12 hours apart) for 28 days. Patients visited the clinic for a total of&#xD;
      up to five scheduled visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening (Day -60 to 1)*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline (Day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interim Visit (Day 8 ± 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interim Visit (Day 14 ± 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of Study (Day 29 ± 3)&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Day 14.</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change in the IGA score from baseline to Day 14 was assessed. IGA score is a static assessment of disease severity and is based on overall severity of signs at each visit. It's a 4-point scale where '0' is absent disease and '4' is 'Severe/Very Severe' disease. A lower score at the end of the study compared to baseline (negative change), indicates an improvement in the disease condition.</description>

    <description>Change in the BSA of involvement with psoriasis from baseline to Day 14 was assessed. BSA was assessed at Baseline, Days 8, 14 and 29.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Day 14.</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. The participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best. A lower score (i.e., negative change score) indicates improvement in the Quality of Life.</description>

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception during the&#xD;
             study which can include abstinence with an adequate secondary option should the&#xD;
             patient become sexually active. A female is considered of childbearing potential&#xD;
             unless she is:&#xD;

             required to practice a reliable method of contraception and may be enrolled at the&#xD;
             Investigator's discretion provided that they are counseled to remain sexually inactive&#xD;
             for the duration of the study and understand the possible risks involved in getting&#xD;
             pregnant during the study. An abstinent female must agree that if she becomes sexually&#xD;
             active during the study she will use an acceptable form of contraception.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Presence of pigmentation, extensive scarring, pigmented lesions, tattoos or sunburn&#xD;

        <title>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</title>
        <description>DLQI is a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains ten items dealing with the participant's skin. The participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from &quot;Very Much&quot; (score 3) to &quot;Not at All&quot; or &quot;Not relevant&quot; (score 0). The DLQI total score is derived by summing all item scores, which has a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best. A lower score (i.e., negative change score) indicates improvement in the Quality of Life.</description>
