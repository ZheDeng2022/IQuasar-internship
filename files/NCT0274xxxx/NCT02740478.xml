  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to prove that the Reassure10.5 GHz sensor is equivalent in&#xD;
      performance to the SomnoScreen Plus RC in indicating the breathing rate of adult subjects&#xD;
      over a number of hours when the subjects are lying still or in bed asleep&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each recording comprised at least 2 hours duration. The subject was lying on a bed, wearing&#xD;
      the SomnoScreen and with the Reassure on a bed-side table in the recommended position: at&#xD;
      arm's length, pointing at the subject's upper torso.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject was asked to lie in set positions on the bed for 20 minutes at a time. The data&#xD;
      was recorded continuously for the duration of the trial and so encompassed the acts of&#xD;
      turning from one position to another and any minor movement made by the subject. If the&#xD;
      subject fell asleep during the trial, they were only woken when it came time for the next&#xD;
      position change.&#xD;

    <description>The respiration rate measured contemporaneously by the Reassure and the reference device, SomnoScreen, are compared on a second-by-second basis, over the whole recording duration. The difference between the two respiration rate measurements (the delta) for all 20 subjects' recordings are plotted on a normal distribution chart, giving 130,000 data points. The distribution chart reveals the mean difference between the two devices' measurements and the Standard Deviation (SD). The measure of success is if the 95% (ie 2SD) of the difference in the respiration rate indicated by the two devices (the delta) is less than 5 breaths per minute. This measure is derived from the peer review paper by Lim et al, cited in the References section</description>
