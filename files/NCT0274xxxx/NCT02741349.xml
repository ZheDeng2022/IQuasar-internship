      The aim of the present prospective study is to further develop and validate a composite risk&#xD;
      score predicting both ischemic and bleeding risk, based on epidemiologic, clinical,&#xD;
      biological, and/or morphologic complementary data. First, the investigators will assess the&#xD;
      predictive performance of current clinical risk scores. Second, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      the potential predictive value of additional markers. Third, the investigators will aim to&#xD;
      develop a new risk score.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) have an excessive risk of arterial thromboembolic&#xD;
      disease and heart failure, resulting in higher rates of cardiovascular and all-cause&#xD;
      mortality in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence and incidence of Non-Valvular AF (NVAF) is rapidly increasing across developed&#xD;
      countries. cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality rates related to AF have increased&#xD;
      between 1990 and 2010, irrespective of sex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determinants of AF (heart disease and/or cardiovascular risk factors), are themselves&#xD;
      associated with an excess risk of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary prevention of NVAF relies on the control of modifiable risk factors, such as&#xD;
      overweight, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco consumption which are associated&#xD;
      with the risk of AF risk and its complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preventive treatment of cardiovascular complications is based on anti-thrombotic treatment,&#xD;
      which reduces the global ischemic risk but at the expense of an increase of bleeding risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment decisions are guided by the evaluation of ischemic and hemorrhagic risks, as&#xD;
      determined by clinical scores (like CHADS2; CHA2DS2-VASc; HAS-BLED) that have been validated&#xD;
      on varying populations through retrospective cohort studies. However, since their&#xD;
      publication, these clinical scores have been criticized regarding their predictive value, the&#xD;
      lack of precision in the definition of their component and the threshold defined for&#xD;
      treatment decisions. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the interest of&#xD;
      biomarkers in addition to clinical parameters to predict the risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications in AF. For example, preliminary data suggest that the dosage of Brain-type&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal (NT) Pro-BNP, troponin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and&#xD;
      all indicators whose levels increase independently of their usual causes may contribute to a&#xD;
      better prediction of cardiovascular complications including all-cause mortality in NVAF. Of&#xD;
      note, the rate of major bleeding events was very low (1.5 per cent among 3,978 patients from&#xD;
      the Euro Heart Survey on AF with complete follow-up) in the HAS-BLED validation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that epidemiologic, clinical, biologic, and morphologic complimentary data&#xD;
      could improve the stratification of cardiovascular risk in NVAF. Biologic and&#xD;
      echocardiographic approaches, in particular, could improve the performance of routinely used&#xD;
      clinical scores. Consequently, identification of a state of inflammation, hypercoagulability,&#xD;
      or increased circulating concentrations of certain biomarkers could explain the increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular events in AF. Furthermore, the morphologic repercussions of NVAF,&#xD;
      including left atrium dilation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, as well as the&#xD;
      presence of left atrial appendage stasis indicators, could also help refine the risk&#xD;
      stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous retrospective survey, the investigators have shown that biomarkers and&#xD;
      echomarkers could better stratify AF patients at increased cardiovascular risk. However, due&#xD;
      to its retrospective design and the lack of completeness, the investigators could not&#xD;
      validate a new risk score including all these markers and taking into account both&#xD;
      thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk. Indeed, these usual biologic and morphologic parameters&#xD;
      will be obtained at admission in all patients in a prospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Professor Ariel COHEN is the coordinating investigator of the study. A Clinical Research&#xD;
      Associate working within the Cardiology Service of the Saint-Antoine Hospital will monitor&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study duration is 5 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion period: 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End of study: 2 years after the end of inclusion period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up: the follow-up period will run for 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion: The inclusion visit will occur during the patient's hospitalization for NVAF in&#xD;
      the Cardiology Department. At the inclusion visit, information will be collected regarding&#xD;
      the patient's history of clinical events, current risk factors and treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: After hospital discharge, each patient will be seen every six month throughout the&#xD;
      two year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up period, information on clinical events, changes in risk factors and&#xD;
      treatments occurring since the last follow-up contact will be collected for each patient, a&#xD;
      blood sample will be collected, and an echocardiography will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of preceding events and follow-up information will be supported by both&#xD;
      clinical exams and medical file evaluation. Interviews with general practitioners and the&#xD;
      patients themselves will also be used in order to collect all necessary information. In the&#xD;
      event of hospitalization, hospitalization reports will be collected. In cases of events&#xD;
      without hospitalization, general practitioner correspondence and prescription records will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NVAF will receive anti-thrombotic treatment, in accordance with routine care&#xD;
      and European society of cardiology (ESC) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of anti-thrombotic treatment will be entirely at the discretion of the attending&#xD;
      physician during hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information describing all treatments received by each patient will be collected throughout&#xD;
      the study, from the inclusion visit to the final follow-up contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All echocardiographic procedures will be performed in the echocardiographic laboratory of&#xD;
      each Cardiology Department. Cardiologists specialized in echocardiographic examination will&#xD;
      perform all echocardiographic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo an echocardiographic examination at their inclusion and at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit occurring every 6 months. The objective of the echocardiographic examinations&#xD;
      is the identification of cardiac conditions and diseases that may be associated with AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome variables The primary outcome variable is a composite cardiovascular endpoint&#xD;
      including stroke, transitory ischemic attack, thromboembolism, acute heart failure, acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome, major bleeding and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Major bleeding will be defined according to international society on thrombosis and&#xD;
      haemostasis (ISTH) criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of each of the following events will be determined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  death (all-cause and cardiovascular)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  major bleeding episodes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be included in the analysis. Participants who withdrew their&#xD;
      consent will be excluded from any analysis. Participants who had no event or those who were&#xD;
      lost to follow-up (impossibility of contact for more than 24 months) will be included up to&#xD;
      the date of their last contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event free survival is defined as the time period from the day of enrollment in the study to&#xD;
      the day of the event or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival will be calculated for each patient starting at their enrollment until their&#xD;
      death or the end of follow-up. One analysis per event type will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One vital status research will be conducted for each participant lost to follow-up; where&#xD;
      appropriate a cause of death research will be undertaken. To deal with the possibility for a&#xD;
      same patient to present multiple events, we will consider competing risk models.&#xD;
