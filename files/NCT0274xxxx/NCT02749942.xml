      Objective The objective of this study is to investigate if long-term ambulatory remote&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning can improve symptoms and signs of peripheral arterial disease in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a vast socioeconomic challenge in the&#xD;
      community of diabetes patients, causing foot ulcers and lower extremity amputations. The main&#xD;
      treatment option for the complication is operative revascularisation. Thus there is a need&#xD;
      for new treatment modalities for diabetes patients with PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is at non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment which has&#xD;
      been shown to attenuate tissue damage caused by ischemia e.g. in hearts subjected to&#xD;
      ischemia. RIC treatment consists of brief repetitive periods of ischemia induced in an&#xD;
      extremity e.g. an arm. Recent findings show that six week RIC treatment improves healing of&#xD;
      diabetic foot ulcers, suggesting a possible effect on the underlying pathological causes of&#xD;
      ulcers e.g. PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that RIC treatment can improve markers of&#xD;
      inflammation, vascular and neuronal function and the sense of empowerment in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      patients with reduced peripheral blood supply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim to conduct a single center double-blinded randomized placebo controlled study&#xD;
      investigating the efficacy of home based 12-week RIC treatment on markers of vascular,&#xD;
      neuronal function, inflammation and serum lipid composition in 40 type 2 diabetes patients&#xD;
      from Steno Diabetes Center with non-critical PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      to qualitatively investigate the experience of empowerment related to the use of Remote&#xD;
      Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) treatment and the mechanisms affecting if and how participants&#xD;
      take up the RIC treatment.&#xD;

      Objective The driving objective of this study is to investigate if long-term ambulatory&#xD;
      remote ischemic conditioning can improve symptoms and signs of peripheral arterial disease&#xD;
      and the sense of empowerment in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is vast challenge in the community of diabetes&#xD;
      patients. The prevalence of PAD in diabetes patients exceeds that of non-diabetic individuals&#xD;
      and is estimated to be about 26% in diabetes patients over 65 years of age and 71% in&#xD;
      patients over 70 years . PAD is the major cause of foot ulcers and lower extremity&#xD;
      amputations, which has great socioeconomic implications . The main treatment option for the&#xD;
      complication is operative revascularisation which in diabetes patient is associated with&#xD;
      increased rates of complication and mortality compared to non-diabetes patients .&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment with e.g. anti-platelet drugs in patients with PAD has shown effect&#xD;
      on walking distance has not been indorsed as standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus there is a need for new treatment options for diabetes patients with PAD. Remote&#xD;
      ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment that has been&#xD;
      shown to attenuate tissue damage caused by ischemia, reducing infarct size in patients with&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction , reducing organ damage in patient undergoing transplantation and&#xD;
      having neuroprotective effects in patients with stroke .&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC treatment consists of brief repetitive periods of ischemia induced in an extremity e.g.&#xD;
      an arm. It is believed that the effect of RIC is mediated through both neuronal and humoral&#xD;
      pathways, however the mechanisms behind are not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC has been shown to have beneficial effects by attenuating platelet activation and&#xD;
      aggregation, improving endothelial function , improvement of microcirculation ,&#xD;
      down-regulation of neutrophil function , down-regulation of inflammatory gene expression ,&#xD;
      improving mitochondrial function and inducing changes in serum lipid composition One of few&#xD;
      long-term RIC treatment studies has shown that twice daily RIC treatment for 300 days is&#xD;
      feasible. The study showed that RIC could reduce the recurrence of stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
      . No studies are presently investigating the effect of long-term RIC on PAD in diabetes&#xD;
      patients (Clinicaltrials.gov search 22nd of October 2015), the concept has however recently&#xD;
      been presented in the literature . Two studies have addressed the acute effect of one RIC&#xD;
      treatment on walking distance in non-diabetic patients with claudication. The results were&#xD;
      inconclusive due to small sample sizes, but a trend towards improvement was shown. It is&#xD;
      however likely that long-term RIC treatment is needed to show a beneficial effect of RIC on&#xD;
      the pathology behind claudication - vascular and neuronal damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis We hypothesize that the long-term RIC treatment can improve PAD. PAD is caused by&#xD;
      both micro- and macrovascular deficits. Reduced microvascular circulation can lead to distal&#xD;
      nerve damage which in turn can both reduce peripheral circulation and cause tissue&#xD;
      degeneration. Reduced macro vascular function is a direct cause of peripheral ischemia (2).&#xD;
      It is possible that RIC could attenuate the pathophysiological processes in the micro- and&#xD;
      microvasculature related to PAD by the abovementioned mechanisms and thereby improving of&#xD;
      both neuronal and vascular function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the present clinical evidence of the beneficial effects of RIC may be translated into a&#xD;
      new safe and simple non-invasive non-pharmacological treatment of PAD in diabetes patients,&#xD;
      preventing progression to critical ischemia and amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also hypothesize that home-based and self-administered RIC treatment can improve the sense&#xD;
      of empowerment in patients with non-critical peripheral arterial disease and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      to study the underlying mechanisms of the effects of long-term ambulatory RIC by&#xD;
      investigating the effect on vascular function, neuronal function, markers of inflammation,&#xD;
      oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and lipidomic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim to study the the experience of the use of RIC treatment and with focus on&#xD;
      barriers that affect the uptake of the RIC treatment, and the effects of treatment on life&#xD;
      quality and empowerment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study will consist of a single-center randomised double blinded placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be performed to investigate the beneficial effects of RIC treatment on the&#xD;
      study outcomes described below. The RIC treatment duration will be 12 weeks and 40 patients&#xD;
      from the Steno Diabetes Center will be included in the trial. All tests and analyses will&#xD;
      performed at Steno Diabetes Center expect for markers of inflammation and oxidative stress&#xD;
      which will be performed at Dept. of inflammation, German Diabetes Center and institute of&#xD;
      Clinical Diabetology, German Diabetes Center. All necessary facilities are available at the&#xD;
      study sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most present knowledge of the beneficial effects of RIC listed above has come from short term&#xD;
      trials (duration = 1 day. 20 days for one study) with small populations (n â‰¤ 40). Thus it is&#xD;
      plausible that the study setup will yield significant differences in outcomes between the&#xD;
      study arms. The study may also indicate if changes in outcomes will occur post RIC treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the qualitative part of the study relevant questionnaires will be filled out at baseline&#xD;
      and end-of trial. In addition 15 random patients will be asked to attend &quot;think-aloud&quot;&#xD;
      interviews within the last 4 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation RIC has shown to increase tissue oxygen tension (a measure of&#xD;
      microcirculation) in a short-term study we hypothesize that RIC treatment will increase&#xD;
      tissue oxygen tension in the feet (Primary outcome) by 13% (SD = 10%). With 90% power and a&#xD;
      two sided significance level of 0.05 the sample size needed to detect this change is 16 in&#xD;
      each group - 32 participants in total. Taking a drop-out ratio of 10% into account and given&#xD;
      the inaccurate nature of this power calculation the sample size of the study will be 20&#xD;
      patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The effects of treatment on outcome measures will be estimated by using&#xD;
      complete-case logistic regression analyses. If needed outcome variables will be&#xD;
      log-transformed using the natural logarithm to meet model assumptions of the distribution of&#xD;
      the model residuals if necessary. Interactions between sex and all determinants will be&#xD;
      investigated in all models to investigate possible sex interactions differences. A level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Discontinuation&#xD;
      of single person participation in study or cancellation of whole study The doctor responsible&#xD;
      for the study can at any time discontinue the study for any reason e.g. for safety concerns.&#xD;
      The responsible doctor can discontinue the participation of any single participant if&#xD;
      informed consent is withdrawn, the a participant wants to get pregnant or get pregnant, if a&#xD;
      participant does not follow the study protocol. A participant can withdraw his or her&#xD;
      participation without justification at any time and this will not influence the treatment at&#xD;
      Steno Diabetes Center of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage All procedures and facilities for data handling and storage will follow the&#xD;
      rules and regulations of Datatilsynet. Permission from Datatilsynet for collecting and&#xD;
      storing the data will be sought prior to the study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data from will be stored at the Steno Diabetes Center, Niels Steensens Vej 4, in&#xD;
      Gentofte, Denmark. No person sensitive data will be shared with collaborator outside of Steno&#xD;
      Diabetes Center. Data on analyses done at the German Diabetes Institute will be handle only&#xD;
      by use of the patients trail number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data gathered on paper during the clinical examination will be stored in a locked archive&#xD;
      at Steno Diabetes Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Data is owned by the Steno Diabetes Center A/S. Positive (significant), negative&#xD;
      (non-significant) and inconclusive results will be published as soon as it is scientifically&#xD;
      justifiable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance and perspectives If the project shows an effect of RIC on PAD the next step will&#xD;
      to test the treatment method in a larger trial where walking distance will be the primary&#xD;
      outcome. Also it is possible that patients with foot ulcers and patients with critical&#xD;
      peripheral ischemia could benefit from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIC treatment could prove to be an attractive non-pharmacological non-surgical treatment&#xD;
      option for a large population of diabetes patients. The trial will result in 5 publications&#xD;
      on the efficacy of RIC on neuronal function, on vascular function, on lipidomic profiles, on&#xD;
      marker of inflammation and oxidative stress (Tentative titles of articles are listed in&#xD;
      Appendix 3) and patient empowerment and quality of life. The study is recommended by an&#xD;
      independent Professor of Cardiology (Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible limitations It is debated whether or not diabetes can attenuated the efficacy of RIC&#xD;
      treatment. Data from randomised clinical trials are conflicting . As the patients in the&#xD;
      present study population will have some degree of neuropathy this may attenuate the effect of&#xD;
      RIC on our outcomes. However a recent study has showed an effect of RIC on diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulcers contradicting the above-mentioned hypothesis, as all diabetes patients with foot&#xD;
      ulcers have some degree of neuropathy .&#xD;
