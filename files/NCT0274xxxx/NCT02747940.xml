  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Brain signatures&quot; as objective measures of acute pain have been characterized with&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance image and machine learning technology. As compared to acute&#xD;
      pain, chronic pain leads to greater socioeconomic burden. However, measures for chronic pain&#xD;
      remain subjective and suboptimal, and the brain signatures for chronic pain are largely&#xD;
      unknown. Chronic migraine and fibromyalgia are two prototypes primary chronic pain disorders&#xD;
      with high disability and intractability with prevalence of around 2% for both diseases. These&#xD;
      two chronic pain disorders have shared clinical presentations (abnormal pain sensitivity,&#xD;
      mood and sleep disorders), pathophysiology (central sensitization) and medical treatment&#xD;
      (anti-depressants), despite different body parts are involved (head vs. whole body). The&#xD;
      present integrated project aims to characterize both common and disease-specific brain&#xD;
      signatures of chronic pain by investigating these two chronic pain disorders. Our findings&#xD;
      may shed some light on the key mechanisms of pain chronification, and may pave the way for&#xD;
      the optimization of diagnosis and prognostication, as well as formulation of personalized&#xD;
      medicine in chronic pain, so as to improve life quality of these patients and to reduce&#xD;
      socioeconomic loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project includes three interdisciplinary sub-projects (plus one animal study, not&#xD;
      listed here):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: Clinical studies for chronic migraine and fibromyalgia: endophenotypes and pain&#xD;
      chronification B: Functional neuroimaging of chronic pain: multimodal quantitative analysis&#xD;
      of brain connectomes C. Data stream mining technology for multimodal physiological signals of&#xD;
      chronic pain: real-time tracking and clinical correlation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the present projects include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of common and disease-specific brain signatures for chronic pain&#xD;
           (sub-projects A, B, C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigation of clinical indicators with predictive values by machine learning analysis&#xD;
           of big data (sub-projects A, B, C)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elucidation of the specific anatomical structures or neural networks underpinning pain&#xD;
           chronification based on clinical neuroimaging (sub-projects A, B) In this 1st-year pilot&#xD;
           study of the 4-year longitudinal study, we will establish experimental platforms for&#xD;
           each sub-project, start to recruit participants and perform endophenotyping, as well as&#xD;
           have a preliminary integration for sub-projects A, B and C.&#xD;
