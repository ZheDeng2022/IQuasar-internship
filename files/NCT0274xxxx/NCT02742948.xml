      Objective: To determine the optimal time for intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis&#xD;
      administration in pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section to minimize postpartum&#xD;
      infectious complication for both the mother &amp; neonate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A randomized comparative study. Setting: The Obstetrics and Gynecology&#xD;
      department of Kasr El Aini hospital (Cairo University - Egypt) in the period from April 2016&#xD;
      to September 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Six hundred pregnant women aged from 20 to 40 years old with singleton living&#xD;
      healthy fetuses undergoing elective lower segment caesarean section (LSCS).They will be&#xD;
      randomized into three groups: group A in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g) 60&#xD;
      minutes before skin incision, group B in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g)&#xD;
      immediately with skin incision &amp; group C in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g)&#xD;
      immediately after umbilical cord clamping. Outcomes include postoperative maternal &amp; fetal&#xD;
      infectious morbidity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Six hundred pregnant women aged from 20 to 40 years old with singleton living healthy fetuses&#xD;
      undergoing elective lower segment caesarean section (LSCS); defined as LSCS done before onset&#xD;
      of labor pains, will be enrolled in the study. They will be randomized into three groups:&#xD;
      group A in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g) 60 minutes before skin incision,&#xD;
      group B in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g) immediately with skin incision &amp;&#xD;
      group C in which 200 women will receive IV ceftriaxone (2g) immediately after umbilical cord&#xD;
      clamping. Randomization will be done using computer generated random numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another inclusion criterion includes gestational age (GA) more than 37 weeks gestation.&#xD;
      Patients on immunosuppressant drugs, received any antibiotic prophylaxis (within 10 days),&#xD;
      suffer any chronic illness (e.g. diabetes mellitus or renal disease) or who experienced any&#xD;
      obstetric complication in the current pregnancy (e.g. antepartum hemorrhage &amp; rupture of&#xD;
      membranes) will be excluded from the study. Additional exclusion criteria include previous&#xD;
      history of more than two laparotomies, maternal BMI more than 28 &amp; any maternal febrile&#xD;
      illness within 10 days from the procedure. Patients who are known to be allergic to&#xD;
      penicillin or cephalosporin will be also excluded (all patients will receive 100 mg of&#xD;
      ceftriaxone as a test dose before participation in the current study). The study was approved&#xD;
      by the Hospital Ethical Committee. All participants will provide an informed consent after&#xD;
      explaining the aim and potential hazards of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patients, full history will be taken followed by complete physical examination,&#xD;
      obstetric ultrasound &amp; routine preoperative investigations. GA is established by menstrual&#xD;
      dates then confirmed by obstetric ultrasound. Spinal anaesthesia will be given for all&#xD;
      patients. All cesarean sections will be done by ob/gyn residents under the supervision of&#xD;
      senior staff obstetrician using the following technique: Pfannenstiel skin incision,&#xD;
      transverse lower uterine segment incision, two-layer closure of the uterine wall, closure of&#xD;
      both parietal peritoneum &amp; rectus sheath &amp; skin closure (using prolene 3/0 suture). Primary&#xD;
      maternal outcome includes postoperative endometritis (diagnosed if maternal axillary&#xD;
      temperature ≥ 38°C for at least 48 hours, uterine tenderness, infected lochia &amp;&#xD;
      leukocytosis).Secondary maternal outcomes include wound infection (diagnosed if there is&#xD;
      induration, redness, hematoma, seroma or purulent discharge at the incision site) &amp; urinary&#xD;
      tract infection (diagnosed if there frequency, dysuria, suprapubic or loin pain &amp; positive&#xD;
      urine culture). Prolonged postoperative hospital stay (more than 2 days) will also be&#xD;
      recorded. The infectious morbidity evaluation will be done by ob/gyn residents who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the study group of the patient. Neonatal outcomes include immediate antibiotic&#xD;
      adverse effects (diarrhea &amp; rash), neonatal sepsis (diagnosed by clinical signs,&#xD;
      leukocytosis, C-reactive protein&amp; positive blood culture), neonatal intensive care unit&#xD;
      (NICU) admission (entailing the length of stay) &amp; neonatal death. All neonates will be&#xD;
      examined by an expert neonatologist who will be blinded to study group of the neonate's&#xD;
      mother. On discharging all patients, a brief summary about symptoms and signs of the above&#xD;
      mentioned infectious &amp; neonatal complications will be given and they will be instructed to&#xD;
      contact any of the authors immediately if any happens. Patients will be reexamined after 1&#xD;
      week (skin stitch removal appointment) &amp; 4 weeks (contraception counseling appointment)&#xD;
      following the CS.&#xD;
