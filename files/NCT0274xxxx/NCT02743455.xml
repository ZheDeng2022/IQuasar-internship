      This study is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase I study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian&#xD;
      Nordic-Yellow Fever (MVA-BN-YF) in Flavivirus-naive healthy male and non-pregnant female&#xD;
      adult subjects. There are six dose groups in this study. Subjects who have never received a&#xD;
      licensed or investigational smallpox vaccine will be randomized to Groups 1-5 and vaccine&#xD;
      administration and follow-up will be conducted in a double-blinded fashion. Subjects who have&#xD;
      previously received two, 1 x 10^8 TCID50 doses of Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic&#xD;
      (MVA-BN) between 19 and 45 days apart by s ubcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) routes will&#xD;
      be enrolled in Group 6 and will be dosed open-label. Since this is a first in human, phase I&#xD;
      study, a sentinel cohort will be utilized. The first two subjects (1st sentinel group) one at&#xD;
      each clinical site will be randomized to Group 2 or 3 and vaccinated with MVA-BN-YF with or&#xD;
      without Montanide ISA 720 adjuvant (ISA 720). Subjects and study personnel will be blinded as&#xD;
      to whether ISA 720 was administered. The primary objectives are the: 1) assessment of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of MVA-BN-YF vaccine administered with or without&#xD;
      ISA 720; 2) comparison of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of MVA-BN-YF vaccine&#xD;
      administered with or without ISA 720 with Yellow Fever Vaccine (YF-VAX) and MVA-BN.&#xD;

      previously received two, 1 x 10^8 TCID50 doses of Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic&#xD;
      (MVA-BN) between 19 and 45 days apart by subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) routes will&#xD;
      be enrolled in Group 6 and will be dosed open-label. Since this is a first in human, phase I&#xD;
      study, a sentinel cohort will be utilized. The first two subjects (1st sentinel group) one at&#xD;
      each clinical site will be randomized to Group 2 or 3 and vaccinated with MVA-BN-YF with or&#xD;
      without Montanide ISA 720 adjuvant (ISA 720). Subjects and study personnel will be blinded as&#xD;
      to whether ISA 720 was administered. Subjects will be monitored for safety for one day, and&#xD;
      if no pre-defined halting rule is met then two additional subjects (2nd sentinel group) one&#xD;
      at each clinical site will be assigned to the group the previous subject was not assigned to.&#xD;
      These subjects will be vaccinated and monitored as above. A total of 4 sentinel subjects will&#xD;
      be vaccinated. The primary objectives are the: 1) assessment of the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of MVA-BN-YF vaccine administered with or without ISA 720; 2) comparison of&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of MVA-BN-YF vaccine administered with or&#xD;
      without ISA 720 with Yellow Fever Vaccine (YF-VAX) and MVA-BN. The secondary objectives are&#xD;
      the: 1) assessment of the immunogenicity against the MVA-BN backbone and Yellow Fever Virus&#xD;
      (YF) antigen insert of MVA-BN-YF with and without ISA 720 as assessed by kinetics of the&#xD;
      immune responses, seroconversion rates, and peak Geometric Mean Titer (GMT); 2) assessment of&#xD;
      the impact of previous MVA-BN vaccination on peak immune responses to YF antigen in&#xD;
      MVA-BN-YF; 3) comparison of the peak immunogenicity against YF antigen of 1 or 2 doses of&#xD;
      MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720 with YF-VAX; 4) comparison of the peak immunogenicity&#xD;
      against the MVA-BN backbone of 1 or 2 doses of MVA-BN-YF with or without ISA 720 with MVA-BN;&#xD;
      5) assessment of durability of immune response to YF antigen and MVA-BN at 6 months after 2nd&#xD;
      vaccination or placebo administration.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be a male or female at least 18 to &lt; / = 45 years old at the time of screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Must be in good health on the basis of physical examination, vital signs*, medical&#xD;
             history, safety laboratories, and the investigator's clinical judgment. *Safety&#xD;
             laboratory normal ranges will be those used by the reference clinical lab.&#xD;
             Protocol-specific criteria for individual subjects are listed in criteria #6&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The clinical laboratory evaluations that will be graded as laboratory Adverse&#xD;
                  Events (AEs) and be considered for the Study or Individual Halting Rules are&#xD;
                  those which are included in the laboratory toxicity grading scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vital signs must be in normal ranges. If a subject has elevated systolic or&#xD;
                  diastolic blood pressure, subject may rest for 10 minutes in a quiet room and&#xD;
                  then the blood pressure may be retaken once.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. For Group 6: subjects must have documented previous vaccination with MVA-BN*. *In&#xD;
             order to be enrolled, a subject has to have received two 1x10^8 TCID50 doses of MVA-BN&#xD;
             19-45 days apart subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) as part of participation in&#xD;
             DMID vaccine trials 11-0021 or 09-0002. First dose must have been administered no&#xD;
             earlier than 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have acceptable* laboratory criteria within 28 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Acceptable lab parameters include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin: women: &gt; 11.0 g/dL; men &gt; 12.5 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  White blood cell count: &gt; 3,700 cells/mm^3 but &lt; 11,000 cells/mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets: &gt; 125,000 but &lt; 375,000 per mm^3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Urine dipstick (clean urine sample): protein &lt; 1+, glucose negative&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT, AST) &lt; 1.25 x&#xD;
                  institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &lt; / = 1 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.25x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine &lt; / = 1 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If laboratory screening tests are out of range, repeat of screening tests is&#xD;
                  permitted once, provided there is an alternative explanation for the out of range&#xD;
                  value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
             and negative urine pregnancy tests prior to each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Women of childbearing potential must have an acceptable method of contraception* from&#xD;
