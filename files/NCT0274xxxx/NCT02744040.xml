    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to determine the influence of timing of ART initiation and alcohol&#xD;
      consumption on HIV disease course, including detailed analysis of important events occurring&#xD;
      shortly after HIV acquisition. ART initiation immediately after HIV infection (during Fiebig&#xD;
      stages I-II) largely results in smaller HIV reservoir and lower HIV-associated systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, which has been linked to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Immediate ART also&#xD;
      reduces HIV-associated bacterial translocation and may prevent dysbiosis, an alteration of&#xD;
      the intestinal microbiota that has been linked to increased systemic inflammation. Immediate&#xD;
      intervention is not, however, generally feasible and more information is required about the&#xD;
      consequences of starting ART at later time-points, but still early after acquisition. The&#xD;
      proposed study will be conducted in Lima, Peru, in the cohort of 180 MSM with acute (Ab-, HIV&#xD;
      RNA+) or recent (≤ 3 months) HIV infection. Alcohol use disorder is present in ~50% of&#xD;
      HIV-infected MSM in our cohort, which is four times higher than that seen among males in the&#xD;
      general Peruvian population. Although the role of alcohol use in HIV pathogenesis and disease&#xD;
      course remains unclear, some studies show a correlation with accelerated disease progression.&#xD;
      In animal models and clinical studies, both acute and chronic alcohol consumption have been&#xD;
      linked to bacterial translocation and activation of the innate immune system, which can lead&#xD;
      to increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effects of alcohol resemble early&#xD;
      post-infection changes in bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by&#xD;
      HIV and their impact on HIV disease course before and after ART initiation remain unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs.&#xD;
      delayed ART initiation. The investigators will study outcomes after 2 and 4 years in MSM&#xD;
      diagnosed with acute or recent HIV infection. The investigators will examine outcomes in 3&#xD;
      groups based on time of ART initiation: a) immediate: during FI-II (N~30), b) early: during&#xD;
      FIII-V (N~50) or c) delayed: at 24 weeks after diagnosis (N~80). The investigators anticipate&#xD;
      that CD4+ T cell counts and peripheral inflammatory markers in the FIII-V group and the&#xD;
      delayed group will approach those in the immediate treatment group (FI-II) over time; in&#xD;
      contrast, they expect that those started ART at &quot;early&quot; or &quot;delayed&quot; time points will have&#xD;
      persistent changes in the GI microbiome and in the HIV reservoir.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of alcohol use on the relative long-term benefits of&#xD;
      immediate vs. early vs. delayed initiation of ART. The investigators will examine the impact&#xD;
      of alcohol use on critical events in HIV infection. They hypothesize that dose-dependent&#xD;
      alcohol-induced changes will compound the negative effects of HIV and lead to greater levels&#xD;
      of dysbiosis and inflammation, higher early plasma HIV RNA, and greater &quot;seeding&quot; and&#xD;
      persistence of HIV DNA in participants with high-level alcohol use. The investigators will&#xD;
      assess viral load, GI microbiome and metagenomics, pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of&#xD;
      msRNA and analyze the impact on alcohol use in all subjects prior to ART initiation and among&#xD;
      ART-adherent participants with persistent viral suppression.&#xD;

      Specific Aims: Recent studies suggest that very early initiation of ART (prior to&#xD;
      seroconversion) does not prevent the establishment of HIV reservoirs, which eventually expand&#xD;
      when ART is discontinued (1, 2). Early ART initiation is, however, associated with&#xD;
      preservation of CD4+ T cells and lower levels of total HIV DNA and cell-associated RNA (3) as&#xD;
      well as preservation of gut Th17 cells, thereby averting a major driver of HIV-related immune&#xD;
      activation and limiting the size of the HIV reservoir (4). When, by contrast, ART is&#xD;
      initiated in Fiebig III (FIII) or later, many HIV-associated changes have already occurred,&#xD;
      including seeding of HIV reservoirs, damage to GI mucosa, and initiation of inflammatory&#xD;
      cascades (4). Some if not all of these effects may be related to the development of dysbiosis&#xD;
      (a markedly different composition of the gut microbiota that might itself drive continued&#xD;
      inflammation). Since ART initiation within weeks of HIV acquisition is not a viable public&#xD;
      health strategy, it is important to more completely understand the relative long-term&#xD;
      benefits of initiating ART at very early times after infection (FI-II) as opposed to after a&#xD;
      short (during FIII-V) or longer delay (at 24 weeks). The effects of alcohol on microbial&#xD;
      translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokines are not unlike early changes after HIV infection&#xD;
      (5-7); however, alcohol's role in HIV pathogenesis and progression is not well defined. Since&#xD;
      the possibility that high-level alcohol use can mitigate the benefits of early ART is&#xD;
      emerging as a potentially important public health issue, the investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of time of ART initiation as well as alcohol use on HIV pathogenesis in Peruvian men&#xD;
      who have sex with men (MSM), in whom high-level alcohol use is common. They will study&#xD;
      outcomes after 2 and 4 years in MSM diagnosed with acute (Ab-, HIV RNA+) or recent (≤3&#xD;
      months) HIV infection. Three groups based on time of ART initiation will be studied: a)&#xD;
      immediate: during FI-II (N~30), b) early: during FIII-V (N~50) or c) delayed: at 24 weeks&#xD;
      after diagnosis (N~80).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching hypotheses are: 1. Initiation of ART soon after HIV infection will dampen&#xD;
      perturbations of GI microbiota, reduce HIV-induced inflammatory changes, and decrease seeding&#xD;
      of the reservoir. Initiation of ART in FI-II will have the greatest benefit. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that CD4 counts and peripheral inflammatory markers in the FIII-V&#xD;
      group and the group treated at 24 weeks will approach those in the FI-II group at 2 and 4&#xD;
      years; in contrast, the investigators expect changes in the GI microbiome and the HIV&#xD;
      reservoir over time will be more modest. 2. Irrespective of the time of ART initiation,&#xD;
      alcohol use will compound the negative effects of HIV to generate greater levels of&#xD;
      dysbiosis, microbial translocation, up-regulation of inflammatory pathways, and seeding of&#xD;
      the HIV reservoir. To investigate these hypotheses, they will address the following two&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1) To determine the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs.&#xD;
      delayed initiation of ART. Initiation of ART during Fiebig I-II, while theoretically&#xD;
      appealing, is infeasible in clinical practice because the duration of FI-II is very short (10&#xD;
      days) and because antibody-based tests, used almost world-wide, are unable to diagnose FI-II.&#xD;
      Six months of ART initiated shortly after seroconversion (FIII) can improve many immune&#xD;
      parameters, although not to the near normal level seen when ART is initiated during FI-II&#xD;
      (4). Longer-term follow-up of seropositive participants who started ART ~2-8 months after HIV&#xD;
      acquisition compared to those initiating ART during FI-II is needed to see whether markers of&#xD;
      inflammation and residual viral load might continue to improve after 6 months, decreasing the&#xD;
      difference between the groups. Methods: the investigators will evaluate the 3 groups using&#xD;
      specimens from equivalent times after ART initiation for a total of 4 years of ART, comparing&#xD;
      CD4 counts, time to reach undetectable VL, the GI microbiota, and inflammatory markers. The&#xD;
      size of the replication-competent reservoir in PBMCs will be compared using measurements of&#xD;
      multiply spliced viral RNA (msRNA) and the degree of low-level infection of new cells by&#xD;
      assessing the production of circular viral DNA (2LTR HIV DNA). They will model the size and&#xD;
      persistence of the viral reservoir across all ART-compliant study subjects. In a subset of&#xD;
      individuals from each group, the proviral integration sites will be defined at ART initiation&#xD;
      and after 2 and 4 years to assess the maintenance of the reservoir by proliferating CD4&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2) To determine the impact of high-level alcohol use on the relative long-term&#xD;
      benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed ART initiation. High-level alcohol use results in&#xD;
      changes in the GI microbiome, increasing dysbiosis and gut permeability, and these changes&#xD;
      are associated with up-regulation of inflammatory pathways (8-13). Dysbiosis is present in&#xD;
      many HIV-infected patients. The extent of dysbiosis correlates with established markers of&#xD;
      HIV disease progression and the consequent inflammatory processes contribute to HIV disease&#xD;
      progression, even in treated individuals. Methods: The investigators will use monthly data on&#xD;
      alcohol use to assess alcohol consumption as a continuous, time-varying predictor. In all&#xD;
      participants at the time of diagnosis, and at multiple timepoints prior to ART in those&#xD;
      enrolled into the deferred group, they will assess VL, GI microbiota and metagenomics,&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and production of msRNA. They will compare these factors between&#xD;
      subjects by their reported alcohol use, focusing on events occurring shortly after HIV&#xD;
      acquisition. Specimens from uninfected and chronically infected subjects are available as&#xD;
      controls. Finally, among ART-adherent subjects with persistent viral suppression, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess inflammatory markers and HIV reservoirs in those with and without&#xD;
      high-level alcohol use at 2 and 4 years after ART initiation.&#xD;
