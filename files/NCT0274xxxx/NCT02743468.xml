      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory diseases affect more than 1 billion people worldwide. They are a growing public&#xD;
      health concern. The lungs are constantly exposed to environmental factors such as dust,&#xD;
      fumes, microbes, and pollutants. But much is still not known about how these pollutants lead&#xD;
      to respiratory illnesses. Researchers want to collect samples from lungs and blood to see how&#xD;
      genetics and environmental pollutants affect cellular responses or functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study how cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway enzymes affect macrophage function in the&#xD;
      lungs and inflammatory responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 65 who can have a bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will take place at the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit in Research Triangle&#xD;
      Park, NC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visit 1, participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They&#xD;
      will have blood and urine tests. They will take tests that measure their lung function. They&#xD;
      will answer questionnaires. Before the visit, they will be given a list of medicines they&#xD;
      cannot take. They also must not have caffeine on the day of their visit. The visit will last&#xD;
      about 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visit 2, participants will give blood samples. They will undergo bronchoscopy. For&#xD;
      this, they will get an intravenous line in a vein to get sedatives. Their airways will be&#xD;
      numbed. Cells will be collected from their lungs. They will fast for 8 hours before the&#xD;
      visit. They must have someone else drive them home from the visit. The visit will last about&#xD;
      3-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a follow-up phone call about 1 day after study visit 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, cross-sectional study designed to provide a consistent method for&#xD;
      obtaining biological samples and respiratory health-related information from participants for&#xD;
      use in research that evaluates lung function (e.g., responses to environmental agents such as&#xD;
      air pollution particles, engineered nanomaterials, or immune ligands; the role of genetics on&#xD;
      cellular responses or functioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be adult volunteers, ages 18-65 (inclusive), who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria to undergo bronchoscopy. Potential participants will be prescreened and scheduled&#xD;
      for a final eligibility visit that will include medical history review, vital signs, physical&#xD;
      examination, blood draw, and pulmonary function tests. After eligibility is confirmed, the&#xD;
      participant will be scheduled for biological sample collections, which will include a blood&#xD;
      draw and bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to investigate the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP)&#xD;
      epoxygenase pathway enzymes, including the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH; encoded by EPHX2)&#xD;
      and CYP2J2 proteins, in macrophage function and inflammatory responses. The primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will evaluate macrophage phagocytosis in an ex vivo assay, comparing groups of&#xD;
      individuals with and without EPHX2 and CYP2J2 polymorphisms of interest. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include evaluations of ex vivo gene expression of inflammatory receptors and cytokines&#xD;
      in stimulated macrophages (alveolar and peripheral blood monocyte-derived), assessment of the&#xD;
      lower airway microbiome from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and measurement of&#xD;
      eicosanoids and cytokines in serum and BAL fluid.&#xD;
