      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) studied farmers and their spouses in North Carolina and&#xD;
      Iowa. It also included people who worked with pesticides in Iowa. They answered a&#xD;
      questionnaire and gave data about their children born since 1975. Researchers want to link&#xD;
      this data to public data like birth and death certificates. They want to study how early life&#xD;
      exposures to farms are linked to cancer and other bad health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study data to find links between early life farm exposure and negative health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no human subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will get public data in the two study states. This will come from things like:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Birth certificates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Driver s licenses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voter registration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death certificates&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these plus the AHS data, they will create a study group. It will be called Early&#xD;
      Life Exposure in Agriculture (ELEA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will link ELEA data to cancer data. This will identify prevalence of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will study parents answers on the AHS. The topics include farm practices and pesticide&#xD;
      use. They will determine ELEA exposure to pesticides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will analyze the cancer and pesticide results and look for links.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that early life exposures may influence future health outcomes&#xD;
      although there is a critical need to more fully understand how these may differ from&#xD;
      exposures received later in life. The farm environment includes pesticides that have been&#xD;
      suggested to increase cancer risk in both children and adults. A review of the literature&#xD;
      identified crucial gaps in our knowledge and highlighted the need for accurate exposure&#xD;
      assessment, including separate parental interviews, specific pesticide exposure questions,&#xD;
      and semiquantitative exposure measures that can be used to confirm information obtained&#xD;
      through questionnaires 2. Some studies suggest that the timing of exposure may be&#xD;
      particularly important. For example, in a study of the insecticide DDT and breast cancer,&#xD;
      researchers observed the highest risks among women exposed prior to age 14 compared to later&#xD;
      in life 3. The agricultural environment also includes other exposures such as animals,&#xD;
      allergens, and endotoxins. These exposures may influence immune function, particularly when&#xD;
      exposed at a young age, and subsequently affect later cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study of farmers and their&#xD;
      spouses residing in North Carolina and Iowa, and commercial pesticide applicators residing in&#xD;
      Iowa. At enrollment (1993-7) women (farmers and spouses of farmers) provided information on&#xD;
      their children born since 1975, including name, gender, SSN and dates of birth. In previous&#xD;
      analyses conducted using Iowa AHS data only for cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in&#xD;
      children under the age of 19, findings suggested increased risks of incident cancer among&#xD;
      these children associated with the use of certain pesticides by their parents. The mortality&#xD;
      analysis focused on fatal injuries sustained, indicative of the dangerous nature of working&#xD;
      on the farm6. In collaboration with researchers at the University of Iowa, we are currently&#xD;
      updating the previous analysis with new cancer incidence information through 2011 and&#xD;
      information provided by the University of Iowa, which has performed a linkage to Iowa birth&#xD;
      certificates to identify additional children born to AHS participants from 1975-2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this proposal, we are proposing to further expand the linkages in Iowa to include&#xD;
      children not previously included, and to link to the North Carolina registries for the first&#xD;
      time to identify additional 2 births, cancer incidence and mortality. This will establish a&#xD;
      unique cohort of agriculturally exposed offspring, with comprehensive information on their&#xD;
      parents farming practices, as well as other information. These data will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      the hypothesis that early life agricultural exposures influence cancer risk. Previous&#xD;
      analyses have only focused on childhood cancers; we will include cancers diagnosed from birth&#xD;
      through adulthood.&#xD;
