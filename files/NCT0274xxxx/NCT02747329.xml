      The objective of this study is a comparative evaluation of BuMA Supreme™ stent and of Xience&#xD;
      V/Prime stent in terms of the extent of neointima formation at 1 or 2 months after implanting&#xD;
      in relatively high bleeding risk patients with coronary artery disease using OCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority study, which will enroll a&#xD;
      total of 80 subjects from approximately 8 centers. All subjects will be firstly randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 1st month OCT (40 pts) or 2nd month OCT group(40 pts). Then both two groups will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to undergoing implantation of BuMA Supreme™ stent (20 pts) or Xience&#xD;
      V/Prime stent (20 pts). If non-inferiority was met, superiority test will be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients be followed up to 2 years. The follow-up visits will be conducted at 1 or&#xD;
      2 months (including QCA/OCT investigation), 3 months, 6 months, 1 and 2 years post&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI),in order to observe the Primary Endpoint and&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints.&#xD;
