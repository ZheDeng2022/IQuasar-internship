      Many patients want to know which blood pressure medication is the best for them. In this&#xD;
      study, we will test the feasibility of a new approach to determining the best blood pressure&#xD;
      medication for individual patients by performing an N-of-1 trial in which patients will have&#xD;
      the opportunity to test a series of 3 blood pressure medications at escalating doses while&#xD;
      carefully measuring their blood pressure and side-effects. At the end of each of these N-of-1&#xD;
      trials, we will ask patients to complete a questionnaire in which they rate their level of&#xD;
      satisfaction with this approach to learning about which is the best blood pressure medication&#xD;
      for them.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to empower hypertensive patients to learn which blood pressure&#xD;
      (BP) medication is best for them. Although lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise play&#xD;
      an important role, medications may still needed to achieve BP control. Yet, there are&#xD;
      substantial differences in the way BP medications affect patients; medications well-tolerated&#xD;
      in some, cause severe side-effects in others. Similarly, medications that cause larger&#xD;
      reductions in BP in some patients have smaller BP lowering effects in others. Despite this&#xD;
      heterogeneity in treatment effects, there are no proven real-world methods to help patients&#xD;
      identify the medication most suited to their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One potential approach to individualizing BP treatment decisions is to conduct N-of-1 trials:&#xD;
      a multiple crossover design conducted in a single patient. Despite the appeal of this&#xD;
      approach, there are few published reports of BP medication N-of-1 trials. Therefore, the&#xD;
      objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting an N-of-1 BP medication&#xD;
      trial in hypertensive patients. Patients who meet all the eligibility criteria will be asked&#xD;
      to monitor their blood pressure and side-effects while taking a series of commonly prescribed&#xD;
      blood pressure medications. If they are already taking a blood pressure medication, they will&#xD;
      begin by tracking their blood pressure and side-effects while taking this medication for 1&#xD;
      week. They will then be asked to track their blood pressure and side-effects while taking a&#xD;
      series of up to three other blood pressure medications (losartan - a renin-angiotensin system&#xD;
      blocking agent, amlodipine - a calcium channel blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide - a thiazide&#xD;
      diuretic). Each of these medications will be taken for 2 weeks at a time. The specific choice&#xD;
      of medications and medication doses will be selected by the study physician. Unless patients&#xD;
      have side-effects that lead them to discontinue a medication early, patients will be expected&#xD;
      to take each medication at least twice in a balanced sequence (e.g., losartan - amlodipine -&#xD;
      HCTZ - HCTZ - amlodipine - losartan). Patients will measure their blood pressure and&#xD;
      medication side-effects during the 2nd week on each of these medications. Patients will have&#xD;
      the option of escalating or decreasing dosages to identify the single medication/medication&#xD;
      dose that best lowers their blood pressure with the least side-effects. Blood pressure will&#xD;
      be measured using an Omron home blood pressure monitor. Side-effects will be tracked using a&#xD;
      daily e-mailed survey that is completed over the Internet.&#xD;
