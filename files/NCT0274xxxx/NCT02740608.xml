      This study is designed to determine if a rejected liver is viable using normothermic machine&#xD;
      liver perfusion (NMLP). It aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. establish the suitability of livers which have been declined by all UK liver transplant&#xD;
           centres by monitoring their function on the NMLP machine; and,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. transplant the liver if its function on the machine is satisfactory allowing it to be&#xD;
           transplanted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deaths from liver disease have soared by 40 per cent in a decade and continue to rise. Liver&#xD;
      transplantation is a highly successful treatment of end stage liver disease, fulminant&#xD;
      hepatic failure and early stage primary liver cancer. The demand for donor livers for&#xD;
      transplantation greatly exceeds supply and approximately 20% of patients die whilst awaiting&#xD;
      transplantation. Normothermic machine liver perfusion (NMLP) is a novel technique developed&#xD;
      for the purposes of organ preservation, which we have also found allows monitoring of liver&#xD;
      graft function ex-vivo by measuring bile production, whilst permitting objective assessment&#xD;
      of liver biochemistry and blood flow. The OrganOx metra, the NMLP device we are using, is CE&#xD;
      marked but is not currently licensed for this particular use and the livers will not be&#xD;
      transported using this device (which the CE mark currently covers). The device will be used&#xD;
      at a particular site (in this case University Hospitals Birmingham) and after a period of&#xD;
      static cold storage during which the liver will be transported to the hospital for testing on&#xD;
      the device. The study population will be extended criteria donor livers, rejected for&#xD;
      transplantation by all UK centres, which are then found to be functioning during perfusion&#xD;
      and transplanted into &quot;medium to low-risk&quot; liver transplant recipients. VITTAL is an open&#xD;
      label, non-randomised, prospective, single arm, 2-part trial the objectives of which are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further validate liver viability assessment criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform the phase 2 study transplanting successfully resuscitated &quot;rejected&quot; livers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish the feasibility of NMLP as a means to increase the number of transplantable&#xD;
           livers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify novel biomarkers that are indicative of liver quality and function In terms of&#xD;
           intervention, the procurement and transplantation of the organs will follow the current&#xD;
           standard of care. The only deviation from the current standard will be the normothermic&#xD;
           perfusion of organs following static cold storage in order to test their ability to&#xD;
           function. This study is based on results from a 5-case pilot series which transplanted&#xD;
           low-risk recipients with organs that had been rejected for transplantation but had been&#xD;
           shown to function on the normothermic machine perfusion device. This work is currently&#xD;
           in the process of being published. The main risk would be the transplantation of a&#xD;
           non-functioning graft (resulting in a case of primary non-function that could result in&#xD;
           re-transplantation or patient death.) Based on our pre-clinical research and clinical&#xD;
           pilot series we believe the criteria we have identified that indicate organ function are&#xD;
           stringent and significantly reduce this risk.&#xD;
