  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in this study have been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and&#xD;
      are scheduled to have a procedure called drug-eluting bead trans-arterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (DEB-TACE). During the DEB-TACE procedure, very small beads are mixed in with a chemotherapy&#xD;
      drug, doxorubicin, and delivered to the tumor through an arterial catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DEB-TACE procedure allows the treatment to be delivered directly into the liver. It also&#xD;
      causes arterial embolization, the process in which a blood vessel is blocked. Treatment of&#xD;
      HCC using DEB-TACE may help delay tumor progression and can downstage (decrease the size) the&#xD;
      cancer in order to meet the criteria which may allow patients to become candidates for liver&#xD;
      transplantation. The purpose of this study is to compare tumor response and medical outcomes&#xD;
      for patients who undergo DEB-TACE with standard endhole catheter versus Surefire® Infusion&#xD;
      System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Conventional transarterial chemoembolization with lipiodol/doxorubicin (cTACE) is known to&#xD;
      prolong survival compared to supportive therapy in certain patients with unresectable HCC,&#xD;
      including patients with unilateral portal vein invasion (PVI). TACE with doxorubicin-eluting&#xD;
      beads (DEB-TACE) is a relatively new modality associated with favorable systemic doxorubicin&#xD;
      exposure/toxicity and liver-specific toxicity compared to cTACE and studies have documented&#xD;
      its safety and efficacy. DEB-TACE is currently utilized for: (1) patients who have&#xD;
      unresectable HCC; and (2) patients who meet the Milan Criteria and currently on liver&#xD;
      transplantation lists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biggest challenge for these procedures has been the inability to actually quantify&#xD;
      embolization in a real-time setting to provide immediate feedback to the operator. Although&#xD;
      various methods, such as perfusion analysis with CT or MRI, have been described, these&#xD;
      require advanced imaging equipment/capabilities, extensive post processing analysis, and can&#xD;
      create challenging workflows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently the best results occur when the dose is delivered in a highly targeted manner into&#xD;
      the tumor. Dense accumulation of embolic spheres or lipiodol into the tumor as documented by&#xD;
      CT has been shown to have improved outcomes. However, with standard endhole catheters&#xD;
      achieving maximum delivery of embolic agents is limited by the development of stasis and&#xD;
      subsequent non-target injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As DEB-TACE is performed through an endhole catheter with either stasis or substasis as an&#xD;
      endpoint. The current methodology is extremely subjective, lacks a quantifiable endpoint, and&#xD;
      results in various degrees of embolization on patients. Often this can result in repeat&#xD;
      procedures or the progression of tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been FDA clearance of a new anti-reflux catheter, Surefire® Infusion&#xD;
      System (SIS, Westminster, CO). The current design has an expandable tip which collapses&#xD;
      during forward flow, and then dynamically seal off the vessel with reversal of flow,&#xD;
      analogous to a valve. SIS, with its expandable tip microcatheter, has been demonstrated&#xD;
      clinically to cause a slight decrease in intra-arterial pressure in the antegrade, or&#xD;
      downstream, vascular compartment. Although this device was designed primarily to prevent&#xD;
      retrograde reflux of embolic agents, the downstream blood pressure reduction may serve as a&#xD;
      biomarker on quantifying embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to develop a method that: (1) allows maximum delivery of embolic spheres into the&#xD;
      tumor tissue to stasis without reflux; (2) enables direct real time numerical quantification&#xD;
      on the degree of embolization; and (3) provides an intra-procedural functional parameter&#xD;
      which could be used to guide the optimal therapeutic endpoints at the time of treatment.&#xD;
