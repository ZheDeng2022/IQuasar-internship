  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the bioequivalence of new formulation of bevacizumab called&#xD;
      CBT124 and safety when compared to two already marketed formulations, one approved in US and&#xD;
      other in EU of Avastin(Registered Trademark). Adult healthy male aged 18 to 50 years (both&#xD;
      inclusive) can participate in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to either a test formulation or one of&#xD;
      the two marketed formulations of bevacizumab. Drugs will be administered intravenously once&#xD;
      only. The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of&#xD;
      drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity&#xD;
      (body's immune response) of the 3 drugs. In order to measure this, blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected at various points after treatment has been given.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cipla BioTec, a pharmaceutical company (company developing drugs), is developing its own&#xD;
      formulation of bevacizumab called CBT124 which is similar to Avastin(Registered Trademark).&#xD;
      The formulation is, intended for intravenous (into a vein) administration for the treatment&#xD;
      of certain cancers. CBT124 is also a type of monoclonal antibody with a proposed biological&#xD;
      activity similar to bevacizumab. Research on CBT124 indicates that it should act the same as&#xD;
      Avastin(Registered Trademark) in the body. It is expected that CBT124 will provide all the&#xD;
      clinical advantages of the marketed drug Avastin(Registered Trademark). The main purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to test that whether CBT124 behaves the same in the human body as&#xD;
      Avastin(Registered Trademark) i.e. produce the same amount/concentration of drug in the blood&#xD;
      as the EU and USA marketed drug, Avastin(Registered Trademark). This is called a 'biosimilar'&#xD;
      study. The study will compare the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) (the levels of&#xD;
      drug in the blood), pharmacodynamics (PD) (what the drug does to the body) and immunogenicity&#xD;
      (body's immune (body's defense system) response) of the 3 drugs when given intravenously&#xD;
      (into a vein) to healthy male participants: new drug called CBT124, marketed drug&#xD;
      Avastin(Registered Trademark) approved in United States (US), marketed drug&#xD;
      Avastin(Registered Trademark) approved in European Union (EU). The results will be compared&#xD;
      to see if these drugs behave the same and are therefore equivalent. In order to measure this,&#xD;
      blood samples will be collected after treatment has been given and the amount of drug in the&#xD;
      blood measured at specific times. In addition, the study will also compare and analyse the&#xD;
      effect the drug has on your immune system from blood samples. Safety and tolerability of both&#xD;
      drugs will also be monitored and compared.&#xD;
