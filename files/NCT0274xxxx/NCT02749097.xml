  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR0534. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted with starting dose of 10 mg followed by dose escalation groups up to 200 mg. Eight&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio in each cohort to receive the study drug or placebo.&#xD;
