  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of a different dose of the seasonal flu vaccine 2013-2015&#xD;
      on the immune response to improve the investigators understanding of cellular and humoral&#xD;
      immune responses induced. The scope of this study is to determine the profile of cellular&#xD;
      activation and antibody production in the ageing immune system following flu immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll 100 male or female subjects ≥65 year old and 90 transplant recipients.&#xD;
      These persons will be deemed to be &quot; at risk &quot; in case of influenza infection and should be&#xD;
      vaccinated according to Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. A medical doctor from the CHUV&#xD;
      will inform the patients about the present study and ask them whether they would be willing&#xD;
      to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be distributed between the two groups according to a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization sequence. The randomization will be done in blocks to ensure balance across&#xD;
      groups. The participants and site staff will not be blinded due to the different&#xD;
      administration assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 subjects will receive a single dose and group 2 subjects a double dose of MUTAGRIP®&#xD;
      manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur containing A/California/7/2009 (H1N1); A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2);&#xD;
      B/Massachusetts/2/2012. Vaccine immunogenicity and safety will be assessed 1, 2, 4 and 24&#xD;
      weeks after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration per volunteer is 6 months after vaccination.&#xD;
