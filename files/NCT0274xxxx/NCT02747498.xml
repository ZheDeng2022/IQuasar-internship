      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes depending on catheter ablation&#xD;
      strategy for repeat ablation procedure among the patients with recurred atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      after de novo catheter ablation. After randomization, we will conduct circumferential&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation alone in a group, and additional posterior box isolation in the&#xD;
      other group. Non-pulmonary vein foci ablation will be done in all patients. We will compare&#xD;
      clinical recurrence rate, complication rate, and procedure time, etc.&#xD;

    <description>We will compare circumferential pulmonary vein (PV) isolation (CPVI) alone and posterior box isolation in addition to CPVI in patients with AF recurrence after de novo ablation procedures and with PV reconnections with 1:1 randomization. We will conduct ablation procedures by 3D electroanatomical mapping guidance and confirm bidirectional blocks of each ablation lines by differential pacing. For posterior box isolation, we will ablate remaining atrial potentials with point by point ablation to avoid the risk of esophageal injury at posterior inferior line. In all patients, mapping and ablation for non-pulmonary vein foci will be done with isoproterenol infusion at the end of the procedure. We will compare procedure time, ablation time, procedure related complication rates, and clinical recurrence rate of AF during follow-up period.</description>
