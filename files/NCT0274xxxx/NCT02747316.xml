  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity causes low-grade systemic inflammation, which sharply increases risk&#xD;
      for iron deficiency. Studies in our laboratory have shown that this is mainly the result of&#xD;
      reduced dietary iron absorption because of increased hepcidin concentrations. During&#xD;
      pregnancy, women have a large increase in iron needs because of the expansion of maternal&#xD;
      blood volume and fetal needs. Iron deficiency anemia in infancy can impair cognitive&#xD;
      development. Whether maternal adiposity impairs absorption and transfer of iron to the fetus,&#xD;
      and thereby increases risk of iron deficiency in the mother and the infant is unclear.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In obese subjects, hepcidin concentrations are increased and iron absorption is believed to&#xD;
      be reduced, leading to iron deficiency over time. How all this will influence iron supply of&#xD;
      the fetus in obese pregnancy has not been well investigated to date. Even if maternal and&#xD;
      fetal iron uptakes are regulated separately, it is unclear to what extent maternal&#xD;
      subclinical inflammation might influence this process. A small study by Dao et al. indicated&#xD;
      that maternal-fetal iron transfer was impaired in obese pregnant women, possibly due to&#xD;
      hepcidin up-regulation. In this study, both maternal BMI as well as hepcidin were negatively&#xD;
      correlated with cord blood iron status. Maternal hepcidin and c-reactive protein were&#xD;
      significantly higher and cord blood iron was significantly lower in the obese compared to the&#xD;
      normal weight. Hepcidin was shown to have an effect on iron transfer across the placenta in&#xD;
      the study by Young et al.: the transfer was increased in women with undetectable hepcidin at&#xD;
      delivery compared to those with higher levels. As of now, clear associations between maternal&#xD;
      BMI or maternal hepcidin concentration and fetal iron status were not shown.&#xD;
