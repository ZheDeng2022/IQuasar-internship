  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urea cycle disorders (UCD) are genetic disorders caused by the liver's inability to break&#xD;
      down ammonia from proteins; ammonia then accumulates and is toxic to the brain. UCD cause&#xD;
      brain damage and intellectual and developmental disabilities and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for UCD is either conservative management which involves a low-in-protein diet,&#xD;
      drugs, and amino acid supplements or liver transplantation; each carries their own risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to help patients to make the decision about different management alternatives&#xD;
      by providing them with scientific information that is currently lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 of this study will compare survival, neurocognitive function, and patient-reported&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Urea cycle disorders (UCD) are genetic disorders caused by the liver's inability to break&#xD;
      down ammonia from proteins; ammonia then accumulates and is toxic to the brain. UCD cause&#xD;
      brain damage and intellectual and developmental disabilities and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment involves a special diet low in protein, drugs that help metabolize ammonia and&#xD;
      amino acid supplements (conservative management). Many patients and families choose liver&#xD;
      transplantation rather than conservative treatment; both alternatives are effective in&#xD;
      reducing or normalizing blood ammonia. While liver transplantation eliminates the ammonia&#xD;
      problem, conservative management does so only temporarily and in many patients, blood ammonia&#xD;
      can rise during an infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term objective of this study is to help patients make decisions about management&#xD;
      alternatives (conservative vs. liver transplantation) by providing them with scientific&#xD;
      information that is currently lacking. The questions the investigators will address are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the disease's risk of mortality and illness in the two treatment approaches?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What can parents expect in terms of the development of their child and his/her school&#xD;
           performance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the expected effects of each treatment on short-term and long-term quality of&#xD;
           life?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use statistical methods to compare numbers or percentages of survival,&#xD;
      illness, psychological testing for IQ, executive function, memory, behaviors, and quality of&#xD;
      life among patients that choose conservative management and those who have chosen liver&#xD;
      transplantation. Some of this information is already being collected by the Urea Cycle&#xD;
      Disorders Consortium (UCDC) in 14 metabolic clinics (11 of them in the US) as part of its&#xD;
      long-term follow-up study. To ensure that the information the investigators analyze is&#xD;
      representative of the UCD patient population in the US, the investigators will also obtain&#xD;
      data from the Studies of Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) registry, which collects&#xD;
      information about children who undergo liver transplantation for many different diseases&#xD;
      (including UCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Urea Cycle Disorders Foundation (NUCDF) and the Patients' Research Working Group&#xD;
      collaborated with the clinical investigators to design this research and to ensure that it&#xD;
      that it covers the questions that are most important to patients and their families. The&#xD;
      results of this study will be disseminated to patients, their doctors, and clinical staff so&#xD;
      they receive current, validated information before making a decision about the best treatment&#xD;
      for them.&#xD;
