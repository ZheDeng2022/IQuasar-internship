  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of SOAR is to characterize the clinical and economic impact of clinicians' responses&#xD;
      to major bleeding complications and pre-procedural concerns for bleeding risk in patients&#xD;
      treated with oral anticoagulants (warfarin, anti-Xa orals, and anti-thrombin (IIa) orals) who&#xD;
      present to the ED or in the hospital with acute illness or injury, with the eventual aim of&#xD;
      informing the development of improved approaches to the management of OACs in the ED.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, warfarin was the only oral anticoagulant (OAC) available in the US, and a&#xD;
      substantial infrastructure has developed around its management. Over the past five years,&#xD;
      four non-Vitamin-K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) have been approved by the FDA. The&#xD;
      NOACs are associated with generally fewer and less severe bleeding complications, and shorter&#xD;
      half-lives, often making management of bleeding that complicates the use of these agents less&#xD;
      problematic than similar episodes associated with warfarin. Bleeding during NOAC therapy does&#xD;
      occur, and patients taking NOACs sometimes require procedures that cannot be delayed, for&#xD;
      which good hemostasis is desirable, and therefore the NOAC may delay or complicate care. The&#xD;
      challenge of this latter issue is compounded by the lack of readily available,&#xD;
      rapid-turnaround quantitative assays for measuring the magnitude of anticoagulation effect&#xD;
      associated with NOAC use. From a safety perspective, the large warfarin infrastructure does&#xD;
      not translate into useful support for use of the new NOACs; their anticoagulation impact&#xD;
      cannot be readily monitored by simple, quick tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In October 2015 the first specific reversal agent for a NOAC was approved, but it is useful&#xD;
      only for dabigatran; at present, there is no specific reversal agent for anti-Xa NOACs.&#xD;
      Emergency care providers face many concerns and insecurities regarding the safety of warfarin&#xD;
      and the NOACs, while working in a highly pressurized care environment, often with limited&#xD;
      patient history and little time to consider treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the unique position of the hospital ED in the US healthcare continuum, it is&#xD;
      frequently the initial site of care for patients on OACs who develop bleeding complications.&#xD;
      In all clinical settings, there tends to be a standardized, international normalized ratio&#xD;
      (INR)-driven pathway for the management of warfarin-related bleeds. Many EDs and hospital&#xD;
      pharmacies are now trying to establish similarly standardized, though not evidence-driven,&#xD;
      pathways for NOAC-related bleeding, and eagerly await the availability of additional specific&#xD;
      reversal agents to use in such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED represents the key sentinel surveillance point for assessing the clinical and economic&#xD;
      impact of bleeding concerns and complications attributable to OAC therapy. Other bleeding&#xD;
      issues that impact the pace and nature of medical and surgical care occur in the inpatient&#xD;
      setting, especially the ICU and surgical suite. Taken together, the hospital setting (ED plus&#xD;
      inpatient) offers a 360-degree view of the scope, significance, and cost of OAC-related&#xD;
      bleeds and bleeding concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry is proposed as a large, prospective, multicenter study that identifies the&#xD;
      clinical and economic impact of safety concerns around OAC use on evaluation and management&#xD;
      strategies in the ED and on the inpatient units of participating hospitals. The eventual aim&#xD;
      will be to use these data to inform the gradual development of a new, protocolized safety&#xD;
      standard in the management of OACs in the ED.&#xD;
