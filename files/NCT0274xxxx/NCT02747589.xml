  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators intend to evaluate the use of a commercially available&#xD;
      neurostimulator system, NeuroPace RNS System to stimulate the visual cortex. The NeuroPace&#xD;
      RNS System has a proven record of safety and reliability was approved by the FDA in November&#xD;
      2013. The RNS System is indicated for use in patients with epilepsy and includes a skull&#xD;
      implanted neurostimulator. No modification to the RNS System is required for this study. This&#xD;
      study will use this device to better understand the effect of stimulation on the visual parts&#xD;
      of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purposes of this study are to confirm the desired location to implant a device in&#xD;
      the visual cortex, determine the amount of energy needed to elicit vision, and assess the&#xD;
      nature of the vision that is produced. This information is important to have early in the&#xD;
      process of designing a visual cortical prosthesis that could eventually be used for&#xD;
      commercial use.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject is (a) male or (b) a female of childbearing potential with a negative&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

          5. Subject is taking chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelet agent or subject has an&#xD;
             abnormally elevated preoperative coagulation profile (either PTT or PT/INR).&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Implantation of the investigational device would present unacceptable risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject requires or is likely to require any of the following medical procedures while&#xD;
             implanted with the NeuroPace RNS System: MR imaging, diathermy, electroconvulsive&#xD;
             therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These medical procedures&#xD;
             are contraindicated for patients with an implanted RNS® System. Energy from these&#xD;
             procedures can be sent through the implanted brain stimulation system and cause&#xD;
             permanent brain damage which may cause severe injury, coma, or death. Brain damage can&#xD;
             occur from any of the listed procedures even if the RNS® Neurostimulator is turned off&#xD;
             or if the Leads are not connected to the Neurostimulator, and can occur even if the&#xD;
             Neurostimulator has been removed and any Leads (or any part of a Lead) or the cranial&#xD;
             prosthesis remain. Refer to the Contraindications section of the RNS System User&#xD;
             Manual for further details.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Subject is implanted with any neurostimulation or neuromodulation device in the head&#xD;
             including, but not limited to cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator, or auditory&#xD;
             brain implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Subject has a clinically significant or unstable medical condition including&#xD;
             uncontrolled systemic hypertension with values above 170/100; cardiac or pulmonary&#xD;
             disease; uncorrected coagulation abnormalities; diabetes; or any condition that would&#xD;

             screening physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has had an alcohol or illicit substance use disorder within the last 6 months,&#xD;
             unstable remission of substance abuse, or chart evidence that co-morbid substance use&#xD;
             disorder could account for lack of treatment response.&#xD;
