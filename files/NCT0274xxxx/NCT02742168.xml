      This is an open-label SPECT/CT (single photon emission computed tomography / computed&#xD;
      tomography) study to investigate clinical study of 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT in diagnosis and&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation of breast cancer. Diagnostic group: for patients in suspicion of breast&#xD;
      cancer. The standard of truth for diagnosis was based on histopathologic findings after&#xD;
      surgical removal of the tumor or a definite diagnosis from fine needle aspiration biopsy. A&#xD;
      single dose of nearly 0.3 mCi/kg (milli-Curie/kilogram) body weight of 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg&#xD;
      3PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the patients. Visual and semiquantitative method&#xD;
      will be used to assess the whole-body planar and lesions SPECT/CT images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy evaluation group: for patients firstly diagnose with malignant tumors (breast&#xD;
      cancer), and prepare to chemotherapy(including neoadjuvant chemotherapy) or radiotherapy. The&#xD;
      standard of truth for diagnosis was based on histopathologic findings after fine needle&#xD;
      aspiration biopsy. A single dose of nearly 0.3 mCi/kg body weight of 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg&#xD;
      3PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the patients before treatment, the second period,&#xD;
      sixth period. Visual,semiquantitative method will be used to assess the whole-body planar and&#xD;
      lesions SPECT/CT images. By comparing with result of the other related imaging, for instance,&#xD;
      PET/CT (positron emission tomography/computed tomography), CT (computed tomography), MRI&#xD;
      (magnetic resonance imaging), Doppler Ultrasound, Mammography, etc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrin αvβ3 is an important member of integrin receptor family and expressed preferentially&#xD;
      on the activated endothelial cells of angiogenesis and some types of tumor cells, but not or&#xD;
      very low on the quiescent vessel cells and other normal cells. Therefore, the integrin αvβ3&#xD;
      receptor is becoming a valuable target for diagnosis and response evaluation of malignant&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to the&#xD;
      integrin αvβ3 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have been&#xD;
      developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression via single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (SPECT)or positron emission tomography (PET). Among all the RGD&#xD;
      radiotracers studied, several RGD monomers have been investigated in clinical trials, and the&#xD;
      preliminary results demonstrated specific imaging of various types of tumors, and the tumor&#xD;
      uptake correlated well with the level of integrin αvβ3 expression. Recently, several RGD&#xD;
      dimeric peptides with PEG linkers have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed&#xD;
      much higher in vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide sequence,&#xD;
      and importantly, they exhibited significantly increased tumor uptake and improved in vivo&#xD;
      kinetics in animal models. As a representative, 99mTc-3PRGD2 could be easily prepared and&#xD;
      exhibited excellent in vivo behaviors in animal models. No adverse reactions are observed in&#xD;
      animal models to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the further interests in clinical trial of 99mTc-3PRGD2, an open-label SPECT/CT (single&#xD;
      photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography) study to investigate 99mTc-3PRGD2&#xD;
      SPECT/CT in diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of breast cancer. A single dose of nearly 0.3&#xD;
      mCi/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the&#xD;
      patients. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the whole-body planar and&#xD;
      lesions SPECT/CT images. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Visual Assessment of Breast Lesions in 99mTc-3PRGD2 SPECT/CT Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analysis will be performed by 3 experienced nuclear medicine physicians to observe the the uptake of 99mTc-3PRGD2 on breast lesions. The visual analysis interpreter's degree of suspicion for an abnormality was recorded with use of a 3-point with the following categories: score 1, no abnormal increased uptake; score 2, mildly increased uptake; score 3, definite focal increased uptake. The lesion was considered positive as malignancy if the lesion scored as 2 or higher.</description>
