    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to investigate the potential use of specific metrics in assessing&#xD;
      the quality and optimising an individual's cochlear implant fitting. Assessment of the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of specific metrics that are potential predictors of inaccurate&#xD;
      T-levels and C-levels is important to determining best methods for streamlined high quality&#xD;
      fitting, providing the potential for feedback to the individual and clinic, as well as&#xD;
      automated adjustments for optimisation. Ultimately the objective is to increase clinical&#xD;
      capacity for managing both the installed base and new candidates for cochlear implantation.&#xD;

      Optimising the clinical fitting of a cochlear implant to an individual listener is an&#xD;
      important aspect of post-operative clinical care. The level of success experienced by any&#xD;
      individual with a cochlear implant can be influenced, to a significant extent, by the quality&#xD;
      of the clinical programming by the audiologist. During clinical programming the audiologist&#xD;
      typically measures the amount of electrical charge required to elicit first hearing (the&#xD;
      T-level) and to provide a loud but comfortable percept (the C-level) on each of the 22&#xD;
      electrodes. The amount of electrical stimulation required for a threshold and a comfortably&#xD;
      loud percept varies across the electrodes of the array and also across individual users.&#xD;
      Appropriately set lower and upper electrical stimulation levels are vital for ensuring that&#xD;
      the listener is able to detect reasonably soft sounds whilst loud sounds are perceived as&#xD;
      loud while remaining comfortable. Achieving this result across the relevant frequency range&#xD;
      is a prime aim of programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of challenges in achieving optimal fitting of cochlear implant recipients&#xD;
      in the clinical setting. First, there are varying skill levels and experience level of health&#xD;
      professionals and allied workers involved in programming devices for cochlear implant&#xD;
      recipients, often resulting in variability in the quality of the program (or MAP) provided to&#xD;
      an individual. Second, there are varying levels of access to specialized equipment such as&#xD;
      sound booths which are required for some types of audiometric measures to be reliably&#xD;
      obtained. Finally, there are increasing demands on clinical capacity, with the specialized&#xD;
      centres typically treating recipients having limited resources and ability to effectively&#xD;
      manage the rapidly increasing population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, there is an increased need for effective, quality-controlled but streamlined&#xD;
      management of implanted recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to investigate the potential use of specific metrics in&#xD;
      assessing the quality and optimizing an individual's cochlear implant fitting. Assessment of&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of specific metrics that are potential predictors of&#xD;
      inaccurate T-levels and C-levels is important to determining best methods for streamlined&#xD;
      high quality fitting, as well as automated adjustments for optimizing. One of the key&#xD;
      objectives is to integrate a new technological advance in the form of in-situ audiometry,&#xD;
      which removes the need for a sound booth to conduct audibility checks of the program. Other&#xD;
      planned investigations relate to identifying the metrics which best identify maps that are&#xD;
      not optimized, and to development and assessment of a range of techniques which may be able&#xD;
      to be effectively applied in the clinical setting.&#xD;
