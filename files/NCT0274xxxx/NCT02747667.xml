  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation occurs up to 30 years after cataract&#xD;
      surgery and the prevalence ranges from 0.1% to 3.0%. Before the introduction of the&#xD;
      continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, late dislocation was very uncommon but since then&#xD;
      several case reports and case series were observed. In-the-bag IOL dislocation is a&#xD;
      well-known postoperative complication, especially in eyes with weak zonules as seen in&#xD;
      pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF), high axial myopia, uveitis and retinitis pigmentosa (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective study, medical records of all patients with IOL related problems after&#xD;
      implantation of one hydrophilic acrylic single-piece lens at the Department of Ophthalmology&#xD;
      Graz, Medical University Graz, Styria, Austria are reviewed. Characteristics and predisposing&#xD;
      factors for late in-the-bag, out-of-the-bag IOL dislocations, and haptic complications will&#xD;
      be investigated and compared amongst each other or control patients. Incidence rates for each&#xD;
      IOL complication will be calculated. For in-the-bag dislocations odds ratios for each&#xD;
      predisposing factor will be calculated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study. Data of all patients treated at the hospital from June&#xD;
      1997 to October 2015 for a complication after IOL implantation will be obtained from an&#xD;
      electronic medical record and database (FileMaker Inc., v3 - 6 and EyMed). Additional data,&#xD;
      e.g. axial length (AL) or diopters of the implanted IOL, are taken from the patients' medical&#xD;
      files. Collected data are age, sex, laterality of the eye, and predisposing eye conditions&#xD;
      (PXF, relevant myopia defined as â‰¥ 25.5 mm axial length, uveitis, RP and ocular trauma).&#xD;
      Other parameters are preoperative surgical interventions, the use of a capsular tension ring&#xD;
      (CTR), perioperative complications, diopters of the IOL, pre- and postoperative corrected&#xD;
      distance visual acuity (CDVA) in logMAR, and post-operative manifest refraction. Time to&#xD;
      dislocation, additional interventions after cataract surgery, and symptoms due to the IOL&#xD;
      complication will recorded. Type of dislocation (in-the-bag or out-of-the-bag), location&#xD;
      (anterior chamber, pupillary plane or vitreous), pre- and post-operative CDVA, pre- and&#xD;
      post-operative manifest refraction, type of secondary intervention, and in case secondary&#xD;
      implantation was performed, type of secondary IOL are collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences regarding prevalence for various predisposing risk factors are investigated by&#xD;
      means of logistic regression methods. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals are calculated&#xD;
      unadjusted as well as adjusted for age, gender, and the four predisposing risk factors: PXF,&#xD;
      relevant myopia, uveitis, and RP. Prevalence and incidence of in-the-bag IOL dislocations&#xD;
      will be calculated from all patients that had an implantation of the ACR6D SE at the&#xD;
      Department of Ophthalmology in Graz.&#xD;
