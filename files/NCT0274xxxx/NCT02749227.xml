  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, 12-month pilot study in 10 patients with silent corticotroph&#xD;
      pituitary tumors testing the hypotheses that Pasireotide long-acting release (LAR) treatment&#xD;
      of patients with silent corticotroph pituitary tumors and elevated plasma Proopiomelanocortin&#xD;
      (POMC) levels will reduce plasma POMC levels and this will be associated with a reduction in&#xD;
      pituitary tumor size. Pasireotide LAR 40 mg will be administered monthly. Baseline and&#xD;
      monthly visits on therapy will monitor plasma levels of POMC, other pituitary function,&#xD;
      safety labs, glucose tolerance, physical examination, and visual fields. Pituitary magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) will be done at baseline, 6 months and 12 months of therapy. The&#xD;
      eligible patient population will consist of adult patients with known silent corticotroph&#xD;
      pituitary tumors and elevated plasma levels of POMC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (CNFAs), the subtype of pituitary adenomas that&#xD;
      does not appear to secrete biologically active hormone nor to have a characteristic clinical&#xD;
      phenotype, are the most common type of pituitary macroadenoma at diagnosis. There is&#xD;
      currently no option for medical therapy of CNFA, in general, or specifically of silent&#xD;
      corticotroph tumors. Silent corticotroph tumors can range from being completely asymptomatic&#xD;
      to becoming large and causing significant hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction and visual&#xD;
      symptoms, and most data support that this type of tumor has a more aggressive phenotype.&#xD;
      Current therapy consists primarily of surgical removal of the tumor and for recurrent or&#xD;
      residual tumors, repeated surgery and/or radiotherapy. In very aggressive tumors,&#xD;
      chemotherapy has been tried with some success. Therefore, a need exists for a medical&#xD;
      therapeutic option for the treatment of this tumor type. This project assesses this clinical&#xD;
      need.&#xD;

    <description>Pasireotide LAR (SIGNIFOR® LAR) is a somatostatin analog indicated for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. It is a long acting release injectable suspension for intramuscular use.&#xD;
The starting dose is Pasireotide LAR 40 mg/month intramuscular (IM), this will be increased to 60 mg/month at 6 months if a fall in POMC levels and/or tumor shrinkage are not attained.</description>

             contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.&#xD;
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on&#xD;
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that&#xD;
                  subject&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or&#xD;
                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure&#xD;
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone&#xD;
                       contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal&#xD;
                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on&#xD;
                            the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                         -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential&#xD;
                            if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an&#xD;
                            appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of&#xD;
                            vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with&#xD;
                            or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In&#xD;
                            the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of&#xD;
                            the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is&#xD;
                            she considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;

Pasireotide LAR: Pasireotide LAR (SIGNIFOR® LAR) is a somatostatin analog indicated for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have had an inadequate response to surgery and/or for whom surgery is not an option. It is a long acting release injectable suspension for intramuscular use.&#xD;
The starting dose is Pasireotide LAR 40 mg/month intramuscular (IM), this will be increased to 60 mg/month at 6 months if a fall in POMC levels and/or tumor shrinkage are not attained.</description>
