  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orthognathic surgery is the state of art of the maxillofacial surgery, it fix and normalize&#xD;
      facial abnormalities and create a harmony between the different tissues compounding the face&#xD;
      (bone, soft tissue and dental structures). It is a common procedure and it is done in order&#xD;
      to correct a dentofacial and skeletal deformities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an inevitable risk of complications with this type of surgery. While postoperative&#xD;
      infections are the most common complication (2% to 33.4%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      preoperative administration of antibiotics have been proven to be effective in reducing the&#xD;
      postoperative infection rate, while, the quality of the currently available literature in&#xD;
      prescribing continues postoperative antibiotics is questionable and there is still no&#xD;
      consensus on its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unwise administration of antibiotics may cause several unwanted side effects such as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms, allergy reactions, high costs, etcâ€¦ while the most worrisome side&#xD;
      effect is a bacterial resentence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of postoperative antibiotics. And&#xD;
      will try to state a consensus in prescribing postoperative antibiotics. By conducting a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, that will explore and&#xD;
      analyze the efficacy of postoperative administration of Amoxicillin Clavulanate versus&#xD;
      placebo in reducing the rate of postoperative infections in 60 healthy patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first Orthographic operation was carried out in 1849, for the correction of&#xD;
      malocclusions, in the United States of America. Back then, this surgery was merely a&#xD;
      mandibular operation and was called Hullihen's procedure done by general surgeons. However,&#xD;
      the first cooperation between surgeons and orthodontists in the evolution of the early&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery was cradled in St. Louis by the orthodontist Edward Angle (1898) and the&#xD;
      surgeon Vilray Blair (1906). During the 19th orthognathic surgery underwent minor&#xD;
      improvements, never the less, not until the beginning of the 1950s, when orthognathic surgery&#xD;
      was deemed as a true specialty had its origins, which led to tremendous success all over the&#xD;
      world. Nowadays, orthognathic surgery is performed not only for correcting dental and&#xD;
      skeletal deformities, but also is conducted as a treatment of various congenital and&#xD;
      cranio-facial syndromes, such as Crouzon syndrome, Treacher syndrome and Apert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, orthognathic surgery is not an innocent procedure, since it contains several&#xD;
      complications. Pain, swelling, neurosensory deficits and post operative infections are the&#xD;
      most common complications. While postoperative infection is the most common one, with a 2% to&#xD;
      33.4% percentage of occurrences. Postoperative infections increase the mortality rate of&#xD;
      orthognathic procedure and may create a challenge for the surgeon and the medical staff,&#xD;
      thus, reducing its prevalence is critical issue in defining the success of this unique&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative prophylaxis has been proven as an efficient in decreasing the rate of&#xD;
      postoperative infections in orthognathic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the current literature regarding the efficacy of postoperative antibiotics questionable&#xD;
      and there is still no consensus on its efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy of postoperative antibiotics. And will try to state a consensus in&#xD;
      prescribing postoperative antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives and Goals of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of post operative antibiotics&#xD;
      in decreasing the rate of postoperative infections in orthognathic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to state and formulate a consensus in prescribing postoperative&#xD;
      antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is a prospective, double blind, randomized, placebo control, clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of post-operative antibiotics in prevention early surgery related infections will&#xD;
      be investigated. The potential benefit of the study lies particular in reducing the various&#xD;
      side effects of unwise administration of antibiotics, along with the high cost and bacterial&#xD;
      resistant resulted from antibiotics overuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study subjects will be allocated by the investigator into two study groups through the&#xD;
      use of randomization. The Intervention group will be getting intra-venous1GR Amoxicillin&#xD;
      Clavulanate 3 times a day for 5 days post surgery; while the Control group will be getting&#xD;
      intra-venous Placebo for 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, 50 patients will participate in this study, an important prerequisite for&#xD;
      this study is a completely healthy patients. Then the patients will be allocated randomly&#xD;
      into two subgroups: intervention group and control group, as mentioned before.&#xD;
