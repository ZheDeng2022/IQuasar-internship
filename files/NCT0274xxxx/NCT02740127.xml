  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During penile prosthesis surgery, patients are given general anesthesia in combination with&#xD;
      other pain drugs. A caudal nerve block (CNB) is a local anesthetic injected near the&#xD;
      tailbone, in addition to general anesthesia, which can lower the need for pain drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn how effective CNBs are in patients who&#xD;
      are having penile prosthesis surgery compared to patients who only have general anesthesia by&#xD;
      studying how long you stay in the hospital and the level of pain you have after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. The general anesthesia and CNB used in this study are FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available. It is considered investigational to compare the&#xD;
      effectiveness of CNBs in penile prosthesis surgery to general anesthesia alone. The study&#xD;
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 104 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Groups and CNB Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal chance of being&#xD;
      assigned to either group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 1, you will receive a CNB and general anesthesia during&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are assigned to Group 2, you will only receive general anesthesia during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will not know to which group you have been assigned. The CNB will be given to you while&#xD;
      you are under general anesthesia. To receive a CNB, a special needle is inserted at the lower&#xD;
      part of the back (near the tailbone). A type of local anesthesia is then injected into the&#xD;
      sac surrounding the spinal cord that contains the nerves related to the penis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will also receive general anesthesia as part of their standard care. You&#xD;
      will also receive a separate consent form for the surgery that explains the procedure and its&#xD;
      risks, including the risks for general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Surgery Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 24 hours after surgery, the study staff will ask you to rate your pain on a scale&#xD;
      of 0-10. You will be asked to rate your pain about every 30 minutes while you are in the&#xD;
      hospital, but you may be asked to rate your pain more often if needed. It should take less&#xD;
      than 5 minutes each time to rate your pain. Depending on how you rate your pain, additional&#xD;
      pain drugs may be given to you as part of your standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are discharged from the hospital on the same day as your surgery or if you are&#xD;
      discharged before a member of the staff can ask you to rate your pain, the study staff will&#xD;
      call you within 24 hours after you have been discharged from the hospital. This call should&#xD;
      last about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of pain drugs given to you before, during, and after surgery will also be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 3 days after your surgery, the study staff will call you to ask about your pain, the&#xD;
      amount of pain drugs you have taken, and how satisfied you are with the type of anesthesia&#xD;
      and pain control you have received. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation in this study will be over after the phone call about 3 days after your&#xD;
      surgery has been completed.&#xD;

    <description>To determine whether the use of a CNB in patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery results in decreased immediate postoperative pain in the first 24 hours after surgery compared with patients having only general anesthesia as determined by postop pain score. The mean, median and max pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale (NRS). The NRS is scored by numeric integers, 0 through 10. The NRS will be used verbally. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their pain intensity. Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'</description>

        <description>To determine whether the use of a CNB in patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery results in decreased immediate postoperative pain in the first 24 hours after surgery compared with patients having only general anesthesia as determined by postop pain score. The mean, median and max pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale (NRS). The NRS is scored by numeric integers, 0 through 10. The NRS will be used verbally. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), patients are asked to circle the number between 0 and 10 that fits best to their pain intensity. Zero usually represents 'no pain at all' whereas the upper limit represents 'the worst pain ever possible'</description>
