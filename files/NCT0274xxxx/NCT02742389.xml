    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an intervention (pre-procedure telephone&#xD;
      call by the investigators) will reduce anxiety in women undergoing urodynamic testing (UDT)&#xD;
      compared to usual care. Our hypothesis is that women who receive the intervention will report&#xD;
      less anxiety immediately before UDT than women who receive usual care.&#xD;

      This is a non-blinded, randomized controlled trial. The clinical trial will investigate&#xD;
      whether a telephone call by the investigator one week prior to urodynamic testing (UDT) will&#xD;
      decrease patient pre-procedure anxiety, improve patient-reported preparedness and increase&#xD;
      satisfaction compared to usual care. Patients who are scheduled for UDT will be informed&#xD;
      about the study. If the patient agrees to participate in the study, she will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of 2 groups based on the week of her scheduled UDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Standard counseling. This group will receive the standard counseling that all Boston&#xD;
      Urogynecology Associates (BUA) patients would receive if they are scheduled to have&#xD;
      urodynamic testing. This counseling will include a description of the procedure and a handout&#xD;
      about urodynamic testing. On the day of their test the participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      a brief survey about their experience before and after their testing. The investigators will&#xD;
      also collect some information from their medical record, such as age and prior urogynecologic&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Standard counseling plus the intervention. The participants assigned to be in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive the standard counseling that all BUA patients who are&#xD;
      scheduled for urodynamic testing receive (just like those who are assigned to group 1). This&#xD;
      counseling includes a description of the procedure and a handout about urodynamic testing. In&#xD;
      addition, the participants will receive a phone call from the investigators 1 week before&#xD;
      their testing to talk about the procedure. The investigator calling the participant will&#xD;
      document the duration of the phone call and any questions asked by the participant. On the&#xD;
      day of their test the participants will be asked to complete the same surveys as group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys given to the participants on the day of their UDT appointment will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A pre-UDT questionnaire that includes questions on demographics, overall anxiety,&#xD;
           anxiety about specific elements of procedure, self-reported preparedness and&#xD;
           satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A brief post-UDT questionnaire addressing test experience and pain.&#xD;
