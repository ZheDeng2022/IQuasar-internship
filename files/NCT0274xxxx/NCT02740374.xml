    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of ROTEM, during spinal surgery is&#xD;
      effective on diminishing the total blood loss and the risk of Allogenic Transfusion of Blood&#xD;
      Products vs control cases without ROTEM assessment.&#xD;

      Study methods This is a prospective, randomized parallel-group single center study in&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective major spine surgery. Patients will be randomized to ROTEM-guided&#xD;
      hemostatic therapy algorithm or standard of care hemostatic therapy: arterial blood gas&#xD;
      analysis (ABG), normalized index ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), thromboplastin time&#xD;
      (aPTT), hemoglobin (Hb), platelets, and fibrinogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either standard of care&#xD;
      coagulation tests (SOC) or ROTEM. No changes in surgery or anesthesia technique will be made&#xD;
      for the purposes of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of Care Coagulation Tests If patients are randomized to standard of care coagulation&#xD;
      tests, these will be performed according to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&#xD;
      standard practices and attending's criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care tests include but are not limited to: hemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen&#xD;
      concentration, INR, aPTT, and PT. These will be performed at fixed time points&#xD;
      (preoperatively, every 2 hours intraoperatively, procedure completion, and 24 hours after&#xD;
      procedure completion). Arterial blood gases will be performed repetitively intraoperative at&#xD;
      a fixed range every 1-hour or at attending's criteria, as well as any postoperative&#xD;
      laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM If patients are randomized to ROTEM, the anesthesiologist will be blinded to any&#xD;
      intraoperative conventional coagulation test that might be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM will be used according to the manufacturer's instructions, using equipment and test&#xD;
      reagents provided by Tem International GmbH. All tests will be performed at the bedside by a&#xD;
      clinical perfusionist trained to perform ROTEM. A specific algorithm has been created and&#xD;
      should be followed according to clinical criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROTEM monitoring will be performed in patients with signs of clinically relevant diffuse&#xD;
      bleeding and in whom blood transfusion is considered (Temp &gt;35 Celsius degrees; pH lower than&#xD;
      7.2; Cai above 4.6 mg/dL; Hb below 9g/dL, or below 10g/dL with anticipated greater blood&#xD;
      loss) or at a fixed range every 2 hours or at Anesthesiologist criteria based on patient's&#xD;
      clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PatientÂ´s clinical situation should be consider as the most important component on the&#xD;
      transfusion decision-making process. Packed erythrocytes will be transfused to maintain&#xD;
      hemoglobin concentrations higher 9g/dl and higher 10g/dl in individuals with underlying&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease or anticipated greater blood loss. Individual based dynamics strongly&#xD;
      indicating the need for erythrocyte transfusion at anesthesiologist criteria will be also&#xD;
      part of the transfusion making decision-making process (tachycardia, hypotension, sings of&#xD;
      ischemia on electrocardiogram, lactic acidosis, and dynamics of bleeding).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and reporting of Adverse Events The occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAE) will be recorded from the time of consent until discharge. For each AE,&#xD;
      the relationship to the study procedures and monitoring, severity, expectedness, outcome will&#xD;
      be determined by the PI and recorded in the study source accordingly If the case a subject&#xD;
      withdraws from the study due to a serious adverse event the local Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      (IRB) will be notified within 10 days.&#xD;
