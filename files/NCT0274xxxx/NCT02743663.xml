    <textblock>
      The study will ascertain the ability of preschool lung function tests to distinguish healthy&#xD;
      children from those with wheeze, and to differentiate phenotypes of wheezy children (high and&#xD;
      low risk for asthma as defined by API) in order to predict response to therapy, and to&#xD;
      explore the correlation between preschool lung function test results and symptoms, in order&#xD;
      to develop objective methods for monitoring asthma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Canada, the most common chronic disease of childhood is asthma. Childhood asthma places a&#xD;
      significant burden on the health care system (refn). No objective preschool asthma diagnostic&#xD;
      tools exist, and the current gold-standard, the Asthma Predictive Index, does not provide&#xD;
      information about lung function and symptom management. In this study, it is hypothesized&#xD;
      that the lung clearance index (LCI), a value derived from the multiple breath washout test,&#xD;
      will be the most sensitive, responsive discriminative test for preschool asthma. If it proves&#xD;
      useful in the monitoring and diagnosis of preschool asthma, LCI has the potential to improve&#xD;
      the clinical management and thus potentially significantly reduce hospitalization rates for&#xD;
      preschool children suffering with asthma. In this unique data set, the investigators will&#xD;
      also compare the relative utility of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and preschool&#xD;
      spirometry with the LCI in order to detect abnormalities amongst those children at high risk&#xD;
      for preschool asthma. In addition, the impact of sleep apnea as a risk factor for and&#xD;
      modifier of asthma will be investigated in this study. Furthermore, changes to the&#xD;
      composition of the nasal microbiome during and after a wheezing episodes and the role of&#xD;
      viral infections in wheezing exacerbations will be explored. Finally, the utility of new&#xD;
      methods of diagnosing food allergy, such as the basophil activation test, will be examined in&#xD;
      this Canadian cohort.&#xD;

    <description>Two study visits will be completed with wheezing subjects. The baseline visit will be completed within a 5 day window from the child's discharge from the emergency department. The follow-up visit will be completed 3 months after the baseline visit. At both visits, participants will provide a nasal swab and urine sample, complete three breathing tests: multiple-breath washout, forced oscillation technique, and Spirometry. In addition, at the follow-up visit, children will have an allergy skin test done, a nasal brush to collect epithelial cells and provide a blood sample. Whole blood will be used for basophil activation test (BAT). Children age 4+ will also complete post-bronchodilator testing using Salbutamol to capture information about bronchodilator response.</description>
