      GreenLight laser PVP currently gains wide acceptance as a minimally invasive treatment for&#xD;
      benign prostate enlargment and the emergence of ejaculatory sparing techniques made it&#xD;
      feasible to get both benefits: relief of lower urinary tract symptoms and preservation of&#xD;
      ejaculation. However evaluation of actual infravesical de-obstruction following such&#xD;
      techniques remains a grey zone in the literature without an objective assessment of the&#xD;
      degree of de-obstruction. Furthermore, the impact of maintaining ejaculation on different&#xD;
      domains of the sexual function using comprehensive assessment tools was not compared in&#xD;
      ejaculatory sparring vs. non-ejaculatory sparring approaches.&#xD;

      I- Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benign prostatic enlargement is one of the most prevalent disorders in aging men and may&#xD;
      develop into benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) causing a significant effect on the quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL). Clinical manifestations of BPO include a variety of lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms (LUTS) that can be classified into voiding symptoms or storage symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser prostatectomy includes two major technical principles; enucleation of the adenoma from&#xD;
      the surrounding capsule or laser ablation of the adenoma. GreenLight laser (532-nm laser) and&#xD;
      Holmium: Yttrium-Aluminum-Aarnet (Ho:YAG) laser (2100 nm) are commonly used nowadays.&#xD;
      However, TURP remains the gold standard modality of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejaculation is one of the fundamental domains of male sexual functions. It is well&#xD;
      established that ejaculation disturbances, either anejaculation or loss of antegrade&#xD;
      ejaculation, are almost inevitable adverse effects of prostate surgery especially TURP. A&#xD;
      problem which also associates prolonged use of α-adrenoreceptros blockers. Such adverse event&#xD;
      can be the reason why patients may choose to avoid surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This ejaculatory dysfunction can be attributed, according to current theory of ejaculation,&#xD;
      to the loss of bladder neck function after resection. However, many recent studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that bladder neck closure may not have such important role in maintaining&#xD;
      antegrade ejaculation. Recent techniques had been developed to preserve ejaculation including&#xD;
      ejaculatory hood sparing technique, prostatic urethral lift and the Rezum System ( convective&#xD;
      water vapor energy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejaculatory hood was defined as paracollicular and supracollicular tissue present 1 cm&#xD;
      proximal to the verumontanum. Hermabessiere et al. used dynamic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)&#xD;
      findings after TURP to demonstrate that the ejaculate is directly expelled into the&#xD;
      infra-montanal urethra with a direct closure mechanism of the paracollicular and&#xD;
      supracollicular tissue without previous ballooning of the prostatic urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies were published highlighting this ejaculation preserving technique and its&#xD;
      impact on relieving LUTS. Alloussi et al. conducted ejaculatory preserving TURP (epTURP) on&#xD;
      total number of 89 patients during which the ejaculatory hood area was preserved and was not&#xD;
      affected by cutting or coagulation. Antegrade ejaculation was preserved in 90% of patients at&#xD;
      3 months with significant improvement of LUTS and only 12.7% of cases needed a second session&#xD;
      for bladder neck contracture after 60 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GreenLight laser PVP is now challenging TURP as the standard treatment for lower LUTS caused&#xD;
      by BPH for its many advantages e.g. short learning curve, a shorter period of postoperative&#xD;
      bladder catheterization, lower levels of retrograde ejaculation and low indices of&#xD;
      postoperative hematuria etc. Recently, with the introduction of the latest generation of the&#xD;
      GreenLight laser (XPS), greenlight PVP using XPS system proved to be non inferior to TURP in&#xD;
      reducing LUTS secondary to BPH with all the advantages of laser. [GOLIATH TRIAL].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tabatabaei S et al. described the ejaculation preserving PVP (EP-PVP) technique applied to&#xD;
      160 patients and presented its outcomes. Postoperative ejaculatory function evaluation showed&#xD;
      that 56% patients had normal antegrade ejaculation, 30.6% patients had diminished&#xD;
      ejaculation, and 13.4% patients suffered no ejaculation. Post voiding residual urine (PVR)&#xD;
      and peak urinary flow rate (Qmax) showed significant improvement. Overall, EP-PVP technique&#xD;
      was successful in preserving ejaculatory function in 86.6% of patients, without compromising&#xD;
      LUTS outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of published similar studies relied on degree of reduction of International prostate&#xD;
      symptoms score (IPSS), PSA, PVR and uroflowmetry to assess the improvement of LUTS following&#xD;
      ejaculatory preserving prostate surgery, without actual functional assessment of degree of&#xD;
      deobstruction via urodynamic investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pereira-Correia JA et al. conducted a prospective urodynamic based trial comparing TURP and&#xD;
      GreenLight laser PVP in total number of 20 patients over 2 years. In this study the older&#xD;
      generation of the GreenLight laser (HPS) was utilized and conventional PVP technique was&#xD;
      applied looking for the urodynamic changes between Greenlight PVP and TURP. They reported&#xD;
      that high-power PVP can achieve and maintain the same results as TURP over a period of 24&#xD;
      months as regards improvement of infravesical obstruction evidenced by reduction of mean&#xD;
      micturition pressure and bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      GreenLight laser PVP currently gains wide acceptance and the emergence of ejaculatory sparing&#xD;
      techniques made it feasible to get both benefits: relief of LUTS and preservation of&#xD;
      ejaculation. However evaluation of actual infravesical deobstruction following such&#xD;
      techniques remains a grey zone in the literature without an objective assessment of the&#xD;
      degree of deobstruction. Furthermore, the impact of maintaining ejaculation on different&#xD;
      domains of the sexual function using comprehensive assessment tools was not compared in&#xD;
      ejaculatory sparring vs. non-ejaculatory sparring approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- Aim of the work&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we planned to compare ejaculatory sparing and non-ejaculatory sparing&#xD;
      (conventional) GreenLightTM Laser PVP using both subjective and objective assessment tools&#xD;
      for the degree of deobstruction. Furthermore, the impact of both techniques on ejaculation&#xD;
      and its secondary effect on orgasm perception and different domains of sexual function will&#xD;
      be thoroughly assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.1. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov ID:&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.2. Target population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Prostate Unit, Mansoura urology and nephrology center, sexually active patients presented&#xD;
      with LUTS secondary to BPO who failed medical treatment will be scheduled for GreenLightTM&#xD;
      Laser PVP. BPH surgical candidates are patients presented with LUTS secondary to BOO due to&#xD;
      BPH who failed medical treatment with IPSS score &gt;15 and Peak urinary flow rate Qmax &lt; 15&#xD;
      ml/min with at least 125 ml voided volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Legible subjects fulfilling inclusion criteria will be included in a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial and will be asked to sign an informed consent form according to Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      and the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.3. Patients' allocation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be allocated into 2 groups. In the 1st one, patients will undergo regular non&#xD;
      ejaculatory sparing GreenLightTM Laser PVP (Group I), while in the 2nd group (Group II);&#xD;
      ejaculatory sparing technique will be applied. Patients are asked to sign the informed&#xD;
      consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.4.a. Intervention All laser surgeries will be performed or supervised by a single surgeon&#xD;
      with large experience with laser prostate surgery. Procedures will be performed with the&#xD;
      patient under general or regional anesthesia. Normal saline will be used as an irrigant. The&#xD;
      GreenLight (532 nm) laser generator (XPS) will be used with our previously described&#xD;
      technique for Group I. A side-to-side sweeping technique was used with the side firing fiber&#xD;
      moving from the area of the bladder neck to approximately the level of the verumontanum. As&#xD;
      much as possible, the end point of the laser procedure was a TURP-like cavity lined by&#xD;
      capsular fibers, as judged by the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Group II, similar equipment will be used and steps of PVP will be similarly performed.&#xD;
      However the procedure starts by marking of the ejaculatory hood; paracollicular and&#xD;
      supracollicular tissue present almost 1 cm proximal to the verumontanum using the Co-Ag mode&#xD;
      of the laser (40W). The obstructing prostate tissue will be vaporized sparing the ejaculatory&#xD;
      hood without vaporization or coagulation at the marked hood area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III.4.b. Assessment tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejaculatory domain of Male sexual health questionnaire (Ej-MSHQ) 16 will be used for detailed&#xD;
      assessment of the impact of each procedure on ejaculatory function and subsequently the&#xD;
      impact of reported ejaculatory changes on orgasm perception. This domain entails seven&#xD;
      questions assessing ejaculatory frequency, latency, volume, force, pain, pleasure, and dry&#xD;
      ejaculation. Each question has a score from 1 to 5 (best function) and the outcome of each&#xD;
      question is considered significantly impaired once equals 2 or less. A total Ej-MSHQ score of&#xD;
      good ejaculatory function was considered for a range from 28-35, average from 22 to 27 and&#xD;
      ejaculatory dysfunction for score less than 22 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      International index of erectile function-15 (IIEF-15) 5 ; each of the five domains (EF,&#xD;
      orgasm, desire, intercourse satisfaction and overall satisfaction) will be assessed and the&#xD;
      degree of change from baseline to the last follow up will be depicted. EF domain is a 30&#xD;
      points score and normal EF is considered for score more than 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urinary outcome evaluation will be done using IPSS (International prostate symptom score),&#xD;
      QOL (quality of life), Q.max (maximum flow rate) and PVR (post void residual urine&#xD;
      estimation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urodynamic evaluation will be performed in accordance with the standards recommended by the&#xD;
      International Continence Society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and will be followed post procedure at 2 weeks, one,&#xD;
      four and twelve months interval. In the first and second visits patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      urinary function and once their voiding parameters deemed satisfactory, they will be&#xD;
      counseled to resume their sexual activity as before. Patients will be thoroughly evaluated at&#xD;
      subsequent visits for both urinary and sexual outcome parameters (4 and 12 months' visits)&#xD;
&#xD;
      V.1. Randomization&amp; masking:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process was performed using computer-generated random tables in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Patients were randomly assigned to the study groups on the day of the surgery, once&#xD;
      the patient signs the informed consent for participation in the study. We randomly assigned&#xD;
      patients to one of our treatment groups by means of stratified-blocked randomization across&#xD;
      two strata derived from predetermined size grouping (30-55ml and 55-80ml) and two strata&#xD;
      derived from preoperative medication (alpha blockers vs. non alpha blockers user).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method ensured parity among our two treatment groups. In each stratum, given two&#xD;
      possible block lengths of two and four respectively, with a random number generator giving&#xD;
      numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, we selected a block length of two for random&#xD;
      numbers lower than 0.5 or a block length of four otherwise. Variation of the block sizes&#xD;
      prevented the surgeon from guessing what the next treatment will be; it makes it difficult&#xD;
      (although not impossible) to break the treatment code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V.2. Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgeon knew the randomly assigned laser procedure for each patient in the operating&#xD;
      room. All patients, nurses performing urine flow studies/ addressing the questionnaires, and&#xD;
      physician doing the urodynamic studies will be blinded to the type of the procedure.&#xD;
