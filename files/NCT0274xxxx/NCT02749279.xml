  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important drugs for evidence based lipid lowering treatment (LLT) in CHD are&#xD;
      statins. All patients with established CHD should be treated with statins irrespective of low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The goals of treatment are LDL-C below&#xD;
      1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or 50% LDL-C reduction when target level cannot be reached.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, several patients cannot achieve treatment targets also related to the serious&#xD;
      problem of adherence to therapy, which includes also LLT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In German rehabilitation clinics the number of patients who has a clear indication for LLT is&#xD;
      continuously high since years. Approximately 2,000 patients with cardiac diseases were&#xD;
      treated per year per clinic and momentarily approximately three fourth of them have an&#xD;
      indication for LLT, mainly patients with CHD. The main length of stay in German&#xD;
      rehabilitation clinics is 21 days, which gives the chance and the necessity to optimize LLT,&#xD;
      since in approximately 50% of all patients with an indication for LLT treatment targets are&#xD;
      not achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients will give written informed consent, data will be collected. Here, all relevant&#xD;
      baseline parameters (drug treatment, indication for rehabilitation, all clinical diagnoses,&#xD;
      age, sex, BMI, echocardiographic parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction,&#xD;
      laboratory parameters corresponding to the recording standard of the clinic, etc.) will be&#xD;
      recorded in a central database (online-CRF). Furthermore, as the main topic of interest of&#xD;
      the study, LLT at baseline, LLT during the rehabilitation phase, and LLT treatment at&#xD;
      discharge including the recommendation given for the home physicians regarding LLT in the&#xD;
      discharge letter will be collected. Here, according to the AHA/ACC Guideline (9) LLT will be&#xD;
      stratified in low-intensity statin therapy (Simvastatin 10mg, Pravastatin 10-20mg, Lovastatin&#xD;
      20mg, Fluvastatin 20-40mg), moderate-intensity statin therapy (Atorvastatin 10-20mg,&#xD;
      Rosuvastatin 5-10mg, Simvastatin 20-40mg, Pravastatin 40-80mg, Lovastatin 40mg, Fluvastatin&#xD;
      80mg) and high-intensity statin therapy (Atorvastatin 40-80mg, Rosuvastatin 20-40mg).&#xD;
      Furthermore, data on other lipid lowering drugs such as cholesterol resorption inhibitors,&#xD;
      fibrates and PCSK-9 inhibitors will be collected. Adverse events related to drug therapy will&#xD;
      be further collected and submitted to the German health authorities. Furthermore, serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAE), for drugs manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis, Zentiva or Genzyme, will be&#xD;
      submitted to Sanofi-Aventis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge patient will receive a questionnaire, which includes questions about change of&#xD;
      drug treatment during the next 12 months. Here, patients will record prospectively whether&#xD;
      medication has been changed and if so, why, and who changed it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge patients will be contacted by mail after three and twelve months. Patients&#xD;
      will asked in addition to the questionnaire at discharge about drug therapy with special&#xD;
      regards to LLT Changes in medication will be documented by comparison of drug list at&#xD;
      discharge with the patient reported drugs, which are taken at time of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, general questions about other drug therapy, re-hospitalizations especially in&#xD;
      connection with atherosclerotic diseases such as cardiac death, Re-PCI, Bypass, pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism, TIA/ stroke, bleeding, ACS/MI, and others are recorded. In this disease registry&#xD;
      these endpoints will be recorded separately and statistically analyzed, however not defined&#xD;
      as AE and not recorded as such. Patients will be further asked whether other adverse events&#xD;
      occurred and whether they may be related to drug therapy. If AEs in relation to drug therapy&#xD;
      will be reported these information will be submitted to the German health authorities. SAE,&#xD;
      with drugs manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis,Zentiva or Genzyme will be submitted to&#xD;
      Sanofi-Aventis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical research organization (CRO) will carry out&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GCP-compliant data management: eCRF - creation including validation and consistency&#xD;
           checks, input and training regarding the manual (while auditors meeting), online&#xD;
           delivery incl. license allocation and support, patient registration, query management,&#xD;
           data export to biometrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GCP-compliant quality control (Clinical Monitoring), setup process including monitoring,&#xD;
           initiating the inspection once centrally (auditors meeting) including a total of 22&#xD;
           on-site visits (2 / center).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study preparation incl. review of study documents, submission to ethics committees,&#xD;
           supporting the drafting and implementation, creation of test folder and the &quot;Trial&#xD;
           Master Files&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Coordination and care of the on-site files&#xD;
