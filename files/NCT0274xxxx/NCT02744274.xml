      The aim of this pilot study is to investigate the efficacy of acupuncture in prevention of&#xD;
      chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. The study adapted a single center, randomized,&#xD;
      assessor- and participant-blinded, controlled, and parallel-design approach to investigate&#xD;
      whether acupuncture can prevent or postpone the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy and&#xD;
      improve quality of life.&#xD;

      Background and purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a disabling side effect of several&#xD;
      commonly used antineoplastic agents. CIPN prevalence was 68.1% within the first month of the&#xD;
      end of chemotherapy, 60% at 3 months, and 30.0% at 6 months or later. Oxaliplatin as a&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic drug for colorectal cancer has neurotoxicity on peripheral nerve system. A&#xD;
      definite portion of patients suffered neurologic symptoms including paresthesia, dysesthesia&#xD;
      over limbs and perioral area accompanied with muscles cramps or spasm sometimes; however, had&#xD;
      impact on quality of life, daily functions, quality of sleep and lead to distress and&#xD;
      depression. There is no drug to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Clinical observations reveal&#xD;
      that acupuncture could decrease peripheral neuropathy, improve quality of life, and promote&#xD;
      motivation of complete chemotherapy course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 32 volunteers of patients with colorectal cancer will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Chinese medicine or Western medicine clinics in China Medical University Hospital. These&#xD;
      patients will be randomized to receive verum acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment two&#xD;
      times biweekly, prior to beginning chemotherapy and the weeks that drugs administered, for 26&#xD;
      treatments in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires, neurological examination and Von Frey Filament Test will be completed at&#xD;
      baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after initiation of intervention, 12 and 24 weeks after completion&#xD;
      of acupuncture completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predict results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators expect that the efficacy of verum acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture&#xD;
      in prevent or postpone occurrence of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy and able to&#xD;
      improve numbness, paresthesia, quality of life. The effectiveness of acupuncture can be&#xD;
      detected by questionnaires, Von Frey Filament Test and neurological testing.&#xD;
