      Iron Oxide Nano Particle m-PEG-silane (IOP) Injection belongs to Superparamagnetic iron oxide&#xD;
      (SPIO) can shorten the T2 relaxation time very effectively and reduces signal intensity in&#xD;
      normal tissues. The mechanism of action increases after the particles have been phagocytosed&#xD;
      by cells of the RES. Tissues with decreased RES function (e.g., metastases, primary liver&#xD;
      cancer, cysts and various benign tumors, adenomas, and hyperplasia) retain their native&#xD;
      signal intensity. In this study, investigators will characterize the PK profile, iron&#xD;
      metabolism and preliminary efficacy of IOP Injection.&#xD;
