    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, dose escalation phase I trial to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 and identify recommended&#xD;
      phase II doses of SHR-1210 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, nonrandomized, dose-escalation Phase 1 study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 in subjects with advanced Solid Tumors who have&#xD;
      failed current standard antitumor therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and tolerability of SHR-1210 will be assessed by ongoing reviews of clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, physical&#xD;
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and adverse events. Evaluations of immune safety will&#xD;
      also be conducted (immune-related AEs, or labs of autoimmune sera, inflammatory events, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity). Safety evaluations (both clinical and laboratory) are performed at baseline,&#xD;
      before each study treatment, and throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed every 8 weeks. The study consists of 3 periods: screening (up to 14&#xD;
      days before the first dose), treatment, and follow-up (up to 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
      study treatment).&#xD;
