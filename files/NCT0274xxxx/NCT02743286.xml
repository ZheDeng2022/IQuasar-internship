    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior, characterized by excess sitting time during waking hours, is detrimental&#xD;
      to health and increases cardiometabolic disease risk, independent of moderate-to-vigorous&#xD;
      physical activity. The mechanisms that mediate this are unknown and there are no&#xD;
      evidence-based methods known for effectively intervening on sedentary behavior. The&#xD;
      consequences of prolonged sitting time are of particular interest in older adults as&#xD;
      sedentary behavior and cardiometabolic disease risk both increase with aging and&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity may not be feasible. This pilot study will assess&#xD;
      interventions for sedentary older adults designed to interrupt prolonged sitting time.&#xD;
      Interrupting sitting time through sit-to-stand transitions, and standing and walking breaks&#xD;
      increases muscle use and blood flow in the lower parts of the body. Thus, the investigators&#xD;
      believe that frequent sit-to-stand interruptions of sitting time are the most efficacious&#xD;
      sedentary behavior interventions, compared to simply reducing sitting time or less frequent&#xD;
      walking breaks, for improving health outcomes and healthy aging. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that frequency of sit-to-stands during a 5-hour sitting period will result in&#xD;
      health benefits that can be observed with a simple 2-minute standing interruption, and that&#xD;
      this will be associated with improvements in metabolism and endothelial function. This pilot,&#xD;
      10-participant study will 1) generate preliminary data for a revised Program Project Grant&#xD;
      application to the National Institute of Aging (NIA) that focuses on postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      the fastest growing aged population with high life-time risk of cardiometabolic risk. This&#xD;
      pilot study will inform sitting interruption modality design for two projects in the&#xD;
      investigators' Program Project Grant application: &quot;Project 1: Sedentary Behavior Interrupted:&#xD;
      A randomized crossover treatment trial of acute effects on biomarkers of healthy aging in the&#xD;
      laboratory (86 participants)&quot; and &quot;Project 2: Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: A randomized&#xD;
      trial of 6 month effects on biomarkers of healthy aging and physical functioning in the real&#xD;
      world (660 participants).&quot; The current design of this pilot study is enhanced by and&#xD;
      responsive to feedback from our initial NIA submission. This pilot study will increase our&#xD;
      knowledge about how sedentary behavior and sitting interruption interventions influence&#xD;
      healthy aging in postmenopausal women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sedentary behavior, characterized by excess sitting time during waking hours, is detrimental&#xD;
      to health and increases cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes) risk, independent of&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The mechanisms that mediate this are unknown and&#xD;
      there are no evidence-based methods known for effectively intervening on sedentary behavior.&#xD;
      The consequences of prolonged sitting time are of particular interest in older adults as&#xD;
      sedentary behavior and cardiometabolic disease risk both increase with aging and&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity may not be feasible. The investigators propose pilot&#xD;
      and feasibility testing of interventions for sedentary older adults that are designed to&#xD;
      interrupt prolonged sitting time. Interrupting sitting time through sit-to-stand transitions,&#xD;
      and standing and walking breaks increases muscle use and blood flow in the lower parts of the&#xD;
      body. Thus, the investigators believe that frequent sit-to-stand interruptions of sitting&#xD;
      time are the most efficacious sedentary behavior interventions, compared to simply reducing&#xD;
      sitting time or less frequent walking breaks, for improving health outcomes and healthy&#xD;
      aging. The investigators hypothesize that frequent sit-to-stands during a 5-hour sitting&#xD;
      period will result in health benefits that can be observed with a simple 2-minute standing&#xD;
      interruption, and that this will be associated with improvements in metabolism and&#xD;
      endothelial function. This pilot, 10-participant study will 1) generate preliminary data for&#xD;
      a revised Program Project Grant application to the National Institute of Aging (NIA) that&#xD;
      focuses on postmenopausal women, the fastest growing aged population with high life-time risk&#xD;
      of cardiometabolic risk. This pilot study will inform sitting interruption modality design&#xD;
      for two projects in the investigators' Program Project Grant application: &quot;Project 1:&#xD;
      Sedentary Behavior Interrupted: A randomized crossover treatment trial of acute effects on&#xD;
      biomarkers of healthy aging in the laboratory (86 participants)&quot; and &quot;Project 2: Sedentary&#xD;
      Behavior Interrupted: A randomized trial of 6 month effects on biomarkers of healthy aging&#xD;
      and physical functioning in the real world (660 participants).&quot; The current design of this&#xD;
      pilot study is enhanced by and responsive to feedback from our initial NIA submission. This&#xD;
      pilot study will increase our knowledge about how sedentary behavior and sitting interruption&#xD;
      interventions influence healthy aging in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM The deleterious health consequences of too much sitting are independent of&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Understanding the health consequences of sitting time&#xD;
      is particularly relevant for older adults who are extremely sedentary and at high risk of&#xD;
      several chronic diseases that have been linked with sitting time, including type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      Interestingly, sedentary behavior is least studied among older adults who may benefit the&#xD;
      most from reducing sitting time. Reducing uninterrupted sitting time in older adults is a&#xD;
      research priority because the pervasiveness of sitting time, typically &gt;8 hours per day,&#xD;
      provides many opportunities for intervention. Specific interventions are required to reduce&#xD;
      sitting because it is such a habitual behavior and is reinforced by social norms and&#xD;
      chair-dominant contexts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this pilot study, the investigators focus on three different types of prolonged sitting&#xD;
      interruptions as variables. Studies have shown that frequent breaks in sitting may reduce&#xD;
      risk for cardiometabolic disease. In older adults, the investigators anticipate that frequent&#xD;
      sit-to-stand transitions will impact metabolic, inflammatory and other biomarkers, in&#xD;
      particular those related to mitochondrial and endothelial function. A key limitation of&#xD;
      previous sedentary intervention studies is that they have not impacted frequency of&#xD;
      sit-to-stand transitions; rather, they decreased total sitting and increased standing time.&#xD;
      Further, previous sedentary intervention studies have not directly compared frequent&#xD;
      sit-to-stand transition interruptions with other interruption modalities associated with less&#xD;
      frequent sit-to-stand transitions, for example, reduced overall sitting time (standing more)&#xD;
      or with occasional walking breaks. The investigators propose to test these sedentary behavior&#xD;
      interruptions modalities to disrupt prolonged sitting and explore mitochondrial- and&#xD;
      endothelial function-based mechanisms of action. Biologic theories suggest that interrupting&#xD;
      sitting via sit-to-stand muscle contraction and increased blood flow to extremities is key to&#xD;
      improving in healthy aging outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a controlled laboratory study of prolonged sitting, 3 different interruption break types&#xD;
      will be utilized. Ten sedentary, postmenopausal participants 55+ years of age and body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) of 27-45 will be enrolled. After screening and enrollment, participants will&#xD;
      visit the clinic on 4 occasions for a 6-hour monitoring period and, following a 1-hour&#xD;
      sitting run-in period, complete each of 4 5-hour sitting protocols. The 3 sitting&#xD;
      interruption protocols will each include sitting interruptions of different break frequency&#xD;
      and type and will allow evaluation of the effect of sit-to-stand transitions and interruption&#xD;
      type on acute metabolism and health outcomes. All study protocols include baseline,&#xD;
      mid-point, and end-of-study bathroom breaks for urine sample collection with additional&#xD;
      bathroom breaks allowed as needed. During each protocol at multiple time points, blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected to assess changes in biomarkers of glycemic regulation (glucose and&#xD;
      insulin areas under the curve) and mitochondrial function over the course of the sitting&#xD;
      protocols. During each protocol at multiple time points, changes in endothelial function,&#xD;
      specifically, blood pressure (indirect measure) and femoral flow-mediated dilation (direct&#xD;
      measure), will be assessed. Changes in these measures will be compared between protocols. A&#xD;
      small aliquot (0.5mL) of plasma samples and urine samples collected during the protocol will&#xD;
      be banked for possible ancillary, exploratory studies. This study is a crossover design and&#xD;
      each participant will be her own control. The investigators hypothesize that frequent&#xD;
      sit-to-stands during a 5-hour sitting period will result in health benefits that can be&#xD;
      observed with a simple 2-minute standing interruption, and that this will be associated with&#xD;
      improvements in metabolism and endothelial function. The investigators will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in the following aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim: Using a randomized, controlled crossover study design, assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      metabolic and endothelial function outcomes of an acute bout of prolonged sitting ± standing&#xD;
      or walking interruptions using targeted metabolic and endothelial function biomarker&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
