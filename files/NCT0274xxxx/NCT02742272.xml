      The purpose of this study is to develop a clinical decision rule for patients seen in the&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department for possible intracranial pathology. This a prospective study&#xD;
      evaluating patients presenting with headache and migraine. The study is observational and&#xD;
      does not impact patient care.&#xD;

      Background/Question: A significant number of children who present to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED) with headache or migraine undergo head imaging with Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, there is relatively low yield in imaging neurologically&#xD;
      normal patients based on prior studies. The goal of this study is to describe the utilization&#xD;
      of head CT or MRI among pediatric ED patients with headache and migraine. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to evaluate clinical and examination characteristics of these patients, and use this&#xD;
      information to develop a clinical decision rule to help providers predict the risk of finding&#xD;
      an abnormality that affects patient treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The investigators will perform a study of all children between 6 and 18 years of age&#xD;
      who present to the ED with headache or migraine. At the time of the visit providers will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a questionnaire regarding exam and history without making any changes to&#xD;
      patient care. The investigators will also contact a sub-group of patients who do not undergo&#xD;
      MRI or CT, 12-14 weeks after discharge to ask about subsequent headache care after leaving&#xD;
      our facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: All children age 6-18 years who present to the ED with a chief complaint of headache&#xD;
      or migraine will be eligible for the study. Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the&#xD;
      following criteria: trauma within 48 hours, previous neurosurgery (shunt included), known&#xD;
      tumor, history of cerebral hemorrhage/ischemia, Sickle Cell Disease, thrombophilia, bleeding&#xD;
      disorder or non-English speaker. ED Research Assistants and ED staff physicians and nurse&#xD;
      practitioners will screen potential candidates and ask providers to review the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. If the eligibility criteria are met, the provider will complete a standardized data&#xD;
      collection form regarding exam and history findings. Patient care will not be impacted or&#xD;
      altered. Research Assistants will also provide a Parent Information Sheet (either during the&#xD;
      visit, or by mail following the ED visit) to the family of those patients who are enrolled&#xD;
      informing them they may be contacted following discharge. Medical records will be reviewed&#xD;
      for all eligible patients to obtain information on patient demographics, course of treatment&#xD;
      and diagnosis. For those patients who do not have any head CT or MRI performed at their&#xD;
      visit, the family will be contacted 12-14 weeks later to determine if they have had&#xD;
      subsequent care for their headache. If the family is unable to be reached by phone, the&#xD;
      patient chart will be reviewed for any other pertinent visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis: For each patient characteristic examined, the investigators will look for a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference between those patients who have normal head imaging, and&#xD;
      those with abnormal imaging. Using the characteristics that are significantly different, the&#xD;
      investigators will develop a clinical decision rule to help providers assess the risk of&#xD;
      significant findings in an individual patient. The investigators will also develop a decision&#xD;
      tree to help aid providers when deciding which patients need head imaging. A sample of&#xD;
      patients will have two independent assessments to allow us to look for evidence of&#xD;
      inter-rater reliability in our questionnaires.&#xD;
