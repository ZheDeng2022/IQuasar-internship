    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to examine and compare the immediate and long-term effects of&#xD;
      combined Botulinum toxin type A injection with mirror therapy (MT) and with bilateral&#xD;
      robot-assisted (RT) in patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke. Spasticity, a common&#xD;
      impairment after stroke, has a profound impact on activity and participation for patients.&#xD;
      BoNT-A injection combined with rehabilitation training is recommended to enhance functional&#xD;
      recovery for stroke patients with spasticity. Although the positive combination effects of&#xD;
      BoNT-A with stretch, RT, and constraint-induced movement therapy were reported, the quality&#xD;
      of the evidence was weak due to methodology limitations. In addition, patients with&#xD;
      spasticity usually have lower motor function and worse sensory deficits than patients without&#xD;
      spasticity. Designing the post BoNT-A injection rehabilitation program should consider the&#xD;
      above issues. RT and MT are two interventions providing sensorimotor input for patient with&#xD;
      low level of motor function. It is unknown whether combining BoNT-A injection with RT or with&#xD;
      MT have positive effects and engenders differential effects on motor and related functional&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 60 participants with chronic spastic hemiplegic stroke will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: BoNT-A injection with RT, BoNT-A injection with MT, and&#xD;
      BoNT-A injection with control intervention (CI). All the post-injection interventions will be&#xD;
      implemented 60 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 8 weeks. The RT group will receive 30-minute RT,&#xD;
      followed by 30-minute functional training. The MT group will receive 30-minute MT, followed&#xD;
      by 30-minute functional training. The CI group will receive 60-minute rehabilitation program,&#xD;
      such as bilateral arm training and functional task practice. Body function and structures&#xD;
      outcome measures include Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Modified Ashworth Scale, Medical Research&#xD;
      Council scale, myometer (Myoton-3), actigraph, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Activity&#xD;
      and participation measures include Wolf Motor Function Test, Ten meter walk test, Motor&#xD;
      Activity Log, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Canadian Occupational&#xD;
      Performance Measure. In addition, to directly reflect a patient's unique needs and goals,&#xD;
      Goal Attainment Scaling will be assessed. Evaluators will be blind to group allocation. The&#xD;
      outcome will be measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This comparative efficacy study will be the first to examine and compare the immediate and&#xD;
      long-term combination effects of BoNT injection with RT, MT, or CI. The follow-up assessments&#xD;
      will provide the long-term effects of different treatments on health-related outcomes, which&#xD;
      are crucial for community reentry. In addition, the results of objective assessments and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes may lead to individualized upper limb training following BoNT-A&#xD;
      injection for patients with spastic hemiplegic stroke.&#xD;
