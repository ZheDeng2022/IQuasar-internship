  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma (MB) are at-risk for neurocognitive and social&#xD;
      deficits, including specific skills such as facial affect recognition which is the ability to&#xD;
      recognize the emotional expressions of another person. Because the underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      these deficits are poorly understood, the investigators propose to examine social-cognitive&#xD;
      skills (i.e. facial affect recognition) and indices of brain integrity, including an&#xD;
      established core neural network of face perception in MB survivors and healthy controls. By&#xD;
      comparing these outcomes between survivors of MB and healthy controls, investigators seek to&#xD;
      identify the areas of the brain that help individuals recognize emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate social cognition in adolescent and young adult survivors of pediatric&#xD;
           medulloblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine indices of brain integrity and function and their association with facial&#xD;
           affect recognition in survivors of pediatric medulloblastoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive social-cognitive and behavioral data will be collected and structural and&#xD;
      functional brain imaging will be completed in an attempt to determine if disruptions to brain&#xD;
      integrity and function caused by prior treatment of medulloblastoma directly influence&#xD;
      social-cognition and behavior in survivors. These outcomes will be compared between survivors&#xD;
      and age-, gender-, and race-matched healthy community controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility criteria and consent will undergo neurocognitive&#xD;
      (intelligence, attention, memory, processing speed, motor, executive function, and&#xD;
      visuospatial) and social cognitive evaluations (affect recognition, prosody, social memory,&#xD;
      withdrawal/isolation, loneliness, social anxiety, visuospatial, and executive function).&#xD;
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be completed during affect identification&#xD;
      tasks to assess activation of the core face perception network. Magnetic resonance with&#xD;
      diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will be obtained to quantify water diffusion within white&#xD;
      matter tracts to assess white matter integrity and its association with functional outcomes.&#xD;
