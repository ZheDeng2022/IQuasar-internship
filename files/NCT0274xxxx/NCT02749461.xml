      The aims of this validation study are the testing of the Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates'&#xD;
      (BPSN) psychometric properties. The variability of pain reactions related to behavioral and&#xD;
      physiological patterns across time will also be examined. Furthermore, the influence of&#xD;
      contextual factors on the variability of pain reactions across gestational age groups will be&#xD;
      explored. The results will be used for modifications of the BPSN to account for contextual&#xD;
      factors in future clinical pain assessment in neonates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth rates are rising worldwide, including in Europe. In 2014, Switzerland's rate of&#xD;
      premature births reached 7.2%. Still, while significant progress in neonatal care has&#xD;
      increased the long-term survival of preterm infants, other long-term outcomes remain&#xD;
      problematic. As a result, affected infants commonly undergo exceedingly high numbers of&#xD;
      painful procedures on a daily basis. For many, these treatment interventions take place at a&#xD;
      crucial period in the development of the nociceptive and central nervous systems, i.e., at a&#xD;
      developmental stage when repeated painful stimulus may induce both structural and functional&#xD;
      reorganization of the nervous system and an altered pain response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As infants are unable to communicate verbally, clinical pain assessment in neonates,&#xD;
      particularly those delivered preterm, is highly challenging. Therefore, pain responses have&#xD;
      to be observed according to physiological and behavioral indicators which might vary across&#xD;
      preterm infants depending on their physiological and neurological development stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bernese Pain Scale for Neonates (BPSN) is a multidimensional pain assessment tool which&#xD;
      is already widely used in clinical settings in the German speaking areas of Europe. Recent&#xD;
      findings suggest that pain reaction is influenced by more than noxious stimulation alone: it&#xD;
      is assumed that contextual factors, e.g., gestational age (GA) or gender, might also impact&#xD;
      pain reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this validation study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to undertake the psychometric testing of the BPSN regarding its concurrent validity with&#xD;
           the Premature Infant Pain Profile-Revised (PIPP-R), construct validity, interrater and&#xD;
           intrarater reliability, specificity and sensitivity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the variability of pain reactions related to behavioural and physiological&#xD;
           patterns across time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the influence of contextual factors on the variability of pain reactions&#xD;
           across GA groups; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to examine the relationship between behavioural and physiological indicators across&#xD;
           time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multisite psychometric measurement study of the BPSN will use repeated measures design.&#xD;
      The study will take place in three tertiary care hospitals (Bern, Zurich and Basel) in&#xD;
      Switzerland. To examine the impact of GA on pain reaction and its variability, the infants&#xD;
      will be stratified into six GA groups ranging from 24 0/7 to 42 0/7. Among preterm infants&#xD;
      with GAs up to 36 6/7 weeks, five consecutive heel sticks within the first 14 days of life&#xD;
      will be documented. Among healthy-term infants two heel sticks within the first days after&#xD;
      birth will be documented. For each heel stick, measurements will be recorded for each of&#xD;
      three phases: baseline, heel stick, and recovery. All phases will be videotaped and the&#xD;
      child's pain reaction later rated according to the BPSN by five independent raters blinded to&#xD;
      the measurement phase. Individual contextual factors of interest for this study are&#xD;
      documented in a standardised way in all three participating Neonatal Intensive Care Units&#xD;
      (NICUs), and can be extracted from patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This diagnostic study is intended to validate the BPSN with consideration for contextual&#xD;
      factors influencing neonatal pain responses. Understanding and embedding the influences of&#xD;
      contextual factors into a final version of the BPSN-Context will help clinicians more&#xD;
      accurately assess pain in the clinical setting, and will eventually help them minimize the&#xD;
      pain endured by neonates, particularly preterm neonates in NICUs. For preterm infants&#xD;
      requiring intensive care, adequate and efficient pain management is an important factor in&#xD;
      later motor and cognitive development. The investigators hope this study will contribute to&#xD;
      the prevention of negative long-term outcomes in this patient population.&#xD;
