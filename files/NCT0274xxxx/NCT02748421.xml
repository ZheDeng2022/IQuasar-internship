      In our study , the investigators will use the microscope with OCT ( Lumera with RESCAN OCT )&#xD;
      coupled to assess the extent , depth and change of retinal architecture in the perioperative&#xD;
      period . Thus , they will evaluate what the optimal maneuvers of dissection of macular&#xD;
      membranes to obtain a more satisfactory result of the rearrangement in the retinal layers .&#xD;
      Furthermore , the use of OCT perioperative may dispense with the use of dyes , decreasing the&#xD;
      concentration used or reduce the exposure time. Thus, they can get the potential decrease in&#xD;
      retinal toxicity may be generated by them.&#xD;

      The investigators will use the microscope with OCT (Lumera with RESCAN OCT) coupled to assess&#xD;
      the extent, depth and change of retinal architecture in the perioperative period. Thus, they&#xD;
      will evaluate what the optimal maneuvers of dissection of macular membranes to obtain a more&#xD;
      satisfactory result of the rearrangement in the retinal layers. Furthermore, the use of OCT&#xD;
      perioperative may dispense with the use of dyes, decreasing the concentration used or reduce&#xD;
      the exposure time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods The investigators will evaluate 30 patients with changes in macular&#xD;
      membranes with surgical removal of indication from the Retina and Vitreous outpatient sector&#xD;
      of Unifesp - Paulista School of Medicine. The patients will be classified according to the&#xD;
      diseases in the following groups: Macular Hole, Epiretinal Membrane, Traction Syndrome&#xD;
      vitreomacular, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy of Retinal Detachment. Everyone will be&#xD;
      informed about the risks and benefits of the study and sign an informed consent form. In the&#xD;
      preoperative evaluation a complete ophthalmologic examination with complementary tests such&#xD;
      as angiography and optical coherence tomography will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo retinal surgery using the Lumera Microscope WITH RESCAN OCT - ZEISS.&#xD;
      The team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on the surgical difficulty regarding the&#xD;
      identification and removal of macular membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed at 1, 7, 15, 30, 60 and 90 and 180 days after surgery,&#xD;
      including the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of visual acuity with best correction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous Biomicroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indirect Funduscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tonometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optical coherence tomography (OCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retinography Surgeries and procedures of the study groups will be conducted by the same&#xD;
           team of surgeons and all surgeries and procedures will be carried out in IPEPO -&#xD;
           Paulista Institute of Studies and Research in Ophthalmology / Vision Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each type of retinal disease, there will be a control group and a group OCT as detailed&#xD;
      below: 1 - GROUP CONTROL The control group will undergo retinal surgery with conventional&#xD;
      microscope without coupled OCT. This group will have its filmed and documented surgery. The&#xD;
      team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on the surgical difficulty regarding the&#xD;
      identification and removal of macular membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 -GROUP OCT / RESCAN In the group microscope coupled to OCT, patients will undergo retinal&#xD;
      surgery using the Lumera Microscope WITH RESCAN OCT - ZEISS and have their filmed and&#xD;
      documented surgery. The team of surgeons will answer the questionnaire on the surgical&#xD;
      difficulty regarding the identification and removal of macular membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methodology All information will be presented by mean and standard deviation for&#xD;
      the quantitative variables and absolute frequency (n) and relative (%) for qualitative&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
