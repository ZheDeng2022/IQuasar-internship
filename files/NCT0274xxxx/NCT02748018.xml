    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Hybrid Closed&#xD;
      Loop system (HCL) in adult and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes in the home setting. A&#xD;
      diverse population of patients with type 1 diabetes will be studied. The study population&#xD;
      will have a large range for duration of diabetes and glycemic control, as measured by&#xD;
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). They will be enrolled in the study regardless of their prior&#xD;
      diabetes regimen, including using Multiple Daily Injections (MDI), Continuous Subcutaneous&#xD;
      Insulin Infusion (CSII) or Sensor-Augmented Pump therapy (SAP)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6 month, multi-center, randomized, parallel, adaptive study in type 1 diabetes with&#xD;
      a 6 month continuation period. The study will have three periods, per Cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Run-in Period: The run-in period can be up to 60 days during which time a blinded CGM&#xD;
           sensor will be worn for two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study Period: There will be a 6 month randomized study period with two arms: The HCL&#xD;
           system and Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continuation Period: There will be a 6 month continuation period during which time all&#xD;
           subjects will use the HCL system with Auto Mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1500 subjects will be enrolled in order to have 1000 subjects complete the study. Up to&#xD;
      70 investigational Centers in the US, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
