  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, culturally relevant narrative&#xD;
      intervention, or &quot;storytelling,&quot; based on the solid conceptual foundation of the narrative&#xD;
      communication theory and the constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM) to improve&#xD;
      medication adherence and outcomes in chronic diseases among African-Americans (AA), using&#xD;
      gout as an example. Gout is a chronic disease associated with chronic symptoms and disability&#xD;
      interrupted by intermittent acute flares, similar to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease&#xD;
      (COPD) and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) that leads to joint destruction if not treated&#xD;
      appropriately. Due to the intermittently symptomatic nature of chronic conditions, patients&#xD;
      often don't perceive disease severity and susceptibility to disease complications, and,&#xD;
      therefore, may not balance the barriers and benefits to medication adherence. Storytelling in&#xD;
      the patients' own voices has the power to directly and more effectively confront a patient's&#xD;
      barriers to medication adherence, reinforce the benefits and provide useful cues to action.&#xD;
      Storytelling promotes patient engagement when the patient identifies with the storyteller and&#xD;
      can lead to a patient's recognition of the need to treat the condition and improve health&#xD;
      outcomes, as shown by a meaningful improvement in blood pressure in a recent clinical trial&#xD;
      in AAs with hypertension. The success of this project, combined with other published data,&#xD;
      will represent a major step toward demonstrating the effectiveness of storytelling to improve&#xD;
      medication adherence in chronic diseases and will address two VA research priority areas,&#xD;
      i.e., health care disparities and health care delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 12-month, multicenter, randomized controlled trial among 250&#xD;
      African-American Veterans with gout with ULT medication possession ratio of &lt;80% at&#xD;
      Birmingham, St. Louis and Philadelphia VA clinics. The investigators will compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of the storytelling intervention to usual care in improving Urate Lowering Therapy&#xD;
      (ULT) adherence, assessed with MEMSCaps (electronic monitoring) at 6-months (primary&#xD;
      outcome); reducing gout flares needing treatment, improving patient satisfaction, improving&#xD;
      the ability to achieve target serum urate &lt;6 mg/dl and improving self-reported ULT adherence&#xD;
      at 6-months (secondary outcomes). The investigators will assess these outcomes at 12-months&#xD;
      as evidence for sustenance of the effect of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alignment with VA mission and priorities: This study serves the VA's mission of improving the&#xD;
      health of Veterans and addresses two priority areas, 1) decreasing health care disparities&#xD;
      and 2) improving health care delivery using a low-cost, technology-based solution to poor&#xD;
      medication adherence. Study results will lead to a ready-to-implement low cost&#xD;
      patient-centered intervention for AA Veterans with gout to improve medication adherence and&#xD;
      patient outcomes. This study will provide the proof of efficacy of &quot;storytelling&quot; for&#xD;
      improving medication adherence in chronic symptomatic diseases. The &quot;storytelling&quot;&#xD;
      intervention can be easily adapted for similar chronic symptomatic conditions such as COPD&#xD;
      and CHF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of 12/11/2020: completed enrollment end of September 2019, now in active 1-yr FU of people&#xD;
