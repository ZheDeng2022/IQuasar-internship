      Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of adding voluntary&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC) contraction to a Pilates exercise program on sedentary&#xD;
      nulliparous women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Fifty-seven healthy nulliparous and physically inactive women were randomized to&#xD;
      Pilates exercise program (PEP) with or without PFMC. Forty-eight women concluded this study&#xD;
      (24 participants for each group). Every women evaluated before and after the PEP, by a one&#xD;
      physiotherapist and an urogynecologist (UG). Both professionals were not revealed to them.&#xD;
      This physiotherapist measured their pelvic floor muscle strength by using both, a&#xD;
      perineometer (Peritron) and vaginal palpation (Oxford Scale) . The UG, who performed 3D&#xD;
      perineal ultrasound exams, collected their data and evaluated the results for pubovisceral&#xD;
      muscle thickness and the levator hiatus (LA) area. Both professional were masked to the group&#xD;
      allocation. The protocol for both groups consisted of 24 bi-weekly 1-h individual sessions of&#xD;
      Pilates exercises, developed by another physiotherapist who is specialized in PFM&#xD;
      rehabilitation and Pilates technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I: Pilates exercise program (PEP), involving only the Pilates exercises protocol&#xD;
      without any instruction of a voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction. I other words, the&#xD;
      researcher had, under no circumstance, never explained anything about a voluntary pelvic&#xD;
      floor muscle contraction during the Pilates exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II: Pilates exercises program with voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction (PEP+PFMC)&#xD;
      composed of a Pilates exercises program with voluntary pelvic floor contractions. This&#xD;
      included maximum contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during expiratory period with 5&#xD;
      repetitions alternately, thus avoiding any muscle exhaustion pelvic floor that could happen.&#xD;

    <description>The volunteers were divided in two groups:&#xD;
Group I: Pilates exercise program involving only the Pilates exercises protocol Group II: Pilates exercises program with voluntary pelvic floor muscle contraction.&#xD;
The protocol of both groups consisted of 24 bi-weekly 1-h individual sessions of Pilates exercises program.&#xD;
Both groups performed the same protocol . For the group PEP + PFMC the instructor asked for the maximum contraction muscle of the pelvic floor muscle, during expirations with 5 repetitions performed alternately, thus avoiding pelvic floor muscle exhaustion.&#xD;
After the 24 sessions, both groups were retested with the same measured methods of the baseline.</description>
