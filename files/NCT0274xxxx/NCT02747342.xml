  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, dose-escalation/expansion phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of SHR3680 with or without SHR3162 given orally to subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 Part. In the Part 1 (dose escalation phase), up to 4 dose levels of&#xD;
      SHR3680 will be investigated with a sequential &quot;3+3&quot; design (3 or 6 participants in each dose&#xD;
      level). There will be a single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) run-in period (7 days). Following&#xD;
      the first dose, participants will enter a 1 week treatment-free period to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      single-dose PK. If not dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed during the 1-week period,&#xD;
      SHR3680 administration will resume at the same dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Part 2a (expansion phase), up to 9 additional participants will be enrolled at the MTD&#xD;
      or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). The purpose of the expansion part of the study is to&#xD;
      explore the clinical benefits of SHR3680 and to further identify its PK features.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2b (combination phase), two dose cohorts of SHR3162 combine with SHR3680 at fixed&#xD;
      dose will be investigated.&#xD;
