    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether PDT (MRSAid™) is effective in eradicating SA&#xD;
      from hemodialysis patients who are known to harbor this organism inside their nose.&#xD;

      This is a medical research study is to eliminate Staphylococcus aureus (SA) (decolonization)&#xD;
      from nares of patients who are colonized with this organism. Bacterial colonization of the&#xD;
      anterior nares (inside of the nose) is believed to play an important role in the development&#xD;
      of infection of central venous catheter, such as the line used for hemodialysis, and&#xD;
      subsequent bloodstream infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to be lethal against all classes of microorganisms:&#xD;
      Gram-positive and, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi (fungus), viruses, parasites and even&#xD;
      spores. In addition to the antimicrobial effects PDT also demonstrates an anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PDT in nasal decolonization of S.&#xD;
      aureus in hemodialysis patients&#xD;
