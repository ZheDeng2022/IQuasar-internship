  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caries prevalence has declined significantly since the introduction of fluoridated&#xD;
      toothpastes. Since then, different toothpaste formulations and concentrations have been&#xD;
      introduced to the market with varying levels of efficacy. There are several commercially&#xD;
      available toothpastes to choose from and only with the aid of sound methodological research,&#xD;
      can the best evidence-based oral education advice be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a double-blinded randomised controlled trial that aims to measure the salivary&#xD;
      fluoride concentration following tooth-brushing with several toothpaste formulations. Power&#xD;
      calculations were performed using PASS 11.0 software, and calculations showed that 3&#xD;
      participants are needed in each group in order for results to be considered as significant.&#xD;
      We will aim to recruit five to seven participants in each of the 12 groups. Research will be&#xD;
      publicised by means of flyers and circulating emails amongst University of Leeds students.&#xD;
      Information sheets will be provided to all participants and informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will brush with one of 6 different formulations of toothpastes either with&#xD;
      or without water rinsing post-brushing. Participants will randomly be assigned to groups&#xD;
      using an online random team generator. Saliva will be collected six times once before&#xD;
      brushing and at 1, 15, 30, 60 and 90 minutes post-brushing. Samples will be analysed using&#xD;
      fluoride ion-specific sensitive electrode connected to an ion analyser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistician's help will be sought for analysis of the results. After the analysis stage,&#xD;
      the codes of the toothpastes will be broken.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-Blinded Randomised controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an in vivo study that aims to compare the salivary fluoride concentrations of&#xD;
      different fluoride formulations in the form of toothpaste with and without post-brushing&#xD;
      water rinsing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the salivary fluoride concentrations of different fluoride formulations in the&#xD;
      form of toothpaste, with and without post-brushing water rinsing. Toothpaste formulations are&#xD;
      to include: sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP), sodium fluoride plus&#xD;
      sodium monofluorophosphate combined (NaF + MFP), Amine fluoride (AmF) and stannous fluoride&#xD;
      and sodium fluoride combined (SnF + NaF). Fluoride-free toothpaste will serve as a control in&#xD;
      this study. Concentration is to be standardised for all the formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study would reflect on the oral hygiene instructions given to patients in&#xD;
      term of tooth brushing frequency, fluoride-containing dentifrices of different formulations&#xD;
      and post-brushing rinsing practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypotheses for this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the following toothpaste formulations have no significant difference in term of&#xD;
      salivary clearance rate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      oNon-fluoridated toothpaste oSodium fluoride (Naf) toothpaste oSodium fluoride and sodium&#xD;
      monofluorophosphate combined toothpaste (NaF+ MFP) oStannous fluoride and sodium fluoride&#xD;
      combined (SnF+NaF) toothpaste oAmine fluoride toothpaste (AmF) oSodium monofluorophosphate&#xD;
      toothpaste&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials under investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental materials to be investigated are taken from the list of the available brands&#xD;
      in UK published in delivering better oral health: an evidence-based toolkit for prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control toothpaste (0 ppmF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sodium fluoride toothpaste 1,450 ppm F&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sodium monofluorophosphate toothpaste1,450 ppm F&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sodium monofluorophosphate + sodium fluoride combined toothpaste 1,450 ppm F&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stannous fluoride + sodium fluoride combined toothpaste1,450 ppm F&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amine fluoride toothpaste 1,400 ppm F&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical advice was sought and sample size calculation was performed using PASS 11.0&#xD;
      software. A sample of at least 3 participants is needed for each group. The study aims to&#xD;
      test 12 different groups, with 5 participants in each group, giving a total number of 60&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recommended by the Research Ethics Committee (REC) committee the investigators have rerun&#xD;
      the power calculations again, using raw data from Issa and Toumba, 2004 without the data from&#xD;
      the control groups, and similar results were obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Research Ethics Committee (REC) has approved increasing the sample size to at least 120&#xD;
      participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining informed consent Contact details are enclosed in the recruitment emails, flyers and&#xD;
      information sheet. Information sheet and a copy of the consent sheet will be sent to&#xD;
      participants by emails, post or they can come and pick it up at their comfort. Participants&#xD;
      will still have the opportunity to contact the lead researcher for further questions or&#xD;
      queries through either her contact number or her university email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information sheet to this research study will be used as an invitation letter as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the research day, consent sheets will be explained and an informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participants. The original copy of the consent sheet will be kept by the&#xD;
      lead researcher and participants will retain the copy of their signed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anonymising patients Participants will be identified by a numerical number rather than their&#xD;
      names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding toothpaste groups A third party will put toothpastes in small identical containers&#xD;
      labelled with the group number (G1-12), batch number and expiry date. This will be done&#xD;
      randomly using the following website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator A file will be attached in the checklist&#xD;
      explaining the randomisation process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignments of toothpastes to participants With aid of the following website&#xD;
      (https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator), each reference number (participant number) will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of 12 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the required information will be provided to the Ethical committee (Leeds Health&#xD;
      Authority / United Leeds Teaching Hospitals) in advance for ethical approval to be obtained&#xD;
      prior commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective assessment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When participants contact the lead examiner (responding to the email or posters) about&#xD;
      participating in the research study, volunteers will be asked several questions about their&#xD;
      medical history (medical questionnaire) to determine whether they fall within ASA I and ASA&#xD;
      II categories. Other ASA categories (ASA III or higher) will be excluded from the study,&#xD;
      informed consent will not be obtained and no further information (i.e. information sheet)&#xD;
      will be sent out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants contact the lead examiner by email, then the medical history questionnaire&#xD;
      will be asked by replying to their email. If however, the participants show interest over the&#xD;
      phone, then the medical questionnaire will be obtained over the phone. For participants who&#xD;
      show interest over the phone, they will be given the option whether they want the information&#xD;
      sheet mailed to them, emailed or if they prefer to pick it up at their convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants who are included in the research gender, age and carious status will be&#xD;
      recorded on the assessment sheet. This information will remain anonymous and will not&#xD;
      identify participants since each participant will be identified by a number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After result analysis, results will be disseminated to all participants attached with an&#xD;
      appreciation letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of Anaesthesiologist (ASA) Physical Status Classification ASA 1 A normal&#xD;
      healthy patient ASA 2 A patient with mild systemic disease ASA 3 A patient with severe&#xD;
      systemic disease ASA 4 A patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to&#xD;
      life ASA 5 A moribund patient who is not to survive without the operation ASA 6 A declared&#xD;
      brained-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publicity and recruitment of participants Participant recruitment will be performed by the&#xD;
      means of recruitment flyers and circular emails. Recruitment flyers will be posted across the&#xD;
      Worsley building of the University of Leeds (Level 6 and Level 7, Worsley building, West&#xD;
      Yorkshire, LS2 9JT) and Leeds Dental Institute (Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS2 9LU). Circular&#xD;
      emails will be emailed to all University students, after permission from the school's office.&#xD;
      This means that the population targeted would be staff and students of the University of&#xD;
      Leeds and possibly their families, visitors to the University of Leeds and patients under the&#xD;
      care of Leeds Dental Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment of NHS patients will follow a similar process to the other volunteers.&#xD;
      Recruitment leaflets will be put at the reception and waiting areas of each different&#xD;
      department. A copy of the information sheet and the consent sheet can be obtained from the&#xD;
      receptionists upon request. Participants who wish to take part in this study will have to&#xD;
      contact the lead examiner (Marwah Albahrani) through the contact details on the recruitment&#xD;
      flyers and the information sheets. Informed consent will obtained following the procedure&#xD;
      explained under the subheading &quot;obtaining informed consent&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emails will be short and the subject line will include a short description of the study&#xD;
      followed by the word &quot;circular&quot;. Subject line: Participant needed for tooth-brushing -&#xD;
      Circular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The email will start with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Circular email for use for recruitment of participants for study ref: Ethics reference&#xD;
      number, approved by [INSERT NAME OF ETHICS SUBCOMMITTEE/PANEL].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project contributes to the University's role in conducting research, and teaching&#xD;
      research methods. You are under no obligation to reply to this email, however if you choose&#xD;
      to, participation in this research is voluntary and you may withdraw at anytime. Please see&#xD;
      attached for more details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A copy of the recruitment flyer, the information sheet and consent sheet will be attached to&#xD;
      the circular email.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sending out appointments for participants An appointment message will be sent out to&#xD;
      participant's contact numbers informing them with the date of the research appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Message reminders one day before appointment A reminder message will be sent one day before&#xD;
      the appointment. This will also include fasting and tooth-brushing instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A list of which patient is going to be in which group will be published before the day of the&#xD;
      appointment according to the blinding and randomisation procedures explained above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, 1.0 ml whole mixed saliva will be collected in a plastic beaker&#xD;
      labelled with their reference number, group, rinsing method and time interval. Participants&#xD;
      will then be asked to brush their teeth with pre-weighed amount of toothpaste for 2 full&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which group, participants will be either asked to spit the excess toothpaste and&#xD;
      not rinse their mouth for the entire appointment or participants might be ask to rinse their&#xD;
      mouth with 10 ml of water for 5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will have a slip stating times at which their saliva samples (1.0 ml) will&#xD;
      be collected. After each sample collection, the time interval will be ticked off on the slip.&#xD;
      Participants will be waiting in the waiting room and will be instructed to refrain from&#xD;
      eating or drinking during the length of their appointment. Saliva samples will be collected&#xD;
      by the lead investigator (M. Albahrani) 6 times at the following time intervals: 0,1, 15, 30,&#xD;
      60 and 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given £10 to compensate for their time, transport and food expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample analysis Fluoride concentration will be measured using an ion-specific sensitive&#xD;
      electrode connected to an ion analyser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REPRODUCIBILITY OF THE MEASRUMENTS Reproducibility of the results will be checked by using&#xD;
      fluoride ion standard solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two way mirroring ANOVA meaning that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ANOVA statistical test will be performed comparing salivary fluoride concentration&#xD;
           between the different time intervals of the same group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ANOVA statistical test will be also performed to compare salivary fluoride concentration&#xD;
           between different groups at the same time interval.&#xD;
