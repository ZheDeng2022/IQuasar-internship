  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 300,000 total knee joint replacement surgeries are performed per year in the United&#xD;
      States and safe, effective management of post-operative pain in these patients, often&#xD;
      elderly, deconditioned, obese, or with co-morbid diseases like sleep apnea, can be&#xD;
      challenging and often require a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach. Opiates have been a&#xD;
      mainstay of treatment in the post-operative period with varying degrees of success and&#xD;
      complications. Inadequately controlled postoperative pain is not uncommon. Poorly controlled&#xD;
      pain inhibits early mobilization and hinders post-operative physical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new paradigm for treating post-operative pain following total knee replacement may be the&#xD;
      use of cooled radiofrequency ablation (C-RFA) of the articular sensory nerve supply of the&#xD;
      knee capsule prior to surgery, to desensitize the knee by blocking sensory afferents to the&#xD;
      anterior capsule and thereby decrease post-operative pain. There are several publications&#xD;
      that have demonstrated the use of RFA in patients with chronic knee pain from osteoarthritis&#xD;
      however the use of RFA in the preoperative management of pain in patients undergoing total&#xD;
      knee joint replacement has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine if patients undergoing unilateral total knee&#xD;
      replacement obtain any post-operative pain relieving benefits from C-RFA of the articular&#xD;
      sensory nerve supply when performed prior to surgery, as compared to sham controls who&#xD;
      receive only local anesthetic injections of these same nerves without the benefit of ablation&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) Score 48 Hours Post-operative.</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) is a method of quantifying different pain drug regimens by evaluating the use of 22 distinct drug classes (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], antidepressants, benzodiazepines, opiates). A single value is calculated based on a patient's pain medication profile, taking into account dosages, and the types of pain medications prescribed. The score is calculated for a given pharmacologic class by taking its detriment weight, as determined by the physician, multiplied by a score given for dosage. The scores for each pharmacologic class prescribed to a patient are then summed to determine the overall score of a given pain medication regimen. The scale ranges from (0 low (good) 500 high (poor).</description>

    <measure>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Score 6 Months Post Operative</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score 6 months post operative. The WOMAC score is a survey comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Subjects are asked a range of questions about their ability to carry out daily activities such as using the stairs, rising from sitting, lying in bed and conducting light or heavy domestic duties. Items are scored on a scale of 0-4 (lower scores indicate lower levels of symptoms or physical disability). Values are summed up for a combined WOMAC score of 0 (low) to 96 (high) Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitation.</description>

        <title>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) Score 48 Hours Post-operative.</title>
        <description>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) is a method of quantifying different pain drug regimens by evaluating the use of 22 distinct drug classes (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], antidepressants, benzodiazepines, opiates). A single value is calculated based on a patient's pain medication profile, taking into account dosages, and the types of pain medications prescribed. The score is calculated for a given pharmacologic class by taking its detriment weight, as determined by the physician, multiplied by a score given for dosage. The scores for each pharmacologic class prescribed to a patient are then summed to determine the overall score of a given pain medication regimen. The scale ranges from (0 low (good) 500 high (poor).</description>

          <title>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) Score 48 Hours Post-operative.</title>
          <description>Medication Quantification Scale III (MQSIII) is a method of quantifying different pain drug regimens by evaluating the use of 22 distinct drug classes (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], antidepressants, benzodiazepines, opiates). A single value is calculated based on a patient's pain medication profile, taking into account dosages, and the types of pain medications prescribed. The score is calculated for a given pharmacologic class by taking its detriment weight, as determined by the physician, multiplied by a score given for dosage. The scores for each pharmacologic class prescribed to a patient are then summed to determine the overall score of a given pain medication regimen. The scale ranges from (0 low (good) 500 high (poor).</description>

        <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score 6 months post operative. The WOMAC score is a survey comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales: Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Subjects are asked a range of questions about their ability to carry out daily activities such as using the stairs, rising from sitting, lying in bed and conducting light or heavy domestic duties. Items are scored on a scale of 0-4 (lower scores indicate lower levels of symptoms or physical disability). Values are summed up for a combined WOMAC score of 0 (low) to 96 (high) Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitation.</description>

          <description>Medication Quantification Scale Version III (MQSVIII) is a single value calculated based on a patient's pain medication profile, taking into account dosages, and the types of pain medications prescribed. The score is calculated for a given pharmacologic class by taking its detriment weight, as determined by the physician, multiplied by a score given for dosage. The scores for each pharmacologic class prescribed to a patient are then summed to determine the overall score of a given pain medication regimen score on a scale of 0 good-500 poor at baseline in patients with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores (HADS) of less than 11.The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores (HADS) is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. The questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 (low) and 21 (high) for either anxiety or depression.</description>

        <description>WOMAC score at baseline in patients with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Scores of less than 11.The WOMAC score is a survey comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales:Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Subjects are asked a range of questions about their ability to carry out daily activities such as using the stairs, rising from sitting, lying in bed and conducting light or heavy domestic duties. Items are scored on a scale of 0-4 (lower scores indicate lower levels of symptoms or physical disability). Summed for a combined WOMAC score of 0 (low) to 96 (high) Higher scores indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitation. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores (HADS) is a fourteen item scale. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.The questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 (low) and 21 (high) for either anxiety or depression.</description>

        <description>WOMAC score at 1 month in patients with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Scores of less than 11.The WOMAC score is a survey comprised of 24 items divided into three subscales:Pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and physical function (17 items). Subjects are asked a range of questions about their ability to carry out daily activities such as using the stairs, rising from sitting, lying in bed and conducting light or heavy domestic duties. Items are scored on a scale of 0-4 (lower scores indicate lower levels of symptoms or physical disability). Summed for a combined WOMAC score of 0 (low) to 96 (high) Higher scores indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitation.
