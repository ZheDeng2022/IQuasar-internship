  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bundled payment is a new payment reform that encourages health care providers to improve&#xD;
      quality and contain costs of care. These arrangements are being rapidly expanded across the&#xD;
      country, but evidence about their impact are lacking. This study will use Medicare claims&#xD;
      data to evaluate the effect of participation in a large Medicare bundled payment program on&#xD;
      the quality and costs of care for common medical and surgical conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to examine the effects of the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement&#xD;
      (BPCI) Model 2 on the quality and costs of care for conditions related to seven of the ten&#xD;
      Medicare severity disease-related groups (MS-DRGs) most commonly selected by program&#xD;
      participation. Five of these are surgical (major joint replacement of the lower extremity;&#xD;
      double joint replacement of the lower extremity; revision of the hip or knee, hip and femur&#xD;
      procedures except major joint; lower extremity and humerus procedure except hip, foot, and&#xD;
      femur) and two are medical (simple pneumonia and respiratory infections; chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, bronchitis/asthma). These MS-DRGs represent two larger service lines:&#xD;
      orthopedics and pulmonary. For each of these seven MS-DRGs, the team will first describe&#xD;
      characteristics of provider organizations participating in bundled payment arrangements,&#xD;
      including geographic characteristics and clinical volume. We will subsequently empirically&#xD;
      test the effect of bundled payment arrangements on quality outcomes and costs of care for&#xD;
      these conditions. Additionally, the team will examine any spillover effects that occur within&#xD;
      the service lines that contain these seven MS-DRGs.&#xD;

        The target population consists of a subset of provider organizations who participated in&#xD;
        CMS's BPCI bundled payment program. From this group, the team will focus on provider&#xD;
        organizations that participated in the largest model within the BPCI program (model 2) and&#xD;
        accepted bundled payment for the ten most common MS-DRGs.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Provider organizations that participate in model 2 of the BPCI program, accept bundled&#xD;
             payment for the ten most common MS-DRGs, and have at least ten or greater episodes in&#xD;
             each of the MS-DRGs.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provider organizations who participated in the BPCI program, but do not meet inclusion&#xD;
             criteria will be excluded.&#xD;
