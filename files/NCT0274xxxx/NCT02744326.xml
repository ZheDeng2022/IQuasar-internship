    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a prospective study and a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      involving children and adolescents presenting with a primary mental health (MH) concern to&#xD;
      the emergency departments (EDs) of Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota (CH). The&#xD;
      investigators will characterize the primary MH concerns of 800 patients and assess their&#xD;
      baseline access to and utilization of external resources. All enrolled patients will be&#xD;
      followed 3-months after their initial visit to determine ED revisits and identify factors&#xD;
      associated with connection to outpatient care. The RCT portion of the study will involve 200&#xD;
      patients discharged from the ED with a referral to an outpatient MH provider, and will test a&#xD;
      novel text-message communication method by which parents/caregivers can be encouraged to&#xD;
      complete follow-up care for their child. The experimental group will receive tailored text&#xD;
      message reminders regarding follow-up appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Pediatric ED visits for MH issues are increasing, but the current system of&#xD;
      managing these patients is not optimal. More information is needed to accelerate change and&#xD;
      to efficiently invest in improving services available to MH patients. Specifically,&#xD;
      information is needed on which MH populations need to be targeted, and on simple,&#xD;
      reproducible interventions which improve connection with community resources. The proposed&#xD;
      study will collect vital information needed to develop programs that improve outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce ED revisits in pediatric patients visiting the EDs at CH with primary MH concerns, and&#xD;
      will set the stage for future work focused on improving core and outcomes for MH youth.&#xD;

      Background/Significance The number of youth visiting the ED with MH issues has risen&#xD;
      dramatically in the last decade.1 EDs have become a safety net for a strained mental health&#xD;
      system that is under resourced and lacks adequate services to meet demands at the impatient&#xD;
      and outpatient level.2 EDs bear a high burden of caring for children and adolescents with&#xD;
      acute psychiatric illness, and pediatric patients with MH-related visits require substantial&#xD;
      ED resources.2,3 Visits to the ED for MH are longer, more likely to be triaged to urgent&#xD;
      evaluation and result in more admissions or transfers compared to visits for other&#xD;
      reasons.4,5 ED revisits are also are also common in pediatric MH patients, with a recent&#xD;
      study finding return rates of 6-9% within 72 hours, and return rates around 30% over a 4-year&#xD;
      study period.6 ED visits for children and adolescents with MH concerns are resource&#xD;
      intensive, and further research will be crucial for improving the management of these&#xD;
      patients.2,3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information lacking on resources needed by MH diagnostic subgroup:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MH issues encountered by ED physicians cover a broad range of diagnoses. Bardach et al.&#xD;
      examined MH hospitalizations and identified the following as the most common diagnostic&#xD;
      subgroups: depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, externalizing disorder, anxiety disorder,&#xD;
      ADHD, eating disorder, substance abuse, reaction disorder and autism.7 ED visits for MH&#xD;
      concerns are often thought to mainly involve suicide attempts, self-harm behavior or&#xD;
      psychosis, but a recent study of a large urban pediatric ED found that almost half of the&#xD;
      visits were for behavioral problems.8 Preliminary data has described that almost half of the&#xD;
      behavioral assessments done at CH in 2013 were on individuals with developmental disorders&#xD;
      (i.e. autism spectrum disorders). The number of MH ED visits for behavioral issues is&#xD;
      growing, but there is limited information regarding this population.8 Overall, the ED&#xD;
      experience has not been well documented based upon diagnostic subgroup, but there are&#xD;
      critical differences in MH patients depending on their primary concern, specifically&#xD;
      connection to outpatient resources and risk of ED revisit.8,9 In order to more efficiently&#xD;
      help MH youth it is crucial to obtain information regarding services, and how this differs by&#xD;
      diagnostic subgroup.8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Text-messaging to improve MH referral follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ED represents a suboptimal care setting for MH youth but does provide an important&#xD;
      opportunity to identify children and adolescents in crisis and connect them with external&#xD;
      resources.8 Unfortunately, successful follow-up with MH resources by ED patients has been&#xD;
      shown to be low, with some studies finding follow-up rates below 30%.10,11 A recent study&#xD;
      found that 66% of patients visiting the ED with suicidal behaviors successfully followed up&#xD;
      with a mental health provider, a more positive number, but one that still shows a large need&#xD;
      for improvement.12 Strategies are needed to improve successful follow-up with MH outpatient&#xD;
      referrals as failure to comply with ED discharge guidelines could result in worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms and return visits to the ED. While ED providers have a unique opportunity to&#xD;
      identify MH youth and provide referrals, they also have limited time and resources. If an&#xD;
      intervention is to be incorporated into usual care in the ED, it must be simple, efficient,&#xD;
      and easy to replicate. Automated text messaging reminders have been shown to increase&#xD;
      attendance to healthcare appointments.13 Over 90% of Americans reported owning a cell phone&#xD;
      in 2013, and 81% report using their cell phone to send or receive text messages.14 In&#xD;
      addition, the cost and personnel requirements needed to implement an automated text message&#xD;
      based system are low, making this a unique intervention technique that could be easily&#xD;
      incorporated into usual care in any ED.15 A recent study found that automated text message&#xD;
      appointment reminders improved follow-up attendance to primary or specialty care in adult ED&#xD;
      patients.15 Additional research is needed to examine the potential of a text message strategy&#xD;
      to increase attendance to follow-up appointments in a diverse population of youth visiting&#xD;
      the ED the MH concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the proposed study is to collect vital information needed to develop&#xD;
      programs that improve outcomes and reduce revisits in children and adolescents who present to&#xD;
      the ED with primary MH concerns. Pediatric ED visits for MH issues are increasing.1 The&#xD;
      current system is in need of improvement, yet more information is needed to accelerate&#xD;
      change, including information on which MH populations need to be targeted, and on simple,&#xD;
      reproducible interventions which improve connection with community resources. The proposed&#xD;
      project will collect data on a cohort of MH patients from two large urban EDs to characterize&#xD;
      diagnostic subgroups and current access to care, will follow all patients 3-months post visit&#xD;
      to identify risk factors for ED revisits and barriers to outpatient care, and will test a&#xD;
      novel text message reminder system focused on improving the linkage of MH patients with&#xD;
      follow-up referrals. The EDs of CH provide the vast majority of emergent pediatric care&#xD;
      within the Twin City Metro area, and a substantial proportion of these visits are mental&#xD;
      health related. The proposed project provides a unique opportunity to meet the study goals,&#xD;
      and sets the stage for future work focused on improving care and outcomes for MH youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Which pediatric MH patients visiting the ED at CH are in the most need of additional&#xD;
           support (lowest baseline access to and utilization of outpatient care, highest risk of&#xD;
           ED revisit, lowest follow-up with outpatient referrals)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does a targeted text-message communication method improve compliance with ED discharge&#xD;
           in pediatric MH patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the primary MH concerns of children and adolescent visiting the EDs of CH&#xD;
           and assesses their baseline access to and utilization of external MH resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: MH patients will represent several subgroups of primary concerns and these&#xD;
           subgroups will differ in their baseline connection to and utilization of community&#xD;
           resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow all enrolled MH patients post visit to determine factors associated with ED&#xD;
           revisits and barriers to outpatient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis: Patients who have public or no insurance, who visit the ED with&#xD;
           self-inflicted injuries, or who identify multiple barriers to connecting with outpatient&#xD;
           MH care will have higher rates of ED revisits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Develop and test a novel text-message communication method focused on increasing rates&#xD;
           of discharge referral follow-up in ED patients with MH concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients randomized to a text-message communication system will have higher rates&#xD;
      of follow-up care and lower rates of ED revisit compared to patients who receive usual care&#xD;
