  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For almost 17 % of cases patients over 75 years are sent for inappropriate reasons to the&#xD;
      emergency unit. They are described as inappropriate hospitalization because they don't&#xD;
      require the use of technical platform or diagnostic neither therapeutic procedures under&#xD;
      medical supervision. Those are inappropriate because the patient could have a paramedical and&#xD;
      social care at home or in more efficient structures. The hospital remains the place of remedy&#xD;
      for social and health situations whose resolution was not possible because of a lack of&#xD;
      infrastructure available, of patient or his relative information, or a lack of coordination&#xD;
      in medico-social establishment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These inappropriate hospitalizations involve an increase of length of stay that enhancing the&#xD;
      fragility and vulnerability of the elderly. They have deleterious effects as decompensation,&#xD;
      comorbidities and loss of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the suffering of natural or informal caregivers is also an important public health&#xD;
      question; Caregivers may have a serious disease resulting from caring their relative. That&#xD;
      leads to increase their consumption of health care and medical goods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This comprehensive study will highlight the deficiencies of the actual health care through&#xD;
      the analysis of the speech of the different parts involved (main study). Simultaneously, a&#xD;
      comparative analysis of the costs of health care will be conducted (economic combined study).&#xD;

&#xD;
      These inappropriate hospitalizations involve an increase of length of stay that enhancing the&#xD;
      fragility and vulnerability of the elderly. They have deleterious effects as decompensation,&#xD;
      comorbidities and loss of autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the suffering of natural or informal caregivers is also an important public health&#xD;
      question; Caregivers may have a serious disease resulting from caring their relative. That&#xD;
      leads to increase their consumption of health care and medical goods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This comprehensive study will highlight the deficiencies of the actual health care through&#xD;
      the analysis of the speech of the different parts involved (main study). Simultaneously, a&#xD;
      comparative analysis of the costs of health care will be conducted (economic combined study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient over 75 years will arrive in the emergency or geriatrics units of the&#xD;
      University Hospital of Besançon and the reason for admission indicated in the hospital record&#xD;
      will be &quot; difficult home care &quot; or &quot; caregiver burn out &quot; or any other reason unjustified&#xD;
      from a strictly medical point of view, the investigator will ensure the patient's eligibility&#xD;
      under the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, and will do a review of appropriateness of&#xD;
      hospital according Appropriate Assessment Protocol criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients corresponding to the inclusion criteria during the three months of the inclusion&#xD;
      period will be identified in the reference population. Expected active file is fifteen&#xD;
      patients in three months. The reference population of patients in the active file will be&#xD;
      followed for six months. Steps of their health care will be identified and described in a&#xD;
      questionnaire detailing the patient's pathway by collecting data on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates when they change their place of living or care,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Places of living or care at every step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative study will include five patients of the reference population in order to&#xD;
      describe, analyze and understand in depth their health care through semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews. To analyze a variety of pathways, 5 patients will be selected in order to&#xD;
      represent the heterogeneity of admission places (emergency or geriatric unit), as well as the&#xD;
      places of origin (home institution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interview will be also proposed to relevant people involved (health professionals,&#xD;
      professional home) in the situation and at least to one relative designated by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each change of place of residence or place of care (or return at home) of the five&#xD;
      patients, the interviews will be conducted with the patient and relevant stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the first step, the investigator will join to the outgoing mail, a document to&#xD;
      ensure that the later steps of patient health care is collected. For each step, the referring&#xD;
      health professional will have to do the same in order to compile data of the patient's&#xD;
      pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, from an estimate of three key steps to describe and analyze the healthcare trajectories&#xD;
      of five patients during six months, 90 interviews will be conducted, transcribed and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The economic combined study will focus on the five patients followed in the qualitative&#xD;
      study. This descriptive and prospective study will analyze the differential costs between the&#xD;
      actual health care course and a more appropriate care course. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      according to a &quot;societal&quot; perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most appropriate health care courses will be selected by healthcare professionals who&#xD;
      specialize in elderly care in the Besançon area (medical structures, gerontological&#xD;
      network…). The patients actual care courses will be presented to them and they will&#xD;
      collectively decide which care course would have been most appropriate for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The costs of the actual and most appropriate courses will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct medical costs regarding hospitalizations, consultations, medical and technical&#xD;
           procedures, laboratory and pathology costs, and medical transport expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Direct non-medical costs regarding social expenses (accommodation). Welfare received by&#xD;
           the elderly patients; expenses of the elderly patients or their relatives related to&#xD;
           special facilities and adaptation of the home. Allowances received by relatives in case&#xD;
           of sick leave and the cost associated with consumption of medication and medical&#xD;
           transport (sleep disorders, anxiety and depression, nutritional and memory disorders,&#xD;
           cardiovascular disorders including hypertension, decompensation of chronic diseases...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These costs will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the patient's medical record,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the record compiled by the social worker,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the databases of Regional Health Authority of Franche-Comté&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the hospital Discharge Abstract Database (PMSI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  as well as with a questionnaire to patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global expenditure related to the actual care course and the most appropriate course as&#xD;
      defined by healthcare professionals will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, this economic combined study will analyze the differential costs between current&#xD;
      patient health care and a more relevant patient health care.&#xD;
