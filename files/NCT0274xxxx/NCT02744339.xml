      The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Assess the pharmacodynamic profile of riociguat in subjects with symptomatic pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess safety and tolerability of riociguat in this study population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess changes in dimensions of left and right ventricles and cardiac function&#xD;
           parameters using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
