      Research Problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical stress induces inflammation and postoperative immuno-suppression, which are risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      factors for both post-operative complication and possible disease recurrence. Colorectal&#xD;
      cancer is in the top 5 malignancies in the Kingdome and the highest incidence in males.&#xD;
      Recurrent disease locally or distally occurs in 35% of patients and is the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in these patients. Despite the new era of laparoscopic surgery, still surgical stress&#xD;
      is present and equally traumatic to the conventional open colorectal resection, earlier&#xD;
      studies showed no major differences in post-operative inflammatory and immunological&#xD;
      reactions. The previous studies revealed the anti-inflammatory effects of the&#xD;
      hyper-insulinimic euglycemic therapy. Benefits observed in both major liver resection and in&#xD;
      cardiac surgery. The anti-inflammatory effect reduced the surgical stress and postoperative&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is &quot;Can intraoperative hyper-insulinimic euglycemic infusion reduce post&#xD;
      operative inflammation and immunomodulation in colon cancer patients undergoing a curative&#xD;
      surgery?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology Triple blinded randomized controlled study with estimated sample size of&#xD;
      144 patients of non-metastatic colorectal cancer patients operated at King Saud University&#xD;
      Medical city with a confirmed diagnosis of colon adenocarcinoma. Patients Consented will&#xD;
      undergo computer randomization to receive intraoperative hyper-insulinimic normoglycemic&#xD;
      infusion (experimental) or standardized insulin sliding scale and saline (control). A common&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative pathway with standardized management and pain control in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured via a battery of laboratory test consist of routine labs,&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and immunological markers to be repeated at fixed timed intervals. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed by regularly for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes to examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anti-inflammatory effects of intraoperative hyper-insulinimic euglycemic therapy in&#xD;
           patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunomodulatory effect of intraoperative hyper-insulinimic euglycemic infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thirty days post-operative morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease-free survival rate.&#xD;

      Aim &amp; hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate the effect of the same protocol in colorectal surgery and to&#xD;
      further delineate the effect on perioperative inflammation, immunosuppression and clinical&#xD;
      outcome. This is an original approach, as this protocol was never used in bowel surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis predicts a reduced inflammation and resulting immunomodulation due to the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect of hyper-insulinmic euglycimic infusion, and improved postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and oncological outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the approval of the ethics board at King Saud University Medical city (KSUMC) a triple&#xD;
      blinded randomized controlled study of operable resectable CRC patients of consented to be&#xD;
      randomized to receive hyperinsulinimic normoglycemic protocol (experimental) or standardized&#xD;
      insulin sliding scale (control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size estimation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 patients per group( total of 144) was calculated to be sufficient to detect a reduction in&#xD;
      disease recurrence from 35 to 20 percent, with α=0•05 and power of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer generated randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Triple blinded study. Patient to be kept blinded to which group he/she will be assigned to.&#xD;
      An independent anesthesia team will manage the infusion and will not be involved in the&#xD;
      patient care or the study analysis. Research assistant will collect all the data and samples&#xD;
      and will be blinded to the therapy. Patients' follow up by primary surgeons will also be&#xD;
      blinded to the intervention. Analysis to be done in blinded groups A &amp; B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative Intravenous insulin and glucose. The anasthesia will be asked to prepare an&#xD;
      insulin bag containing 1000 units in 1 liter normal saline , another bag of dextrose 20 %&#xD;
      with 30 mmol KPO4/ liter will be supplied from the pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Experimental therapy group, after obtaining a baseline preoperative blood glucose&#xD;
      value, 2 U/kg bolus of insulin to be administered IV followed by an infusion of 2 mU/ kg/min.&#xD;
      Ten minutes after starting the insulin infusion, and when the blood glucose is &lt;6.1 mmol /L&#xD;
      (110 mg /dL), dextrose 20% supplemented with phosphate (30 mmol/L ) is administered. In the&#xD;
      operating room, blood glucose levels were measured every 15 minutes, and the dextrose&#xD;
      infusion rate will be adjusted to maintain arterial glycemia between 3.5 and 6.1 mmol/L&#xD;
      (63-110 mg/dL), according to this protocol. If Blood Glucose mg/dl Action &lt;63 Stop insulin&#xD;
      infusion.Give Dextrose 20% 10 ml recheck level in 10 minutes 63.0 - 110 Maintain current&#xD;
      infusion rate 111 - 143 144 - 180 Increase infusion by 2 unit/hour &gt;180 Increase infusion by&#xD;
      3 unit/hour&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood glucose will be measured hourly for 24 hours in the ICU, and the dextrose infusion&#xD;
      rate was modified by the attending nurse according to this protocol (attached).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the safety of the patient on the hyperinsulinemia arms glucocheck every 5-10&#xD;
      minutes using an arterial line. Ongoing dextrose 20% + KPO4 supplementation when glucocheck&#xD;
      drops less than 110 and will be titrated aimed to maintain a glucocheck 63-110. If at any&#xD;
      point of time patient reached sever hypoglycemia defined as 32.3 (1.8) or below the insulin&#xD;
      drip will be stopped and the patient will be considered a dropout of the study. Resuscitation&#xD;
      with dextrose and KPO4 will continue to achieve eu-glycemia again. An international expert in&#xD;
      the insulin clamp will be conducting the first patients to assure the local team experience&#xD;
      for extra assurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose Level mg/dl 20% Dextrose infusion + 30 meq Kcl &lt;63 + 15 ml/h &amp; 20ml bolus &amp; Call MD&#xD;
      63-74 +10 ml/h &amp; 10 ml bolus 75-81 + 5ml/h 82-98 Maintain the rate 99-110 - 5ml/h 111-116&#xD;
      -10ml/h &gt;126 - 50% of the current rate &amp; Call MD&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the standard therapy group, blood glucose measurements will be performed before the&#xD;
      induction of anesthesia,every 30 minutes during surgery, and hourly in the ICU for 24 hours.&#xD;
      If the blood glucose was &gt;6.1 mmol /L (110 mg /dL), an insulin infusion of 1 U/ h was&#xD;
      started. This was then titrated according to the sliding scale (Attached), aiming at a blood&#xD;
      glucose between 3.5 and 6.1 mmol / L (63-110 mg/dL) during surgery and 3.5 and 7.9 mmol /L&#xD;
      (63-143 mg /dL) after surgery A common preoperative and postoperative pathway with&#xD;
      standardized management and pain control to be implemented in both groups. In diabetic&#xD;
      patients, the administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs will be discontinued 24 hours before&#xD;
      surgery. If patients received insulin, the daily dose will be held the evening before&#xD;
      surgery, and subcutaneous insulin will be administered using a sliding scale. Arterial blood&#xD;
      glucose concentrations measured using the glucocheck. Human insulin to be administered using&#xD;
      the concentration 100 U of insulin in 100 mL normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;

      and radiological interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allowed therapeutic regimens are: drugs as antiemetics, antipyretics, analgetics, diuretics&#xD;
      and electrolytes and physiotherapy. This grade also includes wound infections opened at the&#xD;
      bedside.&#xD;

      organ dysfunction (including dialysis) Grade IV-b: multi organ dysfunction Grade V: Death of&#xD;
      a patient Suffix 'd': If the patients suffers from a complication at the time of discharge,&#xD;
      the suffix &quot;d&quot; (for 'disability') is added to the respective grade of complication. This&#xD;
      label indicates the need for a follow-up to fully evaluate the complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the guidelines all our patients will undergo a routine colonoscopy at 1 year and then&#xD;
      after depending on the results, also a CT scan at 1 year, and 3 years and 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data privacy and management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cardiac surgery it was mainly directed towards postoperative complication only and graft&#xD;
      survival. In liver resection the main outcome was postoperative liver dysfunction and the&#xD;
      micro mechanism were related to glycogen storage that might have been the cause for earlier&#xD;
      and faster hepatic recovery. In our study, it's the first time to correlate it with&#xD;
      anastomotic leak mainly and oncological outcomes. The use of this therapy has not made it to&#xD;
      the clinical side because more studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.&#xD;
