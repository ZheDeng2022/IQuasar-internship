      The purpose of this study is to determine if methadone improves postoperative pain control in&#xD;
      pediatric patient's undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be conducted at Children's National Health System (CNHS). Pediatric&#xD;
      subjects undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass will be recruited.&#xD;
      Eligible and consenting participants will be assigned a unique identification number and will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either methadone or fentanyl using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization scheme. A total of 52 participants will be enrolled to each arm of the study,&#xD;
      providing 80% power to detect a 30% difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once informed consent is obtained the inpatient pharmacist at CNHS will randomly assign&#xD;
      eligible participants to receive methadone or fentanyl. The pharmacist will prepare 0.3&#xD;
      mcg/kg of methadone and 20 mcg/kg of fentanyl for loading dose administration, diluted to 10&#xD;
      mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IDS pharmacy will store and maintain all medications per Department of Pharmacy standard&#xD;
      operating procedures for waste of a controlled substance (C-II) drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase will begin at the induction of general anesthesia and finish at the end&#xD;
      of the surgical procedure. Standard anesthetic practice for monitoring, induction, and&#xD;
      maintenance of general anesthesia will be preserved throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive either 0.3 mg/kg of methadone or 20 mcg/kg of fentanyl prior to&#xD;
      surgical incision, over 20 minutes. The medication will be prepared as described above and&#xD;
      all research and staff personnel as well as the study participant will be blinded to&#xD;
      treatment group assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per standard anesthetic practice, the subject will continue to be evaluated for&#xD;
      hemodynamic stability, postoperative risk of bleeding, and respiratory effort. Morphine at&#xD;
      0.05 mg/kg per dose will be administered intravenously as needed for pain control. Surgical&#xD;
      procedures and times will be recorded in the operative report via the electronic medical&#xD;
      record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative ICU Phase The postoperative cardiac intensive care unit phase will begin at&#xD;
      admission to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) and will end on the third day of hospital&#xD;
      admission. Postoperative care including hemodynamic stability, resuscitation, and respiratory&#xD;
      support will be at the discretion of the CICU team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per CICU protocol, the nurse will monitor and record vital signs and pain scale (FLACC)&#xD;
      scores beginning at handoff from the anesthesia team to the intensive care team. The nurse&#xD;
      will continue to document vital signs including: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory&#xD;
      rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, minute ventilation when mechanically ventilated, and&#xD;
      oxygen supplementation when appropriate, in the electronic medical record every hour. As per&#xD;
      nursing protocol, FLACC scores will be recorded in the electronic medical record every 4&#xD;
      hours or when the nursing staff witnesses pain during the entirety of the subject's CICU&#xD;
      stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive analgesics and sedation medication based on CICU postoperative pain&#xD;
      control and agitation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection The investigator or designee, blinded to group assignment, will collect all&#xD;
      of the relevant data from the electronic medical record within six months of the cardiac&#xD;
      surgery and enter it into the Medical Center's proprietary web-based data-entry and&#xD;
      data-management system, REDcap (Research Electronic Data Capture). The source of information&#xD;
      will be medical records at the Children's National Health System &quot;Anesthesiology&quot; and &quot;Bear&#xD;
      Tracks&quot; information systems provided by Cerner Corporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be obtained specifically for research purposes. Subject identifiers (e.g. name,&#xD;
      date of birth, address) will not be entered into the REDcap system. The previously assigned&#xD;
      unique identification numbers will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations Significance will be measured as a 30% reduction in postoperative&#xD;
      pain requirement. Statistical analysis will be used to evaluate any differences between the&#xD;
      randomization groups in opioid-related adverse events during the first 24-hour postoperative&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <measure>Total Opioid Dose, in Morphine Equivalents, in the First 24 Hours After Pediatric Cardiac Bypass Surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The distribution of the total opioid dose in the first 24 hours will be evaluated by randomization group (methadone vs. fentanyl) and differences between groups will be tested. It is hypothesized that compared to fentanyl, methadone administered intraoperative will result in a significantly lower total opioid dose (morphine or oxycodone) during the first 24 hour postoperative period. Assuming no difference between the two treatment strategies in the population, a total sample size of 52 in each group will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.1. Significance will be measured as a 30% reduction in postoperative pain requirement.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The trial was terminated because enrollment in the clinical trial did not reach the target number of subjects needed to achieve target power and was insufficient to produce statistically reliable results. Additionally, without notice formulations of the study drug methadone became unavailable and remain unavailable due to production shortages.</recruitment_details>

Fentanyl: The treatment phase will begin at the induction of general anesthesia and finish at the end of the surgical procedure. Under the direction of the cardiac anesthesiologist subjects will be premedicated and general anesthesia will be induced with standard anesthetic monitoring and management. Participants will receive 20 mcg/kg of fentanyl prior to surgical incision, over 20 minutes. General anesthesia will be maintained with inhalational anesthetics and paralytics. The subject will continue to be evaluated for hemodynamic stability, bleeding, and respiratory effort. The postoperative intensive care phase will begin at time of room admission and end at day three of hospital stay. All subjects will receive morphine or oxycodone analgesics and sedation medication based on the hospital's postoperative pain control and agitation protocol. Standard electronic documentation will be maintained throughout and include: medications, vital signs, and events.</description>

        <title>Total Opioid Dose, in Morphine Equivalents, in the First 24 Hours After Pediatric Cardiac Bypass Surgery.</title>
        <description>The distribution of the total opioid dose in the first 24 hours will be evaluated by randomization group (methadone vs. fentanyl) and differences between groups will be tested. It is hypothesized that compared to fentanyl, methadone administered intraoperative will result in a significantly lower total opioid dose (morphine or oxycodone) during the first 24 hour postoperative period. Assuming no difference between the two treatment strategies in the population, a total sample size of 52 in each group will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.1. Significance will be measured as a 30% reduction in postoperative pain requirement.</description>
        <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
        <population>The trail was terminated because enrollment in the clinical trial did not reach the target number of subjects needed to achieve target power and was insufficient to produce statistically reliable results. Additionally, without notice formulations of the study drug methadone became unavailable and remain unavailable due to production shortages. Therefore, no analysis was performed on the data.</population>

Assuming no difference between the two treatment strategies in the population, a total sample size of 52 in each group will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.1. Significance will be measured as a 30% reduction in postoperative pain requirement.</description>
          <population>The trail was terminated because enrollment in the clinical trial did not reach the target number of subjects needed to achieve target power and was insufficient to produce statistically reliable results. Additionally, without notice formulations of the study drug methadone became unavailable and remain unavailable due to production shortages. Therefore, no analysis was performed on the data.</population>
