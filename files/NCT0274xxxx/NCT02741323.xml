    <textblock>
      Maraviroc (MVC) is a type of HIV medicine called a CCR5 inhibitor. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of MVC in HIV-infected adults receiving a kidney transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MVC is a CCR5 inhibitor that may have a positive role in modulating the immune response&#xD;
      following transplantation. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of MVC in HIV-infected adults in need of a kidney transplant. The study will&#xD;
      also evaluate whether using both immunosuppressant drugs and MVC will improve kidney function&#xD;
      after a kidney transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) who&#xD;
      need a kidney transplant. At the time of their kidney transplant, study participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive either MVC or placebo as an addition to their cART regimen. (MVC&#xD;
      or placebo will be provided by the study. However, the HIV medicines in their cART regimens&#xD;
      will not be provided by the study.) Participants will receive MVC or placebo throughout their&#xD;
      participation in the study, which will be 1 to 3 years depending on when they enroll in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study visits will occur at enrollment (Day 0) and post-transplant Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26,&#xD;
      39, 52, 78, 104, 130, and 156. Study visits may include a physical examination, blood&#xD;
      collection, lymph node collection, urine sample collection, and a kidney biopsy. During the&#xD;
      study, participants will also be monitored closely for evidence of drug toxicities, HIV&#xD;
      treatment failure and rejection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant is able to understand and provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented HIV infection (by any licensed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]&#xD;
             and confirmation by Western Blot, positive HIV antibody (ab) indirect fluorescent&#xD;
             antibody (IFA), or documented history of detectable HIV-1 RNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CD4+ T-cell count greater than or equal to 200/µL at any time in the 26 weeks prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Most recent HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies RNA/mL. Eligibility at the time of&#xD;
             enrollment will be determined based on the most recent HIV-1 RNA, not more than 26&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment. Subjects who require a switch in combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy (cART) regimen to become study eligible must also have an eligible HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
             result post change in cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant meets standard listing criteria for placement on transplant waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For participants with an HIV+ deceased donor:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No active opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrence by the study team that based on medical history and ART, viral&#xD;
                  suppression can be achieved in the recipient post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must be enrolled in an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved research&#xD;
                  protocol that fulfills the requirements of the DHHA Hope Act Policy (see the&#xD;
                  protocol for more information).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV+ deceased donor must have no evidence of invasive opportunistic complications&#xD;
                  of HIV infection, and must have a pre-implant biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Antiretroviral (ARV) Use: Participant is on a stable cART regimen for at least 3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment (unless changes are made due to toxicity, drug&#xD;
             interactions, convenience or to an eligible non-protease inhibitor-based regimen).&#xD;
             Switch should not be due to virologic failure. A regimen consisting of 2 NTRTIs and an&#xD;
             integrase inhibitor is preferred due to minimal drug interaction but any non-protease&#xD;
             inhibitor regimen may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If on a protease inhibitor based regimen, participant must be switched to a&#xD;
                  non-protease inhibitor-based regimen based on lack of any prior drug resistance&#xD;
                  or antiretroviral-treatment failure, and be willing to remain on indefinitely&#xD;
                  unless a change is medically necessary. Participants who need to be switched must&#xD;
                  have been on a stable cART regimen for at least 3 months prior, and must have an&#xD;
                  eligible HIV-1 RNA result post change in cART.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If already on a stable non-protease inhibitor-based regimen, participant is&#xD;
                  willing to remain on this regimen indefinitely unless a change in regimen is&#xD;
                  medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If untreated, must initiate and be willing to remain on indefinitely a&#xD;
                  non-protease inhibitor-based antiretroviral regimen unless a change is medically&#xD;
                  necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known allergy or intolerance to components of maraviroc (MVC) or its formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No known contraindication to MVC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum beta-human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) pregnancy test within 30 days of randomization.&#xD;

             of prednisone, or equivalent strength steroid) will not be considered&#xD;
             immunosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Opportunistic Complication History: Any history of progressive multifocal&#xD;
             leukoencephalopathy (PML), chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis of greater than 1&#xD;
             month duration, or primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Note: History of&#xD;
             pulmonary coccidiodomycosis will be treated per local site policy regarding this&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding. Note: Participants who become pregnant&#xD;
             post-transplant will continue to be followed in the study and will be managed per&#xD;
             local site practice. Women that become pregnant should not breastfeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has used interleukin-2 (IL-2) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating&#xD;
             factor (GM-CSF) in the prior six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received interferon-alpha therapy in the prior 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of investigational drugs within 4 weeks of enrollment.&#xD;

             examination, or laboratory testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, may pose additional risks from participation in the study, may&#xD;
             interfere with the participant's ability to comply with study requirements, or that&#xD;
             may impact the quality or interpretation of the data obtained from the study.&#xD;
