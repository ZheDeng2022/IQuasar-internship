      This study will employ the Vessix Renal Denervation System (Boston Scientific) to ablate the&#xD;
      renal nerve by radio-ablation in patients suffering from severe pain due to Autosomal&#xD;
      Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD). Twenty patients with opiate-dependent, Autosomal&#xD;
      Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease-associated kidney pain will be selected to this&#xD;
      double-blind, prospective device study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to an experimental&#xD;
      (those who will receive nerve ablation) or control (those who will have a sham procedure in&#xD;
      which the ablation device is not turned on) groups. Subjects will complete physical exams and&#xD;
      be administered questionnaires regarding their mental status and pain before, during and&#xD;
      after the denervation procedure. Renal function and adverse events will be monitored for 1&#xD;
      year after denervation.&#xD;
