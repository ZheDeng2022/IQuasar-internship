    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ibrutinib and brentuximab vedotin work in treating&#xD;
      patients with Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving ibrutinib together with brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      may be a better treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the two agent combination ibrutinib and brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin, as assessed by complete response (CR) rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of the two agent combination through evaluation of&#xD;
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), response duration and survival (overall&#xD;
      and progression-free).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe outcomes of patients who ultimately undergo autologous or allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation following treatment with ibrutinib/brentuximab vedotin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lymphoma specimens and&#xD;
      serial plasma samples for future biomarker evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and brentuximab vedotin&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
