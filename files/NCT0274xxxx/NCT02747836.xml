      This study evaluates the ability of ultrasound to measure the movement of tendons and nerves&#xD;
      within the human carpal tunnel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel ultrasonographic method to&#xD;
      characterize the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT) and detect differences between SSCT,&#xD;
      median nerve and tendon motion for the evaluation and diagnosis of patients suspected of&#xD;
      having carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is usually diagnosed late in its evolution, by&#xD;
      measuring electrophysiological changes in median nerve function. Once these changes have&#xD;
      occurred, surgery is often the only effective treatment. At an earlier stage of evolution,&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment might be more effective. Although ultrasonography and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) have recently been used to measure changes in median nerve shape in&#xD;
      CTS, such approaches also only capture late changes. Thus, a method for detection of CTS that&#xD;
      could identify pathology before function or structure of the nerve is compromised could&#xD;
      prevent significant morbidity and transition to a permanent neuropathy. One promising&#xD;
      opportunity is presented in the subsynovial connective tissue (SSCT), which surrounds the&#xD;
      tendons in the carpal tunnel. One of the most characteristic findings in surgically treated&#xD;
      patients with CTS is a non-inflammatory fibrosis of the SSCT. Some investigators have&#xD;
      suggested that the SSCT may be the cause of the nerve compression in CTS. In our previous&#xD;
      work, the investigators have demonstrated differences in the mechanical properties, motion&#xD;
      and thickness of the SSCT in patients with CTS compared to normals. More recently, an animal&#xD;
      model has been described in which the structural changes in the SSCT have been shown to&#xD;
      precede the changes in nerve function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have demonstrated in cadaver studies that the normal SSCT can be imaged by&#xD;
      ultrasound, and its motion, velocity, and thickness distinguished from that of the nearby&#xD;
      tendon and nerve. Here the investigators propose to leverage this work, and study the ability&#xD;
      of ultrasound to detect SSCT thickness and motion in individuals with and without CTS. Based&#xD;
      on our preliminary research, the investigators formulate the following central hypothesis: An&#xD;
      increase in SSCT thickness and changes in sliding velocities of the SSCT with respect to the&#xD;
      corresponding tendon are indicative of CTS. In addition, this material property change at&#xD;
      SSCT affects median nerve motions and transformations. This is because the SSCT becomes&#xD;
      fibrotic in CTS, and the fibrosis alters the normal SSCT-median nerve-tendon functional&#xD;
      relationship.&#xD;
