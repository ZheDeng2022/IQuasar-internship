    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to engage patients with chronic pain and other key&#xD;
      stakeholders in an iterative process of pilot-testing a validated patient generated&#xD;
      instrument, the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP), to support primary care&#xD;
      encounters and provide a direct comparison between a strategy of incorporating patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes into the package of care for complex pain patients and usual care. The&#xD;
      specific aims of this phase of the project are to: 1) adapt the MYMOP for use in the primary&#xD;
      care setting well-integrated into everyday practice flow, and 2) evaluate whether the&#xD;
      utilization of the MYMOP data in routine primary care encounters results in improvements in&#xD;
      patient symptoms and functioning over time as well as increased satisfaction with the visit&#xD;
      for patients and primary care providers. To achieve Aim 2, the investigators will compare the&#xD;
      reported outcomes and health care utilization from participating patients in this study for&#xD;
      whom the MYMOP-based instrument will be used in routine clinical care to a matched group of&#xD;
      chronic pain patients who will not receive the MYMOP-based assessment but will otherwise have&#xD;
      similarly collected data. This also allows us to evaluate of the extent to which use of the&#xD;
      tool adds patient-centered information to more conventional instruments. In addition to these&#xD;
      two aims, for a third aim, the investigators plan to collect qualitative data from patients,&#xD;
      their family members, Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) health care providers, and KPNW&#xD;
      administrators to better understand the needs of this subpopulation of patients.&#xD;
