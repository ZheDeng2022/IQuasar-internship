  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to see if it is possible to use blood samples to predict response to&#xD;
      treatment in breast cancer patients receiving preoperative (or neoadjuvant) therapy. Research&#xD;
      has shown that most breast cancers release tumor-specific DNA into the blood (that is, DNA&#xD;
      that is specific to the tumor cells or cancer). This DNA can be detected in blood testing&#xD;
      known as plasma tumor-DNA or &quot;ptDNA.&quot; This DNA is separate from that found in the blood and&#xD;
      tissue samples which serve as the &quot;instruction book&quot; or &quot;genetic code&quot; for the cells that&#xD;
      make-up the human body. The changes in ptDNA before and after treatment, as well as after&#xD;
      surgery, may also help investigators to understand more about a patient's risk of cancer&#xD;
      returning and long-term outcomes.&#xD;

      This is a prospectively designed study. Up to 229 newly diagnosed invasive HER2-positive or&#xD;
      triple-negative breast cancer patients planning neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected pre-operatively at the time of diagnosis/prior to NAT,&#xD;
      post-cycle 1/pre-cycle 2 of NAT, after all NAT/immediately before surgery, and&#xD;
      post-operatively at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, and annually thereafter if funding allows.&#xD;
      Researchers will also collect representative tissue samples from the diagnostic biopsy (in&#xD;
      all participants) and definitive surgery (if available). Additionally, to look at feasibility&#xD;
      of tumor DNA analyses in urine samples, urine samples will be collected along with blood&#xD;
      samples (urine tumor DNA or utDNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next generation sequencing will be performed on core biopsies of all enrolled patients for&#xD;
      tumor-specific mutations (TSM) discovery. Based on those findings, droplet digital PCR&#xD;
      (ddPCR) on plasma DNA samples will also be performed to confirm the presence of the TSM in&#xD;
      the plasma on diagnosis, and one TSM will be chosen to track as the plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA)&#xD;
      mutation of interest. Investigators will perform ddPCR on pre-operative plasma DNA samples&#xD;
      and will assess for the presence of ptDNA. Pathologists will assess surgical specimens for&#xD;
      pathologic response (such as complete response/pCR and residual cancer burden/RCB). As&#xD;
      primary endpoint, investigators will assess the number of patients with and without&#xD;
      preoperative ptDNA who have pCR versus residual disease. As exploratory endpoints, the&#xD;
      following will also be performed: (a) quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR&#xD;
      (QM-MSP) in diagnostic biopsy and definitive residual surgery specimen; and, (b) the&#xD;
      circulating methylated tumor DNA (cMethDNA) assay in plasma specimens (baseline and after&#xD;
      NAT), and evaluate associations with pathologic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional endpoints include the association between plasma and tissue markers at baseline,&#xD;
      after NAT, and (if available) during surveillance with long-term prognosis (invasive&#xD;
      disease-free survival/IDFS and distant disease-free survival/DDFS).&#xD;
