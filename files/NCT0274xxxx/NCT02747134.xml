  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study researchers aim to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention&#xD;
      combining emotion regulation and mindfulness skills in a single 10-week program. A total of&#xD;
      75 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis in complete or partial&#xD;
      remission participated in this randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing an intervention&#xD;
      including emotion regulation and mindfulness skills (ER+M) with a psychoeducative program.&#xD;
      After treatment, participants were followed for a 1-year period. Researchers results indicate&#xD;
      that ER+M was not more effective than the treatment used with the control group in preventing&#xD;
      depression relapse. Participants allocated to the ER+M group showed a significant decrease on&#xD;
      global psychiatric symptoms, whereas those in the control group did not. Further studies are&#xD;
      needed in order to better determine the combined effects of mindfulness and behavioral&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
