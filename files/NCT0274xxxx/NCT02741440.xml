      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is disease in which people have problems with&#xD;
      coordination, balance, speech and vision. It is caused by a change in the ATXN7 gene. A&#xD;
      mutation in this ATXN7 gene causes changes in eye cells, which can lead to vision loss. There&#xD;
      is no cure for SCA7 but researchers are looking for possible treatments. Researchers need&#xD;
      more information about SCA7. They want to collect vision and neurology related data from&#xD;
      people with SCA7. They want to learn how and what changes in the eye and brain when the ATXN7&#xD;
      gene isn t working properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about SCA7 and its progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 12 and older with SCA7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history and genetic testing from a previous&#xD;
      National Eye Institute study or their personal physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 7 visits over 5 years. They will have 2 visits during the&#xD;
      first week of the study. Then they will be asked to come back every year for the next 5&#xD;
      years. Each visit will last several days and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and eye history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several eye tests: some will include dilating the pupil with eye drops and taking photos&#xD;
           or scans of the eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electroretinography (ERG): Participants will sit in the dark with their eyes patched for&#xD;
           30 minutes. After this, the patches will be removed and contact lenses put into the&#xD;
           eyes. They will watch flashing lights and information will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological exams: Sensation, strength, coordination, reflexes, attention, memory,&#xD;
           language, and other cognitive functions will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI: They will lie in a machine that takes pictures of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional skin biopsy: About 3 millimeters of skin will be removed for more research&#xD;
           testing; this is half the size of a pencil eraser.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinocerebellar Ataxia, type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease&#xD;
      characterized by progressive ataxia, retinal degeneration, and marked genetic anticipation.&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to 1) establish a cohort of participants with&#xD;
      molecularly-confirmed SCA7 in anticipation of future clinical trials, 2) create a repository&#xD;
      of plasma, DNA, and skin fibroblast samples from the accrued cohort of SCA7 participants, 3)&#xD;
      formulate clinical outcome measures for future studies, and 4) acquire and perform&#xD;
      preliminary analyses of data that may advance our understanding of the progression of retinal&#xD;
      and neurodegeneration associated with molecularly-confirmed SCA7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-five (25) participants, ages 12 and above, with molecularly-confirmed SCA7 will be&#xD;
      accrued for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this natural history study, participants will be followed for at least five years. Because&#xD;
      three years may be required to enroll 25 participants, this study will last up to eight&#xD;
      years. All participants will undergo a standardized medical/ophthalmic history and a complete&#xD;
      baseline eye examination, including non-invasive electrophysiology (e.g.,&#xD;
      electroretinography), psychophysiology (e.g., microperimetry, static perimetry), and&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging examinations (e.g., optical coherence tomography). In addition,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a detailed neurology exam, neuroimaging (MRI, including special&#xD;
      sequences) and consult with speech pathology and/or other rehabilitation services, audiology,&#xD;
      and neuropsychology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish baseline, the participants will undergo two separate detailed eye examinations&#xD;
      and a single neurology/neuroimaging examination within a one to two week period. Afterwards,&#xD;
      they will return to the NEI clinic annually until the last-enrolled participant reaches five&#xD;
      years of follow-up. Therefore, this study will require a minimum of five study visits.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will consist of a single detailed eye exam, a single detailed&#xD;
      neurology/neuroimaging exam, and follow-up with appropriate consultants. Participants may be&#xD;
      seen at more frequent intervals at the investigators discretion, depending on the clinical&#xD;
      and research situation. Participants will be required to submit a blood sample for research,&#xD;
      and they will have the option to provide a skin biopsy to facilitate research at a cellular&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study is determination of the amplitude and time of photopic and&#xD;
      scotopic responses on electroretinogram. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual acuity,&#xD;
      microperimetry, peripheral visual field, color vision, macular thickness, and neurologic&#xD;
      outcome variables. Exploratory outcomes for this study include: 1) the formulation of&#xD;
      clinical outcome measures for future studies and 2) the acquisition and preliminary analysis&#xD;
      of data that may advance our understanding of the progression of retinal and&#xD;
      neurodegeneration associated with molecularly-confirmed SCA7. Cells from skin biopsies may be&#xD;
      grown in the laboratory to better understand SCA7, including the evaluation of potential&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

        the nation, as well as from the SCA7 patient support group (e.g., The National Ataxia&#xD;
        Foundation). All advertisements will undergo IRB-approval before release. Referrals from&#xD;
        investigators for participants under the 08-EI-0102 or 15-EI-0128 NEI protocols may be&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met, where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be 12 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant must be able to understand and sign the protocol s informed consent&#xD;
             document on their own behalf OR, in the case of a minor, have a legal guardian/parent&#xD;
             with the ability to do the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participant must be able to produce a recordable electroretinogram (ERG).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant must have the ability to cooperate the required testing. Participants&#xD;
             unable to cooperate with one or more tests may be included only at the discretion of&#xD;
             the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must be willing and able to provide a blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any female participant of childbearing potential must agree to have pregnancy testing&#xD;
             prior to undergoing MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participant has molecularly-confirmed, symptomatic SCA7, as defined by CAG repeat&#xD;
             expansion in the ATXN7 gene of greater than 35 repeats. Accrual will be biased towards&#xD;
             those with lower numbers of abnormal repeats (above 35 repeats) as they are most&#xD;
             likely to be able to cooperate with testing. Participants who have clinical findings&#xD;
             consistent with SCA7 and a relative who has had molecular diagnosis, may be included&#xD;
             in the study with subsequent confirmation of the number of repeats. Patients who have&#xD;
             clinical findings consistent with SCA7 but no molecular diagnosis may be evaluated&#xD;
             under an NEI screening, genetics bank, or evaluation and treatment protocol with&#xD;
             subsequent molecular diagnosis performed within six months of their initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant is unable to cooperate with ophthalmic/neurologic testing, including&#xD;
             inability to undergo brain MRI without sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant has comorbidity, unrelated to ocular pathology, compromising the ability&#xD;
             to view/image the retina and/or record an ERG.&#xD;
