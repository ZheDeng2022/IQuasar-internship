      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease causes plaque in arteries. This can cause stroke or heart disease.&#xD;
      Drugs called statins might shrink plaque. Researchers want to study how CT scanning can&#xD;
      determine if an individual s arterial plaque has decreased while taking statins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure the change in coronary artery plaque volume in people treated with high-intensity&#xD;
      statin therapy using CT and MRI scans. To study the metabolic activity of plaque in arteries.&#xD;
      To determine how well plaque measurements from heart CT scans can be replicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 40-75 and women ages 40-75 who are good candidates for statin treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart MRI and CT scan: An IV inserted into an arm or hand vein removes blood and injects&#xD;
           contrast, and medicine if needed. Participants lie on a table that slides into a machine&#xD;
           that takes pictures of the body. For the CT scan, if their heart rate is too high, they&#xD;
           get medicine to lower it. They breathe in a special way, holding their breath for 5&#xD;
           seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will begin high-intensity statin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 7 more visits over 3 years. All visits include blood tests and&#xD;
      medication review. Some may also include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statin treatment adjustment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may join the PET Substudy. This includes 5 more visits during the study. These&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Getting an IV in an arm vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PET scans: They fast 12 hours before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may join the Reproducibility Substudy if they had a slow heart rate during their&#xD;
      first CT scan. This includes 1 additional heart CT scan 4 weeks later.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In high risk patients undergoing invasive angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has&#xD;
      shown reduction of plaque for patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins).&#xD;
      However, there is no accepted noninvasive method to determine if treatment for&#xD;
      atherosclerosis results in reduction of coronary artery plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery CT angiography (CCTA) is noninvasive and can accurately determine the degree&#xD;
      of coronary artery stenosis. In addition, the extent of calcified and noncalcified plaque may&#xD;
      be directly measured using this technology at low radiation dose using state-of-the-art CT&#xD;
      scanners. Several retrospective studies have previously suggested that CCTA may be able to&#xD;
      show plaque regression in the coronary arteries due to statin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the change in coronary artery plaque volume&#xD;
      in individuals treated with high intensity statin therapy as defined by 2013 ACC/AHA&#xD;
      Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk&#xD;
      in Adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will undergo CCTA examination for&#xD;
      the presence or absence of coronary artery plaque. Individuals with evidence of noncalcified&#xD;
      coronary plaque by CCTA and who meet criteria for HMG-CoA reductase (statin) therapy will be&#xD;
      evaluated for a total of 36 months. The change of coronary artery plaque (progression or no&#xD;
      change, or regression) in individuals with noncalcified plaque at baseline will be measured&#xD;
      by CCTA at yearly intervals.&#xD;
