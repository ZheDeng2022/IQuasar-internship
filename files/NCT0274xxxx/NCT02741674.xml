  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research project is to conduct a comparative effectiveness research&#xD;
      study involving existing data in the PCORnet Common Data Model to provide accurate estimates&#xD;
      of the 1-, 3-, and 5-year benefits and risks of the three most common bariatric procedures -&#xD;
      Roux-en-y gastric bypass, adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy - with a focus&#xD;
      on outcomes that are important to adults and adolescents with severe obesity: 1) changes in&#xD;
      weight, 2) rates of remission and relapse of diabetes, and 3) major adverse events.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study will compare the effectiveness and safety of the three most&#xD;
      common bariatric surgical procedures: Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric&#xD;
      banding (AGB), and sleeve gastrectomy (SG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question (Aim) 1: To what extent does weight loss and weight regain differ across the three&#xD;
      bariatric surgical procedures at 1, 3, and 5 years? This aim addresses the primary outcome of&#xD;
      interest among most patients seeking bariatric surgery - the differential impact of these&#xD;
      procedures on maximum weight loss as well as the extent of longer-term weight regain. We will&#xD;
      also explore the heterogeneity in weight loss and regain across several key subgroups that&#xD;
      may have differential response to surgical treatment, specifically groups defined by age,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, baseline BMI, smoking status, and pre-operative comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question (Aim) 2: To what extent do these bariatric procedures differ on improvements in&#xD;
      diabetes risk at 1, 3, and 5 years? Among patients with diabetes, remission or &quot;cure&quot; of&#xD;
      their disease (defined as HbA1c &lt;6.5% off diabetes medications) has been cited as the most&#xD;
      important outcome of bariatric surgery. Thus, we will examine the comparative effect of these&#xD;
      procedures on rates of diabetes remission as well as relapse (recurrence). Secondary analyses&#xD;
      will examine the comparative impact of the procedures on glycemic control independent of&#xD;
      diabetes remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question (Aim) 3: What is the frequency of major adverse events following these three&#xD;
      different bariatric surgical procedures at 1, 3, and 5 years? We will examine four important&#xD;
      adverse event outcome categories across the three procedures: 1) short- and long-term (1, 3,&#xD;
      and 5 year) mortality rates, 2) a composite end point of 30-day major adverse outcomes: based&#xD;
      on the definition used in the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study that&#xD;
      included death; venous thromboembolism; percutaneous, endoscopic, or operative subsequent&#xD;
      intervention; and failure to be discharged from the hospital; 3) subsequent hospitalization&#xD;
      (any hospitalization following initial surgery); and 4) subsequent&#xD;
      reoperation/reintervention: defined as any additional bariatric procedure and other&#xD;
      procedures related to device removals, gastric revisions, abdominal or incisional hernia&#xD;
      repair, laparoscopy or laparotomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placements.&#xD;
