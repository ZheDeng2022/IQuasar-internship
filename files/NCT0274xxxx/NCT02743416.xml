  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      STROKESTOP II will study if the biomarker NT-proBNP together with single-lead ECG can be used&#xD;
      as a primary population screening tool for silent atrial fibrillation, and builds on previous&#xD;
      results from the STROKESTOP study.&#xD;

    <measure>To compare different ECG modalities for AF screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>A subset of participants will perform both single-lead, handheld, intermittent ECG (Zenicor) and continuous event loop ECG recordings (Novacor R-test 4) and AF yield (defined as at least one episode of AF with a duration of 30 seconds) will be compared between the methods. Tolerability to both methods will be measured qualitatively with a questionnaire.</description>

        Individuals aged 75/76 residing in Stockholm will be identified using their 10-digit&#xD;
        personal identification number. All identified subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion&#xD;
        to be invited to screening for AF or to serve as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants with a prior diagnosis of AF will be asked if they are on treatment with&#xD;
        anticoagulants. If they are not, a referral to cardiologist will be made to ensure&#xD;
        appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals without known AF will have blood samples drawn and analysed with regard to&#xD;
        NT-proBNP using point of care analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals with NT-proBNP&gt; 125 ng/L and without known AF will be taught to undergo&#xD;
        intermittent ECG recordings twice daily for two weeks (High-risk Group). Individuals with a&#xD;
        NT-proBNP&lt;125 ng/L will do one initial 1-lead ECG, and if normal not undergo further ECG&#xD;
        screening (low-risk Group).&#xD;
