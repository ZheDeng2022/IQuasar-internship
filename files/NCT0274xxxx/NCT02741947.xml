      The trial was an experimental two-centers, randomized, double-blind, two-sequence,&#xD;
      non-inferiority cross-over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screened subjects already treated with Levodopa/Benserazide (LDB) (Madopar®) who agreed to&#xD;
      participate in the study entered a 4 weeks period if not on stable regimen of Madopar®&#xD;
      (run-in period). Following the run-in period, there were two maintenance periods of 4 weeks&#xD;
      each, for a total duration of 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) by a computerized randomization system to one of two&#xD;
      formulation sequences maintaining the dose stabilized during the run in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  generic-originator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  originator-generic At the end of maintenance period 1, the patients in each formulation&#xD;
           group underwent an overnight switch to the same dose of the alternative formulation. The&#xD;
           dose was kept stable during the whole length of trial. Clinical evaluations were&#xD;
           performed at the end of each period. The tablets were encapsulated to maintain the&#xD;
           blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic study with a fixed dose (100+25 mg) was performed in a sub-population of 14&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: out-patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease for at least 5&#xD;
      years, receiving L-dopa/benserazide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the trial was approximately 8 weeks for patient divided in two&#xD;
      maintenance periods of 4 weeks each.&#xD;

      The trial was an experimental two-centers, randomized, double-blind, two-sequence,&#xD;
      non-inferiority cross-over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: out-patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) for at least&#xD;
      5 years, receiving Levodopa, were enrolled to participate into the study. The study was&#xD;
      performed in hospital setting using the facilities of the clinical trial centre in both sites&#xD;
      involved in the study. The patients were recruited within the patient population using the&#xD;
      hospitals out-patients clinics. Recruitment timing lasted 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screened subjects who agreed to participate in the study, taking Levodopa/Benserazide LDB&#xD;
      (Madopar®) entered a 4 weeks period with stable regimen of Madopar® (run-in period). The&#xD;
      formulations of levodopa admitted in the trial were: Madopar® 100+25; and 200+50 (1/2 or 1&#xD;
      tablet). Following the run-in period, there were two key phases of the study: two maintenance&#xD;
      periods (4 weeks each), for a total duration of 8 weeks. Patients were assigned randomly&#xD;
      (1:1) by a computerized randomization system to one of two formulation sequences maintaining&#xD;
      the dose stabilized during the run in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  generic-originator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  originator-generic At the end of maintenance period 1, the patients in each formulation&#xD;
           group underwent an overnight switching to the same dose of the alternative formulation.&#xD;
           The dose was kept stable during the whole length of trial. Clinical evaluations were&#xD;
           performed at the end of each period (see flow chart enclosed). The tablets were&#xD;
           encapsulated to maintain the blindness. A pharmacokinetic study with a fixed dose&#xD;
           (100+25 mg) was performed in a sub-population of 14 subjects. The drugs was administered&#xD;
           orally. In case of prolonged, not tolerable akinetic periods during the study, the&#xD;
           patients could be rescued with an extra dose of levodopa. Any antiparkinsonian treatment&#xD;
           modification or supplementation of antiparkinsonian drugs was not allowed during the&#xD;
           study. Any other drug not specific for Parkinson's disease was evaluated by the&#xD;
           investigators and allowed only if necessary and if not interfering with the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The random allocation of patients to one of the two treatment groups was centrally managed by&#xD;
      the coordinating centre, according to an automatically generated randomization list provided&#xD;
      by the team responsible for the data collection monitoring and statistical analysis. An&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1:1 was assumed when generating the list. Patients eligible to enter the&#xD;
      randomization procedure was sequentially assigned to the lowest randomization sequence number&#xD;
      not yet assigned to any study subject. For each randomization number, a sealed envelope&#xD;
      containing the randomization code was prepared by the team that generated the randomization&#xD;
      list. Unblinding was permitted only if strictly necessary. In case it was essential to know&#xD;
      the treatment assigned to a patient due to serious unexpected adverse events, the envelope&#xD;
      containing the patient's randomization code could be open. In such cases, a detailed report&#xD;
      on the timing, the causes and the patient's randomization number would have been issued by&#xD;
      the person responsible for the trial and archived by the coordinating centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical blinding (encapsulation) was used to ensure the double-blind nature of the study.&#xD;
      Because the patients enrolled in the trial received levodopa/benserazide in different doses,&#xD;
      over-encapsulation of tablets permitted blinding of most oral dosage forms: ½ tablet, several&#xD;
      small tablets, capsules of different sizes or colors. Each capsule was then be placed in a&#xD;
      narrow opaque tube and identified as &quot;Treatment 1&quot; and &quot;Treatment 2&quot; before administration to&#xD;
      the patient. The patient, the investigator, Medical Monitor and Clinical Monitor remained&#xD;
      blinded, whereas the site pharmacist and a nurse who administered study medication were not&#xD;
      blind throughout this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No interim analysis was planned for this protocol. Amendments: no amendments were presented&#xD;
      during the study.&#xD;
