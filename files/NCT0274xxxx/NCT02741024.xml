      This will be an open-randomised non-inferiority study to test the hypothesis that the risk of&#xD;
      recurrent parasitaemia after 42 days is not worse in the group receiving the&#xD;
      Artesunate-Amodiaquine (ASAQ) regimen than in the group receiving the Artemether-Lumefantrine&#xD;
      (Coartem®) regimen. Children with uncomplicated malaria meeting the inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled (after their parent/caretaker has given informed consent), treated on site with&#xD;
      the drugs under evaluation and followed-up for a period of 42 days. Drugs will be given under&#xD;
      direct supervision, either at the clinic or at home. Follow-up shall consist of a fixed&#xD;
      schedule of clinical and laboratory examinations. Based on clinical and laboratory findings,&#xD;
      children will be classified as therapeutic failures (early or late) or adequate responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of cases experiencing an in vivo therapeutic failure during the follow-up&#xD;
      period will provide an estimate of the efficacy of the drug regimens. A Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction (PCR) analysis will be carried out to differentiate true recrudescence due to&#xD;
      treatment failure from episodes of re-infection. This proposal is compliant with the latest&#xD;
      WHO recommendations for anti-malarial efficacy monitoring in high, medium or low transmission&#xD;
      zones11.&#xD;

      3.1 STUDY DESIGN Children with uncomplicated malaria meeting the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled (after their parent/caretaker has given informed consent), treated on site with the&#xD;
      drugs under evaluation and followed-up for a period of 42 days. Drugs will be given under&#xD;
      direct supervision, either at the clinic or at home. Follow-up shall consist of a fixed&#xD;
      schedule of clinical and laboratory examinations. Based on clinical and laboratory findings,&#xD;
      children will be classified as therapeutic failures (early or late) or adequate responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proportion of cases experiencing an in vivo therapeutic failure during the follow-up&#xD;
      period will provide an estimate of the efficacy of the drug regimens. A Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction (PCR) analysis will be carried out to differentiate true recrudescence due to&#xD;
      treatment failure from episodes of re-infection. This proposal is compliant with the latest&#xD;
      WHO recommendations for anti-malarial efficacy monitoring in high, medium or low transmission&#xD;
      zones11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 STUDY SITES The study site will be the MSF catchment area of Baraka health centres,&#xD;
      MSF-OCA Baraka, South Kivu, DRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 STUDY POPULATION The study population is children aged between 6 and 59 months with&#xD;
      uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. This age group was selected because it is considered the&#xD;
      most vulnerable and is less likely to clear infections spontaneously compared to older&#xD;
      children and adults. In hyper-endemic areas, they are the most at risk of dying from malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 DEFINITIONS 3.4.1 DEFINITION OF PARENT/CARETAKER The parent/caretaker is defined as the&#xD;
      household member who is aged ≥ 18 years who cares for the patient and can give accurate&#xD;
      information on all demographic and health issues related to the patient and is present at the&#xD;
      time of the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child will be eligible for study participation if s/he meets all of the following inclusion&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 6 and 59 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight ≥ 5 Kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Slide-confirmed infection with Plasmodium falciparum only (no mixed infections)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Asexual parasite density between 2000 and 200000/µl of blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measured axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ability to swallow oral medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High probability of respecting the follow-up visits (residence within 1 hour walking&#xD;
           distance from the OPD, no upcoming travel plans, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent from a parent or caretaker aged at least 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A child will be excluded from study participation if s/he meets any of the following&#xD;
      exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General danger signs according to the WHO definition (Appendix 5.1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of severe/complicated malaria according to the WHO definition (Appendix 5.1.2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe anaemia (haemoglobin &lt; 5 g/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known history of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe acute malnutrition (as defined by a weight-for-height below -3 Z-score and/or&#xD;
           symmetrical oedemas involving at least the feet)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant febrile illness due to causes other than malaria with the potential to&#xD;
           confound study outcome (measles, acute lower tract respiratory infection, otitis media,&#xD;
           tonsillitis, abscesses, severe diarrhoea with dehydration).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having received already a full course of the treatment (or one of the treatments) under&#xD;
           study in the previous 28 days (as indicated by the parent/caretaker). Note that previous&#xD;
           incomplete anti-malarial intake of treatments under study, or previous intake of&#xD;
           anti-malarials not under study, are not exclusion criteria, but details of any such&#xD;
           intake should be recorded carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of hypersensitivity reactions or contra-indications to any medicines being&#xD;
           tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 SAMPLE SIZE Recent studies had determined the 42-day risk of recurrent parasitaemia due&#xD;
      to recrudenscence (treatment failure) in children to range from 0.9-6% with Coartem®&#xD;
      therapy14;17;21;22. Therefore on the basis of a conservative estimated risk of recurrent&#xD;
      parasitaemia (due to recrudescence, PCR corrected) of 5%, we calculated that 120 patients per&#xD;
      treatment arm would be needed to detect a difference in the risk of recurrent parasitaemia&#xD;
      between treatment arms of no greater than 7% (one-sided type I error of 5%, 80% power)23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming re-infections, undetermined PCR results or loss to follow-up occur in 20% of&#xD;
      samples, the total estimated sample size of this study will be 288 children aged 6-59 months&#xD;
      (144 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.7 SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS Day 0 is the day of screening with clinical assessment, initial&#xD;
      malaria blood smear, first haemoglobin measurement, pre-treatment capillary blood sample for&#xD;
      PCR, enrolment and administration of first dose of drugs under study. On Day 1 and Day 2,&#xD;
      treatment will continue and children will be re-assessed at the MSF clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will return to the clinic on the following mandatory days: Day 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35&#xD;
      and 42. At each scheduled visit, a clinical examination and a blood smear will be performed.&#xD;
      To encourage clinic attendance, small incentives will be offered such as soap, blankets and&#xD;
      travel reimbursement. All children recruited to the study receive a long-lasting&#xD;
      insecticide-treated bednet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If children have to return to the clinic for unscheduled visits, at each time clinical and&#xD;
      laboratory exams will be conducted as needed. In case of treatment failure at any day after&#xD;
      day 7, a capillary blood sample for PCR will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8 STUDY END POINTS A study endpoint is the point at which a patient will no longer be&#xD;
      followed-up within the context of the efficacy study. Valid study endpoints include treatment&#xD;
      failure, completion of the follow-up period without treatment failure, loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      withdrawal from study (voluntary and involuntary) and protocol violation11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8.1 EARLY TREATMENT FAILURE (ETF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of danger signs or severe malaria on Day 1, Day 2 or Day 3 in presence of&#xD;
           parasitaemia , or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasitaemia on Day 2 higher than Day 0 count irrespective of axillary temperature, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasitaemia on Day 3 with axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parasitaemia on Day 3 ≥ 25% of day 0 count irrespective of axillary temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8.2 LATE CLINICAL FAILURE (LCF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Development of danger signs or severe malaria on any day from Day 4 to Day 42 in the&#xD;
           presence of parasitaemia (without previously meeting any of the criteria of ETF), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of parasitaemia and axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C on any day from Day 4 to Day&#xD;
           42 (without previously meeting any of the criteria of ETF) 3.8.3 LATE PARASITOLOGICAL&#xD;
           FAILURE (LPF)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of parasitaemia and axillary temperature &lt; 37.5°C on any day from Day 7 to Day&#xD;
           42 (without previously meeting any of the criteria of ETF or LCF) 3.8.4 ADEQUATE&#xD;
           CLINICAL AND PARASITOLOGICAL RESPONSE (ACPR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of parasitaemia on Day 42 irrespective of axillary temperature (without&#xD;
           previously meeting any of the criteria of ETF, LCF or LPF) 3.8.5 NON ANALYSABLE&#xD;
           ENDPOINTS A patient's endpoint is not analysable if s/he meets any of the following&#xD;
           criteria after his enrolment in the study. In non-inferiority studies,&#xD;
           Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will often increase the risk of falsely claiming&#xD;
           non-inferiority (type I error) so will not be carried out here24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8.5.1 Protocol violation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure to complete the full study treatment regimen, other than due to vomiting,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erroneous enrolment of the patient (not all inclusion/exclusion criteria respected),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intake of any anti-malarials or antibiotics with anti-malarial activity (cotrimoxazole,&#xD;
           tetracycline except for eye ointment, doxycycline, erythromycin, clindamycin,&#xD;
           azithromycin) as administered by a third party or through self-medication,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Misclassification of the patient's endpoint (due to a laboratory or clinical error)&#xD;
           leading to the unjustified administration of the rescue treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LCF or LPF with missing or undetermined PCR result. 3.8.5.2 Withdrawal:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe malaria occurring on Day 0 after enrolment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of a (mixed or mono-) infection with a non-falciparum species,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting any study dose more than once,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of the study drug severe enough that they require discontinuation of&#xD;
           treatment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalisation for a reason other than malaria, rendering normal follow-up visits&#xD;
           impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Withdrawal of consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.8.6 SAFETY ENDPOINTS The occurrence of any adverse event will be documented. All patients&#xD;
      will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since&#xD;
      the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and&#xD;
      treated appropriately. All serious adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9 STUDY TREATMENTS 3.9.1 REGIMENS TESTED&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Artesunate-amodiaquine fixed dose combination, ASAQ FDC (artesunate-amodiaquine&#xD;
           Winthrop® Sanofi Aventis) given as 1 tablet/day for 3 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Artesunate 25mg / amodiaquine 67.5mg: in children 5 to 8.9kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Artesunate 50mg / amodiaquine 135mg: 1 tab/day in children 9 to 17.9kg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Artesunate 100mg / amodiaquine 270mg: 1 tab/day in children 18 to 34.9kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Artemether 20mg / lumefantrine 120mg co-formulated tablets (Coartem®, Novartis) given as&#xD;
           six twice-daily doses over three days:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  1 tab/dose for children 5 to 14.9kg (total 6 tabs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 tabs/dose for children 15 to 24.9kg (total 12 tabs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 tabs/dose for weight 15-24.9kg (total 12 tabs)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  3 tabs/dose for weight 25-34.9 Kg (total 18 tabs) The second dose of Coartem® will&#xD;
                be given 8 hours (h) after the first dose, given at enrolment. The following doses&#xD;
                will be given 24h, 36h, 48h and 60h after the first dose. Patients will be given a&#xD;
                glass of milk or fatty food, or encouraged to breastfeed before each dose is taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs under study will come from the same batch. All study doses will be supervised. Patients&#xD;
      will be directly observed following intake for 30 minutes. If vomiting occurs, a repeat dose&#xD;
      will be administered. If the repeated dose is also vomited, the child will be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study, and rescue treatment will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to administer the evening doses of Coartem®, a home visitor/village health worker&#xD;
      will go to the patient's home 8h, 32h and 56h after the first dose. Thus recruitment to this&#xD;
      study will only take place in the OPD before 12pm 3.9.2 CONCOMITANT TREATMENT Fever over 38°C&#xD;
      can be treated with paracetamol or acetaminophen, one dose of 20 mg/kg of paracetamol,&#xD;
      followed with 15 mg/kg at 4 to 6 hourly intervals for home treatment. Tepid sponging can be&#xD;
      used to reduce fever before drug intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events requiring treatment can be treated according to local prac¬tice. If there is a&#xD;
      clinical indication for any additional medication during the course of the study, including&#xD;
      medication given to treat an adverse event related to the study medicine, the name of the&#xD;
      medicine, the dosage and the date and time of administration must be recorded on the case&#xD;
      report form. Additional prescriptions may be given on enrolment or during follow-up for&#xD;
      conditions other than malaria, although antibiotics with anti-malarial activity&#xD;
      (cotrimoxazole, tetracycline except for eye ointment, doxycycline, erythromycin, clindamycin,&#xD;
      azithromycin) will not be prescribed unless no equally effective alternatives are available.&#xD;
      Any such prescriptions will be noted carefully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of herbal remedies during the study should be avoided, and partici¬pants should be&#xD;
      encouraged to return to the study site for treatment if they feel unwell. If any herbal&#xD;
      remedies are taken during the study, this should be captured on the case report form, under&#xD;
      'study medication administration'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Haematinics (like ferrous sulphate and folic acid) will be prescribed to ameliorate anaemia&#xD;
      according to WHO25 if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.9.3 RESCUE TREATMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue treatment for malaria shall be initiated immediately according to WHO guidelines25 for&#xD;
      the following cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression to severe malaria on Day 0 after enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vomiting any study dose more than once&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Early treatment failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late clinical failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Late parasitological failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection during follow-up of a non-P. falciparum (mixed or mono-) infection,&#xD;
           irrespective of fever Rescue treatment shall consist of six-dose Coartem® for 3 days for&#xD;
           the children that had received ASAQ as study-treatment or ASAQ for the children that had&#xD;
           received Coartem® as study-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In cases of severe malaria, rescue treatment will be intravenous artesunate at a dose of&#xD;
           2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12 and 24 hours, then once every 24 hrs until the patient can take oral&#xD;
           therapy (This will be followed by 3-days full course of ACT) Non-falciparum species&#xD;
           detected during follow up should be treated with Chloroquine for 3 days in the case of&#xD;
           infection with P. vivax or P. ovale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once rescue treatment is initiated, normal study follow-up ends for the patient, as an&#xD;
      endpoint has been reached. However, patients who receive rescue treatment will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the study clinic at least once, so that the study team can verify whether the&#xD;
      treatment has been effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10 STUDY PROCEDURE 3.10.1 SCREENING AND ENROLMENT (DAY 0) All children aged between 6 and&#xD;
      59 months presenting at the Baraka Health clinic with fever or a history of fever and&#xD;
      positive RDT and with no danger signs (Appendix 5.1.1) will be sent to the study clinic for&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients entering the screening process will be assigned a consecutive screening number.&#xD;
      The screening form (Appendix 5.2) will be used to record the general information and the&#xD;
      clinical observations of each patient being screened. Each patient will be assessed again for&#xD;
      danger signs and signs of severe malaria. Middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will then be&#xD;
      used as a screening tool for malnutrition. An initial clinical assessment will be done&#xD;
      including inclusion and exclusion criteria, previous treatment history (including ingestion&#xD;
      of any anti-malarial drugs), clinical examination and weight-for-height on children with MUAC&#xD;
      &lt;125 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care will be taken to detect early signs of febrile diseases other than malaria, as their&#xD;
      presence will necessitate exclusion from the study. These patients will not be enrolled but&#xD;
      should be treated for both malaria (if they have parasitaemia) and the other infection, as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient meets the clinical inclusion criteria, s/he will be examined for blood&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (P. Falciparum mono-infection, parasite density and haemoglobin levels).&#xD;
      Thick and thin malaria smears will be taken on the same slide in duplicate and one smear will&#xD;
      be stained. At the same time, a capillary blood sample will be taken on Fast Technology for&#xD;
      Analysis (of nucleic acids) or FTA Cards for PCR analysis. The patient will wait for the&#xD;
      thick smear result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If all inclusion criteria are met, the patient will be invited to enrol in the study. The&#xD;
      study purpose will be explained to the parent/caretaker who must be aged 18 years or above&#xD;
      and a written informed consent will be requested (Appendix 5.4). All parents/caretakers will&#xD;
      receive an information sheet containing the study purpose and study team contact details&#xD;
      (Appendix 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the parent/caretaker consents to include the child in the study, a unique patient&#xD;
      identification number will be assigned to the child and a wrist band with the identification&#xD;
      number will be given. Administrative data will be recorded (name of child and&#xD;
      parent/caretaker, gender, age, address and directions) on a Case Record Form (Appendix 5.5).&#xD;
      An appointment schedule will be clearly explained and a follow-up card marked with the unique&#xD;
      patient identification number will be handed out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each unique patient identification number will be randomised to a treatment regimen before&#xD;
      the study starts and this information will be contained in sealed envelopes. The first dose&#xD;
      of the study drug will be dispensed at the health clinic (for children who cannot swallow,&#xD;
      Coartem® tablets will be dissolved, and ASAQ tablets will be crushed in minimal amounts of&#xD;
      water and dispensed by help of a syringe or dropper). Intake will be observed for 30 minutes.&#xD;
      If the child vomits, a resting period of 15 minutes will be observed before attempting a&#xD;
      repeat dose. Any concomitant prescriptions will be collected at the designated pharmacy and&#xD;
      care will be taken to ensure that the instructions on home treatment are clear to the&#xD;
      parent/caretaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being sent home, the patient's parent/caretaker will repeatedly be advised to bring&#xD;
      him/her back the study clinic at any time if symptoms persist or worsen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to administer the evening doses of Coartem®, a home visitor/village health worker&#xD;
      will go to the patient's home 8h, 32h and 56h after the first dose. Thus recruitment to this&#xD;
      study will only take place in the OPD before 12pm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10.2 FOLLOW-UP (DAY 1 TO DAY42) On Days 1 and 2, study drug treatment is continued; the&#xD;
      fourth (Day 1) and sixth (Day 2) Coartem® doses will be administered at home as described&#xD;
      above by a home visitor. However all patients will return to the MSF clinic for a clinical&#xD;
      assessment (including measurement of axillary temperature) and parasitological examination by&#xD;
      malaria slide. All ASAQ and the 3rd and 5th Coartem® doses will be observed during these&#xD;
      clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42, all patients will return to the MSF clinic for a&#xD;
      clinical assessment (including axilliary temperature) and blood smear examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If treatment failure is observed (ETF, LCF or LPF) rescue treatment will be initiated. For&#xD;
      LCF or LPF occurring after Day 7 (since if there is a re-infection it will not lead to&#xD;
      clinical symptoms before day 7 so we can assume it's a recrudescence) a second blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected on FTA cards for PCR analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For unscheduled visits by patients, a clinical assessment will be performed, and a malaria&#xD;
      slide (and blood sample for PCR in case of treatment failure) may be taken if there are signs&#xD;
      and symptoms of possible malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being sent home after each visit, the parent/caretaker will be advised to bring the&#xD;
      patient back to the MSF clinic at any time in case of any illness. In case of emergency&#xD;
      outside of working hours, parents/caretakers will be advised to bring their appointment card&#xD;
      and to inform emergency staff of their child's inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instructions will be given to emergency staff to report all information concerning the event&#xD;
      to the study coordinator the next morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to trace children who fail to return for scheduled visits will be made immediately&#xD;
      by a home visitor to minimise loss to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who fail to return on days 1 and 2 and miss one dose of the treatment will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. After day 3, patients who fail to return on day 7 but are present&#xD;
      on day 6 or 8 (likewise days 13/15, days 20/22, days 27/29, days 34/36 and days 41/43) may&#xD;
      still be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.10.3 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight will be measured to the nearest 100 g on a hanging scale (Salter) properly&#xD;
           calibrated with only undergarments kept on the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height will be measured on a wooden height board, by asking the child to stand if s/he&#xD;
           is &gt; 85 cm, or by laying the child horizontally if s/he is &lt; 85 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MUAC will be measured on the left arm, at the mid-point between the elbow and the&#xD;
           shoulder and will be recorded to the nearest mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oedema will be assessed by 3 second thumb pressure on the dorsal surface of both feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Axillary temperature will be measured with a calibrated digital thermometer graduated in&#xD;
           Celsius, with a precision of 0.1°C. If the result is &lt;36.0°C, the measurement will be&#xD;
           repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11 LABORATORY TECHNIQUES 3.11.1 MALARIA SLIDES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thick and thin smears will be prepared on the same slide and stained in 10% Giemsa solution&#xD;
      (pH 7.2) for 10-15 minutes. All smears must be read to 100 fields before they can be declared&#xD;
      negative. Species will be confirmed on the thin smear. Quantification of P. falciparum&#xD;
      asexual parasitaemia on the thick smear will be performed according to the WHO protocol26.&#xD;
      Parasites will be counted against at least 200 white blood cells/leucocytes (WBC), and the&#xD;
      parasite density (expressed in parasites per µL of blood) will be calculated assuming a&#xD;
      normal level of 8000 WBC/µL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parasite density (/µL) = number of parasites counted x 8000 / number of WBC counted If 500&#xD;
      parasites are counted before reaching 200 WBC, the counting will be stopped at the end of&#xD;
      that field and the parasitaemia will be calculated with the above formula. If less than 10&#xD;
      parasites are counted after 200 WBC, the counting will be extended to 500 white cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presence or absence of P. falciparum gametocytes does not influence endpoint classification,&#xD;
      but will be recorded carefully and systematically. If a smear contains gametocytes but not&#xD;
      trophozoites (asexual parasites) it will be considered negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two qualified microscopists will read all the slides independently, and parasite densities&#xD;
      will be calculated by averaging the two counts. Blood smears with discordant results&#xD;
      (differences between the two microscopists in species diagnosis, in parasite density of &gt;50%&#xD;
      or in the presence of parasites) will be re-examined by a third, independent microscopist and&#xD;
      parasite density will be calculated by averaging the two closest counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood smears will be destroyed once data analysis is complete. 3.11.2 HAEMOGLOBIN&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT The HemoCue B-Haemoglobin analyser (Ängelholm, Sweden) apparatus will be used to&#xD;
      measure haemoglobin on Day 0 or any other day if clinically warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11.3 PCR GENOTYPING PCR genotyping analysis will be performed in order to distinguish true&#xD;
      recrudescence (same parasite strain) from a newly acquired infection (different parasite&#xD;
      strain). Capillary blood samples for PCR will be collected for all patients at enrolment and&#xD;
      during follow-up in case of LCF or LPF after Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 drops of capillary blood will be collected on FTA cards, stored individually in zip-lock&#xD;
      bags with desiccant, and kept away from humidity, excessive heat and light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The genotyping will be performed at the department of Medical Microbiology, at the Academic&#xD;
      Medical Center (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), under the supervision of Prof. Dr Tom van Gool.&#xD;
      A material transfer agreement will be signed. The genotyping procedure will be based on&#xD;
      comparison of the two-locus genotype resulting from expression of the P. falciparum MSP-1 and&#xD;
      MSP-2 gene alleles in pre- (enrolment) and post-treatment (failure) samples27. Pre- and&#xD;
      post-treatment pairs with similar genotype will be classified as recrudescence (true&#xD;
      failure), and pairs with different genotype will be classified as re-infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11.4 QUALITY CONTROL OF MALARIA DIAGNOSIS Before the study starts, correct laboratory&#xD;
      procedures, such as staining technique, staining time, dilution and data reporting will be&#xD;
      established. A blinded re-reading of routine malaria slides (of which at least 20 will be&#xD;
      positive) will be performed and discordances reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An external quality control, with a reference parasitological laboratory, is envisaged at the&#xD;
      end of the study on a random sample of 20 positives slides collected between Day 0 and Day&#xD;
      42.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.11.5 MOLECULAR MARKERS FOR ANTI-MALARIAL DRUG RESISTANCE Currently there are no clear&#xD;
      molecular markers associated with decreased susceptibility to ACTs. Therefore we do not&#xD;
      anticipate at this moment to study molecular markers of ACT resistance. However a region of&#xD;
      chromosome 13 on the P. falciparum genome that is linked to decreased parasite clearance&#xD;
      rates in response to ACTs has been identified28. If putative markers of artemisinin&#xD;
      resistance are identified in the next 5 years the FTA cards from this study should be made&#xD;
      available to the World Wide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) for analysis. Permission&#xD;
      to store the FTA cards at -70⁰C at the Amsterdam Medical Centre, The Netherlands for 5 years&#xD;
      after termination of the study, and their use for determination of molecular markers of&#xD;
      resistance will therefore be requested in the informed consent forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.12 DATA ANALYSIS 3.12.1 DATA MANAGEMENT All case record forms (CRF) will be double-entered&#xD;
      daily using EpiData 3.1 software (Odense, Denmark), merged (with verification of&#xD;
      inconsistencies) and analysed using Stata (Stata Corporation, USA) statistical software. An&#xD;
      interim analysis of early treatment failure will be carried out once all the participants&#xD;
      have reached day 3 and their blood smear results are available. This is to assess at an early&#xD;
      stage whether the non-inferiority hypothesis regarding early treatment failure should be&#xD;
      rejected. At the end of the study analysis, all CRFs and other source data (consent forms,&#xD;
      laboratory registers, screening forms, etc) will be stored securely at the capital level.&#xD;
      Data will also be submitted to the WWARN database for the international monitoring of&#xD;
      anti-malarial drug resistance. A copy of CRFs will also be stored for at least 5 years at&#xD;
      MSF-OCA in Amsterdam. The principal investigator is responsible for keeping all screening&#xD;
      forms, the case report form and the completed subject identification code list in a secure&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.12.2 ANALYSIS PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of the study : numbers of patients screened, number of patients with a P.&#xD;
           falciparum infection, number of patients infected with other Plasmodium species, number&#xD;
           of patients excluded (and, if possible, reasons for non-eligibility), numbers of&#xD;
           included, randomised and analysable patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Validity of the study : results on internal and external laboratory quality control, %&#xD;
           of overall non analysable patients and % of overall non analysable patients and % loss&#xD;
           to follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characteristics of included patients: age, sex, weight-for-height, previous intake of&#xD;
           anti-malarials, axillary temperature, parasite density, gametocyte carriage,&#xD;
           haemoglobin. Chi-square test will be performed to test the adequacy of randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Description of study endpoints: numbers of ETF, LCF, LPF and ACPR at Day 42. Similar&#xD;
           outcomes would be assessed at Day 28 for comparison with Day 42 efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events: the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the&#xD;
           patients included in the study for each drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PCR genotyping analysis: number of samples analysed, number of recrudescence episodes&#xD;
           and re-infections, number of mixed and undetermined results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy estimates: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis methods will be used with and without&#xD;
           genotyping adjustment. Patients withdrawn, lost to follow-up or with re-infections are&#xD;
           censored from the analysis on that day. Patients with a recurrence of parasitaemia, but&#xD;
           with missing or undetermined PCR results should be censored on the last visit when the&#xD;
           malaria smear was found to be negative (as it is known that the patient was 'cured' at&#xD;
           that point).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data analysis: Per-protocol analysis followed by a survival analysis using the&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier method. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed above, patients&#xD;
           will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or&#xD;
           if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to re-infection with P. vivax. P.&#xD;
           malariae or P. ovale. The cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day&#xD;
           28/42, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected for each drug; and the proportion of early&#xD;
           treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate&#xD;
           clinical and parasitological response at day 28/42, with 95% confidence intervals,&#xD;
           PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected will be calculated 3.12.3 STUDY REPORT At the end of&#xD;
           the study, the principal investigator will submit a report on the study and its main&#xD;
           outcome. This report will be shared with the national malaria control programme and the&#xD;
           Ministry of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study results will be presented at appropriate scientific meetings and potentially&#xD;
      published in a peer-reviewed journal. Data will also be submitted to the WWARN database for&#xD;
      the international monitoring of anti-malarial drug resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study results will be shared with the community leaders, and in patient meetings. Results&#xD;
      will be displayed in lay-language in the health clinic.&#xD;
