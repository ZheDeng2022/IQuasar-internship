  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if partially filling the bladder after&#xD;
      laparoscopic/robotic gynecologic surgery (for benign disease) shortens the time required to&#xD;
      spontaneously void for patients to determine if this subsequently shortens patient stay times&#xD;
      in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) following surgery. This intervention would be&#xD;
      compared to the current standard of care, which involves removing the patient's Foley&#xD;
      catheter with an empty bladder and then giving the patient up to 6 hours to void in the PACU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing laparoscopic/robotic hysterectomy or myomectomy who meet the study&#xD;
      criteria will be contacted by the research assistant at a pre-operative visit. The risks and&#xD;
      benefits of participation will be explained to them. If they choose to participate they will&#xD;
      sign the consent form at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the surgery, the research coordinator will open a sealed envelope containing&#xD;
      the patient's assignment to partial bladder filling or no bladder filling. The research&#xD;
      coordinator will then notify the surgeon via secure phone call or secure messaging service&#xD;
      and the patient/subject will have their bladder partially filled or completely emptied as&#xD;
      relayed to the surgeon at the end of the procedure in the Operating Room, unless there are&#xD;
      issues of patient safety or operative complications. In the patients who are chosen for&#xD;
      partial bladder filling, the bladder will be back-filled with 150 cc of normal saline and&#xD;
      then the Foley catheter will be removed at the end of the procedure. In patients who have no&#xD;
      bladder filling, the bladder will be completely emptied and then the Foley catheter will be&#xD;
      removed. One of the providers who perform the gynecological surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      responsible for back-filling or completely emptying the bladder with the Foley catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed in the PACU to determine the time it takes for them to void.&#xD;
      The will also be followed for any complications until they are four weeks post surgery. The&#xD;
      electronic medical record will be examined to see if they have any complications reported at&#xD;
      their post-operative visits or any readmissions to the hospital.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hysterectomy or myomectomy planned for a benign gynecologic reason. (This means that&#xD;
             there is no evidence of, or concern for, malignancy in the cervix, uterus, tubes or&#xD;
             ovaries. Benign gynecologic reasons to have a hysterectomy include fibroids, abnormal&#xD;
             uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and pelvic pain. Benign reason for myomectomy would&#xD;
             be fibroids)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is scheduled to have surgery with one of the minimally invasive gynecologic&#xD;
             surgeons at George Washington University Hospital (GWUH)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is planned for a robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy (RA-TLH) or&#xD;
             a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) or robotic assisted or laparoscopic&#xD;
             myomectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is capable of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The patient has no baseline urinary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Hysterectomy or myomectomy is indicated for malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Hysterectomy or myomectomy is not being performed via robotic or laparoscopic method&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient is not capable of providing informed consent&#xD;
