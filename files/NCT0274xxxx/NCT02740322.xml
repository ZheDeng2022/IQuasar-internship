  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sensitivity and specificity of the Hum Test is being investigated in it's ability to&#xD;
      detect conductive hearing loss. The hum test is simply elicited by asking the subject to hum&#xD;
      to him or herself for a few seconds at both a high and low pitch that is comfortable for the&#xD;
      subject. The subject is then asked if the hum was heard on one side more than the other (left&#xD;
      or right), or if the sound was equal on both sides. To simulate conductive hearing loss, ear&#xD;
      plugs will be placed in one of the subject's ears. We will elicit the hum test as well as the&#xD;
      standard Weber test and audiogram across two conditions, with an ear plug and without an ear&#xD;
      plug. From this, it is hoped to assess how the Hum Test compares to the audiogram (gold&#xD;
      standard) in detecting conductive hearing loss as well as how it compares to the standard&#xD;
      Weber test. If the Hum Test demonstrates strong sensitivity and specificity in detecting&#xD;
      conductive hearing loss, it could have application as being utilized as an alternative to the&#xD;
      standard Weber test, or in a setting where a formal physical examination may not yet be&#xD;
      possible but where the etiology of a patient's hearing change could be quickly assessed&#xD;
      remotely and thus the urgency of intervention/ consultation could then be determined.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is presumed that the Hum Test works similarly to the Weber Test, where bone conduction of&#xD;
      the skull is elicited to determine if a change in hearing is conductive or sensorineural in&#xD;
      nature. Because the hum test is frequently employed in clinical practice yet its validation&#xD;
      has yet to be demonstrated, investigation is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine and compare the Hum Test, Weber Test, and audiogram in their ability to detect and&#xD;
      identify hearing loss, hearing loss will be simulated with the use of ear plugs (mimicking&#xD;
      conductive hearing loss). Subjects will serve as their own control as these tests will be&#xD;
      conducted with and without ear plugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study data will be maintained using an online, password protected storage system. No&#xD;
      identifiable information will be collected or stored (i.e. name, DOB, etc.). Limited&#xD;
      demographic information will be collected for analysis purposes such as age and gender.&#xD;

    <description>The subject will be brought into an exam room. The subject will then be asked to hum for a few seconds in a low pitch. They will then be asked if the nose was heard more so in one ear compared to the other. The subject will then be asked to hum for a few seconds in a high pitch. They will then be asked again if the noise was heard more so in one ear compared to the other.</description>
