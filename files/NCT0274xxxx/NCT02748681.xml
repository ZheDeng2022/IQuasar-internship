      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meta-analyses report a high prevalence of moderate to severe sleep apnea of more than 50% in&#xD;
      stroke patients, with adherence rates for CPAP therapy of only 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether CPAP adherence in stroke patients&#xD;
      with obstructive sleep apnea can be improved by a CPAP training strategy during&#xD;
      rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to compare recording quality as well as subjective and objective&#xD;
      sleep data of non-attended level III polygraphy, polysomnography and telemetric CPAP data in&#xD;
      the management of sleep apnea in stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further the investigators aim to study changes in nocturnal systolic blood pressure due to&#xD;
      CPAP therapy with the pulse transit time method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators intend to study the relationship between CPAP compliance, sleep&#xD;
      and medical and neurorehabilition outcome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial on standard CPAP treatment as compared&#xD;
      with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring system in stroke patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Neurorehabilitation center in Vienna, Austria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: Adult subacute (1 to 12 months post stroke) stroke patients 18-70 yrs of age) with&#xD;
      moderate to severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/hr) determined by non-attended&#xD;
      polysomnography (AHI) ≥ 15/hr of sleep) or level III polygraphy (AHI) ≥ 30/hr of&#xD;
      out-of-center sleep testing (OCST), who undergo successful CPAP training and titration (goal&#xD;
      AHI&lt; 10) at the neurorehabilitation unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to either standard care with an autotitrating CPAP&#xD;
      device or an autotitrating CPAP device that transmits physiologic information (i.e.,&#xD;
      adherence, air leak, residual AHI) daily to a website that will be reviewed by their homecare&#xD;
      provider. If any problems are identified, the patient will be contacted by his homecare&#xD;
      provider by telephone. Neurologists performing sleep and neurological scoring will be blinded&#xD;
      to the randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Recording of the different measuring systems, subjective and objective sleep&#xD;
      quality, CPAP adherence after 3 months and 1 year in hours used per night, systolic BP&#xD;
      determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point calibration of the&#xD;
      pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring system (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany)&#xD;
      and neurorehabilitation outcome parameters as Barthel Index, Timed Up and Go Test.&#xD;

      The investigators intend to perform a single-blind, mono-center, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      on standard CPAP treatment as compared with CPAP treatment with a telemedicine monitoring&#xD;
      system in stroke patients with moderate to severe OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepting CPAP therapy after successful titration will be randomized to either a&#xD;
      standard care or a telemedicine group (1:1 ratio) and will subsequently be informed about the&#xD;
      study arm by their homecare provider. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics&#xD;
      Board of the public health services of Vienna.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent for all examinations will be obtained upon patients' admission. If&#xD;
      patients agree to undergo CPAP monitoring, further informed consent will be obtained. The&#xD;
      study will be performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines of the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki, 1964, as amended in Tokyo, 1975, Venice, 1983, Hong Kong, 1989, and Somerset West,&#xD;
      1996.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Sleep Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the four to eight weeks of neurorehabilitation, each stroke patient ( 19-70 yrs of age)&#xD;
      will be offered a nocturnal respirographic screening evaluation of SA (see study flow chart).&#xD;
      Within the study period the investigators expect to screen 170 patients per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of sleep apnea and referral to CPAP training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA and referral to CPAP training will be based on an AHI ≥ 15/h sleep, as recommended by an&#xD;
      international task force on the standardization of definitions for sleep-related breathing&#xD;
      disorders to indicate moderate SA .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If screening with type-3 polygraphy reveals an AHI ≥ 15 and ≤ 30/h of recording time or if&#xD;
      subjective sleep time in the concomitant sleep log is less than 4 hours, non-attended&#xD;
      polysomnography will be performed to confirm the diagnosis of SA. If type-3 polygraphy shows&#xD;
      an AHI of ≥ 30/h recording time, the patient will directly be referred to CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography and polygraphy will be performed by a trained staff member using the&#xD;
      Somnomedics Diagnostic Systems (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany). Patients will be studied in their&#xD;
      hospital beds. Polygraphic and polysomnographic all-night recordings according to AASM&#xD;
      standard criteria will be obtained between approximately 22.00 (lights-out) and 6.00 am&#xD;
      (buzzer or alarm clock). Thus, time in bed (TIB) is fixed with 7.5 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polygraphic recording includes nasal air flow, snore train, thoracic and abdominal effort,&#xD;
      oxyhemoglobin saturation, and determination of the body position. Recordings will be used in&#xD;
      further investigations if at least 4 h of data can be obtained. EEG sleep data will include 6&#xD;
      EEG channels (F3-A2, F4-A1, C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2, O2-A1) according to the 10/20 system, 2&#xD;
      electrooculogram (EOG) channels (left/right), submental electromyogram (EMG) and tibialis&#xD;
      anterior electromyogram from both legs (EMG) and will be scored manually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic BP will be determined by means of a non-linear algorithm and an individual one-point&#xD;
      calibration of the pulse transit time obtained with a cuff-based BP measuring device&#xD;
      (SOMNOmedics GmbH, Germany). The number of systolic rises (defined as &gt;15mmHg) in relation to&#xD;
      respiratory events and the maximum systolic blood pressure will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete the Self-Assessment Scale for Sleep and Awakening Quality&#xD;
      (SSA) according to Saletu et al. (1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polygraphic data recordings will be manually scored for apneas and hypopneas according to the&#xD;
      criteria developed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). For scoring an event as&#xD;
      a hypopnea, a 30% reduction of nasal flow associated with an oxygen desaturation of at least&#xD;
      3% is required. The AHI is defined as the sum of all apneas and hypopneas occurring per hour&#xD;
      of recording time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPAP Protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients referred to CPAP therapy will receive a 60-min PAP training. A nasal or oronasal&#xD;
      mask will be fitted to the patient's face by the PAP coordinator of our center, who is a&#xD;
      trained respiratory therapist and ESRS-certified somnologist (MS) with many years of&#xD;
      experience in sleep apnea patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be provided with an AirSense™ 10 AutoSet CPAP (Resmed) including a humifdifier.&#xD;
      This auto-titrating device monitors patients' airflow and adjusts pressure automatically to&#xD;
      eliminate sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AirSense 10 AutoSet is able to differentiate between obstructive and central apneas. It&#xD;
      is set to auto-titrate at pressures between 6 and 13 cm H2O, which reflects our current&#xD;
      clinical practice. Pressure limits can be increased up to 16 cm H2O, but will be decreased to&#xD;
      the smallest range leading to a normalized AHI in order to avoid overtitration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients accepting CPAP therapy after the training session will be motivated to use it for at&#xD;
      least 4 &gt; hours sleep/night over one week. Additional nocturnal pulse oximetry will be&#xD;
      obtained. Patients will be coached by trained nurses during the night. Relatives will also be&#xD;
      trained in using the humidifier and cleaning the mask and the humidifier chamber. Data card&#xD;
      AHI, oximetry and leakage information will be collected every day. Pressure limits can be&#xD;
      increased or decreased to improve patient comfort. If patients consider the interface&#xD;
      uncomfortable, it may be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week, patients with a median CPAP use of &gt;4/hours will undergo unattended CPAP&#xD;
      polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of CPAP titration is graded as follows: optimal (obstructive AHI ≤ 5/h, supine&#xD;
      REM sleep on the treatment pressure; desaturation index≤ 5/h of sleep), good (obstructive AHI&#xD;
      &lt; 10/h, REM sleep on the treatment pressure, desaturation index≤ 10/h), adequate (AHI &lt; 10/h,&#xD;
      supine NREM sleep on the treatment pressure, desaturation index≤ 10/h). A persisting central&#xD;
      AHI &lt; 5 will be tolerated. If none of these criteria are met, patients will be referred to&#xD;
      conventional attended CPAP polysomnograpy and excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who chose to participate in the telemetric study part will be asked to sign informed&#xD;
      consent and will be randomized to either a standard care or a telemedicine group (1:1 ratio)&#xD;
      using sequentially numbered envelopes prepared by the CPAP homecare provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving their prescribed CPAP device by their homecare provider they will be informed&#xD;
      in which group they are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff performing sleep recordings and clinical ratings will be blinded to the study&#xD;
      arm. In case of treatment pressure changes doctors will be informed about the study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both study arms patients will be asked to complete the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) SSA (Self-Assessment Scale for Sleep and Awakening Quality&#xD;
      according to Saletu et al. 1987) QoL (Quality of Life Index according to Mezzich et al.) BQ&#xD;
      (Berlin Questionnaire) PAP Satisfaction Questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      NIH Stroke Scale (National Institute of Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders&#xD;
      and Stroke) TUG (Timed Up and Go Test) NHPT (Nine Hole Peg Test) BI (Barthel Index) Moca Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Monitoring after Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by their homecare provider 2 days after receiving their CPAP&#xD;
      device and will be asked about progress and adherence,as well as about any problems that&#xD;
      might have occurred. After 3 months of therapy, patients will return to the hospital to see&#xD;
      the PAP coordinator and their doctor. Data on a variety of physiological variables, including&#xD;
      PAP adherence, PAP pressure applied, mask leakage, and residual respiratory events, will be&#xD;
      downloaded from their CPAP devices. Any problems with treatment may be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a number of clinical scales and answer a variety of survey&#xD;
      questions concerning side effects and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-attended PSG will be performed at the patients' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine Like in standard care, patients will receive an AirSense™ 10 AutoSet CPAP. In&#xD;
      addition, the telemedicine module of the PAP device will be activated by the homecare&#xD;
      provider. The module will be programmed to send physiological information (PAP adherence, PAP&#xD;
      pressure applied, mask leakage and residual respiratory events) to a web-based database via a&#xD;
      GPRS module every day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by the homecare provider after 2 days and will be asked about&#xD;
      progress and compliance as well as about any problems. The PAP coordinator at the homecare&#xD;
      provider will review the downloaded information every morning except on weekends and holidays&#xD;
      and will contact the patient if any of the following occur: mask leakage of the 95 percentile&#xD;
      &gt; 24 L/min, &lt; 4 h of use for two consecutive nights, AHI &gt; 10 events/h, and 90th percentile&#xD;
      of pressure &gt; 16 cm H2O. The homecare provider will call the patient or his/her relatives and&#xD;
      will ask about symptoms such as dry mouth, mask issues, discomfort with the device, or any&#xD;
      other problems. If the only issue is low adherence due to lack of motivation, the homecare&#xD;
      provider will encourage the patient to use PAP. Should there be any other problems, the&#xD;
      homecare provider will discuss the case with the PAP coordinator (the same person that sees&#xD;
      the patients in the standard arm) and arrange for the patient to talk to or see the PAP&#xD;
      coordinator, depending on the patient's responses and the physiological data obtained.&#xD;
      Specific interventions may be performed to improve compliance that are considered standard at&#xD;
      the hospital (e.g., different mask, chin strap, modifications of pressure settings,&#xD;
      modifications of humidifier settings, saline nasal sprays).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 3 months of therapy, patients will return to the hospital to see their doctor and the&#xD;
      data obtained will be reviewed (including CPAP pressure, mask leakage, residual respiratory&#xD;
      events, and compliance). Any problems with treatment may be addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like in the standard arm, polysomography will be performed at the patients' homes and&#xD;
      clinical scales will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Spent with Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time our research coordinator or PAP coordinator spends with patients will be recorded&#xD;
      and written in a daily log sheet. This includes time spent fitting masks, problem solving,&#xD;
      talking with patients on the phone, meeting with patients, and reviewing downloaded or&#xD;
      transmitted information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed in SPSS version 10 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL,&#xD;
      USA). All P-values are two-sided and values &lt; 0.05 are considered statistically significant.&#xD;
      To examine and compare demographic and test characteristics at inclusion, chi-sqare test,&#xD;
      t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test for independent samples will be used according to&#xD;
      distribution, which will be examined with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      PAP adherence after 3 months (min used per day). To calculate the number of participants&#xD;
      needed for an effect size larger than 0,80 as proposed by Cohen (Statistical power analysis&#xD;
      for behavioural science. 1988), the investigators based a power calculation on the results of&#xD;
      the study by Fox et al. in patients with sleep apnea, comparing telemedicine versus standard&#xD;
      CPAP treatment over 3 months. The result of this calculation was 11 patients in one group.&#xD;
      Considering patients who will discontinue CPAP treatment, the investigators aim to include 55&#xD;
      patients in the randomisation process. Based on previous data the investigators consider that&#xD;
      168 patients will have to be included in the screening process for sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables will be correlated with compliance data. Therefore the spearman rank&#xD;
      correlation coefficient and the pearson correlation coefficient will be used. Blood pressure&#xD;
      data at baseline and after 3 months of CPAP treatment will be compared.&#xD;
