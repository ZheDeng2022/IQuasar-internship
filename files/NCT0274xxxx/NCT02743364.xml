    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well simvastatin works in reducing pancreatitis&#xD;
      (the inflammation of the pancreas) in patients with pancreatitis that occurs more than once&#xD;
      (recurrent), has worsened quickly (acute), or has persisted or progressed over a long period&#xD;
      of time (chronic). Simvastatin may decrease the inflammation of the pancreas by modulating&#xD;
      the immune response responsible for inflammation. It is not yet known if simvastatin may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for pancreatitis.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo on the change in&#xD;
      secretin-stimulated peak bicarbonate concentration in the pancreatic fluid at 6 months&#xD;
      post-treatment in patients with a history of at least two episodes of acute pancreatitis in&#xD;
      the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of a simvastatin intervention versus placebo at 6 months from&#xD;
      baseline (study visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) on: Ia. Change in the endoscopic ultrasound score (EUS). Ib. Change in serum and&#xD;
      pancreatic fluid levels of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ic. Change in pancreatitis-related readmissions. Id. Change in quality of life score as&#xD;
      measured by the Quality of Life (QLQ)-Core (C)30 and QLQ-Pancreatic modification&#xD;
      (PAN)28(Chronic Pancreatitis [CP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 90 days.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least two episodes of acute pancreatitis in the past 12 months; acute pancreatitis&#xD;
             is defined any 2 of the following: (1) typical upper abdominal pain; (2) elevation in&#xD;
             serum amylase or lipase &gt;= 3 times upper limit of normal; (3) features of acute&#xD;
             pancreatitis on cross-sectional imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 1 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 2,500/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/microliter&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase&#xD;
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])&#xD;
             =&lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN; patients whose AST/ALT levels normalize by screen 2 after&#xD;
             an abnormal test will be included in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test result&#xD;
             prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of simvastatin on the developing human fetus at the recommended&#xD;
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason and because statins are known to be&#xD;
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study&#xD;
             physician immediately; it is not known whether simvastatin is excreted into human&#xD;
             milk; however, a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast&#xD;
             milk; because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing&#xD;
             infants, women who receive treatment with simvastatin should not breastfeed their&#xD;
             infants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             and medical release&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with trial protocol and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or current use of statin medication, or current use of gemfibrozil,&#xD;
             cyclosporine, danazol, lomitapide, verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone, amiodarone,&#xD;
             amlodipine, ranolazine, or strong cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide&#xD;
             4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole,&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir,&#xD;
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone, or cobicistat-containing&#xD;
             products)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic myopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to compounds&#xD;
             of similar chemical or biologic composition to simvastatin (i.e., other statin&#xD;
             medications)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
             because simvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with simvastatin,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with simvastatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of gallstones and hypertriglyceridemia (level greater than 800 mg/dl) that&#xD;
             requires medical or surgical intervention; note: we will include patients who had an&#xD;
             independent episode of pancreatitis after a cholecystectomy, but exclude patients who&#xD;
             are candidates for cholecystectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (at any time)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active malignancy in the past 2 years (excluding basal/squamous cell skin&#xD;
             cancer or prostate cancer with a Gleason score 6 or less)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active infection with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness, such as known psychiatric disorders or substance abuse (i.e.,&#xD;
             average alcohol consumption of more than 5 drinks per day), which in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigators would compromise either the patient or the integrity of the data&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory (lab) results do not meet inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent pancreatitis episode is iatrogenic (endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
             cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] induced)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced chronic pancreatitis as determined by the following criteria: EUS score&#xD;
             greater than 6, calcifications in combination with atrophy and/or dilation of &gt;= 5 mm,&#xD;
             or evidence of advanced chronic pancreatitis by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) results in the past 12 months&#xD;
