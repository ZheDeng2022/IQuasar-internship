  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat patients with the combination of sorafenib and irinotecan.&#xD;
      Patients with relapsed, recurrent, refractory, or high risk malignancies whose tumors possess&#xD;
      a non-synonymous mutation in Raf, PDGFR, VEGFR, Flt-3, KIT, JAK, STAT, RAS, MEK, or ERK will&#xD;
      be eligible for the study. Very few phase 2 clinical trials have been performed in pediatrics&#xD;
      using targeted agents in combination with conventional chemotherapy agents. Furthermore,&#xD;
      since some combinations such as the combination of this study (sorafenib and irinotecan) have&#xD;
      shown additive/synergistic effects in preclinical studies, therapy selecting for those&#xD;
      patients who possess mutations targeted by the TKI of the study, may unveil activity that has&#xD;
      not been previously observed. Thus, the investigators hope to determine whether the addition&#xD;
      of additive/synergistic chemotherapy will increase efficacy of the targeted agent and/or&#xD;
      increase tumor susceptibility to the targeted agent, resulting in increased anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
