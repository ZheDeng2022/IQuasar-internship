  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a double-blind, between-subject, placebo controlled design study, the researchers aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the intranasal OXT (40IU) treatment on rating response after being liked or&#xD;
      disliked in healthy male subjects. All subjects completed a range of questionnaires measuring&#xD;
      personality and affective traits and levels of anxiety: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule&#xD;
      (PANAS) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Cheek and&#xD;
      Buss shyness Scale (CBSS),Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy Quotient(EQ) before&#xD;
      self-administration.Study participants were led to believe that other participants had formed&#xD;
      an opinion on their likability based on their appearance in a photograph and they passively&#xD;
      viewed the responses (like or dislike) from 'other participants'. After that, they rated&#xD;
      'other participants' about likeability (how much do you like the person), accuracy (have you&#xD;
      seen the person), feeling (how good do you feel), and tendency (how much would do like have&#xD;
      him/her as a friend). Likeability, tendency, feeling and accuracy were included into analysis&#xD;
      as dependent variables.&#xD;
