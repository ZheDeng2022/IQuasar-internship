  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of IL-2 when given in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab to patients with advanced melanoma. Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cells&#xD;
      to melanoma cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving aldesleukin and pembrolizumab may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase Ib: To determine the safety and side effects of increasing doses of IL-2 in&#xD;
           combination with pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Once the maximum tolerated dose of IL-2 is determined, additional patients&#xD;
           will be treated to determine if it is effective against the cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine an optimal tolerated dose (OTD) of aldesleukin (interleukin [IL]-2) that is&#xD;
      effective and tolerable in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize the efficacy of the OTD of IL-2 in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety of IL-2 in doses ranging up to the Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA)- approved dose when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize clinical endpoints, including overall survival, progression-free&#xD;
      survival, and complete response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize immune parameters in the blood and tumor microenvironment and cellular and&#xD;
      molecular features of the tumor tissue that correlate with response to combination therapy&#xD;
      for study as potential predictive biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 every 3 weeks and&#xD;
      aldesleukin IV every 8 hours for up to 14 doses at weeks 4, 7, 16, 19, 28, and 31 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months up to 10 years.&#xD;
