      Patient-specific instrumentation guides have previously been used to improving surgical&#xD;
      accuracy and ease of implantation during Total Knee Replacement but have received less&#xD;
      attention for implanting Unicompartmental Knee Replacement. The aim of this prospective study&#xD;
      is to compare the accuracy of implantation and functional outcome of mobile bearing medial&#xD;
      Unicompartmental Knee Replacement implanted with and without patient specific instrumentation&#xD;
      by experienced knee surgeons.&#xD;

      The aim of this prospective study is to compare the accuracy of implantation and functional&#xD;
      outcome of mobile bearing medial Unicompartmental Knee Replacements implanted with and&#xD;
      without patient specific instrumentation by experienced Unicompartmental Knee Replacement&#xD;
      surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-centre parallel-design trial was conducted between March 2012 and March 2014 at&#xD;
      the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Four expert knee surgeons performed all of the&#xD;
      procedures in this study. Patients who were being placed on the waiting list for a medial&#xD;
      Unicompartmental Knee Replacement, and met the entry criteria for the trial, were asked to&#xD;
      see if they would be willing to receive further information about participation in the study.&#xD;
      They were provided with a study information leaflet that they could read in their own time. A&#xD;
      member of the research team subsequently contacted the patients in order to determine if they&#xD;
      would agree to take part in the study and enrolled them onto the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to either Patient Specific Instrumentation, or Conventional&#xD;
      Instrumentation group. There were 23 patients (23 knees) in the Patient Specific&#xD;
      Instrumentation group and 22 patients (22 knees) in the Conventional Instrumentation group.&#xD;
      Randomization was performed using sealed opaque envelopes. Concealment from operating&#xD;
      surgeons and patients was not possible owing to the surgeon needing to confirm the Patient&#xD;
      Specific Instrumentation plans, and the patients undergoing pre-operative MRI scans. Patient&#xD;
      Specific Instrumentation group patients underwent an MRI scan using the protocol outlined by&#xD;
      the Patient Specific Instrumentation manufacturers to plan development of the Patient&#xD;
      Specific Instrumentation guides. The preliminary plan indicating prosthesis size,&#xD;
      positioning, alignment, and proposed bone resection levels was reviewed by the surgeons who&#xD;
      accepted the default preoperative plans unless gross errors were present. The patient&#xD;
      specific cutting blocks were then manufactured and sent for sterilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operative Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received a mobile bearing medial Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement via a&#xD;
      minimally invasive approach under general anaesthetic, and high thigh tourniquet.&#xD;
      Intra-operatively, the bone cuts were made through the Patient Specific Instrumentation&#xD;
      guides without the use of any intra or extra-medullary instrumentation on the femoral side&#xD;
      but with a tibial extramedullary guide for some cases. The subsequent milling process and all&#xD;
      soft tissue balancing was performed manually in the standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, the need to have a blood transfusion, and the change haemoglobin levels&#xD;
      were also recorded. Oxygen saturation levels over the first 24 hours post surgery were also&#xD;
      recorded. Screened anteroposterior and lateral post-operative radiographs were performed&#xD;
      prior to discharge. Patients attended the physiotherapy ward discharge clinic at six weeks. A&#xD;
      further clinical review was performed at 12 months at which point Oxford Knee Scores were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure was radiological assessment of component positioning. (See&#xD;
      Outcome measures section for more detail)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated from a previous study that used similar radiological&#xD;
      assessments to compare unicompartmental knee replacements performed using conventional&#xD;
      instrumentation, with those performed using computer navigation. In this study, the standard&#xD;
      deviation of the tibia varus/valgus angle for the control group was 3.6°. Assuming a minimum&#xD;
      clinically important difference of 3°, the standard mean difference would be 0.8. Hence with&#xD;
      a power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05, a total sample size of 44 patients (22 in each&#xD;
      group) was required.&#xD;

            <groups_desc>The sample size was calculated from a previous study that used similar radiological assessments to compare OUKAs performed using conventional instrumentation and computer navigation. In this study, the standard deviation of the tibia varus/valgus angle for the control group was 3.6°. Assuming a minimum clinically important difference of 3°, the SMD would be 0.8. Hence with a power of 0.8 and significance level of 0.05, a total sample size of 44 patients (22 in each group) was required.</groups_desc>
