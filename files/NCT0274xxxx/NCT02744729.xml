      This is an open-label single photon emission computed tomography / computed tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT/CT) study to investigate the safety and diagnostic performance of&#xD;
      99mTc-HYNIC-3PEG4-E[c(RGDfK)2) (99mTc-3PRGD2) in esophagus cancer patients. A single dose of&#xD;
      nearly 11.1 MBq/kg body weight of 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤ 20 µg 3PRGD2) will be intravenously&#xD;
      injected into the patients in suspicion of esophagus cancer. Visual and semiquantitative&#xD;
      method will be used to assess the whole-body planar and thoracic SPECT/CT images. Any adverse&#xD;
      events will be collected from the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Integrin αvβ3 is an important member of integrin receptor family and expressed preferentially&#xD;
      on the activated endothelial cells of angiogenesis and some types of tumor cells, but not or&#xD;
      very low on the quiescent vessel cells and other normal cells. Therefore, the integrin αvβ3&#xD;
      receptor is becoming a valuable target for diagnosis and response evaluation of malignant&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tri-peptide sequence of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) can specifically bind to the&#xD;
      integrin αvβ3 receptor. Accordingly, a variety of radiolabeled RGD-based peptides have been&#xD;
      developed for non-invasive imaging of integrin αvβ3 expression via single photon emission&#xD;
      computed tomography (SPECT)or positron emission tomography (PET). Among all the RGD&#xD;
      radiotracers studied, several RGD monomers have been investigated in clinical trials, and the&#xD;
      preliminary results demonstrated specific imaging of various types of tumors, and the tumor&#xD;
      uptake correlated well with the level of integrin αvβ3 expression. Recently, several RGD&#xD;
      dimeric peptides with PEG linkers have been studied. The new types of RGD peptides showed&#xD;
      much higher in vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity than the single RGD tri-peptide sequence,&#xD;
      and importantly, they exhibited significantly increased tumor uptake and improved in vivo&#xD;
      kinetics in animal models. As a representative, 99mTc-3PRGD2 could be easily prepared and&#xD;
      exhibited excellent in vivo behaviors in animal models. No adverse reactions are observed in&#xD;
      animal models to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the further interests in clinical translation of 99mTc-3PRGD2, an open-label SPECT/CT&#xD;
      study was designed to investigate the safety and diagnostic performance of 99mTc-3PRGD2 in&#xD;
      esophagus cancer patients. A single dose of nearly 11.1 MBq/kg body weight 99mTc-3PRGD2 ( ≤&#xD;
      20 µg 3PRGD2) will be intravenously injected into the esophagus cancer patients. Visual and&#xD;
      semiquantitative method will be used to assess the whole-body planar and thoracic SPECT/CT&#xD;
      images. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analysis will be performed by 3 experienced nuclear medicine physicians to observe the the uptake of 99mTc-3PRGD2 on esophagus lesions. The visual analysis interpreter's degree of suspicion for an abnormality was recorded with use of a 3-point with the following categories: score 1, no abnormal increased uptake; score 2, mildly increased uptake; score 3, definite focal increased uptake. The lesion was considered positive as malignancy if the lesion scored as 2 or higher.</description>
