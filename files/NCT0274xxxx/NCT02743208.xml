  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, short femoral stems have been introduced. Short stems are designed based on&#xD;
      traditional stems with good clinical results. The assumed benefit of short stems is that they&#xD;
      are easier to use in mini-invasive surgery, and that preservation of proximal periprosthetic&#xD;
      bone stock is better. Preservation of periprosthetic bone in the proximal femur is thought to&#xD;
      secure long time anchoring of the implant, and reduce the risk of loosening. In addition, a&#xD;
      good proximal bone stock makes later revision surgery less technically demanding. However,&#xD;
      the short stem design could compromise the stability of the prosthesis, and there has been&#xD;
      reported diverging results regarding correct positioning of short stems. This may be due to&#xD;
      the lack of inherent aiming provided by the tip of the traditional long stems. We want to&#xD;
      clinically evaluate the stability and bone remodelling pattern of a new short femoral stem&#xD;
      based on a standard stem with excellent long time results. In addition we will compare the&#xD;
      two different stems regarding positioning, when using a newly developed guiding broach for&#xD;
      the short stem, and the standard broach for the long stem. Finally, patient reported clinical&#xD;
      outcome scores will be evaluated with respect to implant and biomechanical reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether this specific short femoral stem is stable, safe&#xD;
      to use, and if it provides the expected beneficial effects on bone remodelling.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a successful treatment of osteoarthritis and other&#xD;
      destructive diseases of the hip joint, relieving pain and restoring the function of the&#xD;
      joint. In Norway more than 7000 patients undergo primary hip replacement every year, and the&#xD;
      incidence is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The femoral component of a hip prosthesis is traditionally anchored to the femoral bone with&#xD;
      a stem introduced into the femoral canal and fixated with cement, or through bony ingrowth.&#xD;
      Over the recent years, short femoral stems have been introduced, among other reasons to meet&#xD;
      the increasing popularity of mini-invasive surgical procedures. The short stems are meant to&#xD;
      be easier to introduce through a small incision like used in muscle conserving anterior and&#xD;
      posterior approaches. Secondly, and biomechanically relevant, an important design related&#xD;
      benefit of the short femoral stems is thought to prevent periprosthetic bone resorption. Bone&#xD;
      remodels as a response to mechanical loading. When a stiff implant is inserted into the&#xD;
      femoral canal, the load will &quot;bypass&quot; the proximal femur through the implant, and is&#xD;
      transferred to bone distally. This results in a negative bone remodelling in the proximal&#xD;
      femur, which leads to bone resorption, often termed as &quot;stress shielding&quot;. Stress shielding&#xD;
      is observed around most uncemented implants, and mainly occurs within the first 6 - 24 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. The extent of implant coating, the material stiffness, design and the size&#xD;
      of the stem are found to influence the degree of stress shielding. The short stems are thus&#xD;
      designed based on the theory that proximal load transfer preserves metaphyseal bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of proximal bone stock due to stress shielding is a controversial subject, but has&#xD;
      several possible consequences. The exact clinical implications are not entirely determined,&#xD;
      but periprosthetic fractures and more challenging revision surgery are recognized problems.&#xD;
      In a revision setting it is favourable to have good proximal bone stock to achieve primary&#xD;
      stability of the implant. Peroperative fracture and compromised stability of the implant may&#xD;
      be a potential problem in stress-shielded bone. Furthermore, already stress-shielded bone in&#xD;
      the proximal femur may give wear debris easier access to the interface between implant and&#xD;
      bone, resulting in further osteolysis. Short-term results for short-stemmed implants are&#xD;
      encouraging in some clinical papers, but most of the available implants lack long-time&#xD;
      clinical documentation. Most papers on stress shielding are not randomized trials between&#xD;
      long and short stems. There are a few reports of increased revision rate and challenging&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncemented prosthetic hip implants are dependent on excellent primary stability to achieve&#xD;
      osseointegration and long-term stability. It is recognized that excessive micromotion at the&#xD;
      bone-implant interface is associated with formation of a soft tissue and loosening of&#xD;
      implants. Micromotion above 40μm leads to partial bone ingrowth, while values above 150μm&#xD;
      completely inhibit bone ingrowth. The main concern in short femoral stems is that stability&#xD;
      might be compromised. This might be due to the relatively less contact surface. There are no&#xD;
      long term results on stability of short femoral stems available, but in vitro studies shows&#xD;
      no significant reduction in stability of prostheses with comparable stem length to the&#xD;
      Furlong Evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malpositioning may result in a discrepancy between the reconstructed and the native&#xD;
      biomechanical anatomy of the hip. Altered biomechanical properties may influence the clinical&#xD;
      outcome and survival of implants. It has been shown that horizontal femoral offset, increases&#xD;
      significantly more using a short femoral stem compared to conventional femoral stems.&#xD;
      Compared to the contralateral hip, horizontal femoral offset was significantly increased only&#xD;
      when using short stems. Increased femoral offset increases the torsion forces along the stem,&#xD;
      which in turn raises the need for primary stability to avoid micromotion. It is also shown&#xD;
      that a short stem has a wider range of varus-valgus in the stem-shaft axis, On the other&#xD;
      there were found no significant differences in biomechanical reconstruction of the hip when&#xD;
      using a &quot;broach only&quot; short stem, or a &quot;ream and broach&quot; standard stem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there are significant differences in the biomechanical hip reconstruction, will this&#xD;
      affect patient reported outcome?&#xD;
