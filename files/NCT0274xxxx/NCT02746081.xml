      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose (RP2D) of BAY 1436032 in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1)-R132X-mutant&#xD;

    <description>Dose escalation: Patients with any type of IDH1-R132X-mutant solid tumor may be eligible for enrollment. A minimum of 3 patients per cohort will be treated. If dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) occur, Bayesian dose-DLT modeling will be performed to help guide dosing decisions and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). If the MTD is not reached, a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be chosen based on available safety, tolerability, PK, PD and clinical efficacy data.&#xD;
Dose expansion: The dose and schedule that was determined to be most appropriate in the dose escalation part of the study, which may be the MTD and / or the RP2D, will be used. Cohorts will consist of patients with the following IDH-R132X-mutant tumor types: (1) anaplastic glioma; (2) glioblastoma; (3) intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; (4) tumor types other than those in Cohorts 1-3.</description>

    <description>The selected starting dose of BAY1436032 is 300 mg/day (150 mg BID) to be administered orally continuously in tablet form in 21-day cycles. Adjustments to this schedule may be made if warranted by information collected during the course of the study. The maximum feasible dose of BAY1436032 is expected to be 3000 mg/day.</description>
