      Aim of this study is to evaluate image quality and reproducibility of Xenon-129 Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to evaluate changes in lung structure and function in&#xD;
      participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and asthma compared to healthy controls using&#xD;
      Xenon-129 MRI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance (MR) lung imaging is a relatively new imaging&#xD;
      method that allows depiction of both lung function and morphology. Hyperpolarized gases are a&#xD;
      new class of MR contrast agent which, when inhaled, provide high temporal and spatial&#xD;
      resolution MR images of the lung airspaces. Since no ionizing radiation is involved,&#xD;
      hyperpolarized gas MR imaging is ideal for the evaluation of lung diseases especially in&#xD;
      children. With hyperpolarized gases, the nuclear spins of the gas atoms are brought into&#xD;
      alignment outside of the MR scanner via a process called optical pumping; this yields high&#xD;
      polarizations and permits visualization of the lung airspaces with MR imaging (despite the&#xD;
      low physical density of the gas in the lung). Two non-radioactive (i.e. stable) isotopes of&#xD;
      noble gases helium-3 and xenon-129 can be hyperpolarized. Until recently, higher&#xD;
      polarizations could be achieved with helium-3 than with xenon-129, so in humans, helium-3 was&#xD;
      more commonly used for hyperpolarized gas MR imaging of the lungs. Recently, the technology&#xD;
      has been developed to provide large quantities of highly polarized xenon-129. Helium-3 gas is&#xD;
      also extremely expensive and since there are limited reserves of the gas, difficult to&#xD;
      procure for research. Unlike helium-3, since xenon-129 is naturally present in the&#xD;
      atmosphere, it is less expensive and easier to procure for imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several applications of xenon-129 MR imaging are under development, including&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted and relaxation-weighted imaging. These techniques take advantage of the&#xD;
      fact that the rate of loss of xenon-129 polarization is significantly influenced by the local&#xD;
      blood flow and concentration of molecular oxygen, as well as the restriction of xenon-129&#xD;
      diffusion by small airway space dimensions. These data can be used to create maps of the lung&#xD;
      reflecting regional ventilation/perfusion and micro-airway sizes. Other data that can be&#xD;
      obtained with xenon-129 MRI include the volumes of ventilated and unventilated lungs which&#xD;
      can subsequently be analyzed to determine the homogeneity of gas distribution within the&#xD;
      airspaces. These data can be used to study the structural and functional changes taking place&#xD;
      in the lungs associated with pulmonary diseases like CF and asthma. It might provide a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool that is able to detect pulmonary diseases more sensitively than the current&#xD;
      gold standard measurements of spirometry and plethysmography, and thus prevent irreparable&#xD;
      and irreversible damage to the lungs in the early stages of disease.&#xD;
