  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) a blood clot blocks the venous outflow of the entire&#xD;
      retinal circulation. This leads to retinal and vitreous hemorrhages, retinal edema and&#xD;
      neovascularization. The development of a microneedle and surgical stabilizer made it possible&#xD;
      to perform a prolonged (10 minutes) retinal vein cannulation with infusion of Ocriplasmin.&#xD;
      Ocriplasmin has the advantage over tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) that it already is an&#xD;
      active enzyme and a strong fibrinolyticum. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      safety of local intravenous Ocriplasmin for CRVO.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is the second most common source of permanent blindness&#xD;
      in the Western world after diabetic retinopathy. By blocking the outflow pathway for the&#xD;
      retinal circulation, visual prognosis is bad on the short and long term. Currently, treatment&#xD;
      is mostly focused on treating the secondary effects: macular edema and neovascularization&#xD;
      with antiVEGF and/or corticosteroid intravitreal injections and retinal laser&#xD;
      photocoagulation. There is however a surgical treatment aimed at displacing the blood clot; a&#xD;
      radial optic neurotomy. During this surgical treatment, the vitreous is removed by&#xD;
      vitrectomy, after which a radial incision is made in the optic disc. The target of this&#xD;
      incision is to open the canal in the lamina cribrosa to improve the blood flow in the central&#xD;
      retinal vein. Since the outcome of this procedure is variable and has its inherent risks,&#xD;
      mainly because the incision can damage the central retinal artery which is adjacent to the&#xD;
      central vein, this procedure is not routinely performed in all vitreoretinal centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the recent development of a surgical stabilizer and microneedle suitable for&#xD;
      retinal vein cannulations, the option for local intravenous administration of fibrinolytic&#xD;
      drugs exists. This phase I study aims to investigate the feasibility and safety of surgical&#xD;
      stabilizer assisted retinal vein cannulation with local intravenous infusion of Ocriplasmin&#xD;
      to dissolve the clot clogging the central retinal vein. Ocriplasmin is the small active part&#xD;
      of the larger plasmin molecule. Plasmin itself is formed by enzymatic conversion from&#xD;
      plasminogen, a process that is mediated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). The amount of&#xD;
      plasmin that can be produced is thus highly dependent on the amount of plasminogen that is&#xD;
      present nearby the clot. By using Ocriplasmin, this intermediate step can be skipped and the&#xD;
      clot will be targeted directly and during the entire time of infusion. By being able to get&#xD;
      infusion times up to 10 minutes, abundant clot exposure to Ocriplasmin is guaranteed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion will be offered to patients presenting with a recent CRVO, a vitrectomy will be&#xD;
      performed augmented with retinal vein cannulation and infusion of ocriplasmin during 10&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with a recent CRVO (&lt;2weeks) will be offered inclusion to undergo a&#xD;
      vitrectomy with subsequent prolonged retinal vein cannulation and infusion of Ocirplasmin.&#xD;
      The surgery is done by placing a microneedle in one of the branch retinal veins at the border&#xD;
      of the optic disc. To increase the safety of this procedure a surgical stabilizer was&#xD;
      developed. This procedure was abundantly tested and refined in multiple in vivo porcine&#xD;
      experiments and the medication (Ocriplasmin) has already been tested for fibrinolytic&#xD;
      activity used in 100-fold higher dosis intravenously and intra-arterially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgery, standard of care follow up with a comprehensive ophthalmological&#xD;
      examination and technical investigations is foreseen. The primary outcome measures of this&#xD;
      safety and feasiblity study are: technical success to cannulate the retinal vein and inject&#xD;
      ocriplasmin to remove the blood clot, number of intervention-related (surgical or&#xD;
      pharmacological) complications, duration of infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If necessary; depending on the disease evolution, additional interventions like intravitreal&#xD;
      antiVEGF, steroids or laser photocoagulation can be performed.&#xD;
