  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that have recurrent glioblastoma that has progressed on bevacizumab continue to&#xD;
      receive bevacizumab with the addition of Tumor Treating Fields Therapy. Treatment is given&#xD;
      until disease progression or the development of adverse events that require complete&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;

    <measure>Overall Survival at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to six months</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants alive at 6 months. Out of the planned 80 eligible patients, if 36 or more were alive at six months then the null hypothesis that the six-month survival rate is 35% or less would be rejected, concluding that the six-month survival is at least 35%. No testing was done due to the small number of participants resulting from early study closure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to study termination. Maximum follow-up was 21.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Survival time is defined as time from registration the to date of death from any cause or last known follow-up (censored) and was to be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Given the small number of participants due to early study closure, only the number of patients last reported to be alive at time of study termination is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to study termination. Maximum follow-up was 21.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined by the Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Response Criteria. (The precise definition is too long to be included here.) Progression-free survival time is defined as time from registration to the date of first progression, death, or last known follow-up. Progression-free survival rates were to be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Given the small number of participants due to early study closure, only the number of patients last reported to be alive without progression at time of study termination is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Partial or Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to study termination. Maximum follow-up was 21.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Response Criteria was used to define response and progression. (The precise definitions are too long to be included here.) Objective response is defined as complete or partial response. The percentage of participants with objective response was to be estimated using the exact binomial method with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Given the small number of participants due to early study closure, only the number of patients with objective response is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3+ Treatment-related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From registration to study termination. Maximum follow-up was 21.8 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event (AE). The CTCAE v4.0 assigns Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grade 1 Mild, Grade 2 Moderate, Grade 3 Severe, Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling, Grade 5 Death related to AE. The percentage of participants with grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events was to be estimated using the exact binomial method with accompanying 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically proven diagnosis of glioblastoma or other grade IV malignant glioma&#xD;
             (including variants of glioblastoma i.e., gliosarcoma, giant cell glioblastoma, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of tumor recurrence or progression on contrast magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
             (MRI) (with and without gadolinium contrast) as determined by Response assessment in&#xD;
             neuro-oncology (RANO) criteria within 14 days prior to registration for patients who&#xD;
             did not have recent resection of their glioblastoma or only had a stereotactic biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients having undergone recent resection (within 5 weeks prior to registration) of&#xD;
             their glioblastoma to treat current recurrence prior to study treatment must have&#xD;
             recovered from the effects of surgery (including patient's skin having fully recovered&#xD;
             from the surgical wound) Note: a 4-week window is required after surgery prior to&#xD;
             starting treatment. For central nervous system (CNS) -related stereotactic biopsies, a&#xD;
             minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Residual disease of recurrent glioblastoma is not mandated for eligibility into the&#xD;
             study. To best assess the extent of residual disease post-operatively, a&#xD;
             post-operative MRI scan must be performed prior to registration and is recommended to&#xD;
             be within 96 hours post-surgery (although 24-48 hours would be optimum). Note:&#xD;
             Patients who did have surgery with a post-operative contrast-enhanced scan falling&#xD;
             outside the 5-week window prior to registration, must have a repeat MRI scan within 14&#xD;
             days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with up to two recurrences are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure on bevacizumab (either as a monotherapy or a combination) as most recent&#xD;
             regimen confirmed by tumor recurrence on MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient must have failed no more than one regimen of bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The patient must not have received bevacizumab as an upfront treatment in newly&#xD;
                  diagnosed glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  There must be a minimum of 14 days (i.e., an interval equal to or greater than 14&#xD;
                  days) since last treatment with bevacizumab and registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History/physical examination within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 22&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to&#xD;
             achieve Hgb ≥ 9.0 g/dl is acceptable.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Urine protein: creatinine (UPC) ratio &lt; 1.0 within 14 days prior to registration OR&#xD;
             urine dipstick for proteinuria ≤ 2+ (patients discovered to have &gt; 2+ proteinuria on&#xD;
             dipstick urinalysis at baseline must have a UPC ratio done that is &lt;1.0 to be&#xD;
             eligible. If the UPC ratio is ≥ 1.0 then the patients should undergo a 24-hour urine&#xD;
             collection and must demonstrate ≤ 1g of protein in 24 hours to be eligible).&#xD;
&#xD;
             *Note: UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24-hour urine protein&#xD;
             excretion; a UPC ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm.&#xD;
             UPC ratio is calculated using one of the following formulas:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine]: if both protein and creatinine are reported&#xD;
                  in mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine]: if urine creatinine is reported in&#xD;
                  mmol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             registration&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients on full dose anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin or low molecular weight (LMW)&#xD;
             heparin) must meet both of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. No active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding&#xD;
                  (e.g., tumor involving major vessels or known varices) within 14 days prior to&#xD;
                  registration&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. One of the below criteria must be met based on patient's therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    1. Warfarin: In-range international normalized ratio (INR) (usually between 2&#xD;
                       and 3) within 14 days prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
                    2. LMW heparin or novel oral anti-coagulant: stable dose within 14 days prior&#xD;
                       to registration&#xD;

        <description>Modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Response Criteria was used to define response and progression. (The precise definitions are too long to be included here.) Objective response is defined as complete or partial response. The percentage of participants with objective response was to be estimated using the exact binomial method with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Given the small number of participants due to early study closure, only the number of patients with objective response is reported.</description>
