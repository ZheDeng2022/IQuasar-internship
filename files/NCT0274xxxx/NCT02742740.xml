      The Study Buddy ECA acts as an advisor to patients on chemotherapy regimens, promoting&#xD;
      protocol adherence and retention, providing anticipatory guidance and answering questions,&#xD;
      serving as a conduit to capture information about complaints or adverse events, providing a&#xD;
      venue for communicating about updates. The Study Buddy will use the web-based ECA&#xD;
      infrastructure developed for use on another project. We will use web browsers on tablets&#xD;
      provided to study participants to access the Study Buddy, providing anywhere, anytime access&#xD;
      to its functions. Usability metrics will include session time, satisfaction, and error rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be identified from among patients on chemotherapy regimens at BMC. With the&#xD;
      provider's approval, we will recruit patients for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be enrolled for 2 months. After consent, we will collect baseline data.&#xD;
      Baseline data is collected after enrollment and before randomization. Baseline data includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      sociodemographic data PROMIS Mental and Social health the PHQ-9 clinical factors such as&#xD;
      medical diagnosis (cancer type and stage) the Short Assessment of Health Literacy-English the&#xD;
      Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) for cognitive impairment the Need For&#xD;
      Cognition scale contact numbers of two friends or family members who will assist us in&#xD;
      establishing contact, if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exit interview will be conducted 2 months after the baseline interview, with windows of 2&#xD;
      weeks plus or minus that date. Study staff will attempt to coincide this interview with a&#xD;
      clinical visit, to minimize inconvenience for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected at the exit interview will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROMIS Mental and Social health the PHQ-9 Satisfaction with ECA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of the subject's medical chart will be performed bi-weekly while the subject is&#xD;
      enrolled. Chart review will be performed by a staff member who is blinded to the subject's&#xD;
      group (intervention vs control).&#xD;
