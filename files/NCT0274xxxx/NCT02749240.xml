  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At risk youth face various adversities including homelessness, social isolation, substance&#xD;
      abuse and other mental illnesses. Thus far, the investigators have successfully partnered on&#xD;
      programs of housing, social and recreational interventions in this population. The&#xD;
      investigators now wish to assess the feasibility of delivery of an innovative&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social intervention, Youth Empowerment Seminar (YES!), developed by their partner,&#xD;
      the not-for-profit Art of Living Foundation. Therefore, the aim of this research is to&#xD;
      conduct a proof of concept study to determine the feasibility of a novel YES! program as an&#xD;
      intervention for at risk youth.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      STUDY DESIGN: The proposed is an open-label study with a mixed methods design. Research&#xD;
      participants will be thirty youth between the ages of 16-25 years who are currently accessing&#xD;
      any resource offered by Youth Opportunities Unlimited, London, ON. Youth will be enrolled in&#xD;
      a rolling 8-week YES! Program repeated when adequate group size is achieved (&gt;6&#xD;
      participants). Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected, which will allow for a&#xD;
      detailed analysis of the feasibility of YES! as an intervention for youth at risk of&#xD;
      homelessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RECRUITMENT: Participants for this study will be recruited through the Youth Action&#xD;
      Centre (YAC) of Youth Opportunity Unlimited (YOU), London. Participants will be between 16&#xD;
      and 25 years of age. As this is a pilot study, the investigators have set the sample size to&#xD;
      n=30, which is in accordance with current standards for pilot studies. The investigators&#xD;
      anticipate to recruit participants at a rate of at least 1 youth/week. Advertisements about&#xD;
      the study will be placed throughout YAC (located in the YOU Cornerstone Building, 332&#xD;
      Richmond St., London, ON, N6A 3C3) and Theresa McLachlan, a staff member with YOU Transition&#xD;
      Services will provide interested youth with additional information as required. There is no&#xD;
      obligation for the youth to take part in the study; all participation is voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING AND INITIAL ASSESSMENTS: Potential participants will be screened as per inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria by trained research staff. Immediately prior to the start of the&#xD;
      intervention trained raters will meet with participants to obtain demographic information and&#xD;
      complete baseline measures of social inclusion, substance use and mental health.&#xD;
      Specifically, the following scales will be administered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. demographic, service and housing history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. community integration questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Global Appraisal of Individual Needs- Substance Problem Scale (GAIN-SPS), (GAIN-SPS is a&#xD;
           subscale of a biopsychosocial battery that has been designed for clinical and program&#xD;
           evaluation and has been validated for use in individuals 11 years of age and older), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Colorado Symptom Index.&#xD;

    <description>An 8-week innovative bio-psycho-social program (Youth Empowerment Seminar, YES!) will be offered to at risk youth participating in programs or resources offered by Youth Opportunities Unlimited. The YES! program will be taught in two phases: (1) an active learning phase which consists of four consecutive days (3 hrs/day) of SEL skills taught in a multi-modality interactive format as well as SKY training, and (2) a reinforcement phase which involves weekly follow up sessions (75-90 mins each) for the 7 weeks following the active phase. Two certified instructors from the Art of Living Foundation (Spencer Delisle and Mark Frye) will deliver this training under supervision of Ronnie Newman (RN). After the initial 4 day training, participants will be asked to practice SKY daily for 20-25 minutes in addition to attending the weekly follow up sessions.</description>
