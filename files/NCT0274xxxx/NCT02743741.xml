    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Lutetium-177 Octreotate in patients with neuroendocrine tumors who has positive Somatostatin&#xD;
      receptor identified by 68Ga-DOTATATE. 195 patients will be enrolled totally. Patient who has&#xD;
      progressed with neuroendocrine tumor will be evaluated by the tumor board first and eligible&#xD;
      patients will undergo diagnostic Ga 68 PET scan. Patients who showed Somatostatin will&#xD;
      undergo 4 cycles of Lu-DOTATATE treatment. Dose adjustment for Cycle 2-4 will be made based&#xD;
      on individualized dosimetry, as well as creatinine clearance and hematological parameters.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated progression free survival at 12 months from last dose. Patients&#xD;
      who are negative for somatostatin will not receive 68Ga-DOTATATE treatment but will be&#xD;
      followed until progression and acts as control group.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Please note that only Ontario residents will be eligible for participation in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Biopsy-proven neuroendocrine tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ECOG performance status ≤ 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ki-67 index ≤ 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of progressive disease demonstrated by imaging within six months prior to&#xD;
             study enrollment as defined by RECIST v1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Tumor board discussion of cases to confirm suitability for participation in the&#xD;
                  clinical trial is required. Review should include but not limited to imaging&#xD;
                  review, pathology (including Ki 67) and treatment options.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with objective evidence (imaging, or biochemical) that is insufficient&#xD;
                  to be classified by RECIST 1.1 criteria can be eligible if after provincial&#xD;
                  multidisciplinary tumor board discussion a consensus for progression eligibility&#xD;
                  is reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The tumor board would consider exemptions if the magnitude of change is adequate&#xD;
                  by other definitions (e.g. using structural and contrast patterns and biochemical&#xD;
                  changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Where clinically indicated, formal consultation on pathology, diagnostic imaging&#xD;
                  to facilitate criteria assessment (including 68Ga PET performed as part of the&#xD;
                  diagnostic procedure) is strongly recommended.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with extensive bone metastases (e.g. &gt;25% of bone marrow involvement are&#xD;
             eligible but requires careful monitoring of hematological reserve&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject's willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans,&#xD;
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Systemic, biologic, other radioisotope, embolization therapies within ≤4 weeks prior&#xD;

             pregnancy test (serum) prior to enrolment. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or&#xD;
             must agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition&#xD;
             of effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator&#xD;
             or a designated associate&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Other condition, illness, psychiatric condition, or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation, 68Ga or 177Lu administration,&#xD;
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and in the judgment of the&#xD;
             investigator would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;
