  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lucitanib is an oral multi kinase inhibitor designed to block the action of certain molecules&#xD;
      called &quot;angiogenic factors&quot; that may cause tumors to grow. These factors are called vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Lucitanib is experimental and not approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of lucitanib in cancer patients whose&#xD;
      cancers harbor aberrations in FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR or other markers predicted to be sensitive&#xD;
      to lucitanib. This study will also look for biomarkers in samples of blood and tumor tissue&#xD;
      to identify patients most likely to respond to lucitanib. Biomarkers are substances such as&#xD;
      genetic material (DNA and RNA) and proteins found in blood and tumor tissue that might show&#xD;
      if a cancer patient will respond or not respond to a drug.&#xD;

      Lucitanib is an oral multi kinase inhibitor designed to block the action of certain molecules&#xD;
      called &quot;angiogenic factors&quot; that may cause tumors to grow. These factors are called vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (called VEGF), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor (called FGF). Lucitanib is experimental and not approved by the FDA&#xD;
      for the treatment of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the following in cancer patients whose cancers&#xD;
      harbor aberrations in FGFR, VEGFR, PDGFR, or other biomarkers predicted to be sensitive to&#xD;
      lucitanib:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look at the effects of lucitanib on their disease at 10 mg once daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look for biomarkers in samples of blood and tumor tissue to identify patients most&#xD;
           likely to respond to lucitanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look at the safety of lucitanib in these patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-center, open-label, non-randomized Phase II study of lucitanib in adult&#xD;
      subjects with advanced cancers. Treatment will consist of daily oral administration of 10mg&#xD;
      of lucitanib in 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients providing informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Baseline&#xD;
      assessments will include vital signs, physical exam, blood hematology and chemistries, ECG,&#xD;
      and ECHO. If not done within the prior 4 weeks, a PET/CT scan, MRI, and/or CT scan will be&#xD;
      performed for radiological evaluation of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations include physical exam, vitals, ECG (obtained once every month throughout&#xD;
      treatment); blood hematology and chemistries (obtained every two weeks for the first three&#xD;
      months and then once every month throughout treatment); radiologic evaluations (PET/CT, CT&#xD;
      and/or MRI, +/- bone imaging as clinically appropriate) will be performed every 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may last up to approximately 4 years or longer, depending on whether or not the&#xD;
      study doctor feels that continuing lucitanib dosing is in the patient's best interest. Once a&#xD;
      patient finishes study treatment with lucitanib, patients will need to complete an End of&#xD;
      Study visit. Each of the study visits can last from approximately 2 to 8 hours.&#xD;
