    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the Dengue vaccine in a&#xD;
      population of special interest, such as HIV-positive adults previously exposed to dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety of each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults&#xD;
           previously exposed to dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the humoral immune response to each dengue serotype at baseline and after&#xD;
           each injection of CYD dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults previously exposed to&#xD;
           dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect the CYD dengue vaccinal viremia post-Inj 1 in HIV-positive adults previously&#xD;
           exposed to dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes in CD4 count and HIV RNA viral load after each injection of CYD&#xD;
           dengue vaccine in HIV-positive adults previously exposed to dengue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the FV (YF, Dengue, Zika) serological status in the study population at&#xD;
           baseline.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio into 1 of 2 groups to receive 3&#xD;
      injections of either CYD dengue vaccine or placebo at 0, 6, and 12 months. The enrollment of&#xD;
      subjects will be carried out in two steps, including an early safety data review before the&#xD;
      second step. The duration of each subject's participation in the study will be approximately&#xD;
      18 months.&#xD;
