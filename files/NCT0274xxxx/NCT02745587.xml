  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 40% of the patients with prostate cancer (PC) present with positive lymph nodes&#xD;
      (N1). The optimal treatment strategy for these patients remains controversial. Although&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is still often initiated as only treatment, the results&#xD;
      are disappointing. Recent studies support the use of more aggressive therapies including&#xD;
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and ADT. The retrospective studies supporting the&#xD;
      additional use of EBRT in N1 PC patients are however not conclusive regarding to the extent&#xD;
      of radiation field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even after an EPLND, there might be a role for pelvic EBRT in irradicating microscopic&#xD;
      disease. However pelvic irradiation irrevocably results in increased toxicity. Moreover, in&#xD;
      node negative (N0) PC patients the addition of pelvic EBRT has not resulted in improved&#xD;
      outcome in randomised trials. However in the setting of Tumor Node Metastasis pathological&#xD;
      stage (p)N1, proven on pathological examination, PC patients this has never been evaluated so&#xD;
      far. This trial aims to answer the question whether or not pelvic EBRT is beneficial in&#xD;
      pathological N1 PC patients. It is also important to realise that not all pathological N1 PC&#xD;
      patients have similar outcome. There is a significant impact of number of positive lymph&#xD;
      nodes on outcome, with two positive nodes being suggested as a significant cut-off value in&#xD;
      predicting survival in pathological N1 PC patients. By stratifying the patients according to&#xD;
      the number of lymph nodes involved this study will add to the proper selection of those&#xD;
      patients who will benefit most of pelvic EBRT and avoid toxicity in patients who have no&#xD;
      benefit of pelvic EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, small RNAs constitute potentially valuable markers for the diagnosis,&#xD;
      prognosis, and therapeutic choices in PC patients. Blood samples will be collected to examine&#xD;
      the potential role of miRNAs as a biomarker and to develop a prognostic signature for&#xD;
      clinical relapse-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this trial will serve as a base for developping new trials in order to&#xD;
      optimise the treatment of patients with pathological N1 PC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an era with increasing evidence in favour of an aggressive local treatment, where an&#xD;
      extended pelvic lymph node dissection (EPLND) is more frequently performed and with data&#xD;
      supporting the potential role for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in pelvic node positive&#xD;
      (N1) prostate cancer (PC), the treatment of N1 PC patients needs to be revised. Seen the lack&#xD;
      of clear guidelines regarding the extent of radiation field in N1 prostate cancer patients,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need for studies evaluating the place of pelvic EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is thus to evaluate if pelvic irradiation has an impact on clinical&#xD;
      relapse free survival in pathological N1 PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that performing a pelvic EBRT after EPLND in pathological N1 PC patients&#xD;
      results in a significant improved clinical relapse free survival with 15% when compared to&#xD;
      prostate only EBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be evaluated in a multicentre Phase III stratified randomised trial randomising&#xD;
      patients with PC and 1-4 positive lymph nodes on EPLND between prostate(bed) only&#xD;
      radiotherapy + 2 years of ADT or pelvic radiotherapy + 2 years of androgen deprivation. A&#xD;
      total of 330 patients will be enrolled in this trial. Stratification is based on the number&#xD;
      of positive lymph nodes since patients with increased number of positive lymph nodes exhibit&#xD;
      a poorer prognosis.&#xD;
