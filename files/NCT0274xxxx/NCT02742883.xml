  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for diffuse, intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) provide very limited benefit&#xD;
      to the patient. The rationale for the use of Antineoplaston therapy in this protocol study&#xD;
      derives from experience with subjects from prior Phase 2 studies and Compassionate Exemption&#xD;
      patients treated with Antineoplaston therapy at the Burzynski Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to analyze the efficacy and safety of Antineoplaston therapy in five&#xD;
      separate DIPG patient cohorts, which are defined by age and prior therapy. This is a two&#xD;
      stage study with 20 patients in each cohort being enrolled in the first stage and an&#xD;
      additional 20 patients being enrolled in the second stage, if pre-determined efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints in the first stage are realized.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to analyze the response of diffuse, intrinsic brainstem glioma (DIPG)&#xD;
      to Antineoplaston therapy in 5 separate patient cohorts, which are defined by age and prior&#xD;
      therapy. The primary endpoint is objective response (OR), but the determination of OR in DIPG&#xD;
      is problematic. Determination of OR using the Macdonald, RANO, and RECIST criteria relies on&#xD;
      postgadolinium TI-weighted MRI images of enhancing disease. However, DIPG shows variable&#xD;
      enhancement and has a non-enhancing component as seen on T2/FLAIR-weighted MRI images. Recent&#xD;
      reviews have proposed OR assessment in diffuse low grade gliomas using modified RANO criteria&#xD;
      and in recurrent glioblastoma using RECIST + F (T2/FLAIR-weighted images).Neither of these&#xD;
      methodologies have been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-arm Phase 2 study of the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in DIPG will utilize&#xD;
      both bidimensional assessment of enhancing DIPG (RANO), a validated primary endpoint, and&#xD;
      unidimensional assessment of enhancing + non-enhancing DIPG (RECIST + F), an exploratory&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 2 protocol has a strategy for early assessment of response rates with procedures&#xD;
      for termination of enrollment for lack of efficacy. A minimax two-stage design is utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients with enhancing disease will be enrolled in stage 1 for each cohort. If none of&#xD;
      the 10 patients in a particular cohort achieves an OR based on bidimensional measurements, no&#xD;
      additional patients with enhancing disease will be enrolled into that particular cohort.&#xD;
      However, if 1 of the 10 patients with enhancing disease in a particular cohort achieves an&#xD;
      OR, then an additional 10 patients with enhancing disease will be enrolled in stage 2 of the&#xD;
      minimax design for that cohort, yielding a maximum of 20 patients with enhancing disease for&#xD;
      that cohort. As exploratory endpoints, complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD) rates, as well as 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival (OS) will&#xD;
      be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with no enhancing disease will also be enrolled into each cohort but will not count&#xD;
      against the numbers designated in the two-stage minimax design. An exploratory endpoint for&#xD;
      these patients will be 6-, 12-, and 24-month OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other exploratory endpoints will be determination of OR, CR, PR, and PD based on&#xD;
      unidimensional measurement of the enhancing + non-enhancing components of DIPG (RECIST + F).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At completion of this study, the efficacy of Antineoplaston therapy in each cohort and the&#xD;
      desirability of its further development in any particular cohort will be determined in&#xD;
      discussion with the FDA.&#xD;
