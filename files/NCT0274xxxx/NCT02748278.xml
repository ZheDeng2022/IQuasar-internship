  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IVF is a well-established method to treat various causes of infertility. Some studies have&#xD;
      suggested that ethnicity affects the success of IVF. This is a prospective study involving&#xD;
      two tertiary IVF units in Hong Kong and Australia. The IVF outcome between Chinese and&#xD;
      Caucasians will be compared.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study conducted in two tertiary IVF units in Hong Kong and Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for the trial will be women undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm&#xD;
      injection (ICSI) treatment in two IVF Units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients recruited in this study will undergo IVF+/-ICSI treatment. They will undergo an&#xD;
      ultrasound scan on the second or third day (day 2 or 3) of a period to exclude the presence&#xD;
      of ovarian cyst and have the antral follicle count determined, which includes all follicles&#xD;
      of 2-10 mm measured with a 5.5-7.5mHz transvaginal ultrasound probe. Blood will be checked&#xD;
      for anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measured by Beckman-Coulter Diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation will be started if there are no ovarian cysts on ultrasound scan. They&#xD;
      will receive one long acting gonadotrophin injection Elonva 150 microgram subcutaneously&#xD;
      followed by daily gonadotrophin injections (Puregon) 200 IU in an antagonist protocol.&#xD;
      Antagonist (orgalutran 0.25 mg) will be started on day 5 of ovarian stimulation. Transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound will be performed for follicular tracking 7 days after the Elonva injection and&#xD;
      every 1-3 days thereafter. No adjustment in FSH dose is allowed. Cycles will be cancelled if&#xD;
      there are less than 3 follicles larger than 18mm after one week of 200 IU Puregon or there no&#xD;
      developing follicle (i.e. larger than 11mm) after one week of 200 IU Puregon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant hCG (Ovidrel, Serono, Bari, Italy) 0.25mg will be given if there are 2 follicles&#xD;
      &gt;18 mm in diameter. Gonadotrophin injection will not be given on the day of hCG. Agonist&#xD;
      trigger will be used if oestradiol concentration on the day of trigger is greater than 15,000&#xD;
      pmol/L or there are more than 15 follicles &gt;16mm on transvaginal scanning. All embryos or&#xD;
      blastocysts will be frozen for transfer later following agonist trigger or when the number of&#xD;
      oocytes aspirated is 20 or more. Serum FSH, oestradiol, LH and progesterone concentrations&#xD;
      are taken 7 days after the Elonva injection and hCG trigger day. Transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval (TUGOR) will be scheduled on Mondays, Wednesdays and&#xD;
      Fridays, 34-36 hours after the hCG injection. Flushing of follicles will not be performed.&#xD;
      Follicular fluid not contaminated with blood will be collected from the first and largest&#xD;
      follicle on each side for estradiol and progesterone level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrieved oocyte will be inseminated conventionally or by ICSI, depending on the semen&#xD;
      parameters. ICSI is advised if the total motile sperm number after sperm preparation &lt; 0.2&#xD;
      million, sperm morphology by strict criteria &lt; 3% or fertilization rate &lt; 30% in previous IVF&#xD;
      cycles with conventional insemination. One to two embryos will be replaced on day 2-5 after&#xD;
      oocyte retrieval. Luteal phase support will be started according to the standard protocol of&#xD;
      the centre. Patients will be followed up for urinary pregnancy test 16 days after embryo&#xD;
      transfer. Patients with a positive pregnancy test will have transvaginal ultrasound scan&#xD;
      performed 10-14 days later and are referred for antenatal care at 8-10 weeks gestation. The&#xD;
      remaining embryos will be frozen. Pregnancy outcome will be monitored.&#xD;
