  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the PillCam SBC system performance in 50&#xD;
      established or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by visualizing and&#xD;
      assessing their small and large bowel.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PillCam SBC system to be tested in this study, is a new system composed of capsule, Data&#xD;
      recorder and a new software Pillcam Desktop Software (version 9.0). The main features of the&#xD;
      SBC capsule are panoramic field of view and adaptive frame rate customized for complete&#xD;
      coverage of both small bowel and colonic mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty established and suspected IBD patients (at least half of them with established crohn&#xD;
      disease (CD)) with active or quiescent disease activity, aged 18 years and up, with no&#xD;
      symptomatic stricture or known obstruction that would prevent capsule passage will be&#xD;
      enrolled in up to 6 medical sites in Israel and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo bowel prep, followed by a PillCam SBC capsule examination. Patency&#xD;
      capsule may precede PillCam SBC ingestion according to physician discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PillCam Software videos will be evaluated by local site reader following a Subjective&#xD;
      Assessment Form fulfillment.&#xD;
