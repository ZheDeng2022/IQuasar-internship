  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a high (80mg/kg) and low&#xD;
      (40mg/kg) dose of NS-065/NCNP-01 delivered as an intravenous infusion in patients with&#xD;
      Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) amendable to exon 53 skipping. Additional objectives&#xD;
      include tolerability, muscle function and strength, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multiple center, 2-period, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose finding&#xD;
      study of NS-065/NCNP-01 administered by infusion once weekly for 24 weeks to ambulant boys&#xD;
      ages 4-&lt;10 years with DMD. Two dose level cohorts will be enrolled. Period 1 of this study&#xD;
      will be conducted in a double-blind fashion. Randomized patients will receive weekly IV&#xD;
      infusions of NS-065/NCNP-01 or placebo for the first 4 weeks of their participation (Period&#xD;
      1) and NS-065/NCNP-01 by IV infusion for weeks 5-24 (20 weeks of active treatment - Period&#xD;
      2). Analysis of safety data from Period 1 of the 40mg/kg dose cohort will be completed prior&#xD;
      to enrolling patients in the 80mg/kg dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients completing the 24-week study will be eligible for an open-label extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits, including functional&#xD;
      tests such as the six-minute walk test (6MWT), time to stand (TTSTAND), time to run/walk 10&#xD;
      meters (TTRW), time to climb 4 stairs (TTCLIMB) and quantitative muscle testing (QMT). All&#xD;
      patients will undergo a muscle biopsy of the bicep at baseline and a second muscle biopsy at&#xD;
      Week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), blood and urine&#xD;
      laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, and physical examinations&#xD;
      throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be taken at four of the study visits to assess the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of the study drug.&#xD;

    <time_frame>24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were summarized for Period 1 by comparing low dose to high dose to placebo and for Period 2 between the low dose cohort and the high dose cohort. TEAEs were summarized both at the patient level for number of TEAEs, highest severity, relationship, action and outcome and at the TEAE level (summarizing events) by organ system and preferred term TEAE as well as severity, relationship, action and outcome.&#xD;
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 20.1 was used and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading.</description>

    <measure>Dystrophin Production by Western Blot</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage normal dystrophin production in muscle biopsies from study participants at baseline and after 24 weeks treatment was measured by Western blot.&#xD;
To analyze dystrophin induction, biopsies were taken from a biceps muscle at baseline and the other biceps muscle after 24 weeks of treatment. Muscle samples were snap frozen and delivered to a central laboratory. All laboratory researchers remained blinded to sample identity. Dystrophin protein levels were assessed using standard curves on each gel (range from 0-25% of normal levels) generated by mixing 5 normal control samples with one DMD sample.</description>

To analyze dystrophin induction, biopsies were taken from a biceps muscle at baseline and the other biceps muscle after 24 weeks of treatment. Muscle samples were snap frozen and delivered to a central laboratory. All laboratory researchers remained blinded to sample identity. For RT-PCR, bands corresponding to specific versions of the spliced dystrophin mRNA were visualized by gel electrophoresis, and the amounts of different mRNA isoforms were compared.</description>

    <description>The NSAA is a functional scale devised for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). It assesses abilities necessary to remain ambulant that have been found to progressively deteriorate in untreated DMD patients, as well as in other muscular dystrophies such as Becker Muscular Dystrophy. NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function.</description>

          <title>NSAA score</title>
          <description>The NSAA is a functional scale devised for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). It assesses abilities necessary to remain ambulant that have been found to progressively deteriorate in untreated DMD patients, as well as in other muscular dystrophies such as Becker Muscular Dystrophy. NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function.</description>

        <title>Dystrophin Production by Western Blot</title>
        <description>Percentage normal dystrophin production in muscle biopsies from study participants at baseline and after 24 weeks treatment was measured by Western blot.&#xD;
To analyze dystrophin induction, biopsies were taken from a biceps muscle at baseline and the other biceps muscle after 24 weeks of treatment. Muscle samples were snap frozen and delivered to a central laboratory. All laboratory researchers remained blinded to sample identity. Dystrophin protein levels were assessed using standard curves on each gel (range from 0-25% of normal levels) generated by mixing 5 normal control samples with one DMD sample.</description>

          <title>Dystrophin Production by Western Blot</title>
          <description>Percentage normal dystrophin production in muscle biopsies from study participants at baseline and after 24 weeks treatment was measured by Western blot.&#xD;
To analyze dystrophin induction, biopsies were taken from a biceps muscle at baseline and the other biceps muscle after 24 weeks of treatment. Muscle samples were snap frozen and delivered to a central laboratory. All laboratory researchers remained blinded to sample identity. Dystrophin protein levels were assessed using standard curves on each gel (range from 0-25% of normal levels) generated by mixing 5 normal control samples with one DMD sample.</description>

To analyze dystrophin induction, biopsies were taken from a biceps muscle at baseline and the other biceps muscle after 24 weeks of treatment. Muscle samples were snap frozen and delivered to a central laboratory. All laboratory researchers remained blinded to sample identity. For RT-PCR, bands corresponding to specific versions of the spliced dystrophin mRNA were visualized by gel electrophoresis, and the amounts of different mRNA isoforms were compared.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) Score.</title>
        <description>The NSAA is a functional scale devised for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). It assesses abilities necessary to remain ambulant that have been found to progressively deteriorate in untreated DMD patients, as well as in other muscular dystrophies such as Becker Muscular Dystrophy. NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function.</description>
