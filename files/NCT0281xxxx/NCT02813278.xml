  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer resection is one of the most common types of abdominal surgery. Though most&#xD;
      patients undergoing colorectal resection show recovery of bowel movements within a week, some&#xD;
      have prolonged intestinal paralysis or postoperative ileus, resulting in decreasing patient&#xD;
      comfort, increasing morbidity and mortality, a longer hospital stay and subsequent increased&#xD;
      healthcare costs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevention the incidence of postoperative ileus (POI) is quite important because of the&#xD;
      negative clinical outcomes it causes. In the past two decades, many treatments and care&#xD;
      approaches, such as fluid restriction, early enteral nutrition, and nonsteroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug are used for the management of POI. In theory of traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine, oral simo decoction (SMD) or acupuncture at the tsusanli acupoint can boost&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hypomotility. The efficacy of accelerating the return of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      function by such single method or combination of them has been validated in randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials and systematic review following several types of surgery. In recent years,&#xD;
      chewing gum, a new and simple modality, has become a commonly applied method in order to&#xD;
      prevent and reduce the POI. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses revealed that chewing gum&#xD;
      provided significant benefits for the improvement of postoperative bowel function. More&#xD;
      importantly, many official guidelines recommend chewing gum for an evidence-based approach in&#xD;
      the prevention of POI. Despite these positive evidence, three newest randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials are unable to demonstrate an effect of chewing gum on the recovery of bowel function&#xD;
      after colorectal resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to note that almost all previous randomized controlled trials are based on&#xD;
      small sample size. This raises the question whether postoperative SMD, acupuncture at the&#xD;
      tsusanli acupoint, or chewing gum can reduce risk of POI following colorectal resection among&#xD;
      patients with large sample size. To examine this question, we conducted this randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial to compare incidence of POI and length of hospital stay in colorectal cancer&#xD;
      patients who received SMD and acupuncture, chewing gum or no intervention following&#xD;
      resection.&#xD;

    <description>Participants allocated to SMD and acupuncture were asked to take oral SMD decoction (Hansen Co., Ltd., Yiyang, Hunan province, China, 10 mL/dose) three times per day beginning on the first day after colorectal resection. They also received bilateral injections of vitamin B1 (50 mg x 2) at the tsusanli acupoint one time per day. This intervention was performed for a total of 5 consecutive days or until flatus.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to chewing gum were instructed to chew commercially available sugar-free gum (Extra &amp; Reg, Wm.

This intervention was performed for 5 consecutive days or until flatus.</description>
