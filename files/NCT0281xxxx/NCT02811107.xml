  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is associated with discomfort but also with an increased risk of pain and/or&#xD;
      analgesic consumption. A prescription of anxiolytics is very common in pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      consultation but without considering the real anxiety level of the patients. The objective of&#xD;
      this premedication is mainly to improve patient comfort, to reduce patient anxiety and to&#xD;
      improve patient cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a study conducted in the 1990s, 40 to 80% of patients are anxious before&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequences of anxiety are somatic (tachycardia, hypertension, difficulty to falling&#xD;
      asleep), behavioural (aggressiveness, regression, fight against anaesthesia induction) and&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative area is a place of convergence for patients who need surgery or an&#xD;
      interventional procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staying in the preoperative area may be a source of anxiety and may affect the patient&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will interview patients undergoing surgery or interventional procedure to&#xD;
      assess their level of anxiety, pain and their experiences during their stay in preoperative&#xD;
      area. The objective is to analyse the level of anxiety and / or pain and their clinical&#xD;
      consequences, and then to assess the relationship with any potential premedication.&#xD;
