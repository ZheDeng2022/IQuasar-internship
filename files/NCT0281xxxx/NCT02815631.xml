  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CARDIOFLOW study compares the standard test, a pressure wire test called fractional flow&#xD;
      reserve (FFR), with a new method that is based on taking a detailed &quot;3D&quot; ECG called&#xD;
      Cardiogoniometry (CGM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFR is an angiographic technique which measures the physiological significance of a coronary&#xD;
      stenosis and trial data has shown that basing management decisions on this data improves&#xD;
      prognosis. However FFR studies are expensive and invasive, whereas CGM is painless and simply&#xD;
      involves placing 4 sticky pads to the patient's chest / back and is similar to an ECG (heart&#xD;
      tracing). The investigators want to see whether we can use this new method to find out&#xD;
      whether treatment with coronary angioplasty would be of benefit. If so, then in the future,&#xD;
      clinicians could use this method (CGM) rather than pressure wire assessment (FFR). This would&#xD;
      have several advantages; in particular, it can be easily performed in the clinic and avoids&#xD;
      the need to use an expensive pressure wire.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the hypothesis that cardiogoniometry (CGM) is helpful to identify&#xD;
      physiologically significant coronary artery stenosis in comparison to fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      (FFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Last year in the UK 202 098 patients underwent coronary angiography to determine whether they&#xD;
      had significant coronary artery disease. However, it is well recognised that, even with&#xD;
      orthogonal views, angiography is limited in terms of its ability to determine the functional&#xD;
      importance of coronary lesions. In particular those lesions judged to be 50-70% stenosed may&#xD;
      not necessarily cause ischaemia as this depends on factors such as the lesion length and,&#xD;
      importantly, the size of the territory supplied by the vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been several studies that have demonstrated the clinical utility of evaluating&#xD;
      such lesions with FFR. The measurement of FFR is an index of the physiological significance&#xD;
      of a coronary stenosis and is defined as the ratio of maximal blood flow in a stenotic artery&#xD;
      to normal maximal flow. It is calculated by comparing the ratio of the aortic pressure and&#xD;
      the pressure distal to the coronary stenosis during maximal hyperaemia. These pressures are&#xD;
      measured by introducing a coronary pressure guide wire into the artery and hyperaemia is&#xD;
      induced by giving an infusion of adenosine intravenously. An FFR ratio of &lt;0.80 indicates&#xD;
      that the coronary stenosis is causing significant ischaemia and would benefit from PCI. This&#xD;
      has since been incorporated into ESC clinical guidelines on myocardial revascularisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However this is an invasive procedure and the pressure wires are relatively expensive&#xD;
      compared to standard angioplasty wires. On the contrary, CGM is a cheap and non-invasive&#xD;
      technique that can be easily applied. The aim of the proposed study is to assess whether CGM&#xD;
      may be able to aid clinicians in identifying if a coronary stenosis is physiologically&#xD;
      significant at inducing myocardial ischaemia in conjunction with standard coronary&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM is form of 3D vector electrocardiography which can provide quantitative analysis of&#xD;
      myocardial depolarisation and repolarisation. It has been shown to be more sensitive and&#xD;
      specific than standard 12-lead ECG at diagnosing stable coronary artery disease. Furthermore,&#xD;
      other work has showed CGM to be more sensitive than 12-lead ECG at detecting patients with&#xD;
      ACS. More recently in 2012, further work found that CGM was more sensitive and specific than&#xD;
      the 12 lead ECG at identifying abnormal myocardial perfusion scans (MPS). FFR validity was&#xD;
      initially based on a comparison with MPS and therefore we hypothesise that CGM may be&#xD;
      comparable to FFR.&#xD;

    <description>Every patient involved in the study will undergo a series of CGM recordings whilst having their FFR procedure. These recordings will all be done whilst they are in the catheterisation laboratory and will be taking at the following points during the procedure.&#xD;
First baseline recording - taken when the patient first enters the catheterisation laboratory and is prepped for their procedure.&#xD;
Second baseline recording - taken when the FFR guide wire is in place in the coronary artery being assessed.&#xD;
Maximal hyperaemia recording - this will be taken when the patient is at maximal hyperaemia during their adenosine infusion for their FFR procedure.&#xD;
The patients involvement will then be finished in the study and will be cared for as per clinical practice.&#xD;
If the CGM records a result of anything less than 0, it will be regarded as a positive result.</description>
