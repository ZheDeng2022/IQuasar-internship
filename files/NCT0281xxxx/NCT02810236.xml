      The investigator hypothesizes that a benign directed ultrasound, when performed after a&#xD;
      normal digital mammogram, will provide women with focal breast pain additional reassurance&#xD;
      that the etiology of their symptom is benign. 160 women over the age of thirty with focal&#xD;
      breast pain who present to the Breast Imaging Clinic for evaluation between 3/1/2016 -&#xD;
      7/1/2018 will be selected and randomized to three groups using a block randomization&#xD;
      technique. All study participants will complete a survey assessing psychosocial factors, then&#xD;
      receive a digital mammogram. Patients with a negative mammogram will continue on with the&#xD;
      study and will either have a conversation about their negative mammogram with a radiologist&#xD;
      or receive a directed ultrasound. A second survey will be conducted assessing psychosocial&#xD;
      factors. All study participants who did not receive an ultrasound will receive an ultrasound&#xD;
      so that all study participants are provided with the standard of care for focal breast pain.&#xD;
      The results of the survey will be compared and appropriate statistical analyses such as an&#xD;
      Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test will be conducted to determine any statistically&#xD;
      significant differences between the three randomized groups. The risks/safety issues of this&#xD;
      study are believed to be minimal.&#xD;

      Protocol Title: Focal Breast Pain: Does a normal ultrasound provide reassurance?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the Study: The investigator hypothesizes that a benign directed ultrasound, when&#xD;
      performed after a normal digital mammogram, will provide women with focal breast pain&#xD;
      additional reassurance that the etiology of their symptom is benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background &amp; Significance: Breast pain is one of the most common symptoms for which women&#xD;
      seek medical care. While up to 80% of women experience breast pain at some point in their&#xD;
      lives, most commonly breast pain results from a benign etiology such as trauma, infection,&#xD;
      pregnancy, lactation, or simple cysts. In contrast, breast cancer is only reported in up to&#xD;
      7% of women presenting with focal breast pain. Despite the uncommon association between&#xD;
      breast cancer and focal breast pain, a diagnostic imaging workup is often requested. Current&#xD;
      American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria guidelines rate the use of&#xD;
      mammography and ultrasound for the evaluation of non-cyclical, focal, unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      breast pain in patients 30 years and older as &quot;may be appropriate.&quot; Traditionally both&#xD;
      mammography and ultrasound are performed in women over the age of 30, who present with&#xD;
      noncyclical, focal breast pain as imaging can often exclude a treatable benign cause of pain&#xD;
      and/or provide reassurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator recently completed a retrospective study evaluating the utility of digital&#xD;
      mammography and directed ultrasound in women with focal breast pain. It was observed that&#xD;
      performing directed ultrasound following digital mammography was potentially beneficial in&#xD;
      women with mammographically dense breast tissue. In contrast, the investigator demonstrated&#xD;
      that directed ultrasound in conjunction with digital mammography was of low utility in women&#xD;
      with non-dense breast tissue. These findings suggest that directed ultrasound might be&#xD;
      unnecessary in the work up of focal breast pain for women with non-dense breast tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is anecdotal evidence that a directed ultrasound yielding benign findings&#xD;
      following a normal digital mammogram might further reassure women that the cause of focal&#xD;
      breast pain is benign. These potential psychological benefits may drive the continued use of&#xD;
      ultrasound in the work up of focal breast pain, even though their diagnostic utility is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection, Recruitment, and Compensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team (Principal investigator (PI), Co-PI, and Study coordinator) will select up to&#xD;
      160 women, who present to the Breast Imaging Clinic for evaluation of focal breast pain&#xD;
      between 3/1/2016 - 7/1/2018. Inclusion criteria include women over the age of 30 with primary&#xD;
      focal breast pain, i.e. pain localizable by the patient to within one breast quadrant without&#xD;
      other associated symptoms. Women with diffuse, radiating, or axillary pain, associated&#xD;
      palpable findings at the site of pain, skin changes (erythema, thickening) or nipple changes&#xD;
      (discharge, retraction), currently pregnant or breast-feeding, history of recent trauma or&#xD;
      infection of the affected breast, and history of ipsilateral breast cancer will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the investigator's clinical judgement, the investigator anticipates a minimum effect&#xD;
      size of d=.4 for anxiety. A sample size of n =80 per group (total n = 160) has power of 0.8&#xD;
      to detect differences with an effect size of d=.4 using a one-tailed alpha = .05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include women referred for imaging because of focal breast pain and&#xD;
      women who report focal breast pain to the technologist or radiologist prior to imaging. Once&#xD;
      a patient is identified as a possible candidate, the PI, Co-PI, or study coordinator will&#xD;
      look at electronic medical record, Epic. to see if they meet inclusion criteria and do not&#xD;
      have any exclusion criteria. If there are none, the patient will be approached to see if they&#xD;
      are willing to participate in the study. While the number of patients who present in a&#xD;
      typical week to Duke with focal breast pain has not been studied, anecdotally, approximately&#xD;
      1-2 patients per day have been evaluated for focal breast pain. Study participants will not&#xD;
      be compensated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Process&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will include women referred for imaging because of focal breast pain and&#xD;
      women who report focal breast pain to the technologist or radiologist prior to imaging. Once&#xD;
      a patient is identified as a possible candidate, the PI, Co-PI, or study coordinator will&#xD;
      look at Epic to see if they meet inclusion criteria and do not have any exclusion criteria.&#xD;
      If there are none, the patient will be approached to see if they are willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study. Only a member of the study team (Karen Johnson, MD, Lars Grimm, MD, and Michael&#xD;
      Cho, MD) will approach a potential participant for the consent process. If a member of the&#xD;
      study team is not available, the potential subject will not be recruited. Subjects who are&#xD;
      able to provide legally effective consent will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the number of patients who present in a typical week to Duke with focal breast pain has&#xD;
      not been studied, anecdotally, approximately 1-2 patients per day have been evaluated for&#xD;
      focal breast pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will serve as the 3/2 research project for Michael Cho, MD. Dr. Cho has requested&#xD;
      37 weeks of dedicated research time during his 4th year to recruit patients. Dr. Cho will&#xD;
      continue to recruit patients during his Breast imaging fellowship if needed. As such, Dr. Cho&#xD;
      will be primarily responsible for the consent process. Dr. Cho will work with Steve Shipes to&#xD;
      learn about the consent process and Maestro data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient volunteers to participate, the investigator will utilize a block randomization&#xD;
      technique to randomize the study participants into two groups (Group A and B), ensuring&#xD;
      comparable numbers across the study groups. The patient will then be consented. Pertinent&#xD;
      demographic and medical data will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included study participants will be asked to complete a short survey, based on the State&#xD;
      Anxiety scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (18). This survey will primarily&#xD;
      assess psychosocial metrics, including, but not limited to anxiety, comfort, and level of&#xD;
      concern for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will receive a digital mammogram, which is the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients presenting with focal breast pain. Patients with no imaging correlate to the focal&#xD;
      breast pain (Breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) 1 and 2) will continue on&#xD;
      with the study. Patients with an imaging finding at the site of focal pain (BI-RADS 0, 4, or&#xD;
      5) will be excluded from the study and receive the standard care that is appropriate for the&#xD;
      imaging finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with BI-RADS 1 and 2 digital mammograms will proceed with the study and be informed of&#xD;
      their imaging findings. Study participants randomized to Group A will receive their mammogram&#xD;
      results from a Breast imaging fellow or fellowship trained Breast imaging radiologist.&#xD;
      Participants in Group B will receive their mammogram results from a Breast imaging fellow or&#xD;
      fellowship trained Breast imaging radiologist and additionally receive a directed ultrasound&#xD;
      in the area of focal pain, which is the standard of care for focal breast pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will be asked to complete a second survey, based on the State Anxiety&#xD;
      scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Groups A will receive a directed ultrasound of their breast at the end of the&#xD;
      visit ensuring that all women receive the standard of care. One of the research collaborators&#xD;
      will approach subjects in groups A following the 2nd survey to disclose the minor deception&#xD;
      and explain to the subjects the necessity of the deception for the purposes of the study. The&#xD;
      collaborator will also explain that the current standard of care for patients with focal&#xD;
      breast pain is a targeted ultrasound. The standard of care ultrasound will then be performed&#xD;
      by a Breast imaging fellow or fellowship trained breast radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk/Benefit Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks of this study are believed to be minimal, including the potential loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality. The digital mammogram and directed ultrasound patients will receive are the&#xD;
      standard of practice for women with focal breast pain. Women in this study would have&#xD;
      received these imaging tests regardless of their participation in the study and therefore the&#xD;
      potential risks of imaging are not considered additional risks of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs to the Subject: There are no projected direct financial costs to the subjects involved&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis &amp; Statistical Considerations: The results of the survey will be compared and&#xD;
      appropriate statistical analyses including but not limited to analysis of variance and&#xD;
      multiple two sample t-tests conducted to determine any statistically significant differences&#xD;
      between the three randomized groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data &amp; Safety Monitoring: There are no anticipated safety concerns. The study coordinator&#xD;
      (MC) will be responsible for the data collection and storage. Paper surveys will be stored in&#xD;
      a locked cabinet in the Breast imaging reading room (Cancer Center Room 2S33) in the Cancer&#xD;
      Center Breast Imaging Department (Clinic 2-1) which is accessible by badge only. Any digital&#xD;
      data will be stored on an encrypted external hard drive (Western Digital) with a backup on&#xD;
      Duke approved cloud storage (Box) and DTHS managed shared drive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Privacy, Data Storage &amp; Confidentiality: A de-identification code will be assigned to the&#xD;
      patients to be used as their identifier. The linking code identifying the subject will be&#xD;
      kept for the duration of the study and will be securely stored on an encrypted external hard&#xD;
      drive (Western Digital) with a backup on Duke approved cloud storage (Box) and DTHS managed&#xD;
      shared drive.&#xD;
