      The GrantPax study is a multicenter phase 4 geriatric assessment directed trial to evaluate&#xD;
      gemcitabine +/- nab-paclitaxel in elderly pancreatic cancer patients. The primary objective&#xD;
      is that CGA-stratified patients do not decline in their CGA performance in response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy measured as a loss of five points or less in the Barthel's ADL, (ADL1 vs. ADL2&#xD;
      during core CGA assessment).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the proposed study is that individualized assessment directed treatment&#xD;
      algorithms identifies elderly patients, who benefit from combined nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine&#xD;
      therapy. The project uses a CGA, which includes various tests and scoring systems, to&#xD;
      stratify patients as &quot;GO-GO&quot;, &quot;SLOW-GO&quot; or &quot;FRAIL&quot; patients. Depending on test results&#xD;
      patients receive chemotherapy (GO-GO group: nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine; SLOW-GO group:&#xD;
      gemcitabine monotherapy) or best supportive care (FRAIL group). After the first cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (4 weeks) a subsequent CGA and a safety assessment will be performed to assign&#xD;
      patients to their definite treatment arm. The primary objective is that CGA-stratified&#xD;
      patients do not decline in their CGA performance in response to chemotherapy measured as a&#xD;
      loss of five points or less in the Barthel's ADL (ADL1 vs. ADL2 during core CGA assessment).&#xD;
