      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the beneficial effect of a spirulina water&#xD;
      extract (product named Spirulysat®) compared to a placebo in the blood level ratio of&#xD;
      oxidized LDL / total LDL cholesterol in subjects with metabolic syndrome after 12 weeks of&#xD;
      consumption&#xD;
