  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of alisertib and TAK-228 that can be given to participants with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors that are associated with HPV. Researchers also want to learn if the study drug&#xD;
      combination can help to control advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a&#xD;
      dose level based on when they join the study. Up to 5 dose levels of alisertib and TAK-228&#xD;
      will be tested. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of alisertib and TAK-228 is&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 14 participants will be enrolled onto a Dose Expansion group after the highest&#xD;
      tolerable dose combination has been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1-7 of each cycle, participant will take alisertib by mouth 2 times a day with a&#xD;
      glass of water (about 4 ounces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 3-18 of each cycle, participant will take TAK-228 by mouth 1 time a day Participant&#xD;
      should not eat or drink anything for 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking TAK-228.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will need to take their blood sugar levels every morning while they are on study.&#xD;
      Participant will be given a blood sugar monitor and the study staff will show them how to use&#xD;
      it. Participant will also have their blood sugar tested in the clinic Participant must fast&#xD;
      for at least 8 hours before each of these blood sugar tests. If the doctor thinks it is in&#xD;
      participant's best interest, this testing may be decreased to 1 time a week after the first 2&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test blood clotting,&#xD;
           participant's blood fat levels, and their blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2, you will have an EKG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time during Weeks 2 and 3 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) for routine tests and&#xD;
      to test participant's blood sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One (1) time a week during Cycles 1 and 2, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for&#xD;
      routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycle 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycle 3 and beyond, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn routine tests&#xD;
      and to test blood clotting, participant's blood fat levels, and their blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 2, 4, and 6 and then every 3 cycles, participant will have a CT, MRI, or&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant may continue taking the study drugs for as long as they are benefitting.&#xD;
      Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, if the doctor thinks it is in their best interest, if the&#xD;
      study is stopped, if they need treatment that is not allowed on this study, or if they are&#xD;
      unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days of participant's last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have an EKG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test blood clotting,&#xD;
           participant's blood fat levels, and their blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will have a CT, MRI, or PET scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Alisertib and TAK-228 are not FDA approved or commercially&#xD;
      available. They are currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 44 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
