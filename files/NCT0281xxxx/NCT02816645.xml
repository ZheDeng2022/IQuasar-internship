  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to track progression of Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      (PD) is essential while disease-modifying treatments are being developed. Many clinical&#xD;
      biological or imaging biomarkers have been tested but no &quot;gold standard&quot; has been found as of&#xD;
      yet. Among these, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relaxometry using R2* measurement (R2* =&#xD;
      1/T2*), which is a validated marker for estimating brain iron concentration, appears to be an&#xD;
      attractive technique because its safety, rapidly measured in clinical conditions and its ease&#xD;
      to ensure individual longitudinal follow-up. Current data of cross sectional studies of R2*,&#xD;
      which have shown an iron increase in Substantia Nigra (SN), led to suppose that it could be a&#xD;
      biomarker of disease vulnerability. Recently, the investigators have conducted the first&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up of R2* (1.5 T MRI), which showed a rapid R2* increase in both parts of&#xD;
      the SN and in the caudal putamen. We propose, here, a multicenter prospective study of&#xD;
      one-year cohort follow-up of R2* variations (ΔR2*) in three regions of interest (ROIs) (the&#xD;
      SN, the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and the Putamen) of 160 patients with PD, using a 3&#xD;
      Tesla MRI, to evaluate the potential interest of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression.&#xD;
      The variation of R2* (ΔR2*) will be correlated with clinical markers of disease progress,&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms. 80 healthy controls subjects will also be included to assess the effect&#xD;
      of aging on cerebral physiological iron levels.&#xD;

      Type of study : Interventional multicenter prospective study of cohort follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centers : 6 (Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, Grenoble, Paris, Limoges, Lille)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 patients with Parkinson's disease divided into four subgroups of 40 patients according to&#xD;
      disease duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 5 and 10 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 10 and 15 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt; 15 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, 80 sex-age matched healthy controls subjects matched equally distributed in the&#xD;
      4 groups (n = 20/group) based on a stratified plan by gender and age (ratio 1:2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed twice, one year apart by the procedures detailed below. The two&#xD;
      neurological assessments should be made by the same certified neurologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 0) (duration: 1 day or 2 half days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signature of an informed consent form (only at Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease duration, treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-administered questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st MRI acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 0 + 1 year) (duration: 1 day or 2 half days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatment(s), adverse event(s), serious adverse event(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-administered questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2d MRI acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matched healthy controls subjects' procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (Day 0) (duration: 1 half day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signature of an informed consent form (only at Day 0).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease duration, treatments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1st MRI acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (Day 0 + 1 year) (duration: 1 half day)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current treatment(s), adverse event(s), serious adverse event(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief neuropsychological evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2d MRI acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI acquisition (duration: 45 to 60 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be performed on a 3 Tesla MRI, allowing a substantial gain in&#xD;
      signal-to-noise ratio compared with the one obtained at 1.5 Tesla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different sequences will be planned:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2-weighted sequence * 3D GRE multi-echo. This sequence will generate a R2* maps of the&#xD;
           whole brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T1-weighted sequence in high resolution 3D. This sequence will allow the anatomical&#xD;
           characterization of different brain structures and will help the normalization of T2* in&#xD;
           pictures an anatomical reference space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  T2* sequence 3D multiple gradient echo (Spoiled Gradient Recalled echo sequence). This&#xD;
           sequence will measure the decay rate of NMR signal according to the echo time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2D spin echo sequence T1-weighted for neuromelanin. This sequence view the substantia&#xD;
           nigra and locus coeruleus (optional sequence).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Optional Diffusion-weighted sequence. This sequence determines the movements of water&#xD;
           molecule in the brain and to infer the main lines of connections between neurons&#xD;
           (optional sequence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The R2* (1/T2*) will be measured in three different regions of interest (substantia nigra,&#xD;
      ventral tegmental area and the putamen) for the 2 MRI's in order to calculate ΔR2.&#xD;
