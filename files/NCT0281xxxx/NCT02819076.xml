    <textblock>
      Maternity and neonatology, caregivers are regularly confronted with the pain of the newborn,&#xD;
      especially after a birth injury, but it is sometimes difficult ti define.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is not, to our knowledge, any prevalence study of pain in newborn motherhood. The data&#xD;
      available are those of the perinatal survey 2010, with the number of operative vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries (5.3% of suction, forceps 3.9%, 2.9% spatulas) and the number of extractions the&#xD;
      seat (4.7%). These delivery modes can be purveyors of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At St. Joseph's Hospital, there were in 2013: 259 instrumental deliveries and 90 extractions&#xD;
      by headquarters. Fifty five paracetamol bottles were consumed in the layer sequence in 2013,&#xD;
      and 15 in the delivery room. But this consumption is a poor reflection of the pain because&#xD;
      treatment could be given pain-authenticated (measured with the EDIN scale), and because a&#xD;
      bottle is discarded one month after opening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scales measuring pain used in the new-born at term based on the assessment of change in&#xD;
      behavior; two specific scores of the newborn are used in France: Pain and Discomfort Scale&#xD;
      Newborn (EDIN) for prolonged pain and Acute Pain scale Newborn (DAN) for acute pain related&#xD;
      to health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EVENDOL scale (Child Pain Evaluation) has been validated for pediatric emergencies in&#xD;
      children 0-7 years, as well as pre-hospital, to measure the intensity of pain whether acute&#xD;
      or prolonged (8 ). It is easy and fast to use. validation cohorts included a significant&#xD;
      proportion of newborns. This scale appears suitable for evaluation of the newborn to term&#xD;
      maternity&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal: validation of the instrument &quot;EVENDOL&quot; in the new-born at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EVENDOL is equivalent to EDIN to diagnose the pain of the newborn at term.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  While being faster and easier to dimension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EVENDOL preferred by caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology and conduct of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Study of practical evaluation of observational, prospective, multicenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Places of study: maternity of Saint Joseph Hospital, and Kremlin Bicetre. A feasibility study&#xD;
      is underway, it was started in neonatology Antoine Béclère. Time study: 12 to 18 months&#xD;
      Required subjects: 100 patients (1/3 painless children, 2/3 of painful children).&#xD;
