  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal adenocarcinomas are closely related to wood dust exposure. The precise mechanisms of&#xD;
      carcinogenesis leading to the transformation of the respiratory mucosa into a colonic-like&#xD;
      mucosa remain unknown: chronic exposure to wood dust may cause chronic inflammation that may&#xD;
      lead to pre-degenerative lesions, hypothesis yet unconfirmed. The tumor development requires&#xD;
      the activation of a particular gene: CDX2. The working hypothesis is that chronic wood dust&#xD;
      exposure is responsible for changes in genes of inflammation, which can in turn lead to&#xD;
      changes in the expression of CDX2 and its cofactors, thus making possible the genesis of&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. This work is a pilot study aiming to better understand the mechanisms of&#xD;
      carcinogenesis, and to study the feasibility of a larger prospective screening for&#xD;
      woodworkers adenocarcinomas. Cells will be obtained from the at risk area (olfactory cleft)&#xD;
      by a noninvasive method (brushing) in healthy volunteers (unexposed to wood dust) and in&#xD;
      exposed volunteers to compare their genomes and study the genomic changes related to wood&#xD;
      dust exposure.&#xD;

      Pilot study, single center, prospective and retrospective, aiming to better understand the&#xD;
      mechanisms of carcinogenesis of nasal adenocarcinoma among 2 groups of subjects based on&#xD;
      their potential risk of nasal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited prospectively, in the ENT department (Prof. R. JANKOWSKI-Institut&#xD;
      Lorrain Heart and vessels Louis Mathieu -Hospitals Brabois-CHU Nancy), during a visit for&#xD;
      another medical reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will be divided into 2 groups as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: NON EXPOSED : control group: patients not exposed to wood dust (low risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: EXPOSED: patients exposed to wood dust (high risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After complete information, inclusion in the study will be proposed to patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      If inclusion is accepted, patients will undergo, during the nasal fiber endoscopy (performed&#xD;
      for care), and under local anesthesia (performed for care), a brushing of the most accessible&#xD;
      olfactory clef (performed for research). These samples will be compared to tumor samples&#xD;
      which are already available (REFCOR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples of groups 1 and 2 will be sent directly to the laboratory of Pathological Anatomy&#xD;
      Cytology (Pr-J.M. VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy). They will briefly vortexed (5 min)&#xD;
      and frozen. They will be kept in the laboratory of Pathological Anatomy Cytology (Pr-J.M.&#xD;
      VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy) until analysis. The samples will be transferred from the&#xD;
      laboratory of Pathological Anatomy Cytology (Pr-J.M. VIGNAUD Hospital Brabois- CHU Nancy) to&#xD;
      the Genomics Platform (INSERM, U954, Prof. JL GUEANT- Faculty of Medicine, University of&#xD;
      Lorraine), for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNA will be extracted from olfactory cells , using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) with DNase&#xD;
      treatment. The concentration and purity of the DNA / RNA will be measured (OD at 230nm, 260nm&#xD;
      and 280nm) with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nyxor). The RNA integrity will be determined&#xD;
      from the profiles of ribosomal RNAs (18S &amp; 28S) measured on LabOnChip® (2100 Bioanalyzer&#xD;
      System, Agilent Technologies). The RNA samples will be stored at -80 ° C until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcriptome analysis will be conducted on chips Whole Human Genome 60K * 8 developed by&#xD;
      Agilent®, and according to the manufacturer's protocol (single-color Agilent protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the research samples will be destroyed.&#xD;
