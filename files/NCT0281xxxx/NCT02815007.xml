      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chidamide with EGFR-TKI&#xD;
      for Advanced EGFR-TKI-resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (1)The efficacy of the regimen is evaluated by objective remission rate, disease control&#xD;
      rate, progress free survival, duration of remission, overall survival, time to progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety is monitored by vital signs, blood routine test, liver function, kidney function and&#xD;
      electrolytes level, ECG, and cardiac ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the data is documented by CRF form, and carefully preserved.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung carcinoma with EGFR 19/21 point mutation, verified&#xD;
             by histology or cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Achieved remission (CR or PR) over previous EGFR-TKI treatment; or achieved stable&#xD;
             disease (SD) ≥ 6 months over previous EGFR-TKI treatment; disease progression emerged&#xD;
             during the following EGFR-TKI treatment (within the past 30 days); no other treatment&#xD;
             employed after the withdrawn of EGFR-TKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age ≥18 years, male or female;&#xD;

             treated by radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. General condition should be ECOG 0-2, expected survival ≥ 3 months.&#xD;

             Bone marrow: absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet ≥100 × 109/L, Hb ≥&#xD;
             90g/L; Liver: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times of the normal maximum, ALT and AST≤ 2.5&#xD;
             times of the normal maximum. (ALT/AST≤ 5 times of the normal maximum for patients with&#xD;

             results differ largely from the two formula, other methods for creatinine clearance&#xD;
             rate calculation should be employed, like the EDTA method, inulin clearance method or&#xD;
             24 hour urine analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
