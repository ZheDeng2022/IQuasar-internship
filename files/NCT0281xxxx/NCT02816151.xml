  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detrusor hyperactivity is an urodynamic observation defined by involuntary detrusor&#xD;
      contractions during the vesical filling. Within neurological bladders childs, especially&#xD;
      related to spinal dysraphisms, this hyperactivity, associated or not with vesical compliance&#xD;
      disorders, can involve a urinary incontinence obstructing social integration and possibly&#xD;
      vesical pressure rise in the intra- potentially generating the high urinary tract lesions.&#xD;
      Anticholinergic drugs possibly associated with a vesical draining constitute the treatment of&#xD;
      first intention. In approximately 15 to 20% of the cases, intradetrusor iterative injections&#xD;
      of type A Botulinum Toxin are proposed fault of satisfactory results. Largely used according&#xD;
      to the European consensus of 2008 without AM, actual studies remain realized on small numbers&#xD;
      with low level of proof. Posology remains discussed between pharmaceutical laboratories&#xD;
      (derivative of the effective maximum amount per adult kg of weight) and weaker amounts used&#xD;
      with clinical results.&#xD;

      The main aim of the study is to so determine dosages with mid--amount of TBA would make it&#xD;
      possible to anticipate not-inferiors results with full posology and to determine the benefit&#xD;
      ratio/risk improvement. This could lead to an important reduction of the treatment costs.&#xD;
      This study also aims to better identy the &quot;non responders&quot; patients in order to refine the&#xD;
      indications. Thanks to the participation of a French urologic paediatric surgery centers, the&#xD;
      study hope to homogenize practices and to use standardized common criteria of judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, this study should appreciate if it is possible not to more bring back posology to the&#xD;
      weight of the child, but on detrusor surface allowing a more precise estimation of the&#xD;
      amounts to be managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complementary study on the quality of life of these children before and after treatment&#xD;
      will be carried out thanks to Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ 50). The diagram of the study&#xD;
      is a randomized therapeutic test controlled not-inferiority aiming at comparing an amount&#xD;
      full versus an half-amount with TBA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of the study will be made up children from 3 to 15 years treated for detrusor&#xD;
      hyperactivity, confirmed by an aurodynamic assessment according to the criteria of&#xD;
      International the Society Continence, origin neurological, and resistant to the medical care&#xD;
      associated with the usual accompanying measures.&#xD;
