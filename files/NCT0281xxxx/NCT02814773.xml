  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With nearly one million cases of dementia in France in 2010, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and&#xD;
      related syndromes are a major public health issue. The lake of drug for treatment or&#xD;
      preventing AD, health related quality of life (HRQoL) became an essential criterion of&#xD;
      evaluation to assess the treatment strategies of patients. Generic HRQoL tools are generally&#xD;
      less sensitive for a given disease. That is why other specific tools for AD have been&#xD;
      developed. None of them was validated in French. The aim of this study was therefore, after a&#xD;
      review of the literature, to achieve a cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation&#xD;
      of the &quot;Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease&quot; (QoL-AD) and &quot;Dementia Quality of Life&quot;&#xD;
      (DQoL). These two questionnaires were selected because they were the most popular in English-&#xD;
      language literature for this disease.This study concerned a total of 155 patient-caregiver&#xD;
      pairs recruited from six French hospitals and a Francophone Swiss center. Patients had a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of AD (mild stage to moderate: Mini Mental State Examination ≥ 10).&#xD;
      QoL-AD and DQoL were administered by an interviewer. The caregiver sheet of QoL-AD was&#xD;
      self-administered. Cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation have been carried&#xD;
      out for these two questionnaires.&#xD;

      of QoL-AD was self-administered. Cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation have&#xD;
      been carried out for these two questionnaires. First step: the linguistic adaptation will be&#xD;
      performed according to the latest available methodology: that of the &quot; Institute for Work and&#xD;
      Health &quot;, as recommended 6 phases. Second step: the psychometric validation will be done&#xD;
      after a multicentric study, cross repeated at weekly intervals for the validation phase ,&#xD;
      with two longitudinal points for the assessment phase of sensitivity to change. Analysis of&#xD;
      the results will help define the applicability criteria and psychometric acceptability to&#xD;
      know the validity of the adapted instrument that is to say, its content validity , validity&#xD;
      of perceived, validity of structure, validity of agreement , its discriminative ability ,&#xD;
      reliability explored by internal consistency and stability over time. Longitudinal follow-up&#xD;
      of patients is expected to also assess the sensitivity to change .&#xD;
