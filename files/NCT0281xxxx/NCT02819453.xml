  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is acknowledged that IL-18, as a product of the inflammasome, is involved in host defence&#xD;
      against viral and bacterial stimuli by modulating the immune response. The aim of this study&#xD;
      was to determine IL-18 levels in serum of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      and to investigate whether corticosteroid attenuate its levels. In addition, to explore the&#xD;
      effect of corticosteroid therapy on the prognosis of ARDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by an inflammatory injury to the&#xD;
      lung that is characterized clinically by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Pathologically&#xD;
      complex changes in the lung are manifested by an early, exudative phase followed by&#xD;
      proliferative and fibrotic phases. Persistent ARDS is characterized by ongoing inflammation,&#xD;
      parenchymal-cell proliferation, and disordered deposition of collagen, all of which may be&#xD;
      responsive to corticosteroid therapy. Systemic corticosteroids have been considered a&#xD;
      potentially beneficial therapy. However, several studies have failed to provide convincing&#xD;
      evidence to prove the efficacy of corticosteroids in decreasing the mortality of ARDS. For&#xD;
      the secondary outcomes, such as oxygenation improvement and reduction of the duration of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, have shown consistent findings in favor of corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
      However, the underlying mechanisms that account for the anti-inflammatory actions of&#xD;
      corticosteroid in ARDS patients have not yet to be elucidated, and the activities do not&#xD;
      appear to be controlled by a single mechanism. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), along with&#xD;
      interleukin-1b (IL-1b), is produced by inflammasomes when activated by a number of pathogen,&#xD;
      environmental or host-derived danger signals. Inflammasomes are innate immune regulatory&#xD;
      protein complexes which seem to play a key role in the host immune response of patients with&#xD;
      ARDS. The aim of this study is to determine the role of steroid on IL-18 levels in serum of&#xD;
      patients with ARDS and its effect on prognosis.&#xD;
