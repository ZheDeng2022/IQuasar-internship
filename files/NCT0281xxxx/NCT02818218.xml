      Consecutive patients undergoing liver transplant surgery will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Before surgical incision, during the preanhepatic phase, during the anhepatic phase, during&#xD;
      the postanhepatic phase and following closure of the deep fascial layer of the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall simultaneous measurement of SVC diameter, SBC collapsibility index and CVP&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central venous pressure (CVP) measured invasively through a central venous catheter in the&#xD;
      internal jugular vein or through a right atrial port of a pulmonary artery catheter is&#xD;
      commonly used during liver transplant surgery. CVP measurements at the SVC-RA junction are a&#xD;
      function of circulating blood volume, right ventricle function, intrathoracic pressure. CVP&#xD;
      measurements can also be affected by the presence of tricuspid regurgitation. Because central&#xD;
      venous pressure measurements are determined by several factors and do not predict the&#xD;
      response to subsequent fluid bolus administration, they are considered &quot;static measures&quot; and&#xD;
      are poor indicators of fluid responsiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the entirely intrathoracic location of the superior vena cava (SVC), its diameter and&#xD;
      collapsibility with positive pressure ventilation it is a potentially attractive method of&#xD;
      non-invasively estimating CVP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SVC diameter and collapsibility index, dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness have been&#xD;
      successfully utilized as echocardiographic indices for fluid responsiveness in ventilated&#xD;
      septic patients. Whether SVC collapsibility is correlated with CVP measurements in liver&#xD;
      transplant patients is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients undergoing liver transplant surgery will be included in the study.&#xD;
      Before surgical incision, during the preanhepatic phase, during the anhepatic phase, during&#xD;
      the postanhepatic phase and following closure of the deep fascial layer of the anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall simultaneous measurement of SVC diameter, SBC collapsibility index and CVP&#xD;
      will be recorded.&#xD;
