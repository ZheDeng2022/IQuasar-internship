  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carnosine (made by bonding β-alanine and histidine) has been suggested to contribute to the&#xD;
      extension of physical exercise, counteracting the decline in muscle performance due to&#xD;
      fatigue. However this process is largely restricted by the levels of β-alanine available in&#xD;
      the human body. Carnosine levels can be raised through long term ingestion of food products,&#xD;
      such as meat, fish and poultry, however it can also be significantly increased by β-alanine&#xD;
      supplementation. Improved β-alanine levels can potentially advance exercise capacity and&#xD;
      exercise performance, which may have been previously limited. Recently research has&#xD;
      demonstrated no beneficial effect of β-alanine supplementation on neuromuscular performance&#xD;
      in active, healthy males when they were well rested, with no prior exercise or fatigue of the&#xD;
      assessed muscle. It remains unknown if β-alanine supplementation would aid physical&#xD;
      performance when the muscle has already been fatigued. This is currently being investigated&#xD;
      in older adults (60-80 years), however there is no clear comparison between the potential&#xD;
      effects in younger and older participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this investigation hopes to examine the effects of 4 week β-alanine supplementation&#xD;
      on lower limb contractile and force properties, pre and post muscle specific fatigue in 18-30&#xD;
      year old males.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a naturally occurring dipeptide formed by bonding&#xD;
      histidine and β-alanine in a reaction catalysed by carnosine synthase. One role of carnosine&#xD;
      within the human system, is as an intracellular pH buffer due to its pKa of 6.83. Carnosine&#xD;
      is suitable over the whole exercise induced intramuscular pH transit-range. Carnosine in&#xD;
      untrained populations can neutralise 2.4 to 10.1mmol H+.kg-1 of dry mass muscle as&#xD;
      intramuscular pH declines, adding at least 7% to 10% to total intramuscular buffering&#xD;
      capacity. It has also been argued that carnosine in combination with anserine can contribute&#xD;
      as much as 40% to the buffering capacity between pH ranges of 6.5 to 7.5. β-alanine has been&#xD;
      suggested as the rate limiting factor for muscle carnosine synthesis, through ingestion of&#xD;
      β-alanine in diet (meat, fish and poultry) or via short-term supplementation, demonstrating&#xD;
      significant increases in muscle carnosine concentrations. Increases in carnosine&#xD;
      concentrations between 40% and 80% have been shown, depending upon dose (between 3.2 and 6.4&#xD;
      g·d-1) and duration of administration (between 4 and 10 weeks). Increasing β-alanine&#xD;
      concentrations therefore enhance carnosine synthesis with the muscle fibers and improves&#xD;
      intramuscular buffering capacity. Exercise performance and capacity measurements that&#xD;
      previously were limited by the accumulation of H+ have been demonstrated significant&#xD;
      improvements through supplementation with β-alanine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research already conducted at Nottingham Trent University and approved by this ethical&#xD;
      advisory committee has demonstrated no significant effect of β-alanine supplementation on&#xD;
      neuromuscular performance in healthy, active males. However, this research was conducted with&#xD;
      well rested participants, with no prior exercise or fatigue of the assessed muscle; therefore&#xD;
      there was no accumulation of H+ demonstrated within the muscle. These previous investigations&#xD;
      are therefore contemplating how β-alanine supplementation alters performance when&#xD;
      intramuscular buffering has not been altered (at the start of the exercise), whereas the&#xD;
      proposed study will examine the effect of β-alanine supplementation on performance when&#xD;
      intramuscular pH has already been challenged (due to fatiguing exercise). It is hypothesised&#xD;
      that β-alanine supplementation over 4 weeks will beneficially alter the contractile and force&#xD;
      properties of the muscle fibres within the lower limb muscles, improving physical performance&#xD;
      when the muscle is already fatigued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the effects of 4 week β-alanine supplementation on knee extensor contractile and&#xD;
      force properties, pre and post induced muscle specific fatigue in 18-30 year old males.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be supplemented with 6.4g·d-1 β-alanine (CarnoSyn™, NAI, USA). The β-alanine dosing regimen will consist of two 800 mg tablets four times per day at 3-4 hour intervals or the same regimen for placebo tablets. The use of multiple small doses throughout the day has been used in numerous studies using β-alanine in solutions or gelatine capsules (Hoffman et al., 2008; Sale et al., 2011; Saunders et al., 2012; Sale et al., 2012; Tobias et al., 2013) in order to circumvent potential symptoms of paraesthesia (see box xii for possible risks and discomforts). Overall increases have been shown to be between 40% and 80% depending upon dose (between 3.2 and 6.4 g·d-1) and duration of administration (between 4 and 10 weeks) (Sale et al., 2012).</description>
