    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by an&#xD;
      inflammatory pulmonary edema, severe hypoxia and endothelial and epithelial diffuse&#xD;
      aggression. A European study estimated that this disease represents 7% of admissions to&#xD;
      intensive care. Despite progress on the modalities of mechanical ventilation, mortality is&#xD;
      always between 25 and 55%. The definition of this syndrome was recently amended by&#xD;
      individualizing three sub groups based on the importance of hypoxemia (mild, moderate and&#xD;
      severe). Achieving a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by bronchoscopy remains a gold standard in&#xD;
      the initial research of pulmonary infectious cause or secondarily face the suspicion of&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia. Cardio pulmonary consequences of this act are not well known&#xD;
      in patients with ARDS. The first studies on the consequences of a bronchoscopy on oxygenation&#xD;
      of a patient breathing spontaneously have 40 years. More recent work showed a simple&#xD;
      bronchoscopy could in the mechanically ventilated patient cause an average decrease of 26%&#xD;
      from the base of PaO2, 10% of the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a significant increase in&#xD;
      cardiac output. The existence of ARDS was an independent risk factor associated with&#xD;
      hypoxemia. A study by published in Crit Care Med in 1990 can serve as a reference in&#xD;
      ventilated patients benefiting from BAL by bronchoscopy: in a subgroup of 26 patients, 23% of&#xD;
      patients required an increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) post procedure. A&#xD;
      study compared changes in PaO2/FiO2 after BAL with and without endoscopy among patients&#xD;
      without (n = 23) or with pneumonia (n = 11): the decrease in PaO2/FiO2 was significant only&#xD;
      in the &quot;pneumonia&quot; group. In a study of 30 patients ventilated but not hypoxic , PaO2 was&#xD;
      still reduced by 20% 2 hours after the completion of a BAL in 40% of patients. A&#xD;
      retrospective series of 99 ventilated patients but not hypoxic, shows that the BAL was well&#xD;
      tolerated in accordance with a pre oxygenation procedure 15 min and by gradually decreasing&#xD;
      the FiO 2 after the end of the procedure. BAL also appears well tolerated in a study of 12&#xD;
      patients ventilated under sedation and muscle relaxation, in shock and in need of positive&#xD;
      expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 10 cm H2O but the authors show a decrease in PaO2 that&#xD;
      extends well beyond the end of the intervention. Their conclusion is going to offer less&#xD;
      invasive diagnostic techniques for patients with PaO2 less than 60 mm. No study has targeted&#xD;
      the respiratory and hemodynamic consequences of this technique depending on the intensity of&#xD;
      ARDS (mild, moderate or severe).&#xD;
