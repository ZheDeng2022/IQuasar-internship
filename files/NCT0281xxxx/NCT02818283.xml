  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART, HIV medications) dramatically increases the expected&#xD;
      lifespan of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)infected patients; yet, the risks for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as heart attacks and stroke, are increased in this&#xD;
      population. This increased risk may be linked to persistent inflammation and activation of&#xD;
      the immune system. Although the relationship between cardiovascular disease and HIV-infected&#xD;
      individuals who are taking HIV medications is not well understood, the team of researchers&#xD;
      involved in this study observed that a diet rich in soy, at levels recommended by the FDA&#xD;
      (Federal Drug Administration), improved cholesterol levels and inflammation in individuals&#xD;
      not infected with HIV. From this study, the researchers hope to gain understanding on how&#xD;
      dietary soy will impact HIV-infected individuals who are taking HIV medications. Two pretzels&#xD;
      with and without soy developed at OSU (Ohio State University) in the Department of Food&#xD;
      Science and Technology and used in previous clinical trials will be used to investigate how&#xD;
      the pretzel snacks will affect your cardiovascular disease risk, immunity, and how your body&#xD;
      breaks down naturally occurring chemicals from soy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will significantly advance our knowledge of how dietary soy impacts lipid levels&#xD;
      and composition, metabolic parameters and inflammation in HIV+ patients treated with&#xD;
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART). HIV+ persons are at increased risk for CVD, and both HIV and&#xD;
      ART are associated with metabolic perturbations (including lipid disturbances) and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation. There is growing recognition that correcting these perturbations may improve&#xD;
      life expectancy. Two clinical trials, first a short-term single armed study, followed by a&#xD;
      two armed, placebo controlled, crossover clinical trial, will be used to address the&#xD;
      feasibility of a soy-based, functional food intervention and the impact of that intervention&#xD;
      on metabolic and immunomodulatory parameters. Daily pretzel dosing of two packets was&#xD;
      determined from prior clinical trials with soy bread in patients with prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      use of a food-based delivery vehicle has many advantages compared to using a dietary&#xD;
      supplement as it provides a strategy to deliver a complexity of bioactive compounds found&#xD;
      only in whole food ingredients. We hypothesize that the soy pretzel formulation will be well&#xD;
      tolerated with excellent adherence (&gt;95%) among ART-treated HIV+ patients with moderate&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia. The short-term dose confirmation study (n=20) will be a 6 week study&#xD;
      using a single intervention and single dose of soy pretzels to determine Grade 1 and 2&#xD;
      toxicities, compliance, and tolerability of soy pretzels in ART-treated HIV+ patients with&#xD;
      moderate hypercholesterolemia. Once, we have confirmed the short-term feasibility of soy&#xD;
      pretzels, a subsequent longer-term study will involve a 28 week randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, crossover trial (n=80) with soy and wheat (placebo) pretzels. Overall,&#xD;
      the short-term dose confirmation study will provide the necessary clinical data required to&#xD;
      move this intervention forward to the long-term placebo controlled trial. Both studies will&#xD;
      provide us with valuable biologic material to assess changes in cardiovascular and immune&#xD;
      biomarkers relevant to ART-treated HIV+ patients to facilitate future large-scale studies&#xD;
      investigating individual differences in soy isoflavone metabolism within this patient&#xD;
      population. Specifically, the short-term dose confirmation study will include those&#xD;
      participants who are screened and meet eligibility which will be determined using results&#xD;
      from a 12 hr fasting lipid panel which includes total cholesterol (TC), low density&#xD;
      lipoproteins (LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and triglycerides; health history; and&#xD;
      the 2013 American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk calculator. Eligible participants will be enrolled and then instructed to&#xD;
      follow a legume-free diet (avoid beans, soy beans, lentils, bean sprouts, and peanuts) for&#xD;
      two weeks, abstain from other vitamins or dietary supplements, and follow the provided&#xD;
      standardized multivitamin regimen. Participants will return to clinic for a fasting blood&#xD;
      collection and submit a 24 hour urine collection at week 0. At the end of this visit,&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to consume one packet (10 pieces) of soy pretzels twice daily&#xD;
      and continue to follow the legume-free diet with the provided multivitamin regimen.&#xD;
      Participants will return after 4 weeks to obtain a second month's supply of study agents.&#xD;
      Subjects will return after a second 4 weeks for a fasting blood collection and to submit a&#xD;
      completed 24 hr urine collection. The subsequent placebo controlled study will include the&#xD;
      same criteria used for the earlier short-term study. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      either a soy pretzel intervention (1 packet of pretzels twice/day: total 20 pieces delivering&#xD;
      24g soy protein and ~60mg isoflavones) or a wheat pretzel intervention (placebo, 1 packet of&#xD;
      pretzels twice/day: total 20 pieces containing 0g soy protein and 0mg isoflavones) for 12&#xD;
      weeks before crossing over to the other pretzel intervention for a second 12 weeks. A&#xD;
      two-week washout period involving a legume-free diet and standardized multivitamin regimen,&#xD;
      similar to the short-term study, will precede each intervention period. Blood and 24-hour&#xD;
      urine will be collected at the specified time points to evaluate the sustained effects of the&#xD;
      soy pretzel intervention on biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, immune function, and&#xD;
      metabolites of isoflavone intervention. This study addresses an innovative approach of&#xD;
      utilizing a dietary soy snack food to reduce cardiac risk and to explore multiple drivers of&#xD;
      immune activation in HIV disease (pro-inflammatory lipids, microbial translocation, and the&#xD;
      cytokines they induce) increasing the likelihood that we will generate results that impact&#xD;
      clinically relevant indices of HIV disease progression.&#xD;
