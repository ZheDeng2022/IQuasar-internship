      Feasibility trial on the use of a hybrid optical device integrating time-resolved&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy (TRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) for measurement&#xD;
      of cerebral oxygen metabolism and blood flow in neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device wil be tested in four settings measuring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in cerebral oxygenation and haemodynamics after birth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. precision and repeatability&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The cerebral vaso-reactivity to arterial carbon dioxide&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of the user-friendliness and loss of signal in routine care&#xD;

      The BabyLux project aims to provide a precise, accurate, and robust device to continuously&#xD;
      monitor cerebral oxygen metabolism and blood flow in critically ill newborn infants. This&#xD;
      will be achieved by combining time resolved near-infrared spectroscopy (TRS) with newly&#xD;
      developed diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) in a single device. The innovative aspects&#xD;
      of the project are related to the use of advanced solutions, based on state-of-the-art&#xD;
      photonic components, which have already been tested in laboratory and clinical tests on&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time Resolved Near-infrared spectroscopy and Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed solution will integrate two advanced photonic techniques, TRS and DCS. Both&#xD;
      techniques rely on the use of an optical fibre probe (sensor) to illuminate with very low&#xD;
      power near-infrared light the scalp and to collect the diffusively reflected optical signal&#xD;
      that has propagated through the scalp and skull, and therefore carries information on the&#xD;
      deeper cortical region. The different absorption spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated&#xD;
      haemoglobin in the near-infrared range allows for the non-invasive monitoring of the two&#xD;
      species in the cortical tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRS and DCS prototypes are available and have been technically tested in laboratory settings&#xD;
      and successfully validated during preclinical trials on adult volunteers and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured TRS/DCS parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRS measures the attenuation and the temporal broadening of relatively short light pulses&#xD;
      (pulse duration ~100 ps) through a diffusive medium (e.g. a neonate's head). TRS has the&#xD;
      ability to resolve path-lengths (or equivalently time-of-flights) of photons that have&#xD;
      propagated through the tissues. This enables TRS to separate the absorption and scattering&#xD;
      coefficients allowing for absolute measurements, and to utilize time-gating of path-lengths&#xD;
      to emphasize signals from deeper tissues. This is particularly important for separating&#xD;
      intra- and extra-cerebral signals for brain monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCS relies on the fact that temporal correlation of light fields in turbid media also obeys a&#xD;
      diffusion equation, albeit a slightly different one than is used for TRS. Thus DCS shares the&#xD;
      light penetration advantages of TRS, but, since DCS explicitly measures red blood cell&#xD;
      movement, it provides a direct measure of quantities such as cerebral blood flow (CBF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific combination of DCS and TRS allows for the assessment of cerebral oxygen&#xD;
      metabolism and CBF in a complete (i.e. CBF and oxygenation are simultaneously and&#xD;
      independently provided), accurate (i.e. based on absolute measurements of optical parameters)&#xD;
      and robust (i.e. potentially less affected by artefacts related to superficial systemic&#xD;
      activity or sensor/head movements) way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform clinical measurements using the BabyLux instrument in&#xD;
      different clinical real-life settings to validate this new technology in terms of&#xD;
      feasibility, repeatability of measurements, and user friendliness in neonatal medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BabyLux system is tested in four different real-life settings to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The increase in oxygenation and change in blood flow during the minutes after birth to&#xD;
           specify the expected range of measurement;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The precision and repeatability of measurements by reapplying the NIRS sensor several&#xD;
           times on slightly different sites of the head in a relatively steady condition;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The cerebral vaso-reactivity to arterial carbon dioxide tension in mechanically&#xD;
           ventilated newborns to monitor induced changes in cerebral blood flow;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The user-friendliness and loss of signal in routine care situations (e.g. during 24-hour&#xD;
           monitoring of neonates undergoing intensive care).&#xD;
