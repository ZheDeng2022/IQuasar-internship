      Male and female subjects 6 to 17 years of age with a primary psychiatric diagnosis of ADHD&#xD;
      will be enrolled in this study. The subject and his or her parent/guardian must agree to&#xD;
      genotyping to determine whether the subject has disruptive mutations within any of the&#xD;
      approximately 274 mGluR-network genes, and complete an interview that will include&#xD;
      information about the subject's ADHD history, treatment, and co-morbidities.&#xD;
