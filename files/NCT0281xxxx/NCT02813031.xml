      Nutritional clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of different functional meat&#xD;
      products on the nutritional status of healthy people&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different studies have revealed that many chronic pathologies including cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, cancer, obesity or neurological diseases, could be&#xD;
      influenced by different dietary components, such as lipids. Thus, looking for ways to&#xD;
      substitute healthier lipids for fats that contain high amounts of cholesterol, saturated&#xD;
      fatty acids or trans fat, could be of great interest in the prevention of chronic diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, meat and meat products, especially those where the fat is one of the main&#xD;
      ingredients of the formulation, are perceived as unhealthy foods associated with increased&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and obesity development. This is mainly due to their&#xD;
      content of fat, trans fat, high percentage of saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol.&#xD;
      Examples include sausages, meat spreads, salami or mortadella. Interestingly, despite the&#xD;
      negative perception, meat and meat products continue to hold a relevant position in the diet&#xD;
      of the developed countries. Indeed, the group &quot;meat, poultry, deli meats and offal&quot;&#xD;
      contribute to the 17% of the total dietary fat intake of the Spanish population. Moreover,&#xD;
      the consumption of deli meats and other meat products represents 5.8% of the total caloric&#xD;
      intake. These values support the increased interest in evaluating the effect of improving the&#xD;
      composition of these products in the prevention of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and obesity are main public health concerns worldwide. They both contribute to the&#xD;
      development of numerous diseases increasing the morbidity and mortality rates of the adult&#xD;
      population. In this context, it is suggested that the incorporation of healthier fats may be&#xD;
      of great interest in the prevention of these conditions. Thus, usage of lipids from olive oil&#xD;
      as fats replacements in meat products could be an interesting strategy for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, controlled, nutritional intervention is proposed to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      functional meat products on body composition and lipid profile in healthy individuals.&#xD;
