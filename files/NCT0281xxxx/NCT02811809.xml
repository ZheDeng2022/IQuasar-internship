    <textblock>
      This study is open to men who have biochemical recurrence (BCR, increased PSA) following&#xD;
      local treatment of their prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard&#xD;
      treatment option, but is only effective for 16-24 months and has a number of side effects&#xD;
      that impact quality of life. These side effects may include fatigue, hot flushing, loss of&#xD;
      sex drive, brain fog, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle mass, mild anemia (low&#xD;
      levels of red blood cells that can make people feel tired and weak), diabetes (low blood&#xD;
      sugar), heart disease, metabolic syndromes (sometimes called &quot;pre-diabetes&quot; and includes&#xD;
      obesity, increased blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in blood),&#xD;
      and risk of fractures. An alternative to continuous ADT is intermittent administration, where&#xD;
      patients are given &quot;breaks&quot; from ADT to let their testosterone levels return to baseline.&#xD;
      There are a number of potential benefits to intermittent hormone therapy (IHT): (1) longer&#xD;
      time to the development of resistance; (2) improved patient quality of life owing to recovery&#xD;
      from adverse effects, particularly sexual function; and (3) substantial cost savings owing to&#xD;
      less time spent receiving medication. Leuprolide is the name of the ADT / IHT drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apalutamide is an investigational drug, which means it has not been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA). It is an antitumor drug, taken by mouth. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the ability of Apalutamide to extend the time between the first two&#xD;
      injections of leuprolide and improve quality of life. This study will also look at the safety&#xD;
      of Apalutamide and the effects that Apalutamide has on prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men will be randomized (like flipping a coin) to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: Leuprolide + Apalutamide or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Leuprolide only (until second leuprolide injection), then leuprolide +&#xD;
           Apalutamide 45 men will be in Group A and 21 men will be in Group B. Leuprolide is given&#xD;
           as an intramuscular shot that lasts for 3 months intermittently and Apalutamide is taken&#xD;
           by mouth (4 tablets) daily. Each cycle is 4 weeks long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent treatment with Apalutamide + leuprolide will continue until continuous&#xD;
      leuprolide is needed to maintain undetectable PSA levels (i.e., PSA levels rise above&#xD;
      undetectable level unless leuprolide is given without pause, every 3 months).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a sensitive and specific biomarker of prostate tissue.&#xD;
      Monitoring of PSA after local treatment for prostate cancer can assist in identifying&#xD;
      patients who have only increased PSA (biochemical recurrence [BCR]) despite no symptoms,&#xD;
      signs, or evidence of radiographic metastatic disease. This subpopulation of patients are&#xD;
      referred to as having &quot;biochemical failure.&quot; Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard&#xD;
      treatment option, but is only effective for 16-24 months and has a number of side effects&#xD;
      that impact quality of life. These side effects may include fatigue, hot flushing, loss of&#xD;
      sex drive, brain fog, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle mass, mild anemia,&#xD;
      diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndromes and risk of fractures. An alternative to&#xD;
      continuous ADT is intermittent administration, where patients are given &quot;breaks&quot; from ADT to&#xD;
      let their testosterone levels return to baseline. There are a number of potential benefits to&#xD;
      intermittent hormone therapy (IHT): (1) longer time to the development of resistance, owing&#xD;
      to the removal of constant pressure causing faster mutation of resistant cells; (2) improved&#xD;
      patient quality of life owing to recovery from adverse effects, particularly sexual function;&#xD;
      and (3) substantial cost savings owing to less time spent receiving medication. Leuprolide is&#xD;
      the name of the ADT / IHT drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apalutamide is an investigational antitumor drug, taken by mouth. It is a synthetic compound&#xD;
      rationally designed to bind the androgen receptor (with higher affinity than enzalutamide or&#xD;
      bicalutamide), prevent both nuclear translocation and DNA binding, and induce apoptosis. It&#xD;
      has greater antitumor activity at a lower dose, achieves steady-state levels at a lower dose,&#xD;
      and accumulates more into tumor tissue without building up in the brain, which both increases&#xD;
      effectiveness and decreases the risk of seizure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apalutamide's mechanism of action gives it the potential to extend the time to PSA increase&#xD;
      during intermittent ADT, delaying the necessity for continuous ADT. Investigators will assess&#xD;
      the potential applications of intermittent ADT plus Apalutamide for participants with BCR.&#xD;
      This study will elucidate the potential of this regimen to reduce the burden of adverse&#xD;
      events of continuous ADT and delay the development of hormone resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized crossover study intended to determine the interval of ADT administration&#xD;
      achievable with supportive Apalutamide treatment. Investigators will assess the significance&#xD;
      of time to PSA recurrence, time to next leuprolide injection, time to testosterone recovery,&#xD;
      duration of testosterone recovery, time to biochemical recurrence, percentage of men&#xD;
      developing biochemical recurrence, number of detectable CTCs, and quality of life measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be 66 participants in 2:1 randomized crossover - 45 IHT + apalutamide:21 IHT&#xD;
      only until second leuprolide injection, then IHT + apalutamide&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apalutamide + IHT Participants will be treated with 240 mg (4 60 mg tablets) oral Apalutamide&#xD;
      daily plus 22.5 mg 3-month depot intramuscular leuprolide intermittently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IHT Participants will receive 22.5 mg 3-month depot intramuscular leuprolide until PSA&#xD;
      progression, when they will receive 240 mg oral Apalutamide daily plus 22.5 mg 3-month depot&#xD;
      intramuscular leuprolide intermittently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants remain on study until continuous ADT is required to maintain castrate PSA levels&#xD;
      (i.e., leuprolide is needed every 3 months to maintain PSA &lt;1 ng/dL).&#xD;
