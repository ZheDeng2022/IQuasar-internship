  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), in the form of the anti-retroviral pill TruvadaÂ©, has&#xD;
      been approved by the FDA as a method for reducing HIV transmission rates in the population,&#xD;
      particularly young men who have sex with men (YMSM). This study will use a qualitative design&#xD;
      to interview 20-30, HIV-negative, 16-24 year old African American YMSM to: 1) identify and&#xD;
      understand African American YMSM's, aged 16-24, cognitive and emotional processes in response&#xD;
      to using PrEP to reduce their risk for HIV and 2) identify what factors (sociocultural,&#xD;
      individual, experiences in health care, socioeconomic) influence African American YMSM's&#xD;
      likely use of PrEP as a coping strategy for HIV prevention. Demographic information will be&#xD;
      collected and analyzed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.3. Individual interviews&#xD;
      will be audio recorded and transcribed by a vetted transcription service for analysis. This&#xD;
      is minimal risk to participants.&#xD;

      This study will use an exploratory, naturalistic qualitative design where participants will&#xD;
      be interviewed to collect data on their emotional and cognitive processes (illness&#xD;
      representation) in response to the threat of a potential HIV infection, and what factors&#xD;
      (social, cultural, individual characteristics, and experiences in health care) influence&#xD;
      their likely use of PrEP. The sample for this study will include 20 to 30 African American&#xD;
      YMSM, aged 16-24, residing in Durham, Wake, and Orange counties of North Carolina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The in-depth interview guide and the 26-item descriptive survey PrEP Knowledge, Sexual&#xD;
      History, and Demographic Instrument were developed for this study using a combination of the&#xD;
      concepts from the adapted Common Sense Model of Illness Representation (CSM) and questions&#xD;
      adapted from the Adolescent Trial Network's (ATN) 082 study's questionnaire. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked questions relating to African American YMSM's likely use of HIV Pre-Exposure&#xD;
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV risk-reduction strategy. Once informed consent is obtained, the&#xD;
      interview will commence and study participants will be individually interviewed to discuss&#xD;
      what factors influence their likely use of PrEP. Each participant will complete the&#xD;
      descriptive survey and the one-on-one interview.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  between the ages of 16-24&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  self-identify as African-American, Black, or mixed race including African American or&#xD;
             Black&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have been assigned male sex at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer, or self-identify as a heterosexual male who&#xD;
             has had a past voluntary sexual experience with another man or currently has sexual&#xD;
             desires for men&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  report being uninfected with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be mentally capable of providing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be able to speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  not currently using PrEP for HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-infected men are excluded because this study is focused on the prevention of HIV&#xD;
             transmission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who were not assigned male sex at birth are excluded from this study, because&#xD;
             transgender men face very different and distinct issues with access to care compared&#xD;
             to YMSM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men who are currently using PrEP are excluded from this study because this study is&#xD;
             exploring the barriers and facilitators to use of PrEP in African American YMSM aged&#xD;
             16-24. Men who are currently using PrEP may have a different illness representation&#xD;
             compared to men who are not using PrEP.&#xD;
