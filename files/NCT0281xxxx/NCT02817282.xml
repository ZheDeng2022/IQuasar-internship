    <textblock>
      Hand hygiene (HH) appears to be a simple, non-complex procedure to prevent&#xD;
      healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), implementation in daily routine is difficult. The&#xD;
      residential setting and specific population pose challenges to optimal HH compliance. This&#xD;
      study aims to develop and to evaluate an evidence based multi-component implementation&#xD;
      strategy aimed at the promotion of HH in Dutch nursing homes(NHs). A strategy to improve HH&#xD;
      compliance in Dutch NHs will be developed. This strategy addresses the specific barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of NHs' infrastructure, healthcare workers (HCWs) and socio-cultural setting.&#xD;
      The strategy will be tested in a stepped wedge cluster randomized design which is based on a&#xD;
      random sequential roll-out of the implementation strategy to all participating NHs (n=20) for&#xD;
      comparison. Data are collected during six consecutive four month periods with an initial&#xD;
      baseline period for all NHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each period 1200 opportunities for HH are observed, using the gold standard of direct&#xD;
      and unobtrusive observations, according to the Five Moments for HH of the World Health&#xD;
      Organization. HAIs incidence densities, collected in the sentinel surveillance network for&#xD;
      infectious diseases in nursing homes (SNIV), will be evaluated in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi component implementation strategy, combining activities aimed at individual HCWs,&#xD;
      teams and the organization will be used. The individual level includes education, skills,&#xD;
      action planning, reminders and feedback. The team level includes activities that focus on&#xD;
      social influence, strengthening of leadership by gaining active commitment and initiative of&#xD;
      ward management. The organizational level addresses the structural context and institutional&#xD;
      management support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the cost implications of the CHANGE strategy, an economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted from a healthcare perspective. The cost-effectiveness of improved HH, defined here&#xD;
      as the costs for the CHANGE strategy minus less costs for treating infections, divided by the&#xD;
      difference between HAIs before and after the intervention period, will be calculated. A&#xD;
      process evaluation will be performed during and after the intervention to investigate the&#xD;
      feasibility of the implementation strategy and to illuminate the mechanisms and processes&#xD;
      responsible for the results and their variation within the NHs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sub study I: In an observational study, current HH compliance will be assessed in the&#xD;
      participating NHs, by using direct but unobtrusive observation. The primary outcome is the&#xD;
      percentage of opportunities at which HH is performed in accordance with the WHO guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct observation will be used as this is considered the gold standard and the most reliable&#xD;
      method for assessing compliance rates. Direct observation makes it possible to examine and&#xD;
      quantify the required moments for HH and assess the quality of practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strigley et al. showed that HH compliance rates were approximately threefold higher within&#xD;
      eyesight of an auditor compared with when no auditor was visible. Therefore, observations&#xD;
      will be performed unobtrusively to diminish the Hawthorne effect-the possibility that HCWs&#xD;
      modify their HH behavior in response to the fact that they know they are being studied. At&#xD;
      the beginning of each observation period, HCWs will be informed that the observers conduct&#xD;
      research on patient safety errors, but not that HH is monitored. Only the director of the&#xD;
      ward will be informed about the real purpose of the observations. This method of observation&#xD;
      was feasible in previous projects and is currently the World Health Organisation&#xD;
      (WHO)-recommended standard for evaluating HH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study II: Barriers and facilitators in performing HH. To develop a successful HH strategy&#xD;
      in NHs, information is needed on the behavioral determinants of HH compliance. In line with a&#xD;
      study by Grol among doctors and nurses in hospitals and nursing homes, identified barriers&#xD;
      are related to the individual HCW (e.g. not convinced of the evidence, working routines); the&#xD;
      social context within the team (e.g. no mutual accountability and control, no leadership);&#xD;
      and the healthcare organisation (high workload, insufficient facilities). Perceived barriers&#xD;
      to adherence with HH guidelines also include skin irritation caused by HH agents,&#xD;
      interference with HCWs' relationships with patients, patient needs perceived as a priority&#xD;
      over HH, and the lack of scientific information showing that HH prevents cross-infection.&#xD;
      Erasmus et al. found also that negative role models, poor accessibility of materials and a&#xD;
      poor social culture hamper good HH. Finally, a recent Cochrane review of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      'tailored' strategies gave a foundation to the assumption that strategies for change are more&#xD;
      effective if they deliberately address identified barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the barriers and facilitators are experienced in performing HH in Dutch NHs&#xD;
      will be explored. From the literature on barriers to guideline implementation combined with a&#xD;
      literature study on barriers in performing HH, a barriers questionnaire was previously&#xD;
      developed and used in the Helping Hands study. To ensure that the questionnaire contains all&#xD;
      possible barriers that can be experienced in the NH setting, focus group discussions with&#xD;
      HCWs in NHs will be performed. Newly mentioned barriers will be included in the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Next, a questionnaire study will be performed among a random sample of all&#xD;
      professionals, with a minimum of 25 in the participating NH to identify the most frequently&#xD;
      experienced barriers among professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study III: development of HH implementation strategy individual oriented activities.&#xD;
      Education will be based on the different determinants influencing HCWs' behavior. Reminders&#xD;
      for supporting the actual performance of HH will be used by distributing posters that&#xD;
      emphasize the importance of HH, particularly alcohol-based hand disinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance feedback is an effective tool to increase awareness, and has often been effective&#xD;
      in improving HH for short periods. Different mediums will be used for communicating the&#xD;
      feedback of HH performance of the own unit in comparison to other experimental units. The&#xD;
      results will also be discussed in staff meetings. This element will be embeded into&#xD;
      pre-existing work routines. Goal setting will be encouraged and the performance feedback will&#xD;
      be used to help HCWs evaluate their success and determine how they could best adapt their&#xD;
      behavior in order to reach their goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planning for improvement; during HCWs' busy day to day activities will be increased by making&#xD;
      action plans (implementation intentions), as part of the education program in which HCWs will&#xD;
      be assisted in making concrete plans and solutions to the everyday problems they encounter&#xD;
      concerning HH, using if-then plans (web based and/or in groups). Concretely it will involve&#xD;
      formulating plans how and when they intend to perform hand hygiene (i.e. when washing a&#xD;
      resident, first walk to the hand alcohol dispenser). This type of intervention has shown&#xD;
      promising results in creating new habits and changing fixed behaviours in other areas of&#xD;
      public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organisational oriented activities Products and facilities: The physical environment will be&#xD;
      adapted by screening and improving the availability of hand based hand rub.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Team-oriented activities:The social environment will be adapted by training at a group and&#xD;
      individual level, to improve social and descriptive norms. Positive role models will be&#xD;
      stimulated through this training, and particularly senior HCWs will be encouraged to improve&#xD;
      their behavior as role models. The intervention will be delivered in two interactive team&#xD;
      sessions during a period of 6 months. The first 1,5-h team session start with presenting and&#xD;
      discussing current the team performance on HH. Team members explore their HH behavior,&#xD;
      analyse barriers and facilitators and formulate improvement activities. Next, team members&#xD;
      develop a clear set of behavior and communication expectations to address each other in case&#xD;
      of inappropriate HH. The meeting ends with commitment of all team members to achieve a&#xD;
      substantial increase in HH compliance. During the second session, the ward manager will&#xD;
      present the HH compliance rates of the previous period. Team members discuss questions like:&#xD;
      Is the goal achieve? What improvements have been implemented? How to maintain the improved&#xD;
      behavior? What went wrong and what to do about it? Next, attention will be focused at&#xD;
      maintenance of the achieved results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation of CHANGE: In order to increase the success of implementation, an extensive&#xD;
      strategy will be put in place prior to the start of the intervention period. In each NH&#xD;
      contact persons will be appointed: the coordinating Infection Control Practitioner (ICP).&#xD;
      With them the roll-out of the CHANGE package in their NH will be discussed. At the start of&#xD;
      the intervention a kick-off meeting will be planned in the participating NH. HCWs will be&#xD;
      instructed as to how they can signal when a component of the intervention is interfering with&#xD;
      their work activities, so that effective measures to solve these problems can be set in&#xD;
      motion swiftly. Education and team training will be timely planned and integrated in regular&#xD;
      work meetings and in existing educational courses. The implementation phase per NH will last&#xD;
      4 months. During a period of two years, all NHs will receive the implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study IV evaluation of HH implementation strategy. The implementation strategy will be&#xD;
      tested in a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial which is based on a random sequential&#xD;
      roll-out of the CHANGE implementation strategy to all participating NHs (n=20) for&#xD;
      comparison. All groups (hence all NHs) start with the control situation (no CHANGE&#xD;
      implementation activities) at the beginning of the study. At each time point, a new group of&#xD;
      five NHs crosses over from the control situation to the implementation situation. Each group&#xD;
      will start the implementation phase of 4 months at a different time point, directly after one&#xD;
      of the measurements periods (Point of time (PT)0, PT1, PT2, PT3, PT4, PT5). The time point a&#xD;
      group crosses over is randomized (over the groups). Randomization will be computer generated&#xD;
      by an independent statistician when recruitment of clusters is complete. By the end of the&#xD;
      two year study period, all groups (hence all NHs) will have received the CHANGE&#xD;
      implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study V: Exploratory economic evaluation. Costs of HAIs are high and HH is an effective&#xD;
      measure in reducing infections. It is estimated that 15 to 30% of all HAIs can be prevented&#xD;
      by avoiding cross-transmission of micro-organisms on the hands of HCWs. An improvement in HH&#xD;
      compliance has potential to lead to substantial health care cost savings. Therefore,&#xD;
      strategies that focus on increasing adherence to effective HH guidelines are likely to be&#xD;
      cost-effective. To date, little is known about the costs induced by non-compliance to HH in&#xD;
      NHs. To assess the cost implications of inadequate HH, an economic evaluation will be&#xD;
      conducted from a healthcare perspective. The economic evaluation will be performed in&#xD;
      accordance with the Dutch guidelines, the general principles of cost-effectiveness analysis&#xD;
      in healthcare. In the CHANGE implementation strategy the HH compliance in the participating&#xD;
      NHs will increase and subsequently will lead to a decrease in the incidence of HAIs. Data&#xD;
      will be collected on healthcare use for HAIs that are monitored in the participating NHs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of potential cost savings due to less infections, the use of antibiotics&#xD;
      and other drugs, contact isolation precautions, extra consultations of the elderly care&#xD;
      physician, diagnostic tests, extra medical care, hospital transportation and hospital&#xD;
      admission will be registered . Weekly, participating NHs register the incidence of HAIs. This&#xD;
      registration makes it possible to compare the incidence of infections before the intervention&#xD;
      period with the incidence of infections during and after the intervention period. This allows&#xD;
      for the possibility to calculate the cost-effectiveness of improved HH, defined here as the&#xD;
      costs for the CHANGE strategy minus less costs for treating infections, divided by the&#xD;
      difference between HAIs before and after the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub study VI: process evaluation. A process evaluation will be performed during and after the&#xD;
      intervention to investigate the feasibility of the implementation strategy and to illuminate&#xD;
      the mechanisms and processes responsible for the results and their variation within the NHs.&#xD;
      For this purpose, the different implementation activities and the participation level of the&#xD;
      HCWs in order to determine the correlation between the implementation effect (i.e., results&#xD;
      of our implementation strategy on HH compliance) and adherence to the implementation strategy&#xD;
      (i.e., degree of implementation) will be registered. To understand the success -or lack of&#xD;
      success- of the implementation strategy, the evaluation will use three sets of measures that&#xD;
      will be related to the effects on HCWs' HH compliance: adherence to the improvement strategy,&#xD;
      contextual factors, and HCWs' experiences with strategy components. Information on adherence&#xD;
      to the improvement strategy and on contextual factors will be collected using a wide range of&#xD;
      methods, including: observations, a NH structure survey, structured logbooks of coaches and&#xD;
      researchers' field notes of group meetings etc. For example, participation in the&#xD;
      implementation activities will be monitored closely, by documenting participation regarding&#xD;
      all activities: e.g. who participated in an educational meeting, who read his/her individual&#xD;
      feedback report etc. This information is not only crucial for understanding the result of&#xD;
      implementation strategy, but also for providing basic data for the economic evaluation of the&#xD;
      improvement activities. Information on HCWs' experiences with strategy components will be&#xD;
      collected by such information is not only crucial for understanding the result of&#xD;
      implementation strategy, but will also be measured to, if necessary, adapt the strategy to&#xD;
      make it more acceptable and effective for future users of the strategy.&#xD;
