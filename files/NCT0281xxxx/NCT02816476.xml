    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, single-arm, multicentre study of Daratumumab (16mg/kg IV route) in adult&#xD;
      patients with Light-Chain (AL) Amyloidosis who are not in VGPR or better after previous&#xD;
      treatment. A sample size of 40 patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled to&#xD;
      receive study treatment. Patients will receive treatment until either disease progression or&#xD;
      toxicity has occurred with a maximum planned of six 28-day cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab will be administrated every week for the first 2 cycles then. every 2 weeks from&#xD;
      cycle 3 through cycle 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also receive best supportive care (BSC) to mitigate Daratumumab side-effects,&#xD;
      and to address underlying Amyloidosis, including blood product transfusions, antimicrobials,&#xD;
      and (as appropriate) growth factors including granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for&#xD;
      neutropenia, erythropoietin for anaemia, and/or transfusions for thrombocytopenia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the deposition of misfolded monoclonal&#xD;
      immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) in various tissues and organs. It is usually&#xD;
      associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with a low tumour burden. Treatment of AL&#xD;
      amyloidosis relies mainly on chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying plasma cell&#xD;
      clone secreting monoclonal FLC. The organ responses and the survival are greatly influenced&#xD;
      by the degree of hematological response evaluated by the decrease in serum FLC that has been&#xD;
      the principal endpoint in recent trials in AL amyloidosis. The goal of treatment is to reach&#xD;
      at least a very good partial response (VGPR) defined as a difference between the involved FLC&#xD;
      and the normal &lt;40 mg/l.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last 2 years, Daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic, human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (mAb) that specifically recognizes the CD38 epitope has emerged as a breakthrough&#xD;
      targeted therapy for patients with myeloma. Taking into account that, in 90% of AL patients,&#xD;
      the monoclonal cells producing amyloidogenic FLC are Cluster of Differentiation 38 (CD38)&#xD;
      expressing plasma cells Daratumumab should be a promising treatment in AL amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 4 steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 21 day screening period This period start with screening visit which may occurs up to&#xD;
           21 days before the first study drug administration. After signature of the informed&#xD;
           consent form, procedures will be performed to ensure patient meet all&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria and document health status to receive study treatment.&#xD;
           These assessments will include quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period Patient eligible to enter the study will receive 6 cycles of 28 days&#xD;
           of intra venous Daratumumab. During cycles 1 and 2, Daratumumab will be administered&#xD;
           weekly at days 1, 8, 15, and 22 then from cycles 3 to 6, Daratumumab will be&#xD;
           administered every two weeks at days 1 and 15. Patient will have assessments at the&#xD;
           ignition of a new cycle to document haematological and organs response and intra cycle&#xD;
           to watch for toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An end of study visit (when PD or unacceptable adverse events occurs, or planned end of&#xD;
           study visit). Study procedures will be performed at 28 days (Â± 15) after the last dose&#xD;
           of study medication for all patients, including early termination patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Followup period After treatment discontinuation, followup will be made to the patient&#xD;
           every 3 months for at least 1 year to inquire about the patient's hematological and&#xD;
           organ status, general health, and information on any new medical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSING REGIMEN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daratumumab. Six 28-day cycles, 16 mg/kg administered by IV route, During cycle 1 and 2,&#xD;
      Daratumumab will be administered weekly at days 1, 8, 15, and 22&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cycles 3 to 6, Daratumumab will be administered every other week at days 1 and 15&#xD;
