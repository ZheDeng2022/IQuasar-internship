  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the effect and safety of long-term intake&#xD;
      of enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (EMIQ), a natural plant product on body fat loss in&#xD;
      obese and overweight individuals.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the effect of supplementation with Enzymatically&#xD;
      Modified Isoquercitrin (EMIQ) vs. placebo on measures of total body fat in overweight and&#xD;
      obese adults. Participants will visit the HNRCA on 5 different dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Participants will receive materials and instruction for completing 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls to be completed by phone a week prior to the next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Overnight fasted participants will arrive to the Human Nutrition Research Center on&#xD;
      Aging (HNRCA). Vital signs, and EKG measure of heart rhythm, scrub weight and height will be&#xD;
      obtained. Blood samples will be collected. Several baseline measurements will be performed&#xD;
      during this visit including: lipid profile, insulin test, adiponectin, a urine dip stick,&#xD;
      skinfold thickness and waist/hip circumference, resting metabolic rate (RMR), and DXA measure&#xD;
      of total body fat. A three factor eating questionnaire, food craving questionnaire, and the&#xD;
      Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) will be administered to assess volunteer's&#xD;
      dietary inhibition, restraint, hunger, cravings and physical activity level. EMIQ and placebo&#xD;
      capsules, compliance calendar, and instructions will be dispensed to participants by nursing&#xD;
      staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Overnight fasted participants will arrive to HNRCA four weeks from the last visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return their unused supplements as well as their compliance&#xD;
      calendar. Vital signs, scrub weight and changes to volunteer health, medication and&#xD;
      eligibility status will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected. A second EKG will be&#xD;
      performed. The PAR will be administered. Before their next visit, participants will complete&#xD;
      3 24- hour dietary recalls by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: overnight fasted participants will arrive to HNRCA four weeks from the last visit.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to return their unused supplements as well as their compliance&#xD;
      calendar. Vital signs, scrub weight and changes to volunteer health, medication and&#xD;
      eligibility status will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected. The PAR will be&#xD;
      administered. Before their next visit, participants will complete 3 24- hour dietary recalls&#xD;
      by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Overnight fasted participants will arrive to HNRCA four weeks from the last visit.&#xD;
      Vital signs and scrub weight will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected. Final&#xD;
      measurements will be taken during this visit including: routine health screening analysis,&#xD;
      lipid profile, adiponectin, insulin test, a urine dip stick, liver and kidney function (SGOT,&#xD;
      SGPT, BUN, creatinine, and calculated GFR), skin fold thickness, DXA, RMR and waist/hip&#xD;
      circumference. A three factor eating questionnaire, food craving questionnaire, and the PAR&#xD;
      will be administered to assess changes in volunteer's dietary inhibition, restraint, hunger,&#xD;
      cravings and activity level throughout the study.&#xD;
