      The Exploration Center for Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis (CEPTA, Bordeaux&#xD;
      Hospital University) showed that following myocardial infarct (MI) or ischemic stroke (TIA or&#xD;
      stroke), the global management (medical and educational) of patients led to very long-term&#xD;
      satisfactory results in terms of reduction of cardiovascular (CV) risk and morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. However, the specific effect of therapeutic education beyond the conventional&#xD;
      treatment has never been an adequate assessment. The following at 1 year of this study will&#xD;
      show the evolution of chronic long-term CV disease in patients who received therapeutic&#xD;
      education, and to explain the mechanisms. The challenge of this project is to demonstrate for&#xD;
      the first time the superiority of therapeutic education and conventional care and propose a&#xD;
      modeling program for national diffusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experienced a CV event (MI, stroke) will be randomized into 2 groups of 165&#xD;
      patients each: 1) receiving conventional treatment alone; 2) receiving conventional treatment&#xD;
      + CEPTA program. The study was built for a 1-year follow-up period, to demonstrate the impact&#xD;
      of therapeutic education on evolution of risk factors, physical, psychological and social&#xD;
      health of patients. The main benefit of this study for the patient is the implementation of&#xD;
      an optimized treatment and long-term monitoring by a cardiology referral center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cardiovascular diseases are the second cause of death in France, and represent a&#xD;
      major public health issue. Recurrences are numerous, due to inadequate control of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors, despite significant drug prescription. Therapeutic education can&#xD;
      help to improve the health of patients, physical and psychical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Exploration Center for Prevention and Treatment of Atherosclerosis (CEPTA, Bordeaux&#xD;
      Hospital University) demonstrated that following myocardial infarction or stroke, the&#xD;
      comprehensive care (medical and educational) of patients CEPTA led to results very&#xD;
      satisfactory in terms of reduction of cardiovascular risk and morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      However, the specific effect of therapeutic education beyond the conventional treatment has&#xD;
      never been a proper assessment. This study is a single-center prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled. The main objective is to find and explain the impact of the &quot;therapeutic&#xD;
      education program&quot; in addition to optimized conventional therapy in post-MI or stroke&#xD;
      patients, compared to an optimized conventional therapy alone . Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      during hospitalization for their acute phase into two groups of 165 patients each. The first&#xD;
      group receiving conventional therapy alone and the 2nd group receiving conventional treatment&#xD;
      + the therapeutic education program. All patients benefit from traditional monitoring as&#xD;
      provided for this type of patients, followed up for 3 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first days after the acute event, patients benefit from the most appropriate treatment&#xD;
      and receive guidance for their change in lifestyle, diet and smoking cessation. Optimal&#xD;
      treatment will be prescribed to the output depending on cardiovascular status and risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three months after cardiovascular events, patients will benefit from their assessment of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis and its consequences on myocardial or neurological functions. Each patient&#xD;
      will receive an assessment of risk factors (smoking, dietary habits and physical activity).&#xD;
      Personalized advice will be issued. One participants group will receive the &quot;conventional&#xD;
      treatment + therapeutic education program (CEPTA program)&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the therapeutic education associate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Of learning objectives and acquisition of knowledge and self-care skills making the&#xD;
           patient more autonomous and facilitating its adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the objectives of acquiring coping skills (self-confidence, stress management, setting&#xD;
           projects) to improve their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the development objectives respects the relevant criteria of quality, realism and&#xD;
           principle of educational progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge of this project is to demonstrate for the first time the superiority of a&#xD;
      conventional treatment + therapeutic education in this population, and to propose a model&#xD;
      program for national broadcast.&#xD;
