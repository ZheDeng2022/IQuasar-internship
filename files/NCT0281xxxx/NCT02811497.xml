    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of investigational drug, durvalumab given in combination with&#xD;
      azacitidine (CC-486). The main purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of azacitidine in combination with durvalumab patients with microsatellite stable&#xD;
      colorectal carcinoma (MSS-CRC), platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer type II (PR-OC),&#xD;
      and estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer.&#xD;
