      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: To evaluate safety and tolerability of isatuximab in Japanese patients with&#xD;
           relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab at recommended dose and to further evaluate&#xD;
           the overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab in Japanese patients with relapsed and&#xD;
           refractory multiple myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety including immunogenicity of isatuximab. The severity, frequency&#xD;
           and incidence of all adverse events will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab in the proposed dosing&#xD;
           schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response&#xD;
           criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the relationship between baseline CD38 receptor density on multiple myeloma&#xD;
           cells and efficacy.&#xD;

      The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of&#xD;
      up to 21 days, the treatment period consisting of 28 day cycles and a follow-up period.&#xD;
      Treatment with isatuximab may continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event&#xD;
      or other reason for discontinuation.&#xD;
