  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the clinical utility of 11C or 18F-Choline Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Whole Body Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) versus conventional bone scan and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements&#xD;
      in response prediction to treatment with Enzalutamide in Hormono-Sensitive Metastatic&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess how these 2 imaging modalities perform compared to traditional serial&#xD;
      PSA measurements and bone scan in assessing metastatic tumour load, progressive disease and&#xD;
      response to treatment with Enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition measurements of serially collected circulating tumour cell (CTC) samples,&#xD;
      cell-free tumour DNA and RNA will be performed in order to evaluate their predictive value in&#xD;
      terms of response measurement.&#xD;

      Metastatic prostate cancer patients eligible for 1st line hormonal treatment will undergo&#xD;
      treatment with Enzalutamide (XTANDI). Subjects will receive 1dd 160 mg Enzalutamide orally&#xD;
      continuously until progressive disease occurs. All subjects will undergo Choline (11C or&#xD;
      18F)-PET/CT scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 and 6, 9 and 12 months after starting androgen&#xD;
      receptor (AR)-directed treatment. All subjects will undergo Whole Body MRI at baseline, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months. Bone scans will be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 and 12 months. PSA will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter until at 12 months. CTC counts and&#xD;
      characteristics will be measured at baseline and during Enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Radiological progression is defined by any of the following criteria:&#xD;
Soft tissue lesions: Progressive disease on Choline (11C or 18F) PET/CT or Whole Body MRI by RECIST 1.1. Bone or bone marrow lesions: Progressive disease on PET/CT or MRI as evidenced by new lesions or an increase in size of 25% of the sum of target lesions.&#xD;
Conversion of the Choline (11C or 18F) PET signal of the metastases at 2 weeks, 2 or 6 months compared to baseline PET which by comparing it to PFS at 6 and 12 months may be an indicator or drug response. Radiological PFS at 6 and 12 months will be compared to a) PET signal conversion and to b) PSA measurements, and changes in number of lesions on the bone scan (conventional work up).</description>
