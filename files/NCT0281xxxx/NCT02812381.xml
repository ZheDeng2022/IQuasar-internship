    <textblock>
      The suture of the supraspinatus tendon is a common surgery that requires physical therapy for&#xD;
      back pain and functional impairment to such surgery. Kinesiotaping technique (KT) is being&#xD;
      used to treat myofascial trigger points that appear after surgery and for the treatment of&#xD;
      physiotherapy in the supraspinatus muscle and deltoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness of KT technique over the technique of Jones&#xD;
      (Straincounterstrain or SCS) in patients undergoing suture the tendon of the supraspinatus&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the KT technique against Jones&#xD;
      (Strain-Counterstrain or SCS) technique in patients with the suture of the tendon of the&#xD;
      supraspinatus muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Test clinically controlled, randomized, masking of intervention by double placebo and&#xD;
      blind to the subject of the essay and the Studio analyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: Patients with supraspinatus tendon suture are randomly divided into two groups: a&#xD;
      group treated with KT (n = 18) and other treated with SCS (n = 18). The treatment was applied&#xD;
      the 1st, 4th and 8th day of physical therapy session. All patients were evaluated the 1st and&#xD;
      the 12th day of the session with the visual analog scale of pain (VAS), with the scale of&#xD;
      Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) to assess the functionality and active&#xD;
      direction-finding (ROM) to assess travel articulate.&#xD;
