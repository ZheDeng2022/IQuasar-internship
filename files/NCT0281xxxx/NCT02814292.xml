  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Validation of the PEFS to detect breast tumors will be performed by means of a prospective&#xD;
      trial. Subjects will participate for 1 clinic visit. Readings from the PEFS will be studied&#xD;
      for reproducibility and predictive ability. Data analysis will be iterative, moving on with&#xD;
      each modification of the device until the final prototype is created.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2A of this study is directed primarily at prototype development, creating, testing, and&#xD;
      modifying a 4x4 finger array device with a small footprint that is battery powered and&#xD;
      reliable. The testing in this phase is aimed at proving that modifications did not degrade&#xD;
      the screening sensitivity of the original lab prototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target enrollment is up to 100 patients to verify that the investigators have reproducible&#xD;
      values in the same patient. Each breast will be evaluated and compared against each other&#xD;
      whether it is considered normal or abnormal tissue. Data from patients both normal and&#xD;
      abnormal regions will be compared and used to determine predictive value and accuracy in this&#xD;
      prototype. The patient population will be women and men 18 years of age or older with&#xD;
      symptomatic breast lump either by palpation or imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptomatic individuals scheduled to undergo diagnostic exam will be recruited from all&#xD;
      patients presenting for breast evaluations at Dr. Brooks clinical practices who meet all the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consent will be obtained prior to any study related&#xD;
      activities. The PEFS evaluation will be performed by a trained individual. Subjects will be&#xD;
      scanned in supine position without breast immobilization - similar to ultrasound testing. The&#xD;
      PEFS data is recorded and processed by an automated software algorithm and the results are&#xD;
      displayed topographically on a breast-map with red areas showing positive findings and black&#xD;
      areas showing negative findings. Quantitative data will be documented and analyzed for&#xD;
      accuracy metrics. Results will not be given to subjects nor recorded in their medical&#xD;
      records. Because this study is not a clinical utility study, results will have no effect on&#xD;
      clinical care decisions. The PEFS evaluation may add between 10 and 30 minutes to the clinic&#xD;
      visit. No imaging or pathology tests are being done for research purposes.&#xD;
