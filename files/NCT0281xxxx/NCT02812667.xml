    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether plinabulin (also known as BPI-2358) has an&#xD;
      effect on cancer and body in combination with nivolumab, a standard treatment for metastatic&#xD;
      squamous non-small cell lung cancer with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plinabulin inhibits tumor growth by targeting both new and existing blood vessels going to&#xD;
      the tumor as well as killing tumor cells. Plinabulin is an investigational drug, a drug that&#xD;
      is not approved for use outside of research studies by regulatory agencies. Up to 38 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plinabulin is a microtubule destabilizing agent (MDA) that inhibits the polymerization of&#xD;
      tubulin monomers with resultant vascular disrupting properties. Plinabulin inhibits tumor&#xD;
      growth by targeting both angiogenesis and tumor vasculature as well as directly by inducing&#xD;
      apoptosis via the Ras-JNK pathway. It also may activate anti-tumor immunity via inducing&#xD;
      maturation of dendritic cells (DC) and triggering release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
      Plinabulin could therefore have a synergic anti-tumor effect when combined with&#xD;
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors. This hypothesis has been confirmed in a murine model bearing&#xD;
      subcutaneous MC38 colon cancers using other MDAs, including ansamitocin P3, which induces DC&#xD;
      maturation similar to that of plinabulin. Plinabulin has been tested in a randomized phase 2&#xD;
      trial in combination of docetaxel and showed similar response rate to that of docetaxel&#xD;
      alone, but with a significantly longer duration of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is an inhibitor of the programmed cell death receptor-1 checkpoint pathway (PD-1)&#xD;
      that has superior activity in NSCLC, regardless of tumor histology, comparing to standard of&#xD;
      care. In this study, we plan to combine nivolumab with escalating doses of plinabulin to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and /or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the&#xD;
      combination. An expansion cohort will be enrolled at RP2D to further assess toxicities and to&#xD;
      evaluate preliminary anti-tumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, phase 1 dose finding trial of plinabulin, combining with FDA&#xD;
      approved dose of nivolumab, using a 3+3 design in patients with metastatic NSCLC who&#xD;
      progressed after chemotherapy, including a platinum-containing regimen. Patients will receive&#xD;
      plinabulin at escalating doses in combination with nivolumab. Doses of plinabulin and&#xD;
      nivolumab will be administered as intravenous infusions in 4-week cycles. Patients will&#xD;
      receive both medications on Days 1 and 15 and additional dose of plinabulin on Day 8.&#xD;
      Plinabulin will be administered 60 minutes after the completion of nivolumab.&#xD;
