  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HPV vaccines have been included in the national immunisation schedule since 2008, firstly as&#xD;
      the Cervarix vaccine which protects against two HPV types and in 2012 as the Gardasil vaccine&#xD;
      which offers protection against a further two HPV types. This study will assess whether&#xD;
      booster doses are indicated to protect females throughout their lifetime or if the&#xD;
      vaccinations offered in early adolescence provide this by following up a cohort from a&#xD;
      previous study where female adolescents were vaccinated 5-7 years ago.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since September 2008, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been offered as part of the UK&#xD;
      national immunisation schedule to adolescent females, first as three doses of a bivalent&#xD;
      vaccine (Cervarix) covering the two most common strains (HPV16 and 18). Subsequently a&#xD;
      quadrivalent vaccine was given in 2012 (Gardasil) incorporating a further two HPV types (HPV6&#xD;
      and 11). Between 2009 and 2011, the National Vaccine Evaluation Consortium (NVEC) conducted a&#xD;
      randomised, observer-blinded parallel group study to evaluate the immunogenicity of the two&#xD;
      HPV vaccines in terms of humoral immune responses against vaccine and non-vaccine&#xD;
      incorporated HPV genotypes. The investigators plan to approach the participants of the&#xD;
      original study as part of a follow up study to assess the duration of the humoral immune&#xD;
      response elicited to the HPV vaccines; specifically, comparing the breadth and magnitude of&#xD;
      antibody responses against vaccine and non-vaccine incorporated genotypes 5.7-6.8years on&#xD;
      from their first dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term follow up studies have been conducted up to 9.4 years post vaccination for example&#xD;
      in a multicentre double-blinded trial evaluating the long term efficacy of the Cervarix&#xD;
      vaccine, which demonstrated 95-100% sustained efficacy against incident infection and&#xD;
      CIN1+/2+ lesions whilst antibody titres were above those seen with natural infection adding&#xD;
      confidence to the long term efficacy of this vaccine . The quadrivalent vaccine has been&#xD;
      evaluated in long term follow up studies for example in a continuation of the Future II study&#xD;
      at 9 years post first dose, whereby ≥94% of samples were seropositive for types 6,11 and 16&#xD;
      and 60% for HPV18 according to a cut-off negative serostatus value decided on by a selection&#xD;
      of naïve and seropositive sera. There was also minimal difference in titres compared to&#xD;
      months 18 and 48, representing a stable plateau of seroprotective titres. There are only two&#xD;
      studies that have examined the duration of antibody responses against non-vaccine genotypes&#xD;
      beyond 12 months: one comparing antibody titers elicited by both HPV vaccines against HPV31&#xD;
      and HPV45 in 18-26 year old women 24 months post first dose and one describing HPV31&#xD;
      seropositivity in 18-25 year old women at 48 months. This study will therefore provide unique&#xD;
      data for the age group that HPV vaccination is offered to in the UK, in terms of vaccine&#xD;
      incorporated genotypes as there are a limited number of follow up studies evaluating the&#xD;
      12-15 year old age group, as well as assessing the duration of antibody responses against&#xD;
      non-vaccine types which has been far less extensively studied in all age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum antibody titre that correlates with HPV vaccine efficacy has not been defined; that&#xD;
      is, a so-called correlate of protection. For HPV16 and HPV18 this is, in part, due to the&#xD;
      high levels of HPV antibody generated following vaccination and the lack of breakthrough&#xD;
      infections in vaccine trials. For non-vaccine genotypes where efficacy is only partial,&#xD;
      further information on the breadth, magnitude and duration of such antibody specificities is&#xD;
      required before a correlate (or surrogate) of protection can be established .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest robust immunological memory from studies looking at booster&#xD;
      doses of HPV vaccine, which could be introduced into the UK programme to ensure protection&#xD;
      throughout a women's sexual lifetime. For instance, in a follow up study assessing the&#xD;
      immunological response to a booster dose of Cervarix seven years following immunisation with&#xD;
      a three dose schedule, a strong memory B cell response persists after vaccination, giving&#xD;
      rise to significantly higher GMTs than observed following the first dose of the bivalent&#xD;
      vaccine. A significant fold-increase in GMTs was also observed with a booster dose following&#xD;
      two doses of the quadrivalent vaccine, though GMTs were higher following a bivalent booster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow up study will begin to address the question of long term durability of HPV&#xD;
      vaccine antibody responses afforded by the HPV vaccines in the target age group in the UK&#xD;
      population and therefore whether changes need to be made to the current national schedule.&#xD;
