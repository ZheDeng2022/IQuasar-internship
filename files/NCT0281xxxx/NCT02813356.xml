  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the&#xD;
      safety of naloxegol in patients aged 18 years and older who do not have a diagnosis of cancer&#xD;
      and who are treated with opioids chronically&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the overall risk of major adverse cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (MACE) among naloxegol-treated patients compared to that among patients on prescription&#xD;
      non-peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonist (PAMORA) opioid induced constipation (OIC)&#xD;
      treatment. The corresponding analysis is of a new-user cohort study that captures the&#xD;
      occurrence of MACE in persons receiving naloxegol or comparison medications. The study takes&#xD;
      place in actual-use settings in the US in which existing electronic data captures patient&#xD;
      diagnoses, health care, and treatment. The occurrence of MACE in naloxegol-treated patients&#xD;
      will be compared to the occurrence of MACE in medically-similar new users of other&#xD;
      prescription-only treatments for OIC in the same settings, with both naloxegol-treated and&#xD;
      comparison medication-treated patients being followed for as long as they continue on&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In further pursuit of the primary objective, there will be a self-controlled study that&#xD;
      follows all members of the new-user cohorts, including both new naloxegol users and new users&#xD;
      of comparator products, for as long as data are available as the patients may go on or off&#xD;
      treatment. A self-controlled study offers a complementary approach to the statistical control&#xD;
      for the possible confounding effects of personal characteristics. Using the same data&#xD;
      sources, this self-controlled design follows individuals from the time they finish their&#xD;
      first course of treatment as new users for as long as the study continues. Patient treatment&#xD;
      statuses are continuously updated since the treatment choices exercised by patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers create extended periods of study time on and off naloxegol and possibly on and off&#xD;
      other therapies for OIC. Comparisons of the occurrence of MACE occur within individuals and&#xD;
      so are unaffected by differences between individuals, as in a crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first secondary objective is to assess the potential confounding effects of lifestyle&#xD;
      risk factors on relative risk of MACE among naloxegol-treated patients compared with that&#xD;
      among patients on other prescription non-PAMORA OIC treatment. The corresponding analysis is&#xD;
      of a case-control study nested within the primary study population. All of the MACE &quot;cases&quot;&#xD;
      will be matched to other members of the cohorts (&quot;controls&quot;). In cases and controls, the&#xD;
      outpatient medical record will be abstracted for information on lifestyle risk factors. The&#xD;
      case-control analysis will provide information on the presence and effect of lifestyle&#xD;
      confounding factors that may be identifiable only by chart review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further secondary analyses will investigate the relative risks analyzed under an&#xD;
      intent-to-treat paradigm over fixed time periods of membership in the naloxegol and&#xD;
      comparator cohorts, relative risks for specific components of MACE, relative risks associated&#xD;
      with new oral PAMORA agents other than naloxegol (non-naloxegol oral PAMORAs [NNPAMORAs])&#xD;
      that may come onto the US market during the course of the study, and an exploration of the&#xD;
      possible variations in risk associated with variations in the dose and timing of naloxegol&#xD;
      dispensing in the case-control study.&#xD;

        All patients in this study will be 18 years of age or older, and they will have had at&#xD;
        least 6 months of continuous data available before they enter one of the new-user cohorts.&#xD;
        During the 6-month baseline period before cohort entry, they will have received at least 90&#xD;
        days of dispensed opioids, of which in the 60 days before cohort entry there were at least&#xD;
        30 days of opioids dispensed at an average of at least 30 morphine equivalent units (MEQ)&#xD;
        per day. Patients will have no evidence of active cancer; they will have no evidence in the&#xD;
        electronic record of MACE; they will not have received methylnatrexone bromide for&#xD;
        subcutaneous injection. At the time of the index dispensing of naloxegol or comparison&#xD;
        drug, cohort members will furthermore be current users of a dispensed opioid.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient receives a new dispensing of naloxegol, lubiprostone/linaclotide, or an oral&#xD;
             NNPAMORA. A new dispensing is one that occurs with no dispensing for the same drug&#xD;
             having occurred in the preceding 182 days. A patient only qualifies once under this&#xD;
             criterion for any drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients 18 years of age or older at the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Continuous availability of data for at least 183 days immediately before and including&#xD;
             the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. 90 days of opioid dispensed in the 183 days before and including the index date of&#xD;
             which at least 30 days of opioid dispensed at at least 30 MEQ/day in the 60 days&#xD;
             before and including index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Current users of a dispensed opioid, meaning that the interval between index study&#xD;
             drug dispensing and at least 1 prior opioid dispensing is less than the days supply&#xD;
             associated with the opioid dispensing&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any medical care associated with a diagnosis of cancer in the 183 days before and&#xD;
             including the index date; a diagnosis of cancer for this purpose is any diagnostic&#xD;
             code of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) in the range&#xD;
             140-208 &quot;Malignant neoplasms â€¦&quot; or of the 10th revision (ICD-10) in the range C00-C96,&#xD;
             &quot;Malignant neoplasms&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Dispensing of methylnaltrexone for subcutaneous injection in the 183 days before and&#xD;
             including the index date&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Indication in the electronic records of the occurrence of MACE in the 183 days before&#xD;
             and including the index date; see Section 9.3.2 &quot;MACE&quot; for screening criteria&#xD;
