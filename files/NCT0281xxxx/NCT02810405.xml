      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer of any type is a serious disease and despite all the progress made from past research,&#xD;
      there is still much that is poorly understood at the molecular level. Recent advances in&#xD;
      biomedical technology platforms have emerged as critical tools for accelerating personalized&#xD;
      medicine. The collection of human tissue specimens has been an invaluable resource for&#xD;
      conducting translational cancer research using these developing technologies. The ultimate&#xD;
      goal is to understand the molecular indicators of cancer development and progression. While&#xD;
      it is ideal to be able to study clinical samples, specifically tissue biopsies, they are&#xD;
      however precious and are often difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities or numbers to&#xD;
      conduct proteomic or molecular profiling studies. There exists, however, a vast archive of&#xD;
      pathologically characterized clinical samples in the form of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded&#xD;
      tissue blocks. The preservation of these tissue blocks and/or slides for long-term (years)&#xD;
      storage is an important asset that aids in translational and clinical research. This protocol&#xD;
      will describe the procedures for receiving, labeling and storing paraffin-embedded tissue&#xD;
      blocks and/or slides until they are needed for future analysis. When blocks are ready for&#xD;
      analysis, the requestor will then follow the IRB protocol specific to that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To obtain tissue blocks and slides from outside pathology departments for cancer patients&#xD;
      being treated at the Medical Oncology Branch (MOB) and Affiliates Center for Cancer Research&#xD;
      (CCR), National Cancer Institute (NCI) in order to store them for future studies and analysis&#xD;
      (e.g., using molecular technology platforms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patients suspected of having, or with biopsy proof of malignant disease will be evaluated&#xD;
      in the Medical Oncology Branch and Affiliates Clinics, NCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tissue blocks and slides will be acquired from outside pathology departments and&#xD;
           received by the Clinical Pharmacology Program of the MOB/CCR/NCI for coding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bar-coded tissue blocks and slides will then be transferred to the Laboratory of&#xD;
           Pathology/CCR/NCI for proper long-term storage.&#xD;
