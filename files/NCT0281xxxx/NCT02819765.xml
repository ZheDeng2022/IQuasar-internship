      This study aims to establish a biorepository and phenotyping database to investigate&#xD;
      longitudinal changes in ALS subjects. Blood, including DNA and RNA, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      and electrophysiologic measures will be collected every 6 months over 1 and a half years. The&#xD;
      database and specimen repository will be made available to ALS researchers on a merit basis.&#xD;

      Rationale for the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) biorepository is an existing resource which has provided&#xD;
      scientists with a wide range of samples associated with clinical information. It is primarily&#xD;
      cross sectional in nature; longitudinal collections have been associated with a limited set&#xD;
      of clinical and functional assessments. The investigators goal is to continue to build this&#xD;
      repository with the collection protocol proposed here, to associate biofluid collection with&#xD;
      specific measures of upper and lower motor neuron function. This project will compliment&#xD;
      others to upgrade the NEALS biorepository infrastructure, including updating the computer&#xD;
      systems, expanding the number of sample freezers and establishing a repository in the Western&#xD;
      United States, and strengthening the standard operating procedures for the repository. The&#xD;
      project also supports existing efforts to expand the biorepository by collecting new blood&#xD;
      and spinal fluid samples from people with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a multicenter, non interventional, longitudinal study in patients with&#xD;
      ALS. There will be four (4) subject visits in this study: Baseline, month 6, month 12, and&#xD;
      month 18. At each visit, subjects will have biofluids collected, and be evaluated with&#xD;
      assessment tools that focus on upper and lower motor neuron burden as well as cognitive&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Endpoints The primary objective of the study is to obtain deep&#xD;
      phenotyping information on patients studied at regular intervals over 18 months, in&#xD;
      conjunction with biofluid collection over that same time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to integrate data from this study to other ongoing&#xD;
      projects via the NEALS biorepository, and future collections now being planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints for the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motor unit number estimation will be performed on upper extremity muscles using the&#xD;
           multipoint incremental technique (MIMUNE);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lower motor neuron excitability will be assessed with threshold tracking nerve&#xD;
           conduction studies (ttNCS) in the least affected intrinsic hand muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive abnormalities will be assessed using the ALS Cognitive Behavior Screen&#xD;
           (ALS-CBS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upper motor neuron burden will be assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
           (TMS), employing a paired pulse protocol and recording from the least affected upper&#xD;
           extremity intrinsic hand muscle;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hand held dynamometry (HHD) will be performed on 10 muscle groups tested bilaterally;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Global function (ALSFRS-R); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital capacity, measured using slow vital capacity (SVC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, blood will be collected and banked for biomarker discovery; CSF will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, month 6, and at month 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other exploratory objectives of the study (to be performed at Barrow Neurological Institute&#xD;
      only) will investigate to the composition of the &quot;pellet&quot; of processed CSF and a novel&#xD;
      imaging marker called MRI cytography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Locations Approximately 10 Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Centers in the US will&#xD;
      participate in the study. Sites that cannot perform the ttNCS and/or the TMS can still&#xD;
      participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Planned Subjects Fifty (50) subjects will be in the study. It is estimated that 5&#xD;
      subjects shall be enrolled per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population This study will be conducted in subjects who meet the El Escorial criteria&#xD;
      of possible, laboratory- supported probable, probable, or definite ALS. Time from diagnosis&#xD;
      to study entry must be 24 months or less. At screening, eligible subjects must be at least 18&#xD;
      years old and must provide written informed consent. Detailed criteria will be described in&#xD;
      the full protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study Active assessment period will be 18 months; a 1-year enrolment period is&#xD;
      expected.&#xD;

    <measure>ALS cognitive behavioral screen (ALS-CBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 6 months through month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBSâ„¢) is a short measure of cognition and behavior in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The cognitive section includes commonly used elements of standard testing batteries, consisting of 8 tasks, with a possible total score of 20. It can be administered by a physician or other clinical care staff and takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. The behavioral section (ALS Caregiver Behavioral Questionnaire) is composed of questions sensitive to organic brain changes. It consists of a set of questions that compare changes in personality and behavior since the onset of ALS, as well as yes/no questions about mood, pseudobulbar affect, and fatigue. It is completed by a caregiver, family member or other informant during the same time that the patient completes the cognitive portion. The questionnaire typically takes about 2 minutes to complete.</description>
