  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the acceptable upper limit dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab in combination with dasatinib that may be given to patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL).&#xD;
      Nivolumab is currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for other cancers, but has&#xD;
      not yet been investigated in Ph+ ALL. Dasatinib is currently FDA approved for the treatment&#xD;
      of Ph+ ALL, but has not yet been investigated in combination with nivolumab for this disease.&#xD;
      There is evidence that dasatinib not only blocks the Philadelphia chromosome or breakpoint&#xD;
      cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL) mutation, but also&#xD;
      increases the activity of cells in your immune system. Nivolumab increases T cells in your&#xD;
      immune system, which allows your immune system to attack the cancer. We think the combination&#xD;
      of these drugs will be more effective against your leukemia than either drug used alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab when given in combination with&#xD;
      dasatinib in patients with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute&#xD;
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities and safety profile of nivolumab and dasatinib in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the rate of complete hematologic remission (CR) after three cycles of&#xD;
      nivolumab and dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the rate of molecular remission after three cycles of nivolumab and&#xD;
      dasatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To study the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab and dasatinib. V. To evaluate programmed cell&#xD;
      death 1 (PD1) expression levels and saturation in the peripheral blood and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To measure peripheral T-cell levels and activation in response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 30 day mortality rate, overall survival (OS), progression free survival&#xD;
      (PFS), and duration of remission (DOR) one year after treatment with nivolumab when given in&#xD;
      combination with dasatinib in patients with relapsed/refractory Ph+ ALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the OS between patients who receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and&#xD;
      those who receive no further therapy following remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate for resistance mutations at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD ) on days 1-28 and nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 8 and 22 of course 1 and on days 1 and 15 of&#xD;
      subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then monthly for&#xD;
      up to 1 year.&#xD;
