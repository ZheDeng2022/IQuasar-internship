      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate major and minor neurologic events in&#xD;
      patients undergoing right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery and to compare different&#xD;
      aortic clamping techniques; specifically, the endoaortic balloon with retrograde perfusion&#xD;
      (Endoreturn) and the transthoracic clamp with retrograde perfusion. Major neurologic events&#xD;
      will be evaluate through standard neurologic evaluation; minor neurologic events will be&#xD;
      evaluate through magnetic resonance (MR) assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the study is to determine the number and impact of microembolic events&#xD;
      during right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery on clinical neurological status and on MR&#xD;
      evaluation. The investigators also aim to determine if different techniques of aortic&#xD;
      clamping may impact on early outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: despite recent concerns arising about endoaortic balloon with retrograde&#xD;
      perfusion, the investigators expect to show equivalence in term of safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of this technique compared with the transthoracic clamp in a selected population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of neurologic events in right mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery compared&#xD;
      with that of conventional surgery is a controversial issue and has been extensively studied.&#xD;
      In the meta-analysis published by Modi et al, equal occurrence of neurologic events between&#xD;
      patients who underwent MIMVS and those who underwent a median sternotomy was found.&#xD;
      Conversely, the Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac database and the Cleveland Clinic group&#xD;
      concluded that the risk of stroke is significantly higher in the less invasive group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, recent data have suggested that retrograde arterial perfusion, particularly in&#xD;
      patients with severe arch/ascending aortic atherosclerosis, could be the source of the&#xD;
      significant increase in the incidence of cerebral complications. The meta-analysis of Cheng,&#xD;
      documents a 1.79 fold increase in the risk of stroke in the right thoracotomy group, but on&#xD;
      subgroup analysis this appeared driven by a higher stroke risk in those studies reporting&#xD;
      endoaortic balloon occlusion and not transthoracic clamping. Murzi et al. report a 4.28 fold&#xD;
      increase in stroke risk with RAP in 1280 primary MIMVS patients. Grossi and colleagues show&#xD;
      that the only significant risk factor for neurologic event was the use of retrograde&#xD;
      perfusion in high-risk patients with aortic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized blinded study is to prospectively evaluate major and minor&#xD;
      neurologic events in patients undergoing right thoracotomy mitral valve surgery with&#xD;
      retrograde perfusion and endoaortic balloon clamp (Endoreturn) or transthoracic clamp. Major&#xD;
      neurologic events will be evaluate through standard neurologic evaluation; minor neurologic&#xD;
      events will be evaluate through magnetic resonance assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR evaluation will be performed by blinded radiologists. MR will be performed with a 3T&#xD;
      system (Philips INGENIA 3T). The protocol includes conventional sequences for the&#xD;
      morphological and quantitative assessment (3D-FLAIR, 3D-T1-TSE, DWI, T2-FFE) and non&#xD;
      conventional sequences for the white matter microstructural evaluation (Diffusion Tensor&#xD;
      Imaging - DTI with fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity). No contrast enhanced will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have no contraindications will undergo cerebral MR before surgery as baseline&#xD;
      assessment. Then, they will be randomized in one of the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no contraindications arise in the postoperative period (eg definitive pacemaker&#xD;
      implantation), patients will undergo cerebral MR before the discharge, to highlight the&#xD;
      presence of new ischemic lesions, even clinically silent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 months, patients who developed new ischemic lesions revealed by the post-operative&#xD;
      cerebral MR will repeat a new MR to assess evolution of cerebral damage Neurologic assessment&#xD;
      will be performed by blinded specialists of the Neurology Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single center randomized blinded study that will be performed at the University of Turin,&#xD;
      Citt√† della Salute e della Scienza Hospital and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac Surgery department. Neuroradiology department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the incidence of new lesions on pre-discharge MR in patients undergoing right&#xD;
      mini-thoracotomy mitral valve surgery according to different aortic clamping techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the correlation between clinical neurological peri-procedural events (TIA, Stroke),&#xD;
      and the occurrence of new lesions on pre-discharge MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the evolution of new cerebral ischemic lesions between pre-discharge MR and&#xD;
      follow-up MR (more than 6 months later).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the investigators knowledge this is the first randomized blinded study that will compare&#xD;
      two right mini-thoracotomy techniques for mitral valve surgery on a selected population&#xD;
      (without risk factors for neurological events) with MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of this study will be able to allow surgeons to choose the best and less dangerous&#xD;
      method in case of mini-invasive operations. This could rapresent a fundamental step in&#xD;
      confirming the efficacy and safety of mini-invasive approaches for mitral valve surgery and&#xD;
      resulting, in addition, in the reduction of the costs of these procedures.&#xD;
