  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a major health problem with serious consequences for the quality of life of&#xD;
      elderly people: it increases the number of hospitalizations and lengths of stay, worsens&#xD;
      functional dependency and increases morbidity and mortality rates There are numerous&#xD;
      recommendations and tools to detect or to manage malnutrition and the prescription of Oral&#xD;
      Nutritional Supplements (ONS) can be a solution. As the elderly suffer from food monotony, as&#xD;
      well as age-related changes, which may or may not be associated with the presence of disease,&#xD;
      it is necessary to ensure full ingestion of the prescribed supplements to optimize the&#xD;
      benefits provided by these products. To achieve this it is necessary to know the chemosensory&#xD;
      characteristics of foods enjoyed by hospitalized elderly people who are malnourished or at&#xD;
      risk of malnutrition. The investigators make the hypothesis that by further optimizing taste&#xD;
      and energy content of foods, consumption by the elderly and the health benefits would be&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;

A first half of volunteers will start the testing process with the beverages at day 1 and continue with the creams at day 2.

The test order of flavors will be randomly allocated to the volunteers among the list of all possible combinations.</description>
