      This post-authorization observational safety study determines the characteristics of patients&#xD;
      prescribed naloxegol at time of first prescription and treatment patterns of naloxegol in&#xD;
      follow-up in the United Kingdom (UK), Norway, Sweden, and Germany.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The overall research questions for this study are: 1) What are the demographic, clinical, and&#xD;
      treatment characteristics (including dose) at baseline of patients prescribed naloxegol in&#xD;
      real-world practice (including the use of naloxegol in non-indicated populations)? and 2)&#xD;
      What are the treatment patterns of naloxegol utilization during follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the characteristics of patients prescribed naloxegol at time of first&#xD;
           prescription (demographics, targeted comorbidities, targeted comedications, provider&#xD;
           characteristics, and indication characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe any of the following treatment patterns:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Discontinuation of naloxegol (permanently during the observation period)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Switching from naloxegol to other drug(s) potentially used by patients with opioid&#xD;
                induced constipation (OIC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prescription of other drug(s) potentially used by patients with OIC in the same&#xD;
                period when naloxegol is prescribed (augmentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Restart in the prescription of naloxegol (after temporary discontinuation or&#xD;
                treatment holiday)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuous treatment with naloxegol during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Change in dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To identify predictors of length of naloxegol use&#xD;

        Patients in the targeted countries who are newly prescribed naloxegol will be identified&#xD;
        for inclusion. Patients analyzed in this study will be those who have at least 12 months of&#xD;
        continuous data available prior to first prescription. The number of patients who do not&#xD;
        have at least 12 months of prior data will be reported for completeness.&#xD;
