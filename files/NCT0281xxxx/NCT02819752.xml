  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish whether the combination of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and&#xD;
      conventional cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is tolerable and results in acceptable levels&#xD;
      of acute and late toxicity in patients with stage IV LA-SCCHN. In particular, the study will&#xD;
      provide data on the levels of mucosal and cutaneous toxicity within the radiation fields, as&#xD;
      these are the primary acute toxicities associated with this treatment regimen. In addition,&#xD;
      toxicity outside the radiation portals (which may theoretically be exacerbated by radiation)&#xD;
      will be studied. However, all toxicity will be monitored. This study will also give an&#xD;
      indication of the activity of pembrolizumab in LA-SCCHN because we are deliberately selecting&#xD;
      a group of patients with high- and intermediate-risk disease who have a significant chance of&#xD;
      experiencing loco-regional or systemic failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre phase 1 dose-escalation study to confirm the safety of combining&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with standard platin-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage IV high-&#xD;
      and intermediate-risk locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&#xD;
      (LA-SCCHN). 6-36 patients (18 HPV+ve and 18 HPV-ve) will be recruited in a standard 3+3&#xD;
      dose-escalation trial design with an expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (or 200&#xD;
      mg, if no DLT is defined). A pre-loading dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will be given once the patient has completed the screening period. Patients&#xD;
      will then return 2 weeks later to begin cycle 1 of a regimen of pembrolizumab 3 weekly at a&#xD;
      dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) for a total of 7 cycles (3 during&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy and 4 after chemoradiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parallel studies in HPV-ve and HPV +ve disease will be conducted (note these patients may&#xD;
      have different patterns of co-morbidity and, hence, different treatment-related toxicities).&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study will be safety and tolerability. Dose-limiting acute&#xD;
      toxicity will be assessed during administration of study drug according to CTCAEv4.0. The&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose of study drug (or 200 mg in the absence of DLT) will be used in a&#xD;
      subsequent randomised phase 2 study comparing standard-of-care therapy with standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapy plus study drug.&#xD;
