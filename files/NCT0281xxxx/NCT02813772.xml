  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infant colic (IC) is responsible of 25% of pediatric consultation in the first 3-4 months of&#xD;
      life affecting from 5% to 30% of infants between 2 weeks and 3 months of life (3, 4). The&#xD;
      variability in the prevalence of IC reported by the several studies depends on different&#xD;
      criteria used to define IC.The etiology of IC remains still unclear. Recently, the&#xD;
      composition of intestinal microbiome has been addressed as an independent risk factor for IC.&#xD;
      There are no uniform criteria for a specific therapeutic approach of IC. Based on these&#xD;
      conclusions the objectives of our study are: to determine whether the administration of a&#xD;
      partially hydrolyzed formula (pHF) with reduced lactose content and Lactobacillus reuteri, is&#xD;
      beneficial in IC in reducing the infant crying duration and in prolonging the duration of&#xD;
      sleeping period&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Definition Infantile Colic (IC) is one of the Functional gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders (FGIDs) of infants/toddlers, which are defined as a variable combination of chronic&#xD;
      or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms not explained by structural or biochemical&#xD;
      abnormalities. In 2006, the Rome III committee established a new criteria defining it as&#xD;
      &quot;episodes of irritability, fussing, or crying that begin and end for no apparent reason and&#xD;
      last at least three hours a day, at least three days a week, for at least one week&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology IC is responsible of 25% of pediatric consultation in the first 3-4 months of&#xD;
      life affecting from 5% to 30% of infants between 2 weeks and 3 months of life. The&#xD;
      variability in the prevalence of IC reported by the several studies depends on different&#xD;
      criteria used to define IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a systematic review of 15 community-based surveys on IC prevalence, carried out in 2001,&#xD;
      the occurrence rates in the first 3 months of life were from 3% to 28% in prospective studies&#xD;
      and from 8% and 40% in retrospective studies. In a prospective study found that 20.5% of 2879&#xD;
      Italian infants, aged 2 weeks-6 months, had IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a French study reported a prevalence of IC in infants aged 0-4 months, of 19%. In&#xD;
      two english studies, IC was reported in 18.3% and 26 % respectively, of infants aged 0-12&#xD;
      months. Other European studies were conducted with a different reported prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outside Europe, a prevalence of 9.2% and of 20% respectively were reported by two studies&#xD;
      carried out in US. More recently in an Israeli study of 94 mothers of 2-4 moths of life&#xD;
      infants, 56% of those whose babies were breastfed and 73% of those using formula reported&#xD;
      &quot;paroxysmal irritability&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several studies found occurrence rates of crying/fussing problems in young&#xD;
      infants ranging from 7% to 19%, without defining the problems as IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathogenesis The etiology of IC remains still unclear. Gender, type of milk (breast-milk or&#xD;
      formula), delivery modality (vaginally or caesarean), mother age, number of siblings and&#xD;
      gestational history do not seem to be correlated to IC onset. Gastrointestinal function,&#xD;
      psychosocial, and neurodevelopmental disorders, food intolerance, transient low lactase&#xD;
      activity, cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota imbalance have been suggested as the cause of colic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal theories include increased intra-abdominal gas, hyperperistalsis and&#xD;
      visceral pain. Gastrointestinal disorders have been implicated in colic because of the&#xD;
      infant's leg position and grimacing during the crying episodes. Excessive crying or increased&#xD;
      gas production from colon function can result in intraluminal gas formation and aerophagia,&#xD;
      even if radiographic images taken during a crying episode have shown a normal gastric&#xD;
      outline. One study has suggested that infants with colic may have increased fecal&#xD;
      calprotectin levels, suggesting a possible role for gut inflammation; however, another study&#xD;
      suggested no differences in fecal calprotectin levels between infants with and infants&#xD;
      without colic. Gut hormones, such as motilin, also may play a causative role in colic.&#xD;
      Motilin is thought to cause hyperperistalsis, leading to abdominal pain and colic. Regarding&#xD;
      psychosocial hypotheses, maternal anxiety and depression, and difficult infant temperament&#xD;
      have been correlated to IC. Also behavioral issues such as family tension or inadequate&#xD;
      interaction between parents and infant have been considered, but these issues are really&#xD;
      controversial. Concomitant risk factors remain partially unknown; however, maternal smoking,&#xD;
      increased maternal age and firstborn status may be associated to the development of IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of intestinal microbiome in Infantile Colic Recently, the composition of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiome has been addressed as an independent risk factor for IC. Several studies indicate&#xD;
      that inadequate lactobacilli in the first few months of life may affect intestinal fatty acid&#xD;
      profile favoring the development of IC. Coliform bacteria have also been found more&#xD;
      abundantly in colicky infants and it is speculated that altering the intestinal microbiota&#xD;
      composition may positively influence the management of affected infants. As a matter of fact,&#xD;
      recently, research into the use of probiotics for colic has been rapidly increasing but&#xD;
      results are conflicting. Infants with colic are reported to have increased concentration of&#xD;
      gas forming organisms and proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli in their gut. Colonization&#xD;
      with certain intestinal microorganisms, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species,&#xD;
      along with increased intestinal microbial diversity, may protect against infant distress.&#xD;
      Probiotics enhance the mucosal barrier and promote microbial diversity in the gut. They may&#xD;
      reduce concentrations of proteobacteria and gas forming coliform and reduce intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One clinical trial showed safety and efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri in prevention of IC. A&#xD;
      recent meta-analysis of three small, randomized controlled trials, of breast-fed infants with&#xD;
      IC reported that Lactobacillus reuteri noticeably reduced crying time at 21 days post&#xD;
      supplementation. Recently Chau et al showed that administration of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM&#xD;
      17938 significantly improved colic symptoms by reducing crying and fussing times in breastfed&#xD;
      Canadian infants with colic. In contrast, a double blind, placebo controlled randomized trial&#xD;
      on the same probiotic strain Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 showed that it did not benefit a&#xD;
      community sample of breast-fed infants and formula-fed infants with IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of diet in Infant colic There are no uniform criteria for a specific therapeutic&#xD;
      approach of IC. Regarding dietary modifications on management of IC, current evidence&#xD;
      suggests that they may reduce IC in only a very small minority of infants. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      evidence is often contrasting. For the breast-fed infants with IC, where there is the&#xD;
      relatively rare concern of a cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), one can consider eliminating&#xD;
      cow's milk from the maternal diet for a minimum of two weeks. For the formula-fed infants&#xD;
      with colic, the use of a time-limited (two weeks) empiric trial of an extensively hydrolyzed&#xD;
      formula may be considered. However this information derived from studies in highly selected&#xD;
      patients from tertiary care level centers. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, a&#xD;
      partial hydrolyzed, with high Î²-palmitate, and a specific prebiotics mixture with galacto-&#xD;
      and fructo-oligosaccharides resulted in a significant decrease of colic within one week of&#xD;
      intervention. In some cases, these formulas are lactose-reduced or lactose-free and contain&#xD;
      prebiotics or probiotics causing a reduction in the number of crying episodes per week and&#xD;
      total crying time. Infante et al showed an association between clinical improvement and&#xD;
      evidence of decreased levels of hydrogen in IC when the infants were fed with a specially&#xD;
      designed, low-lactose formula. Moreover, in two double-blinded crossover trials, lactase&#xD;
      treatment reduced crying time compared with placebo. The use of soy formulas, instead, in the&#xD;
      treatment of IC should be avoided since it can induce sensitization to soy and it's high in&#xD;
      isoflavones with estradiol-like effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
