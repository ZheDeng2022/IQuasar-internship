      Purpose and rationale The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of high dose&#xD;
      Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)-antagonists and beta-blocker treatment for the primary&#xD;
      prevention of cardiac events in a population of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)&#xD;
      with no evidence of a preexisting cardiac disease. An additional aim is to demonstrate an&#xD;
      interaction between concentrations of amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide&#xD;
      (NT-proBNP as a surrogate of imminent cardiac risk) and treatment effects and the economic&#xD;
      impact of the intervention overall and in the biomarker stratified subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective Superiority of high dose treatment with RAS-antagonists and beta-blockers&#xD;
      compared to conventional therapy regarding the reduction of unplanned hospitalization or&#xD;
      death due to a cardiac event in T2DM patients with a NT-proBNP &gt; 125pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an additional eye-substudy for Viennese sites only. The purpose of this sub-study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of high dose RAS-antagonists and beta blocker treatment on early&#xD;
      subclinical signs of diabetic micro-angiopathy and neuropathy. An additional aim will be the&#xD;
      evaluation of the possible impact of the cardiovascular risk factor NT-proBNP on the onset&#xD;
      and progression of diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Primary objective Superiority of high dose treatment with RAS-antagonists and beta-blockers&#xD;
      compared to conventional therapy regarding the reduction of unplanned hospitalization or&#xD;
      death due to a cardiac event in T2DM patients with a NT-proBNP &gt; 125pg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary objective Superiority of high dose treatment with RAS-antagonists and&#xD;
      beta-blockers compared to conventional therapy regarding the reduction of unplanned&#xD;
      hospitalization or death due to a cardiac event in T2DM patients in the whole population&#xD;
      Secondary objective Dependency of treatment efficacy (reduction of unplanned hospitalization&#xD;
      or death due to a cardiac event in T2DM patients) on the NT-proBNP concentration (interaction&#xD;
      effect between NT-proBNP concentrations and treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population The study population will consist of patients with T2DM without any history or&#xD;
      signs of cardiac disease. Patients from approximately 20 centers worldwide will be included&#xD;
      into the study and randomized 1:1 to intensive or conventional therapy. It is estimated that&#xD;
      about 3000 patients have to be screened In order to include 2400 patients. The screen failure&#xD;
      rate is anticipated to be approximately 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational and reference therapy All eligible patients will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either a high dose of RAS-antagonists and beta-blockers (as defined in the section&#xD;
      investigational drugs) on top of standard diabetes therapy or solely standard diabetes&#xD;
      therapy. The use of RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker therapy at randomization is allowed in&#xD;
      the control group (with the exception of maximal dosage), but prescription or titration&#xD;
      during the study period is not encouraged. However, if the investigators feel that further&#xD;
      prescription or up-titration is required a thorough justification is mandatory. Every attempt&#xD;
      should be made to use other blood pressure lowering drugs than RAS-antagonists or&#xD;
      beta-blockers in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study is a randomized open-label, parallel group, active-controlled,&#xD;
      two-arm, long-term morbidity and mortality trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of high&#xD;
      dose RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker therapy (as defined in the section investigational&#xD;
      drugs) compared to standard diabetes therapy in patients with diabetes without any history or&#xD;
      sign of a cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal is to include 2400 patients. The observation period is planned to last for two&#xD;
      years. However, the trial is event driven and will continue until predefined event rate is&#xD;
      reached. The total trial duration is expected to last for four years (two years of&#xD;
      recruitment and a two year observation period after last patient in). Every patient will&#xD;
      remain in the study for two years after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 Screening At the first visit eligibility to enter the study will be assessed by the&#xD;
      investigator. All inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated. Informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained. Demographic data and drug prescription will be assessed. Blood will be obtained.&#xD;
      Blood chemistry will be assessed locally. NT-proBNP will be determined by a point of care&#xD;
      system locally. The investigator will be blinded to the result, which will be sent to the&#xD;
      central computer. Blood will be obtained for the core lab, centrifuged and stored at -80°&#xD;
      Celsius at the local unit. Vital signs will be obtained. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      electronically, this way randomization can be performed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (3 months) At visit 2 vital signs will be obtained. Blood will be drawn. Blood&#xD;
      chemistry parameters will be assessed locally for safety reason. Drug prescription will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (12 months) At visit 3 vital signs will be obtained. Blood will be drawn. Blood&#xD;
      chemistry parameters will be assessed locally for safety reason. Drug prescription will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 EOS (end of study) (24 months) At visit 4 vital signs will be obtained. Blood will be&#xD;
      drawn. Blood chemistry parameters will be assessed locally for safety reason. Additional&#xD;
      blood samples will be sent to the core laboratory. Drug prescription will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1-4 is mandatory for all patients. Long-term follow-up Patients with be further&#xD;
      followed by population register or telephone contact respectively until completion of the&#xD;
      study to determine long-term mortality and hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled visits for the treatment group The treatment group will have additional visits&#xD;
      for up-titration of RAS-antagonists and beta- blocker between visit 1 and visit 2. The&#xD;
      frequency is up to the treating physician and dependent on the titration steps. A visit is&#xD;
      not mandatory for each titration step. Patients will receive a logbook by the investigator,&#xD;
      with weekly up- titration steps of the drugs. Additionally, patients will receive a diary for&#xD;
      daily documentation of blood pressure, heart rate and symptoms if measurement is technically&#xD;
      feasible for the patient. Based on own measurements, these data and laboratory results the&#xD;
      investigator will decide if further up-titration of medication is possible. Systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure should not decrease permanently below 100 mmHg and heart not below 60bpm&#xD;
      permanently. Recommended drugs and recommended dosages are outlined in the section&#xD;
      &quot;Treatment&quot;. At each visit, blood chemistry for eGFR, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),&#xD;
      sodium and potassium will be obtained for safety reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details of the eye-substudy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PONTIAC Eye Study is a masked longitudinal follow up of previously 1:1 randomized study&#xD;
      patients participating in the PONTIAC 2 study. It is planed to include 130 consecutive&#xD;
      patients for biannually visits over a study period of 2 years. Study patients (n=130) will be&#xD;
      assigned to the Department of Ophthalmology and Optometry of the Medical University Vienna&#xD;
      once they are included in the PONTIAC 2 Study in one of the participating Centers in Vienna.&#xD;
      The investigators will be masked to the patient's randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the sub-study is: Superiority of the treatment arm with&#xD;
      RAS-antagonists and beta-blockers compared to conventional therapy regarding thickness-change&#xD;
      in the retinal nerve fiber layer or outer nuclear layer measured in spectral domain optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography.&#xD;
