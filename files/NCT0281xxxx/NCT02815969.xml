    <textblock>
      This is an observational and exploratory study. Participants will be asked for a blood&#xD;
      collection and a 24- hour collection of urine. The indol profile and levels of catecholamine&#xD;
      and metabolites in PRP, as well as in 24- hour collection of urine will be measured with&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS and analyzed.&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuro-endocrine neoplasms are a diverse group of tumors which encompasses heterogeneous&#xD;
      clinical courses. Different NETs are characterized by differences in the synthesis, storage&#xD;
      and release of biogenic amines and their metabolites, e.g. indoles, catecholamines and their&#xD;
      metabolites. Clinical course, prognosis, and treatment are based, among others, on the origin&#xD;
      of the primary tumor. Up to now it was only possible to measure metabolic output of NETs by&#xD;
      serotonin in platelets and 5-HIAA in urine. Due to technical improvements we can now measure&#xD;
      the complete metabolic pathway of serotonin in plasma and urine, which comprises tryptophan,&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin and 5-HIAA, the indol profile. Furthermore, levels of&#xD;
      catecholamines and metabolites can now be analyzed in the same sample. This metabolic&#xD;
      profiling could potentially lead to improved diagnosis and characterization of NET patients&#xD;
      and possibly contribute to subsequent treatment consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we want to perform an exploratory study to measure the indol profile,&#xD;
      catecholamines and metabolites in patients with NETs of different origin (foregut, midgut and&#xD;
      hindgut) and assess differentiation of their metabolic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the added value of the indol profile in comparison to&#xD;
      serotonin in platelets and 5-HIAA in urine for diagnosis and potentially management of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors including gastrinomas, pNETs and brochopulmonary NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational and exploratory study. Participants will be asked for a blood&#xD;
      collection and a 24- hour collection of urine. The indol profile and levels of catecholamine&#xD;
      and metabolites in PRP, as well as in 24- hour collection of urine will be measured with&#xD;
      LC-MS/MS and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will use PRP and a 24- hour collection of urine of 70 patients with a&#xD;
      foregut NET, 70 patients with a midgut and/or hindgut NET and 70 matched healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers are matched according to age and sex with the included patients. Matched&#xD;
      controls already available in our data bank will be used from the earlier approved SERT study&#xD;
      (NCT 01398306)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this exploratory study we will measure the indol profile in patients with a foregut NET,&#xD;
      mid- and hindgut NET, and healthy volunteers at the time of diagnosis and during follow up&#xD;
      and treatment in plasma and urine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, levels of catecholamines and metabolites in these three groups will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with midgut NET already have blood collections and urinary collection as part of&#xD;
      evaluation of their treatment. Only for patients with foregut NETs and some of the healthy&#xD;
      volunteers one extra blood collection with a vena puncture will be taken. This gives a small&#xD;
      risk of bruising. Furthermore a 24-hours collection of urine will be collected with a&#xD;
      prescription to their diet 48 hours before the collection. This could give some distress.&#xD;
