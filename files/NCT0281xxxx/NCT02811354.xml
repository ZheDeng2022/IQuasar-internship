  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a highly specific and effective biomarker for the detection&#xD;
      of EGFR mutation status. We hypothesise AZD9291 is efficacious in patients with EGFR&#xD;
      sensitizing mutations and T790M detected in plasma ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open label, multi-centre single arm phase II study assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of AZD9291 monotherapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV harboring&#xD;
      sensitising EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations) and&#xD;
      T790M who have progressed following prior treatment with an approved EGFR TKI. Approximately&#xD;
      106 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must have documented radiological progression on EGFR-TKI treatment and on the&#xD;
      last treatment administered prior to enrolling in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As T790M is the most common mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR TKI, EGFR TKIs targeting&#xD;
      T790M has been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD9291 is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for sensitizing (EGFRm) and T790M&#xD;
      resistance mutation with a significant selectivity margin against wild-type EGFR. As a&#xD;
      result, AZD9291 can effectively block EGFR signaling both in EGFR single mutant cells with&#xD;
      activating EGFR mutations and in double mutant cells bearing the resistance T790M mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, open label, multi-centre single arm phase II study assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of AZD9291 monotherapy in patients with stage IIIB or IV harboring&#xD;
      sensitising EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations) and&#xD;
      T790M who have progressed following prior treatment with an approved EGFR TKI. Approximately&#xD;
      108 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must have documented radiological progression on EGFR-TKI treatment and on the&#xD;
      last treatment administered prior to enrolling in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be &gt; 18 years of age, with a diagnosis of locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC not&#xD;
      amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy with documented activating EGFR mutations (exon&#xD;
      19 deletions and exon 21 L858R substitution mutations) at the time of initial diagnosis, have&#xD;
      radiological disease progression following either 1st line EGFR TKI treatment OR following&#xD;
      prior therapy with an EGFR TKI and a platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Plasma sample must&#xD;
      harbour an EGFR mutation known to be associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (exon 19 deletion,&#xD;
      L858R as well as presence of T790M by central lab testing from a plasma sample taken after&#xD;
      confirmation of disease progression on the most recent treatment regimen. Patients must have&#xD;
      normal organ and bone marrow function and ECOG PS 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and regimens:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be treated with AZD9291 at a starting dose of 80mg once a day until the patient&#xD;
      completes the study, withdraws from the study or closure of the study. A cycle of treatment&#xD;
      is defined as 28 days of once daily AZD9291 treatment. Patients may continue to receive&#xD;
      AZD9291 until objective disease progression (determined by RECIST 1.1) or if the subject is&#xD;
      no longer receiving clinical benefit in the Investigator's opinion.&#xD;
