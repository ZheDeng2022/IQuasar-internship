  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a major and frequent complication occurring&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery, contributing to prolonged intensive care and hospital stays and is&#xD;
      associated with several cardiovascular complications. The exact mechanisms and signaling&#xD;
      pathways involved in the development of POAF seem to be multifactorial and remain to date&#xD;
      incompletely understood. β-blockers and amiodarone are the first line preventive drugs but&#xD;
      are partially effective and near 30% of POAF resist to these strategies. In this context,&#xD;
      there is some evidence indicating that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and Galectin-3&#xD;
      (Gal-3) share signaling pathways in the development of cardiac fibrosis and therefore could&#xD;
      be very useful predictive biomarkers of POAF and potentially interesting therapeutic target&#xD;
      to prevent POAF occurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that preoperative plasma aldosterone levels and galectin-3&#xD;
      (Gal-3) expression (in plasma, right atrial appendage or epicardial fat) could be predictive&#xD;
      of POAF in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery with preserved LVEF.&#xD;
