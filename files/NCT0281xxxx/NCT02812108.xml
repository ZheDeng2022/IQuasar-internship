  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to collect a large series of patients with aneurysms treated&#xD;
      endovascularly to analyze hemodynamic factors that affect aneurysm recanalization.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid development of endovascular technique, endovascular treatment has become the&#xD;
      first line treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Compared to microsurgical clipping,&#xD;
      less invasive and lower morbidity have been shown after endovascular treatment. However, the&#xD;
      aneurysms recanalization is the drawback of such modality. It has been reported that many&#xD;
      factors, including complete initial embolization, stent assisted coiling, dense packing and&#xD;
      flow diverter, could reduce recanalization rate. Larger size, wide neck, rupture status and&#xD;
      intraluminal thrombosis are reported as risk factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, no&#xD;
      analysis of hemodynamic risk factors affecting the aneurysm recanalization has been conducted&#xD;
      in a large prospective series of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamics is reported to play an important role in aneurysm initiation, growth and&#xD;
      rupture. Previous studies have showed that the hemodynamics is associated with outcomes of&#xD;
      aneurysms after endovascular treatment. High wall shear stress and flow velocity are risk&#xD;
      factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, the relationship between hemodynamics and&#xD;
      aneurysm outcomes is still unclear. To explore the hemodynamic predictors of aneurysm&#xD;
      recanalization is of great value for clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic analysis for intracranial aneurysms recanalization after endovascular treatment&#xD;
      (HARET) is a prospective trial designed to collect a large series of patients with aneurysms&#xD;
      treated endovascularly to analyze hemodynamic factors that affect aneurysm recanalization.&#xD;
