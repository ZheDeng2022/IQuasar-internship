    <textblock>
      This post-authorization observational safety study (PASS) monitors clinically important&#xD;
      identified and potential risks within a cohort of patients treated with naloxegol, including&#xD;
      the occurrence of bowel perforation, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV)-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity. This study is part of a broader&#xD;
      post-marketing commitment to augment routine evaluation of the safety profile of naloxegol in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the&#xD;
      safety of naloxegol in the indicated population, grouped by cancer or non-cancer, and within&#xD;
      at-risk vulnerable non-cancer populations identified in the naloxegol risk management plan&#xD;
      (RMP) by describing type and frequency of identified and potential risks (including bowel&#xD;
      perforation, acute MI, stroke, CV-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension,&#xD;
      opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity) in&#xD;
      patients ≥18 years of age who were treated with opioids chronically and subsequently treated&#xD;
      with naloxegol in routine post-authorization use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of bowel perforation,&#xD;
      acute MI, stroke, all-cause mortality, and hypertension in patients treated with naloxegol&#xD;
      (Naloxegol Inception Cohort, (NIC)), grouped by cancer or non cancer, a Concurrent Reference&#xD;
      Cohort (CRC) by cancer or non-cancer, and by pre-specified non-cancer sub-populations that&#xD;
      include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior CV, patients with&#xD;
      prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with&#xD;
      concurrent use of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibitors/inducer or P-glycoprotein (Pgp)&#xD;
      modulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of CV-specific&#xD;
      mortality, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity&#xD;
      in patients treated with naloxegol (NIC) grouped by cancer and non cancer, a CRC grouped by&#xD;
      cancer or non cancer, and by pre-specified non-cancer sub-populations that include patients&#xD;
      aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with&#xD;
      prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with&#xD;
      concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors/inducer or Pgp modulators.&#xD;
