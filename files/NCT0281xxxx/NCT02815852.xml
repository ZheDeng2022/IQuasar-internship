      The purpose of this study is to review retrospectively cases of breast cancer of the centers&#xD;
      belonging to the BREST UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area and compare the imaging&#xD;
      characteristics (ultrasound, mammography and mammary MRI if available) of breast cancer with&#xD;
      the corresponding histological reports and assess whether in women &lt;40 years the typical&#xD;
      imaging presentation pattern of malignancies observed in women&gt; 40 years are confirmed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women and the leading cause of death in women&#xD;
      under 50 years in the USA. In Italy, the Pool Airtum 2007-2010 figures confirm that breast&#xD;
      cancer, excluding skin cancers, is 29% of cancers diagnosed in women and the leading cause of&#xD;
      death in women, for the regions in which are active the cancer registries . Among women,&#xD;
      breast cancer ranks first in all age groups: represents 29% of deaths in women aged &lt;49&#xD;
      years, 23% in women between 50 and 69 years and 16% between women aged&gt; 70 years. The disease&#xD;
      is uncommon before age 30 but the European Cancer registries have detected since 1990 an&#xD;
      increased incidence of breast cancer in women before age 40. For this reason it can be&#xD;
      important to start to verify the incidence of breast cancer before age 40 in the BREAST UNIT&#xD;
      of the Tuscany North-West Wide Area (Versilia, Lucca and Massa-Carrara). Mammography, which&#xD;
      is the reference examination for prevention in women after age 40, has not shown before this&#xD;
      age evidence of efficacy. Ultrasound examination, complementary to mammography, is generally&#xD;
      well tolerated but did not demonstrate efficacy in prospective studies as a screening in&#xD;
      reducing mortality. MRI with intravenous contrast medium is considered the exam with higher&#xD;
      sensitivity in identifying neoplastic lesions especially in young women. This study therefore&#xD;
      aims to review retrospectively cases of breast cancer of the centers belonging to the BREST&#xD;
      UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area to locate a number of cases to allow for a comparison on&#xD;
      the imaging characteristics (ultrasound, mammography and mammary MRI if available) of breast&#xD;
      cancer and assess whether in women &lt;40 years the typical imaging presentation pattern of&#xD;
      malignancies observed in women&gt; 40 years are confirmed. In this study will be involved&#xD;
      pathological anatomy of the BREAST UNIT Tuscany North-West Wide Area (Massa-Carrara,&#xD;
      Versilia, Lucca); Radiology (Massa-Carrara, Versilia, Lucca); Clinical breast surgery /&#xD;
      oncology / radiology of the three USL (Massa-Carrara, Versilia, Lucca) of the Tuscany&#xD;
      North-West Wide Area. Data of patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 01/01/2009 to&#xD;
      31/12/2015 will be collected starting in july 2016 and the publication of results will take&#xD;
      place by December 2016.Risk factors, genetic mutations, receptors status, tumor stage,&#xD;
      therapies for NHL / LH and previous breast tumors will be analyzed as well. The data will be&#xD;
      stratified by: age (&lt;30 years, 30-35 years and 35-39 years), biological parameters on&#xD;
      histology, stage at diagnosis and imaging features. Patients undergoing breast biopsy&#xD;
      sampling represent an already select group who may be susceptible to information bias&#xD;
      inherent risk factors: to reduce this bias will recover all the information about the risk&#xD;
      factors for breast cancer. 2) operator-dependent variability of ultrasound images: will be&#xD;
      taken into account in the data analysis, as well as different machines used in the various&#xD;
      hospitals and diversity of the reporting method. 3) The patients for which it will not be&#xD;
      possible to correct analysis of the data will be excluded, but the selection bias of patients&#xD;
      will still be taken into account in the analysis of the data.The statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      done in 1 month, and the results will be published by December 2016.&#xD;
