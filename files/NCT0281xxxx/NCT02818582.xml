  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some people have Ebola virus in their body for months after they recover from Ebola virus&#xD;
      disease. Some may have health problems from the virus while others are fine. These people may&#xD;
      be able to pass the virus to others. There are currently no drugs for people who have&#xD;
      survived Ebola virus disease but still have the virus in their body. A new drug, GS-5734,&#xD;
      might help get rid of Ebola virus in semen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if GS-5734 helps get rid of Ebola virus in semen and is safe for humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men who participated in the Ebola survivor study (PREVAIL III) and have evidence of the Ebola&#xD;
      virus in their semen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eye exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 semen samples if they have not had it tested recently&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must live near the study site in Liberia for 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be put into 1 of 2 study groups. They will have an infusion of either&#xD;
      GS-5734 or a placebo every day for 5 days. A plastic tube is put into an arm vein. The&#xD;
      infusion lasts 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be observed for 1 hour after. They will provide a semen sample on infusion&#xD;
      day 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the infusions, participants will have 5 visits in the first month, then 1 per month for&#xD;
      5 more months. These include giving a blood and semen sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests are performed before and after each infusion and the last visit (5 month visit)&#xD;
      will also include an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the study is over, if the study drug works and is safe, participants who got the placebo&#xD;
      can get the study drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the unprecedented size of the recent 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, the&#xD;
      scientific community is learning a great deal about the psychological and physical&#xD;
      consequences of Ebola, Ebola viral persistence in survivors, risk of Ebola disease relapse in&#xD;
      survivors, and the potential for survivors to transmit the virus to others. Data from PREVAIL&#xD;
      III has demonstrated that persistence of Ebola virus in the semen of male survivors is&#xD;
      common. In addition to Ebola virus persistence, Ebola relapse causing clinical disease has&#xD;
      been well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no licensed therapies for the treatment of Ebola virus disease nor for the&#xD;
      clearance of persistent Ebola virus in survivors. A safe, effective therapy that can reduce&#xD;
      and/or eliminate persistent Ebola virus from semen would reduce the risk of transmission and&#xD;
      enable male survivors to resume normal sexual relations without fear of harming loved ones.&#xD;
      The mechanism underlying Post-Ebola Syndrome is as yet unknown, but improvement in Post-Ebola&#xD;
      signs and symptoms resulting from GS-5734 treatment would be an added benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, two-phase (treatment and longer-term follow-up),&#xD;
      two- arm trial of GS-5734 versus placebo among male Ebola survivors with persistent Ebola&#xD;
      virus RNA in their semen. Participants are randomized 1:1 to receive either 100 mg of GS-5734&#xD;
      or placebo once daily by intravenous catheter for 5 days. Informed by transaminase elevations&#xD;
      in prior Phase I studies in normal healthy subjects, a risk-mitigation strategy includes a&#xD;
      built-in dose de-escalation. Participants will be stratified by country and on the basis of&#xD;
      one versus two positive semen samples for Ebola virus RNA using the Cepheid GeneXpert&#xD;
      platform assessed within 42 days prior to study enrollment. The early DSMB review in August&#xD;
      2016 concluded there was no need for a cohort dose reduction. The protocol expanded to Guinea&#xD;
      in October 2017, where the outbreak ended later. Currently there is an outbreak in the&#xD;
      Democratic Republic of the Congo where the study team may evaluate conducting this study&#xD;
      following the completion of the outbreak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiviral activity, as well as safety and tolerability, will be assessed during the treatment&#xD;
      phase. Longer-term clearance of Ebola virus will be assessed during the 5-month follow-up&#xD;
      phase. Primary analyses for the assessment of antiviral activity in the treatment phase will&#xD;
      focus on the assay negativity rate (ANR; percentage of genital samples that are negative for&#xD;
      Ebola) over the first 28 days of the study, as well as clinical and laboratory adverse&#xD;
      events. A sample is considered negative by PCR if the test result is undetectable. Primary&#xD;
      analysis for the follow-up phase will focus on the ANR collected monthly from months 2 to 6.&#xD;
