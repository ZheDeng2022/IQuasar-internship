  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of acellular adipose&#xD;
      tissue (AAT), intended for the repair of soft tissue defects in humans, in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. The investigators hypothesize that AAT will be safe and well tolerated upon&#xD;
      injection into human soft tissue.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, prospective, Phase I study in healthy volunteers assessing the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of acellular adipose tissue (AAT) intended for the repair of soft tissue defects&#xD;
      in humans. Up to five (5) 2 milliliters (mL) subcutaneous injections of AAT will be&#xD;
      administered into redundant tissues previously identified and scheduled for surgical removal&#xD;
      in an elective surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled and assigned chronologically to one of five excision time&#xD;
      points: Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 post-injection. Implants will be injected on Day 0. A safety&#xD;
      visit will occur at 1 week post-injection; follow-up visits will occur at Weeks 2 and 4 (for&#xD;
      patients who still have implants) post-injection and at time of tissue excision. At the end&#xD;
      of their assigned study time point, participants will have all AAT implants removed&#xD;
      simultaneously during their elective surgery. Implants will be assessed using&#xD;
      histopathological analyses including hematoxylin and eosin staining and flow cytometry. The&#xD;
      primary outcome of safety will be determined by the incidence and rate of adverse /&#xD;
      unanticipated events. Secondary outcomes include histopathological assessment of the&#xD;
      explanted implants and tolerability determined by participant-reported comfort and&#xD;
      physician-reported ease-of-use with the intervention.&#xD;

Implants will be injected on Day 0.

    <description>The components of the adipose-derived scaffold are all naturally occurring AAT proteins and proteoglycans that provide a natural scaffold. The nature of the AAT also enhances host tissue integration since matrix components can be easily degraded by cell-secreted enzymes as tissue remodeling takes place. Mechanisms for matrix turnover are already established in host cells, avoiding any concerns over proper clearance of scaffold materials from the body.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy men and women aged 18-65 years who have sought elective surgery for the&#xD;
             removal of redundant tissue of the abdomen (abdominoplasty or panniculectomy) or arm&#xD;
             (brachioplasty).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to delay elective surgery up to 12 weeks in order to participate in the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent to photography for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to follow study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to perform follow up visits for up to 5 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Undergo complete blood count (CBC) with Differential and Serum Chemistry. (Results&#xD;
             must fall within 1.5 times the normal ranges for all values for candidates to be&#xD;
             eligible.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and Women of reproductive potential: Willingness to use approved methods of birth&#xD;
             control or abstain from sexual intercourse from screening until removal of the AAT&#xD;
             implants.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definition of non-childbearing potential for Women: amenorrhea (previous 12&#xD;
                  months) or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy,&#xD;
                  or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Definition of non-reproductive potential for Men: confirmed surgically sterile&#xD;
                  (vasectomy &gt;3 months prior to screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients seeking elective surgery for the removal of redundant tissue from areas other&#xD;
             than the abdomen or arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of AAT in patients exhibiting autoimmune connective tissue disease is not&#xD;
             recommended. When applied properly, AAT has been shown to support the migration of&#xD;
             host cells from the surrounding tissue. Therefore, this study will exclude patients&#xD;
             with conditions that could inhibit migration of host cells including, but not limited&#xD;
             to, the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fever (oral temperature &gt;99ยบ F at time of screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Insulin dependent diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low vascularity of the tissue intended for elective excision&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Local or Systemic Infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Mechanical Trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor nutrition or general medical condition&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Dehiscence and/or necrosis due to poor revascularization&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Specific or nonspecific immune response to some component of the AAT material&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Infected or nonvascular surgical sites&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Known cancer or receiving treatment for cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
