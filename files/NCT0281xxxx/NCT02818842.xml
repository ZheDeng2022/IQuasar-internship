    <textblock>
      Medication during pregnancy can lead to the occurrence of birth defects or neonatal&#xD;
      pathologies. Thalidomide or diethylstilbestrol (DistilbeneÂ°) are prominent examples. Many&#xD;
      drugs remain insufficiently evaluated in this area and doctors are too often deprived of&#xD;
      relevant information when prescribing drugs in pregnant women.&#xD;

      To fill this gap, the investigators have put in place since 2004, a database, EFEMERIS,&#xD;
      recording products given to women during pregnancy in Haute-Garonne (data from Primary Health&#xD;
      Insurance Fund), fate of these pregnancies and the state health of newborns (Mother and child&#xD;
      protection data, prenatal Diagnostic Centre and Medicalisation Program of Information Systems&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women included in this database (&gt; 90 000 to date) has allowed us to study the risks of&#xD;
      taking certain medications still not assessed in pregnant women (for example phloroglucinol,&#xD;
      the H1N1 flu vaccine , oseltamivir ...). Each year about 10 000 pregnant women join the&#xD;
      cohort. The collection and management of data concerning require careful organization and&#xD;
      mobilize multiple stakeholders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pursuit of these inclusions is needed to study medication less often prescribed but raise&#xD;
      questions. For example, if the investigators consider that the relative risk of cardiac&#xD;
      abnormalities following in utero exposure to paroxetine is multiplied by 1.5, it will take&#xD;
      1,000 women exposed to paroxetine for 5 additional cases observed. In December 2013, 0.3% of&#xD;
      women EFEMERIS were exposed to paroxetine in the first quarter (274 women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this project is to continue the EFEMERIS project (funded for 10 years public&#xD;
      tenders until December 2015) by continuing to include pregnant women (about 10 000 per year)&#xD;
      in order to explore the potential effects of exposure to different drugs on the newborn&#xD;
      (prematurity, birth defects, neonatal diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The processing of data will EFEMERIS to detect drugs at risk to the fetus and provide a&#xD;
      warning role in terms of malformation effects, to monitor over time prescribing practices,&#xD;
      participate in pharmacoepidemiology international multicenter studies including similar&#xD;
      databases in general population.&#xD;
