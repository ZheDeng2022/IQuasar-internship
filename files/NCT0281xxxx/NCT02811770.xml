  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Henoch-Schönlein (HS) purpura is a common cause of renal glomerular injury in children. This&#xD;
      condition is responsible for 10-15% of glomerulonephritis in children. The outcome is&#xD;
      generally favorable, but up to 5% of patients develop kidney failure. The outcome of patients&#xD;
      with kidney biopsy is less favorable with 7-50% of them progressing to chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of HS is difficult to determine from literature. Annual incidence is estimated at&#xD;
      6.1 / 100,000 children in the Netherlands and up to 20.4 / 100 000 children in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. The proportion of children with HS who develop renal disease is difficult to&#xD;
      determine because the numbers reported in the literature are variable and depend greatly on&#xD;
      the type of the reporting center, whether or not specialized in pediatric nephrology. Thus&#xD;
      the proportion of renal disease varies from 20% to 100% of children with a HS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of HS nephropathy (HSN) usually depends on the severity of histological lesions&#xD;
      but histological classification is discussed and there is currently no consensus. Randomized&#xD;
      studies are scarce and often do not allow to draw clear conclusions. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      suggested a positive effect of corticosteroids on renal prognosis of severe forms but in this&#xD;
      study the definition of renal disease was very heterogeneous. The only classification of the&#xD;
      HSN recognized is from the International Study Group of Kidney Disease in Childhood (ISKDC)&#xD;
      which is the following: grade I: minimal glomerula abnormalities, grade II: pure&#xD;
      proliferation, grade III: crescents/ segmental lesions &lt;50%,grade IV: crescents/ segmental&#xD;
      lesions 50 to 75%, grade V: crescents/ segmental lesions &gt; 75%, grade VI:&#xD;
      pseudomesangiocapillary. However, this classification is questioned because it ignores other&#xD;
      significant histological lesions such as interstitial fibrosis, tubular lesions, glomerular&#xD;
      and interstitial inflammation, the appearance of crescents (segmental or totally encompassing&#xD;
      the glomerulus, fibrous or cellular), segmental sclerosis, fibrosis and arteriolar appearance&#xD;
      in immunofluorescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no consensus on the criteria indicating the initiation of corticosteroid&#xD;
      therapy whether oral or intra venous bolus. Some patients with severe clinical and / or&#xD;
      histological initial presentation can evolve to remission spontaneously while others who have&#xD;
      more moderate initial symptoms will evolve later to kidney failure. The management is&#xD;
      therefore heterogeneous. In France, some centers perform a kidney biopsy almost always before&#xD;
      starting treatment (or in the days following the start of treatment), while in other&#xD;
      centers's treatment decision is based on the biology resulting from the glomerular disease,&#xD;
      kidney biopsy being performed possibly in a second time in case of failure of the initial&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal objective of the study: assessment of the interest for the long term outcome of&#xD;
      performing early a kidney biopsy (before the establishment of treatment or within 15 days&#xD;
      after the start of treatment) in children with HSN compare to kidney biopsy performed later&#xD;
      (depending on the response to initial therapy) or not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: assessment of the impact of early kidney biopsy (before the&#xD;
      establishment of treatment or within of 15 days after the start of treatment) on the initial&#xD;
      treatment HSN : does it modify or not the treatment started right before it (decided on&#xD;
      clinical and biological criteria).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      If in the past the HSN could be considered a rather benign disease not requiring specific&#xD;
      active treatment, the studies evaluating the long-term outcome have shown the risk of&#xD;
      progression to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and have lead to recommend the use of&#xD;
      corticosteroids and immunosuppressors even in not rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis&#xD;
      forms (24,25). Unfortunately clinical studies are scarce, often with few patients and&#xD;
      uncontrolled (17,26,27). However, the efficacy of methylprednisolone pulses followed by oral&#xD;
      steroids has been suggested in several studies, as in the study conducted at the Hospital&#xD;
      Necker, where prospective patients receiving pulses of methylprednisolone were compared to an&#xD;
      historical cohort from the same center (28) in a control arm of a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (29), and in studies where patients received combinations of several immunosuppressive drugs&#xD;
      (30-32).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the current French way to manage severe HSN is to give methylprednisolone pulses&#xD;
      followed by oral steroids. Anti-proteinuric medications are for initially mild forms or&#xD;
      sequelae. Immunosuppressor is added to steroid in the forms not responding well to initial&#xD;
      corticosteroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these therapies are used by most of pediatric teams, practice in kidney biopsy (KB) varies&#xD;
      from one center to another. Some teams routinely perform KB before the start of steroid&#xD;
      therapy (and adapt the treatment to the results), while others first establish the treatment&#xD;
      and perform the KB only if the evolution is not as expected. This second approach reduces the&#xD;
      number of KB since patients with favorable outcome will never be biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question is which of these two attitudes is the best. Do the biopsied patients have a&#xD;
      better prognosis at 5 years (because the lesions were better evaluated in comparison to&#xD;
      clinical evaluation, because the diagnosis was confirmed, despite the risk taken to perform&#xD;
      KB, because there is no excess of treatment) than those who were not biopsied at the initial&#xD;
      period (with possible errors in assessing the severity of injury ), or is there is no&#xD;
      difference (because the treatment is the same whether KB was performed or not, because&#xD;
      clinical criteria prevail in the therapeutic decision on histological criteria, because KB&#xD;
      may falsely reassure and may lead to stop treatment too early (sample problem)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to answer these questions, to improve patients care by identifying&#xD;
      the most effective strategy to improve long term prognosis, and to standardize practices to&#xD;
      make randomized control trials easier to drive in the future.&#xD;
