  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mental repetition of movements - or motor imagery (MI) practice - facilitates motor&#xD;
      learning. It allows avoiding fatigue that occurs during physical practice; this method is&#xD;
      thus particularly interesting for elderly people. Transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) is a noninvasive method of neurostimulation during which a low direct current is&#xD;
      applied to the brain via electrodes placed on the scalp. This method has been successfully&#xD;
      used to enhance motor learning in both young and elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to assess the impact of MI practice combined with tDCS on the&#xD;
      learning of a complex finger sequence, in young and elderly subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that purpose, young and elderly healthy subjects will be randomly assigned to Stimulation&#xD;
      and Sham groups. There will thus be a total of four groups: Young Stim, Young Sham, Elderly&#xD;
      Stim, and Elderly Sham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will participate to three training sessions spread over five days, and a&#xD;
      retention test one week after the third training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During training they will mentally repeat a complex finger sequence with the left hand, for&#xD;
      13 min:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects of the Stimulation groups (Young Stim and Elderly Stim) will receive in&#xD;
           parallel an anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects of the Sham groups (Young Sham and Elderly Sham) will receive in parallel a&#xD;
           sham tDCS of the primary motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before (pretest) and after (posttest) each training session, as well as during&#xD;
      the retention test, subjects will repeat the sequence as many times of possible, for 1 min.&#xD;
      During these tests (pretests, posttests and retention test) electroencephalographic activity&#xD;
      will be recorded to assess the Mu rhythm power.&#xD;
