    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency and the safe use of a new medical&#xD;
      device to improve the oral accessibility of disabled people during the oral-dental&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The oral examination of people with behavioural handicap seems to be difficult. Those&#xD;
      patients react with defensive reflexes which limit spontaneously the amplitude of their oral&#xD;
      cavity or prevent them to keep open their mouth for a sufficient time to process the&#xD;
      examination. This difficulty can be caused by various reasons: cerebral motor disability,&#xD;
      behavioral troubles or mental disability, and it affects people of all ages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current methods keeping open the mouth like wedges are often unsuitable for those&#xD;
      patients. Moreover, no other device exists or is described even in literature. An innovative&#xD;
      medical device has to be developed, in order to offer to disabled patients and the users or&#xD;
      dentists a comfort during the oral-dental examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral accessibility spatula, made out polypropylene plastic, is designed into two parts :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a handle to hold the spatula by the user&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a thin plastic surface introduced into the mouth, which is dull with a round edge and&#xD;
           has holes on the sides to lock the spatula between the upper and lower teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the buccal access during a first oral-dental examination without and then with&#xD;
      the oral accessibility spatula (SAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safe use of the SAB To evaluate the tolerance of the exam without, and then&#xD;
      with the SAB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visibility and dental examination of incisor-canine sectors, premolars and molars using a&#xD;
      probe, assessed by an oral accessibility score determined based on intra oral accessible&#xD;
      areas with and without oral accessibility Spatula device&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the spatula will be assessed by analyzing the reported adverse effects and&#xD;
      their relative frequency The dental exam tolerance evaluation; with and without Oral&#xD;
      Accessibility .Spatula&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center interventional prospective study, open-label Only one medical check per patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any patient with a behavioral handicap, and who consults with dentist for a preventive&#xD;
      check-up or a oral-dental curative act, is examined by an inclusion operator who checks the&#xD;
      inclusion or non-inclusion criteria, and especially the behavior with Venham Scale (only&#xD;
      patients with a score of 2 and higher, meaning opposing, after an approach toward the oral&#xD;
      cavity are included).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral accessibility score of each eligible patient is performed twice, without the SAB&#xD;
      first, and then with the SAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidents and/or potential injuries are reported from a standardized grid. Venham scale&#xD;
      score is measured a second time during the oral-dental examination without or with the&#xD;
      spatula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients number :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Without the SAB, the rate of patients with an oral accessibility score of at least level 8 is&#xD;
      20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol forecasts hypothetically a 20% highering of this rate after the use of SAB (so&#xD;
      40% of patients with a score of 8 and higher). With a total staff of 140 patients, this&#xD;
      hypothesis is validated with an α risk set at 5% and a statistical power at 90%. 200 patients&#xD;
      are expected in order to take into account a potential center effect and a potential&#xD;
      investigator effect, and a study output rate of 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Time :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one medical check per patient, so the total duration goes with the inclusion period of&#xD;
      18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected study start : first semester of 2016 End of inclusion : second semester of 2017 End&#xD;
      of study : second semester of 2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major analysis will be the comparison of the oral accessibility scores during the&#xD;
      examination with or without the SAB. Each patient will be his own control, and the&#xD;
      examinations always will be performed without the SAB in first, and secondly with the SAB, by&#xD;
      the same dental surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Benefits :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected result is the proof of a best examination quality with no risk for the patient.&#xD;
      The major prospect is the availability of the SAB to dental surgeons to improve the&#xD;
      therapeutic indications and the quality of examinations, then to parents, carers and&#xD;
      caregivers, in order to make possible and easier the application of a oral-dental health&#xD;
      suitable for handicapped or disabled people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the expected benefits are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  early diagnostic of the oral-dental diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improved efficiency of the tooth care&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduction of the use of general anesthesia for oral examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  help for tooth washing in order to improve significantly the oral-dental healthy level&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improved prevention by the availability of the spatula to parents, carers and&#xD;
           physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance Plan :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded in a Paper Case Report from medical records. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      only one medical examination for the study. No follow-up is expected.&#xD;
