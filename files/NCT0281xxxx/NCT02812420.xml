      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of durvalumab and tremelimumab in treating&#xD;
      patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk urothelial cancer that cannot be treated with&#xD;
      cisplatin-based therapy before surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      durvalumab and tremelimumab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and tremelimumab in patients with&#xD;
      muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible for neoadjuvant&#xD;
      cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess immunologic/molecular responses (e.g. peripheral blood cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation [CD] 4+inducible T-cell co-stimulator [ICOS]+ T cells) to durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer who are ineligible&#xD;
      for neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pathologic T0 rate after neoadjuvant treatment with durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab in patients with muscle-invasive, high-risk bladder cancer comparing to&#xD;
      historical data (about 10% in patients with high-risk disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      day 1 of weeks 1 and 4. Beginning 4-6 weeks after the last infusion, patients undergo&#xD;
      cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for up 1 year.&#xD;
