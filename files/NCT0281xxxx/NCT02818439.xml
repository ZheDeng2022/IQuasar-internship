  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARPEGE project fits within the general framework of maintaining functional autonomy in the&#xD;
      frail elderly. The early identification of elderly people at risk of frailty is essential to&#xD;
      be able to make corrective actions to maintain a quality of life desired by the person.&#xD;
      ARPEGE offers tracking and monitoring based on a corpus mobile evaluation of frailty, that&#xD;
      could be used in various environments (home, prevention center, office of the general&#xD;
      practitioner, geriatric consultation), and manipulated intuitively by professionals not&#xD;
      specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This four-year project spearheaded by the University of technology of Troyes in partnership&#xD;
      with the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne also brings a set of partners and experts in&#xD;
      the region and outside, so that the proposed solution has the qualities necessary for its&#xD;
      deployment in terms of value diagnostic, use, acceptability and perfectly controlled ethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Region has made &quot;longevity aging&quot; theme one of its priorities. This image of driver of&#xD;
      innovation in this area can only be enhanced by a program like ARPEGE. Beyond the scientific&#xD;
      and technological results expected, one can imagine the potential socio-economic benefits if&#xD;
      this tracking solution is deployed on a large scale.&#xD;
