  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of durvalumab and&#xD;
      tremelimumab can help to control sarcoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not FDA approved or&#xD;
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study&#xD;
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive tremelimumab and&#xD;
      durvalumab by vein, over about 1 hour each, every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks (4 doses). After&#xD;
      Week 16, you may continue to receive durvalumab alone by vein over about 1 hour for an&#xD;
      additional 32 weeks (8 doses).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you have a side effect related to the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab during&#xD;
      the first 16 weeks of the study, you may be able to switch over to receive durvalumab alone&#xD;
      sooner than expected. This will be discussed with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 0:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have 3 EKGs in a row.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If you can&#xD;
           become pregnant, part of this routine blood and urine sample will be used for a&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing. Biomarkers&#xD;
           are found in the blood and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. The type&#xD;
           of genetic testing in this study will be performed to learn how your DNA (genetic&#xD;
           material) may change how you respond to the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Weeks 2 and 6, blood (about 3½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic,&#xD;
      and biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Week 4 and then every 4 weeks after that (Weeks 8, 12, 16, and so on) until Week&#xD;
      44:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have imaging scans. You will not have these scans at Weeks 16 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Weeks 10 and 14, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive up to 4 doses of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and up to an&#xD;
      additional 8 doses of durvalumab alone. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s)&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow&#xD;
      study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you complete 12 months of therapy but the disease appears to get worse, you may be able to&#xD;
      re-start treatment. The study doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that your participation in this study may last up to 15 months. Your&#xD;
      participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Treatment Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You may be called to learn how you are doing and if you have started any anti-cancer&#xD;
           treatments. If you are called, it should take about 5-10 minutes.&#xD;

             for the subtype (i.e. Progressing well-differentiated liposarcoma, clear cell sarcoma&#xD;
             etc do not require prior therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must have at least 1 lesion that is measurable by irRECIST a. A previously&#xD;
             irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well defined,&#xD;

             tumor biopsies must have additional non-target lesions that can be biopsied at&#xD;
             acceptable risk as judged by the investigator or if no other lesion suitable for&#xD;

             except for pts with Osteosarcoma who will be allowed to participate with an estimated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &gt; 40 mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation. c. Hepatic: i. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 × ULN; for subjects with&#xD;

             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study&#xD;
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from MEDI4736 or&#xD;
