  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, the safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination with one of three different&#xD;
      chemotherapies will be assessed in the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or&#xD;
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has not been previously treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy will be assessed&#xD;
      compared to the safety and efficacy of placebo plus chemotherapy in the treatment of locally&#xD;
      recurrent inoperable or metastatic TNBC, which has not been previously treated with&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypotheses are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Progression-Free Survival&#xD;
           (PFS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  all participants,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  participants with programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score&#xD;
                (CPS) ≥1 tumors, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
           compared to placebo and chemotherapy in:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  all participants,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 tumors, and&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 tumors.&#xD;
