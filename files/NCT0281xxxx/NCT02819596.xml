      This study is being carried out to see if the drugs MEDI4736, Savolitinib and Tremelimumab&#xD;
      can be used alone or in combination to reduce the size of tumours in patients with kidney&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs being tested in this study have an anti-tumour effect and have been tested in&#xD;
      pre-clinical and human studies before. MEDI4736 and tremelimumab work with the immune system&#xD;
      to help the body fight against tumour cells with immune cells. Savolitinib works to correct a&#xD;
      faulty signal which causes tumour growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is eligible for the study and decides to take part, they will be enrolled into&#xD;
      one of 3 stages of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First stage [CLOSED TO RECRUITMENT]: aims to find the optimal dose of&#xD;
           MEDI4736+savolitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second stage [RECRUITING]: patients with papillary cell cancer will be treated with&#xD;
           MEDI4736+savolitinib. Patients with clear cell cancer will be randomised to one of four&#xD;
           treatment arms and receive MEDI4736, savolitinib, MEDI4736+savolitinib, or&#xD;
           MEDI4736+tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third stage [NOT YET OPEN TO RECRUITMENT]: patients will be tested for biomarkers before&#xD;
           enrolment, and depending on the results will be allocated to one of 3 treatments&#xD;
           (MEDI4736, savolitinib, or MEDI4736+tremelimumab) to see if certain biomarkers are&#xD;
           linked to drug efficacy.&#xD;
