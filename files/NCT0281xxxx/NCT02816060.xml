  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: There is evidence linking conditioned pain modulation (CPM) deficiency with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, migraine, tension-type headaches and&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome, as well as with temporomandibular disorders, idiopathic facial pain&#xD;
      and chronic fatigue syndrome. Evidence shows that in pre-surgical situations of chronic pain&#xD;
      there is no activation of CPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to measure the CPM response and determine whether&#xD;
      neural tensioner exercise in patients with chronic neck pain is effective in the improvement&#xD;
      of neck pain intensity, neck disability and cervical range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blind, randomized placebo clinical trial. Methods: Patients with neck pain&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated into two groups: the neural tensionner exercise group (NTE) or the&#xD;
      sham technique (ST) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be included in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria: aged&#xD;
      18-65 years, neck pain perceived in the posterior region of the cervical spine, from the&#xD;
      superior nuchal line to the first thoracic spinous process with more than 12 weeks of&#xD;
      evolution and without radicular symptoms radiated to the head. Neck pain intensity with a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), CPM, and cervical rang of motion&#xD;
      will be measured pre and port intervention.&#xD;

    <description>This group will receive a specific tensionner nerve exercise to provide mechanical stress across the median nerve. This technique have two positions, start and end. It consists on going from one to the other position constantly, controlling the speed of the technique to be constant. In the start position, the subject will be supine lying on a couch with the following parameters: contralateral cervical side bending, shoulder depression, shoulder abduction and external rotation to 90°, elbow flexion to 90º, and forearm supination. In the final position, the therapist will perform full elbow extension while maintaining all the joints previously situated as described above until the patients feel tension, then return to the start position.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive a sham technique (ST) with minimal mechanical stress across the median nerve. Patients will be placed in neutral cervical spine position with no shoulder depression, shoulder abduction and external rotation to 45°, 45° of elbow extension, and forearm pronation.. This technique will be passively repeated from elbow flexion to extension in the same way than the NTE group</description>
