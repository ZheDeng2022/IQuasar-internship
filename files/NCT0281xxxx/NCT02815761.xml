  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease worldwide with a high burden&#xD;
      on healthcare resources. The prevalence of COPD varied from 11.4 to 26.1% according to a&#xD;
      recent multi-city population study using spirometry. In Hong Kong (HK), the prevalence rates&#xD;
      of COPD in the elderly population aged ≥60 years were 25.9% and 12.4% based on the&#xD;
      spirometric definition of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC)&#xD;
      ratio &lt;70% and the lower limit of normal of the FEV1/FVC respectively. In 2005, the crude&#xD;
      mortality rate of COPD was 29.1/100 000, while the crude hospitalization rate was 193/100,000&#xD;
      in HK. In HK, COPD ranked second as a respiratory cause for hospitalization. In those 75&#xD;
      years or older, the hospitalization rate for COPD was as high as 2,225/100,000. The economic&#xD;
      burden of COPD on the society is enormous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies gave information on the overall morbidity, mortality and the prevalence of&#xD;
      COPD in HK. One study compared the management of COPD patients in HK with other countries and&#xD;
      found that COPD patients in HK were under-treated. No large scale study has looked into the&#xD;
      details of COPD patients in HK, like their co-morbidities and how they are being treated and&#xD;
      how these factors affect the readmission of these patients. Large prospective studies which&#xD;
      incorporate all the potentially relevant variables are required to refine prediction of the&#xD;
      important outcomes of AECOPD and thus to inform clinical decision making, for example on&#xD;
      escalation of care, facilitated discharge and provision of palliative care.&#xD;

      Aim of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the factors that are related to readmission and mortality&#xD;
      of COPD patients in Hong Kong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study of patients. Patients who are admitted to the&#xD;
      participating hospital with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) will be recruited. AECOPD&#xD;
      was defined as occurring when a patient with background COPD11, with FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;70%,&#xD;
      presented with at least two major symptoms (increased dyspnea, increased sputum purulence, or&#xD;
      increased sputum volume), or one major and one minor symptom (nasal discharge/congestion,&#xD;
      wheeze, sore throat, or cough) for at least 2 consecutive days. Written informed consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with a diagnosis of COPD according to the Global Initiative for chronic&#xD;
           Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) Guideline16 with previous spirometry showing FEV1/FVC&#xD;
           ratio of &lt;0.70 with an AECOPD will be recruited for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age ≥40 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects who have been diagnosed with asthma, bronchiectasis or other chronic lung&#xD;
           disease apart from COPD will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with history of lung resection&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Those who are unable to give consent Baseline assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline assessments will be performed at 6-8 weeks after the AECOPD when the patients&#xD;
           are at their stable state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Demographic data including age, sex, body weight, height, smoking history, social&#xD;
           history and medication usage, co-morbidities and any home oxygen or non-invasive&#xD;
           positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) usage will be collected. Number of hospitalizations&#xD;
           and accident and emergency department attendance in the past 12 month will be recorded.&#xD;
           Any history of intubation or acute NPPV usage will be noted also.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. American Thoracic Society (ATS) respiratory questionnaire17 will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Spirometry will be performed using the MICROLAB 3300 spirometer (Micro Medical, Kent,&#xD;
           UK) in a sitting position, according to the ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS)&#xD;
           standards.18 Both pre- and post-bronchodilator (20 min after inhaling 400 mg of&#xD;
           salbultamol [Ventolin; GlaxoSmithKline, E´ vreux, France] through a 500 mL spacer) tests&#xD;
           will be performed. The updated predicted spirometric values for the Hong Kong Chinese&#xD;
           were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Six min walk test will be performed according to the ATS guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale (MMRC)21 will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)22 and medical outcomes short form 36&#xD;
           questionnaire (SF-36) 23 will be administered to all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Depression score&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Blood saved for inflammatory markers analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reassessed every 12 months for repeat spirometry, 6 minute walk test, MMRC,&#xD;
      SGRQ and SF-36 score for a total of 3 years. All hospitalizations, scheduled and unscheduled&#xD;
      clinic visits in the subsequent 36 months after the baseline assessment will be recorded by&#xD;
      asking the patient and with verification of their computer medical records. Any mortality&#xD;
      (and the cause) will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study with primary aim to assess factors related to&#xD;
      readmission and mortality of COPD patients in Hong Kong. We believe a sample size of 800&#xD;
      would be able to give us some meaningful data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed by the Statistical Package of the Social Science (SPSS) Statistical&#xD;
      software for Window, Version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics will be used&#xD;
      and data will be presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR) as appropriate. Chi-square test,&#xD;
      t-test, Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare the clinical parameters of COPD patients&#xD;
      with the different disease severities as appropriate. A p value of &lt; 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      to be significant.&#xD;
