    <textblock>
      There is no specific treatment for core symptoms of PWS. Regarding behavioral and psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms (hyperphagia, imulsivity and self-mutilations), one of the only drug options&#xD;
      consists in antipsychotics, that are not efficient and might be responsible for a worsening&#xD;
      of the weight gain (major issue in PWS). An alternative therapeutic approach for behavioral&#xD;
      disturbances has been suggested by some authors with topiramate (Epitomax®), an antiepileptic&#xD;
      drug that can be used as a mood stabilizer and anti-impulsive. In addition, topiramate is&#xD;
      used as a treatment for eating disorders because it induces loss of weight and appetite. This&#xD;
      last effect might be useful in the case of SPW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Except for some clinical case reports, the investigators only found one open study for&#xD;
      topiramate in SPW 8 patientssuggesting promising effects. There si however no placebo&#xD;
      controlled study..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of topiramate (200 mg / d) on Eating disorders (E), self Mutilations&#xD;
      (M), irritability and Impulsivity (I), metabolic status, and tolerance among of PWS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter (out-patients in Toulouse, Reims, Nantes and Paris and in-patients in&#xD;
      Hendaye) 8 weeks double-blind placebo controlled study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (n = 125 for 112 analyzable) all having PWS, aged 12 years-old and more should have&#xD;
      any of the following symptoms: E, M and U (see above). All subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated into two groups one taking a placebo, the other taking topiramate (50mg / day&#xD;
      initially, increasing up to 50mg per week 200mg / day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population of analyzable patients in and out patient will be of equal size (n = 56). The&#xD;
      inclusion period is two years..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are excluded subjects with antipsychotic or mood stabilizer medication or topiramate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the rate of responders, with response defined by obtaining a&#xD;
      score of 1 or 2 on the CGI improvement after 8 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other assessments, secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic: Weight / Size / Self-injury behavior (french Echelle des Conduites Auto et&#xD;
           Hétéro Aggressives, ECAHA))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Psychometric: C-SHARP and A-SHARP / Conners (Impulsivity) / Dickens (Eating behavior for&#xD;
           PWS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Organic: NFS, serum electrolytes, creatinine, ammonia plasma, serum bicarbonate, AST /&#xD;
           ALT / GGT, ghrelin, fasting glucose, lipid profile and insulin, leptin, TG and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects of topiramate: SAPS / SANS and BPRS (hallucinations), anxiety scales and&#xD;
           laboratory tests.&#xD;

      Scientific background and justification of the study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a rare disease are often challenging to treat when considering psychotropic&#xD;
      treatment for behavioral or psychiatric manifestations. There is an important lack of clear&#xD;
      data or treatment guidelines for treating behavioral disturbance in patients with&#xD;
      intellectual disabilities. Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is a paradigmatic example of such a&#xD;
      disease. It is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 1:25,000 at birth. PWS is a&#xD;
      genetic disease located on chromosome 15 (15 q11-q13). Imprinting silence the normal genes on&#xD;
      15 q11-Q13, rendering them non-functional, with the paternal non-imprinted genes being&#xD;
      deleted. The imprinting effect in this region explains why approximately 60 to 70% of&#xD;
      patients with PWS have a paternal deletion of 15q11-q13 (2). An additional 25 to 35 % of&#xD;
      patients have two copies of maternal chromosome 15 (uniparental disomy). Rarely, PWS may be&#xD;
      associated with translocation, mutation, or other anomalies. Angelman Syndrome, which has&#xD;
      primarily been associated with autism spectrum disorders, involves the same genetic region&#xD;
      and is commonly associated to mutations of the maternal allele of the UB3a gene or rare&#xD;
      deletions. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      PWS patients present in a neonatal hypotonic state with deficit of sucking and eating refusal&#xD;
      which progresses to with hyperphagia and obsession with food in infancy or adolescence. In&#xD;
      addition, patients have distinct facial features, such as a narrow forehead, almond-shaped&#xD;
      eyes, and a triangular mouth, as well as a short stature, related to growth hormone&#xD;
      deficiency and small hands and feet. Puberty is often delayed or incomplete, and most&#xD;
      affected individuals are unable to have children. This eating disorder is more similar to an&#xD;
      addictive disorder to food than a traditional eating disorder. PWS leads to severe obesity,&#xD;
      which is a major issue associated with quality of life and medical prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms in patients with PWS are severe and have an important&#xD;
      impact on social and interpersonal life. Patients with PWS often have mild to moderate&#xD;
      intellectual disability (ID), with learning impairments and poor academic achievement. They&#xD;
      have particular difficulties in mathematics, calculation, and abstraction, which may be&#xD;
      related to under-diagnosed neuro-visual impairments. There is a large individual&#xD;
      heterogeneity of language impairments, primarily in morphosyntaxic abilities. Behavioral&#xD;
      impairments predominately include temper outbursts, impulsivity, emotional liability and&#xD;
      aggressive behavior , as well as self-injury behavior, such as compulsively picking the skin&#xD;
      and mucosa (rectal picking), which may lead to a severe wound and severe infections. Patients&#xD;
      with disomy as a group have more severe overall symptoms than patients with a deletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the relationship between PWS and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), 5 studies&#xD;
      have utilized standardized psychometric tools to assess psychiatric diagnoses. SSDs are&#xD;
      primarily, but not exclusively, associated with disomy, and the clinical diagnosis may be&#xD;
      complicated. Considering that disomy represents only 20%, at most, of patients, SSDs affect&#xD;
      less than 20% of patients with PWS, most likely approximately 17% or 15%. There are few&#xD;
      studies in the field of behavioral treatment in PWS they suggests that risperidone for&#xD;
      psychotic symptoms associated with disomy, and N-acetylcysteine for skin picking might be&#xD;
      efficient. Moreover and despite many study limitations, the investigators identified&#xD;
      promising treatment effects with topiramate for self-injury and impulsive/aggressive&#xD;
      behaviors. To date there is only one study (open trial) for topiramate in PWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to assess efficacy and tolerance of topiramate in behavioral disturbance in&#xD;
      patients with PWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the efficacy and tolerance of topiramate at 200 mg / day on hyperphagia (H),&#xD;
      seflf-injury (SI) and Irritability-Impuslivity Behavior in patients with Prader Willi&#xD;
      Syndrome during an 8 weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective Assess the tolerance and side effect ot topiramate 200mg/day in this&#xD;
      specific population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will run a multicentric double blind placebo controlled randomized trial&#xD;
      with outpatients in Paris and Toulouse and inpatients in Hendaye. Inclusion period is 3 years&#xD;
      in order to obtain a total number of participants of 125 randomly assigned in two groups&#xD;
      (drug vs placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Ethic Committee did approve this research. Patients and/or their parents / caregiver&#xD;
      give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measure will be Clinical Global Impression thereshold will be to obtain at least&#xD;
      1 at CGI Improvement scoring at endpoint after 8 weeks follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome (psychometric scales and biological measures):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weight, Self-Injury Behavior, C-SHARP and A-SHARP (suicide ideation scale, according to&#xD;
           age), CONNERS Impulsivity, Dickens (Hyperphagia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sides effects assessment; PANNS (for hallucinations), Eysenck Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  And biological assessment including lipid, hepatic enzyme, insulin, serum bicarbonate,&#xD;
           leptin, amoniemia, ghreline and HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments and assessments. Psychometric scales: Impulsivity and aggressive behavior will be&#xD;
      evalauated with irritability sub-score of Aberrant Behaviour Checklist The Children's Scale&#xD;
      of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (C-SHARP) for adolescents until 16 years-old&#xD;
      and The Adult Scale of Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive (A-SHARP) for adults. The&#xD;
      Dickens questionnaire, especially oriented for PWS patients, will be used for eating&#xD;
      behavior. Self injury behavior will be assessed with Scale of Self-Aggressive Behavior (ECAA&#xD;
      Yale-Paris), especially in the sub -scale regarding severity, duration and frequency of such&#xD;
      behavior. The Clinical Global Impression, will be used at base line, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks&#xD;
      (endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale for the Assesment of Positive Symptoms, SAPS, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, BPRS,&#xD;
      Hamilton Anxiety Sclale, HAS et Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment&#xD;
      (C-CASA).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Selection will be made on inclusion/exclusion criteria including blood sample. Inclusion and&#xD;
      randomization is at baseline and all assessments will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits are scheduled at week 2, 4, 6 and 8 (endpoint and end of patient participation). All&#xD;
      scales are used for all visit and biological sample are made at selection, inclusion, week 4&#xD;
      and week 8.&#xD;
