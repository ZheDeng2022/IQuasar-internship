      Neurofunctional Predictors of Escitalopram Treatment Response in Adolescents with Anxiety. To&#xD;
      determine the effects of escitalopram on functional activation patterns during a Continuous&#xD;
      Performance Task with Emotional and Neutral Distracters, the CPT-END. To examine baseline&#xD;
      functional activity and functional connectivity profiles in the ventrolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex as markers of subsequent treatment response to escitalopram in adolescents with&#xD;
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). To use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to&#xD;
      examine glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related abnormalities in the anterior&#xD;
      cingulate in adolescents with GAD as compared to healthy adolescents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this study is to explore the neurobiological basis of generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (GAD) using a validated functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm and functional&#xD;
      connectivity analyses with a cohort of GAD patients and healthy subjects and generating&#xD;
      feasibility and preliminary data regarding treatment-related effects of escitalopram on brain&#xD;
      functional activation and Fc patterns in pediatric GAD. An additional goal is to identify&#xD;
      biological markers in saliva and urine that will predict treatment response in pediatric&#xD;
      subjects with GAD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that core dysfunction within&#xD;
      the prefrontal-amygdala network, which the investigators and others have observed in GAD,&#xD;
      will be normalized by successful treatment. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that,&#xD;
      despite the high prevalence of GAD, there is a need to understand its neurobiology and to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers of treatment response and the mechanisms by which selective serotonin&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) putatively effect changes in the neurocircuitry of pediatric GAD.&#xD;
