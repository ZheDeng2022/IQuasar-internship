  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost two-thirds of survivors have cognitive impairment (CI), manifested as memory,&#xD;
      language, and judgement problems. Post-stroke CI at 2 weeks is a significant predictor of&#xD;
      long-term functional outcome, and more generally, cognitive impairments have a major impact&#xD;
      on functional outcome and ability to participate in rehabilitation. CI is associated with&#xD;
      increased systemic inflammation. Intranasally-administered insulin is a promising new therapy&#xD;
      for enhancing memory in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      (AD), shown in multiple randomized controlled studies. Likely mechanisms of benefit are&#xD;
      intranasal insulin's ability to restore normal cerebral insulin signaling. Based on the&#xD;
      overlap in cerebral insulin resistance that occurs in both AD and post-stroke CI, we have&#xD;
      designed an innovative proof-of-concept, feasibility trial designed to provide pilot data as&#xD;
      to whether post-stroke survivor CI and caregiver burden is improved with intranasal insulin&#xD;
      early after stroke. We will explore the impact of intranasal insulin on inflammatory&#xD;
      biomarkers, since inflammation is a major underlying cause of CI, as shown by others and in&#xD;
      our preliminary studies of VCAM-1. Specific Aims are: 1. Determine if patients with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke randomized to intranasal insulin 20 IU BID for 3 weeks have improved cognition,&#xD;
      compared to patients who receive intranasal saline. Primary outcome is a composite of (a)&#xD;
      memory and executive function z scores. 2. To assess the impact of intranasal insulin vs&#xD;
      saline on change in inflammatory biomarker levels (VCAM-1, TNF-alpha, TNFR-I and II) before&#xD;
      and after the treatment period. 3. To measure differences in burden among caregivers of&#xD;
      participants in the intranasal insulin vs intranasal saline groups. We will prospectively&#xD;
      randomize 40 subjects to intranasal insulin (40 IU) vs saline treatment. Following baseline&#xD;
      cognitive testing 2 weeks post stroke, subjects will receive the assigned treatment for 3&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a 3-week washout period, with cognitive testing performed after the&#xD;
      treatment and washout periods and again at 20 weeks. The proposed study will provide data on&#xD;
      a promising method for treating cognitive function in stroke patients. If effective, our&#xD;
      pilot data will set the stage for larger phase III clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Intranasal insulin will improve post-stroke cognitive impairment if administered&#xD;
      in the early post-acute stroke phase compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Block randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 40 patients, 20 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Ischemic stroke patients presenting within 48 hours of symptom onset and&#xD;
      without moderate to severe aphasia or homonymous hemianopia who have evidence of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Patients identified during the acute hospitalization for ischemic stroke,&#xD;
      inpatient rehabilitation, or in the post-stroke follow-up clinic. Patients from other&#xD;
      hospitals and clinics are also eligible. Eligibility will be assessed through screening MoCA&#xD;
      and if in the target range, will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent: Patients will sign informed consent if eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding: The participant will be randomized and undergo the full baseline&#xD;
      cognitive battery. Caregivers will also sign a separate consent to complete the Caregiver&#xD;
      Strain Index. Subjects will be randomized to intranasal insulin (20 IU BID) vs saline BID&#xD;
      according to a stratified permuted block randomization of 4 as per our statistician,&#xD;
      stratified by age 40 to 69 years vs &gt; 70 years) and presence of language deficit (based on&#xD;
      NIHSS) at the time of randomization. Insulin and saline will be packaged in identical&#xD;
      single-dose ampules that will be opened and inserted into the chamber of the VianaseTM&#xD;
      device. Ampoules will be dispensed in 3 week supplies at each study visit. Package labels&#xD;
      will instruct participants to administer each dose 30-60 minutes after breakfast and dinner.&#xD;
      If a dose is missed, it will not be replaced. The insulin and saline will be identical in&#xD;
      packaging except for randomization code. Patients/caregivers, investigators, and outcome&#xD;
      assessors will be masked to the group assignment. All subjects will receive their first dose&#xD;
      in the clinic and wait for 2 hours to determine any adverse effects of the inhaled dose,&#xD;
      while remaining blinded to the treatment. The glucose level will be measured with the&#xD;
      glucometer to monitor for hypoglycemia and documented. All subjects will additionally check&#xD;
      peak dose blood sugar levels with a glucometer, 3 times per week during insulin or saline&#xD;
      treatment. The patients and caregivers will receive a handbook which describes the method for&#xD;
      loading the device, inhalation, methods for fingersticks, use of the glucometer and test&#xD;
      strips, a blood sugar log, and the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. They will also&#xD;
      document any other adverse effects on the weekly log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Cognitive impairment measured early after stroke predicts functional outcomes in&#xD;
      stroke patients at 13 months. Furthermore, waiting until 6 weeks after the stroke to conduct&#xD;
      baseline cognitive testing and treatment allows enough recovery and completion of intensive&#xD;
      rehabilitation for those patients who may not be able to complete cognitive testing&#xD;
      immediately after stroke, but takes advantage of the potential benefits of insulin in the&#xD;
      early phase, shown in animal studies. In addition, we potentially reduce the variability of&#xD;
      the biomarkers by avoiding the acute phase of stroke. The frequency of cognitive testing is&#xD;
      based on trials of intranasal insulin for MCI and AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a history of psychiatric medication use for the management of mental and&#xD;
      emotional disorders prior to their stroke will not be excluded from the study. However, as&#xD;
      these medications may have an effect on cognitive testing, initiation of psychiatric&#xD;
      medications should be avoided from the time of study enrollment through the post wash out&#xD;
      period (9 weeks total) unless it is clearly indicated to be in the patient's best interest.&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of the prohibited medications during consent and will be asked to&#xD;
      immediately inform the study team of any new medications or changes in existing medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Data collection. We will collect the baseline data described below as in the VCI&#xD;
      Harmonization standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: Birth date, sex, race/ethnicity, years in current country of residence, number&#xD;
      of years of education, occupation, literacy, living situation and level of independence, type&#xD;
      of residence, marital status, and name and contact information for a family member or&#xD;
      caregiver will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proxy/informant information collected: Birth date, sex, race/ethnicity, relationship and&#xD;
      length of time of relationship with the patient, education, and living status with respect to&#xD;
      the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family history information collected: First-degree relatives with stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, and dementia, approximate age at onset, and age at death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke hospital data collected: Severity (NIHSS) at onset, location of stroke, vascular&#xD;
      territory, modified Rankin score at discharge, short physical performance battery score,&#xD;
      length of stay, stroke complications, stroke prevention medications at discharge, stroke risk&#xD;
      factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, alcohol/substance abuse, atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, carotid stenosis, hypercoagulable state), and stroke subtype (NINDS&#xD;
      classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intranasal insulin administration: We will use an innovative investigational device developed&#xD;
      by Kurve Technology (Fig 5A). Typical spray bottle administration results in large droplets&#xD;
      that penetrate only within the first 20% of the lower nasal cavity, and due to gravity and&#xD;
      insufficient airflow, ~90% of the droplets wind up in the stomach (Fig.5B). The ViaNaseTM&#xD;
      device delivers a substance throughout the nasal cavity, to the olfactory region and&#xD;
      paranasal sinuses, thereby maximizing access to nose-to-brain channels (Fig.5C). This&#xD;
      distribution occurs because droplet size is adjusted according to the weight of the&#xD;
      substance, through an individually optimized droplet generator resulting in maximal vortical&#xD;
      distribution (Fig.5D). We have used the ViaNaseTM device with excellent results in two pilot&#xD;
      trials (described above).12,13 A total volume of 2 mL of insulin or placebo (saline) will be&#xD;
      administered each time. Caregivers will supervise participants in administering intranasal&#xD;
      treatment 2 times per day, after breakfast and dinner. Participants and caregivers will be&#xD;
      trained in use of the delivery device. In previous studies, participants with aMCI/AD have&#xD;
      found the device to be easy and pleasant to use, with compliance rates of 95 to 97%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Outcome Analysis: The analysis will be based on intention to treat. The primary&#xD;
      outcomes are analyzed via composite z scores at 3 weeks of treatment in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The summary scores of the SIS, IADL scale and SIS-16 will be compared from baseline to 3&#xD;
      weeks post treatment in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional covariates: Disability and physical function measures will be collected to&#xD;
      understand the trajectory of motor recovery and will be mapped to the cognitive trajectory&#xD;
      from baseline (2 weeks to 20 weeks post-stroke). Exploratory analyses will be performed to&#xD;
      determine whether INI leads to an improvement in IADLs, SIS-16, and mRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The 3 week intervention effect of INI on the cognitive outcomes will be&#xD;
      assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for age, language deficit, and&#xD;
      baseline cognitive score. We will assume a Type I error rate alpha = 0.05 for all analyses.&#xD;
      Adjusting for baseline characteristics will help attenuate the potential effect of&#xD;
      differential dropout, but we will conduct a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation to&#xD;
      ensure dropout does not unduly affect our results. The observed estimates, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and dropout rates will be used for the design of future studies of INI treatment&#xD;
      for stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will examine response by subgroup for evidence of an enhanced treatment&#xD;
      effect, including subgroups defined by participant age (&lt;70 vs. &gt;70 years), baseline&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and the presence or absence of any degree of language deficit (aphasia).&#xD;
      Covariates will be utilized so that they do not overlap with clinical subgroups. Because of&#xD;
      the relatively small sample size, if the prespecified subgroups based on continuous&#xD;
      characteristics are not sufficiently large, new clinically meaningful subgroups may be formed&#xD;
      for exploratory analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Analysis: The primary purpose of the pilot study is to demonstrate feasibility and&#xD;
      safety. The proposed study will collect data to estimate power in future trials, identify&#xD;
      instruments most sensitive to the proposed cognitive effects, and anticipate recruitment and&#xD;
      retention rates in the target population. However, the proposed study will have 83% power to&#xD;
      detect a 1 standard deviation difference in cognitive scores between groups at 3 weeks (i.e.&#xD;
      effect size = 1.0), assuming normally distributed outcomes, alpha = 0.05, and a 10% dropout&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

        <description>The mRS Score is a score for disability after stroke. A score of 0 indicates no symptoms remaining and normal pre-stroke activity, 1 indicates no disability despite symptoms, 2 indicates mild disability but still independent, 3 indicates moderate disability but able to walk, 4 indicates moderate to severe disability and requiring significant help from others, 5 indicates 24 hour nursing care and complete dependence on others, and 6 is death.</description>
