  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD), is increasing in industrialized countries. Over the next decade deaths from&#xD;
      COPD are projected to increase by more than 30% and COPD will become the third leading cause&#xD;
      of death worldwide by 2030. There is robust scientific evidence that non-invasive ventilation&#xD;
      (NIV) therapy is an effective option for most COPD patients hospitalized with acute&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to an acute disease exacerbation. More recently,&#xD;
      NIV has been shown to significantly improve survival and quality of life in COPD patients&#xD;
      with chronic stable hypercapnic disease. These data represent an important advance in the&#xD;
      field, and indicate that usage of NIV in patients with chronic stable hypercapnic COPD should&#xD;
      increase. Such an increase would be expected to improve patient outcomes and have a&#xD;
      beneficial impact on the significant healthcare burden incurred by these patients. However,&#xD;
      the proportion of stable COPD patients with chronic hypercapnia is unknown. In addition,&#xD;
      using NIV at home to treat COPD patients with hypercapnic (type 2) respiratory failure has&#xD;
      not often been considered previously and there is a paucity of data regarding NIV usage&#xD;
      patterns over time in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is robust scientific evidence that non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy is an&#xD;
      effective option for most COPD patients hospitalised with acute hypercapnic respiratory&#xD;
      failure secondary to an acute disease exacerbation [3]. More recently, NIV has been shown to&#xD;
      significantly improve survival and quality of life in COPD patients with chronic stable&#xD;
      hypercapnic disease [4] and in patients with persistent hypercapnia after an acute chronic&#xD;
      respiratory failure [11]. Over the past two decades, the utilisation of NIV has become one of&#xD;
      the most important developments in the field of mechanical ventilation. However, unsuccessful&#xD;
      NIV was found to be independently associated with death [5] and poor NIV compliance was&#xD;
      associated with higher risk of repeat acute NIV use [6]. There is a paucity of useful&#xD;
      predictors of poor patient compliance and the performance of conventional algorithms for&#xD;
      detecting COPD exacerbations is still weak. Detection of NIV failure is crucial in patient&#xD;
      management in view of its negative effect on quality of life and prognosis and the fact that&#xD;
      it often leads to hospitalisation. In addition, 70% of COPD-related healthcare costs are&#xD;
      consequences of emergency and hospital stays for the treatment of exacerbations [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, tele-monitoring emerged and unfolded differently among various healthcare&#xD;
      organisations and countries. Evidence regarding its impact on the management of COPD patients&#xD;
      is still insufficient to draw firm conclusions. Assumption has been made that remote&#xD;
      monitoring of home NIV treatment could help to identify novel predictors of the early&#xD;
      detection of NIV failure and deteriorations in patients with COPD. The incidence in routine&#xD;
      clinical care of unplanned all-cause and COPD-caused hospitalisations in patients treated&#xD;
      with NIV therapy who are continuously monitored by telemetric data in several European&#xD;
      countries needs evaluation. In addition, predictors of unplanned all-cause and COPD-caused&#xD;
      hospitalisations as well as of compliance and persistence to NIV therapy should be assessed&#xD;
      in this patient population with special respect to continuous tele-monitoring&#xD;

      Pre-Screening and check of eligibility Routine clinical care patients are diagnosed and&#xD;
      checked for potential eligibility of study participation based on existing data generated in&#xD;
      routine clinical care which is not part of this observational study Prescription of treatment&#xD;
      The decision of prescription of NIV therapy to the individual patient lies with the treating&#xD;
      physician during the course of routine clinical care and is not part of this observational&#xD;
      study. Diagnosis of COPD and indication of NIV therapy as well as initiation of treatment&#xD;
      should follow applicable medical guidelines and local clinical care policy. Prescription and&#xD;
      use of adequate ResMed NIV devices with tele-monitoring option according to Annex 1, 3. have&#xD;
      to follow the current instructions for use (IFU) of each device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and enrolment visit Patients will be screened and enrolled by contracted study&#xD;
      sites only, i.e. NIV expert centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening of potentially eligible patients will be performed within routine clinical care&#xD;
      using data created within routine clinical care. Adequate staff members of the study site&#xD;
      will inform potentially eligible patients about the potential use of their medical and&#xD;
      telemetric data within this observational study by information documents which have been&#xD;
      approved by the responsible Ethics Committee. Within this study medical care of the patient&#xD;
      is not in any way touched by protocol definitions but an individual decision by the treating&#xD;
      physician in routine clinical care. Only use and handling of medical and telemetric data for&#xD;
      scientific purposes defined in this protocol are elements of informed consent. The patient&#xD;
      will be given sufficient time to consider informed consent to data handling and to get&#xD;
      answers to his questions. If the patient agrees, the informed consent form for data use will&#xD;
      be provided for signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients' signing, patients are screened and checked for eligibility according to in-&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria by the participating sites, either on every day consecutively or at&#xD;
      pre-defined schedules (e.g. on defined days of the week, only) to minimise selection bias.&#xD;
      Medical screening includes check of COPD according to medical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study relevant data will be reported in the e-CRF. The system will automatically display the&#xD;
      patient ID as consecutive number across all participating study sites, i.e. without reference&#xD;
      to the recruiting site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data items will be documented of each participating patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data Patient's physical status Patient's social status Medical history&#xD;
      Concomitant medication and diseases Data regarding COPD diagnosis Spirometry results (no&#xD;
      older than 1 month) Blood gas analyses (carbon dioxide and bicarbonate concentration) during&#xD;
      spontaneous breathing (pH&gt;7.35) at date of decision making on initiation of NIV therapy Date&#xD;
      of NIV therapy prescription Telemetric data of NIV device settings will be recorded as soon&#xD;
      as the device has been delivered to the patient and was used for the first time Amount of&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen during NIV (if needed) The patients will further be asked to answer the&#xD;
      SRI questionnaire (refer to Annex 2), and the CAT questionnaire Initiation of treatment&#xD;
      Initiation of NIV therapy (the device has been delivered to the patient and was used for the&#xD;
      first time) after prescription should start according to local routine clinical care before&#xD;
      or as soon as possible after enrolment into the study (with a maximum of 7 days before&#xD;
      enrolment). Current medical guidelines and recommendations apply, however, they might differ&#xD;
      in participating countries, and thus, prescription and initiation of NIV therapy is the&#xD;
      decision of the treating physician and will follow local policies. Data on initiation of NIV&#xD;
      therapy will be recorded by telemetric data as soon as the device has been delivered to the&#xD;
      patient and was used for the first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits In routine clinical care, a first control visit of the patient at the site&#xD;
      after NIV therapy initiation should take place within the first 6 months together with&#xD;
      nocturnal assessment of ventilator therapy [12]. It is recommended that subsequent control&#xD;
      visits at the site should be performed at least 1-2 times a year [12]. To ensure&#xD;
      comparability of FU data, at least one follow-up visit at the site within 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up should be performed (if in line with routine clinical care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the FU visit at the site the following data from routine clinical care data should be&#xD;
      documented in the e-CRF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient status Concomitant medication and diseases Spirometry results (no older than 3&#xD;
      months) Body plethysmography (if available) Blood gas analyses (carbon dioxide, pH and&#xD;
      bicarbonate concentration) during spontaneous breathing Serious adverse events since last&#xD;
      site visit. History of exacerbations not leading to a hospitalisation The patient will again&#xD;
      be asked to answer to the SRI and CAT questionnaires. NIV device settings and other device&#xD;
      data will continuously be transferred in FU as tele-monitoring data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up questionnaires Every six months of follow-up short questionnaires asking for&#xD;
      hospitalisations and other potential SAEs since last contact will be sent by mail to all&#xD;
      patients. Closed envelopes with PID outside including the questionnaire and a free return&#xD;
      envelope will be prepared and sent to site by the CRO. Site staff will forward the envelope&#xD;
      to the corresponding patient who is asked to return the completed questionnaire (which&#xD;
      contains pseudonymous data only) directly to CRI using the free reply envelope. In case of&#xD;
      missing answer after one written reminder the study site should contact the patient by phone&#xD;
      in order to obtain the required information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data regarding hospitalisations or SAEs reported by the patient will be documented in the&#xD;
      e-CRF primarily by the CRO on the basis of available medical data. In case a patient reports&#xD;
      a hospitalisation or other SAE, the responsible study site will be informed by the CRO and&#xD;
      will subsequently contact the patient's family doctor respectively the hospital where the&#xD;
      patient was treated and ask for supportive documents (i.e. hospital discharge letter,&#xD;
      diagnostic reports) as applicable. The study site is subsequently responsible for completion&#xD;
      of event data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These procedures will not be performed in study patients enrolled in the ANTADIR registry in&#xD;
      France and used for joined analysis in this study. Thus, analysis of hospitalisations will&#xD;
      therefore be performed for patients enroled in Germany, Spain, UK and other potentially&#xD;
      participating countries but not for patients&#xD;
