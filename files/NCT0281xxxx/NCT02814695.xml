  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Baker's yeast extractions ,&#xD;
      probiotic antioxidant, in scavenging the oxidative stress status mediated damage on sperm&#xD;
      motility,progressive motility and vitality as well as comparing this potency to that of&#xD;
      Vitamin E in infertile men.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The practical part of the study took place from August 2015 to May 2016. The Study population&#xD;
      was made up of infertile males attending Hawaa fertility center, banha city, Qaliubiya,&#xD;
      Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 study samples were collected from patients who indicated willingness to participate in the&#xD;
      study and have had 3 to 7 days of sexual abstinence, using the masturbation method and&#xD;
      ejaculated in wide mouthed plastic container as described by World Health Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples were allowed to liquefy for 20 minutes and were examined for volume, viscosity,&#xD;
      spermatozoa count by Neubauer haemocytometer , oxidative stress level measurement by&#xD;
      Oxisperm, percentage of progressive motility and non-progressive motility and sperm vitality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Semen specimens were divided into ten equal fractions. First fraction was control, 0.1ml&#xD;
      of liquefied semen mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes.,&#xD;
      2nd, 3rd, 4th fractions (Vit. E 1,2,3), 0.1ml liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10&#xD;
      medium supplemented with (1, 2, 5 mg/ml) Vitamin E respectively and 5th, 6th, 7th parts&#xD;
      fractions (Yeast extraction ( YE) 1,2,3), 0.1ml liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's&#xD;
      F10 medium supplemented with (10, 20, 50 mg/ml) Yeast extraction and incubated at 37o C for&#xD;
      30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin C was obtained from (Sigma, Germany), 8th, 9th, 10th fractions (Vit. C. 1,2,3), 0.1ml&#xD;
      liquefied semen was mixed with 0.1ml Ham's F10 medium supplemented with (0.02, 0.04, 0.06&#xD;
      mg/ml) Vitamin C respectively and incubated at 37o C for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After semen specimen treated in all fractions, they were examined and assessed for&#xD;
      microscopical changes, total motility, progressive motility, vitality, level of oxidative&#xD;
      stress (OS) were detected in all fractions 30 minutes later after addition of the&#xD;
      antioxidants.&#xD;
