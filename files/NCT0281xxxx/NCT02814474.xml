  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Starvation and metabolic stress increase circulating ketone bodies, potentially providing the&#xD;
      heart with an alternative oxidative fuel. Hyperketonemia reduces myocardial fatty acid&#xD;
      consumption. It is unclear whether this is due to inhibited peripheral lipolysis or&#xD;
      diminished uptake per se.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To test whether infusion of 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) inhibits myocardial glucose and&#xD;
      fatty acid uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Randomized, single blinded, cross-over interventional study in 8 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
      Myocardial glucose and fatty acid metabolism studied by 11C-palmitate and 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
      Experimental elevation of circulating ketone bodies by infusion of&#xD;
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketone bodies are produced by the liver in conditions of increased fatty acid oxidation,&#xD;
      serving as important fuel sources during fasting and starvation. They are metabolized to&#xD;
      acetyl-CoA which enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle, enabling ATP production independently&#xD;
      of glycolysis and resulting in lower oxygen consumption per mole of produced ATP compared to&#xD;
      glucose [ref]. Their primary physiological function appears to be as an alternative&#xD;
      protein-sparing source of energy for extrahepatic tissues in times of reduced carbohydrate&#xD;
      availability, preventing muscle wasting. The principal ketone bodies in humans are&#xD;
      beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate. Increased ketogenesis is a feature common to&#xD;
      fasting, starvation and diabetes mellitus. Ketones have been shown to have a number of&#xD;
      neuroprotective effects including anticonvulsant activity, improving cognitive function in&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease and decreasing the effects of acute brain injury and ischemic damage&#xD;
      [ref], as well as antitumoral effect in gliomas. This has led to the suggestion that ketones&#xD;
      could be used therapeutically for a number of diseases though currently the only recognized&#xD;
      therapeutic use of ketones is in the form of ketogenic diets for the treatment of epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are limited in vivo studies on the effect of ketones on the heart. It is known that&#xD;
      fatty acids are the preferred myocardial fuel substrate and that this shifts to increased use&#xD;
      of glucose, and to a lesser extent ketones, in times of acutely increased demand.&#xD;
      Interestingly, acute ketone infusion in pigs appears to inhibit myocardial fatty acid&#xD;
      oxidation. In vitro studies suggest ketones decrease myocardial glucose uptake and affect&#xD;
      myocardial contractility, with either increased or decreased contractility when ketones are&#xD;
      the only energy source. This has not been further investigated in vivo. It is therefore&#xD;
      unclear to what extent ketones can contribute to myocardial metabolism in conditions of&#xD;
      hyperketonemia, and how this affects contractility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present project thus proposes to address the issues outlined above, by measuring human&#xD;
      cerebral and cardiac uptake of energy substrates, together with functional parameters, using&#xD;
      PET imaging and appropriate radiotracers, under experimental hyperketonemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. An acute increase in blood ketone concentration without previous ketoadaptation will&#xD;
      decrease cardiac palmitate and glucose uptake in healthy humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of acute ketone infusion on cardiac perfusion and 18F-FDG and 11C-palmitate uptake in&#xD;
      healthy subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 10 healthy volunteers. All study subjects will be instructed to follow a&#xD;
      standardised diet for 1 week before the study. On the study day, they will undergo a baseline&#xD;
      dynamic cardiac PET scan with 15O-water followed by 11C-palmitate and 18F-FDG tracers,&#xD;
      together with baseline blood samples, muscle biopsy and subcutaneous fat biopsy to assess&#xD;
      peripheral metabolic status. An intravenous infusion of sodium betahydroxybutyrate will then&#xD;
      be initiated at a concentration and rate sufficient to achieve 1-2 mM ketonemia after 30&#xD;
      minutes (assessed by blood sample). A second dynamic PET scan identical to the first will&#xD;
      then be performed under continuous ketone infusion at a constant rate. Finally, a second set&#xD;
      of blood samples, muscle and subcutaneous fat biopsies will be taken after the scan before&#xD;
      stopping the ketone infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this research are expected to provide insights into how human heart metabolism&#xD;
      respond to increased ketone bodies, and whether there are significant functional&#xD;
      improvements. It should contribute to further understanding the possible therapeutic benefits&#xD;
      of both exogenous ketone administration and of fasting in relation to cardiac function, with&#xD;
      implications for the treatment of various diseases such as diabetes and heart failure.&#xD;
      Knowledge of ketones' effects on the kinetics of various radionuclide tracers also has&#xD;
      importance for the appropriate clinical use of diagnostic PET scans in patients with elevated&#xD;
      blood ketone levels. In addition, the implementation and validation of a ketone PET tracer&#xD;
      will allow further future non-invasive studies that directly measure ketone metabolism in&#xD;
      various tissues and disease states.&#xD;
