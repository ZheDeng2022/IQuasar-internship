      This cohort event monitoring will document real-life safety experiences following the intake&#xD;
      of Injectable AS. Specifically, the study will record common adverse events that are&#xD;
      associated with the use of Inj. AS and associating factors such as age and gender that make&#xD;
      some of these events more likely. The sample size of 3000 patients will enable the&#xD;
      documentation of causally-related events that occur at frequencies of 1 in 1000 or more.&#xD;
      Since quinine, the previous gold standard for treating severe malaria may still be used by&#xD;
      facilities in addition to artesunate and artemether, the study will concurrently monitor the&#xD;
      safety of these products though focus of the study is the capture of adverse events following&#xD;
      exposure to Inj. AS. The concurrent monitoring of both quinine and artemether will also&#xD;
      enable treatment practices in the study areas to be documented.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease caused by Plasmodium species. In 2015, It was&#xD;
      estimated that, about 1.8 million cases of malaria and about 400, 000 deaths were reported,&#xD;
      90% of which are in Africa. Those children who do not die may suffer brain damage or&#xD;
      experience cognitive and learning deficits as a result of the disease severity. Though&#xD;
      significant progress has been made in the last decade towards achieving global malaria&#xD;
      targets, the disease burden is still relatively high in sub-Saharan African countries,&#xD;
      especially among children &lt;5 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectable artesunate (Inj. AS) is a life-saving medication indicated for the treatment of&#xD;
      severe/complicated malaria either intravenously or intramuscularly. The current version (3rd&#xD;
      edition) of the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria&#xD;
      strongly recommends, based on high-quality evidence, that adults and children with severe&#xD;
      malaria should be treated with &quot;intravenous or intramuscular artesunate&quot;. Injectable&#xD;
      Artesunate is prequalified under the WHO Prequalification Scheme. It has received marketing&#xD;
      authorization in nearly all malaria-endemic countries and millions of doses have been&#xD;
      distributed for use in the management of severe malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the widespread usage of Inj. AS, the safety database for the product is nearly empty&#xD;
      with the WHO Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) database containing only 2622 reports to&#xD;
      artesunate including Inj AS. Inj AS is considered a safe product even though there have been&#xD;
      reports of rare but serious haematological reactions in relation to its use including&#xD;
      post-treatment haemolysis and subsequent anaemia, some of them life-threatening and requiring&#xD;
      blood transfusion. Experts agree that the benefits of Inj. AS far outweigh any risks it may&#xD;
      pose and this formed the basis for the WHO recommendation for the use of Inj. AS as the first&#xD;
      product of choice for treating severe malaria except where it is not available and in which&#xD;
      case parenteral artemether is recommended conditionally. In view of the millions of doses of&#xD;
      Inj AS deployed and used each year, it is important to undertake focused, intensive safety&#xD;
      surveillance of the medicine to obtain continuous evidence on its benefits-risk profile and&#xD;
      also to prevent undocumented or rare but serious adverse events acting as barriers to its&#xD;
      uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from the detailed well-collected safety information obtained during clinical trials,&#xD;
      there is no published information on the real-life safety experience of Inj. AS in large&#xD;
      cohorts of patients. This study is therefore designed to obtain real-life safety experience&#xD;
      of Inj. AS when used in actual practice settings in 4 African countries - Ethiopia, Ghana,&#xD;
      Malawi and Uganda. The study is designed as a prospective, observational, longitudinal cohort&#xD;
      study of patients administered Inj AS in the course of normal clinical practice. The method&#xD;
      used is cohort event monitoring which has been deployed for the study of antimalarials and is&#xD;
      being suggested as a key method for several post-authorisation safety studies&#xD;
