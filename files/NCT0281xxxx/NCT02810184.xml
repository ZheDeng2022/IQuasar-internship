      The investigators aim to determine the level of total bone volume remodeling at 6, 24 and 36&#xD;
      months post-surgery in patients who underwent immediate prosthetic rehabilitation through a&#xD;
      cranial bone-grafted maxilla in combination with immediate provisional implant (IPI)&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone augmentation provides a solution for patients with a severely atrophic jaw to achieve&#xD;
      immediate fixed prosthetic rehabilitation. Studies reporting total bone volume changes are&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine the level of total bone volume remodeling at 6, 24 and 36&#xD;
      months post-surgery in patients who underwent immediate prosthetic rehabilitation through a&#xD;
      cranial bone-grafted maxilla in combination with immediate provisional implant (IPI)&#xD;
      placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, longitudinal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited at time of pre-surgical consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the surgical procedure, autogenous cranial graft reconstruction of the jaw is carried&#xD;
      out under general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans (NewTom VGi evo, QR Verona, Italy) will be taken pre-operatively,&#xD;
      and at different time-points post-operatively to evaluate the remodeling process of the bone&#xD;
      after the grafting procedure with implant placements and assess the total bone volume changes&#xD;
      up to 3 years post-surgically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT scans will be send to the oral maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) Research Group within the&#xD;
      Department of Imaging and Pathology (IMPATH), Catholic University Leuven (liaised with the&#xD;
      clinical department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery; University Hospital Leuven) for&#xD;
      analysis of the total bone volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data related to patient demographics, clinical diagnosis, the surgical procedure, IPI&#xD;
      stability, and total bone volume at different time-points will be registered by a clinical&#xD;
      research coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective trial could add important knowledge to the field, and provide indications to&#xD;
      improve future clinical pre-prosthetic management.&#xD;

          -  Patients with moderate to extreme bone atrophy of the jaw (class IV to VI according to&#xD;
             Cawood and Howell (Cawood &amp; Howell, 1988), caused by terminal periodontitis or&#xD;
             edentulism&#xD;

          -  Patients requiring bone augmentation procedures through cranial bone-grafting for jaw&#xD;
             reconstruction&#xD;

          -  Patients requesting immediate prosthetic rehabilitation, through the placement of an&#xD;
             immediate provisional implant (IPI)-supported fixed bridge (immediate loading)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom postoperative complications (e.g. sinusitis, infections) occurred,&#xD;
