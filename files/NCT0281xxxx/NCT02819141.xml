  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for&#xD;
      the self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) in a sample of critically ill patients&#xD;
      receiving mechanical ventilator support. The investigators hypothesis is that self-management&#xD;
      of sedative therapy by mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU),&#xD;
      tailored to their individual needs will be more efficacious than nurse-administered sedative&#xD;
      therapy in reducing anxiety, which may reduce duration of mechanical ventilator support and&#xD;
      occurrence of delirium.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy for conducting a future,&#xD;
      pragmatic effectiveness trial to test whether self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) is&#xD;
      superior to nurse-administered sedative therapy in day-to-day intensive care unit (ICU)&#xD;
      practice. This efficacy trial is powered for the investigators primary, clinically relevant&#xD;
      endpoints (anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and delirium presence), and examines&#xD;
      patient outcomes adversely affected by sedative administration practices, such as prolonged&#xD;
      ICU stays, altered mental status, and diminished post-ICU quality of life. This randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial with a total of 190 mechanically ventilated patients enrolled and maintained&#xD;
      on protocol will address the following Specific Aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of SMST compared to nurse-administered sedative&#xD;
      therapy on anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and presence of delirium in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to compare level of arousal and sedative exposure in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated patients (MVPs) randomized to SMST to those MVPs receiving nurse-administered&#xD;
      sedative therapy. The investigators hypothesize that SMST patients will be easily arousable,&#xD;
      more alert, and exposed to less sedation than those who receive nurse-administered sedative&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory aims are to compare post-ICU outcomes (physical/functional status, psychological&#xD;
      well-being, and health-related quality of life) and recall of ICU experiences between MVPs&#xD;
      randomized to SMST and those receiving nurse-administered sedative therapy.&#xD;
