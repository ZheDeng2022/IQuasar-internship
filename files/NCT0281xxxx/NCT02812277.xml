      This is a single centre, observational and retrospective clinical study. The study group was&#xD;
      about all HR positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients who were hospitalized between&#xD;
      January, 2008 and October, 2010, and ever accepted AI therapy with the completed follow-up&#xD;

      The department of surgery at Tian Jin Medical University Cancer Hospital, one of the centers&#xD;
      of excellence to treat patients with breast cancer in China, collects and maintains an&#xD;
      electronic database of patients treatment details and follow up data. This is a single&#xD;
      centre, observational and retrospective clinical study. The study group was about all HR&#xD;
      positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients who were hospitalized between January, 2008&#xD;
      and October, 2010, and ever accepted AI therapy with the completed follow-up data.All the&#xD;
      enrolled patients received breast-conserving surgery or whole breast surgery, and afterwards,&#xD;
      received adjuvant chemotherapy according the pathological types. The patient's clinical&#xD;
      pathological data include the age, family history, surgery options, pathologic type, the size&#xD;
      of tumor, lymph node status, histological grade, chemotherapy regime, irradiation regime, and&#xD;
      the expressions pattern of Her-2 and Ki-67. The research starts when the patients received&#xD;
      the first time AI treatment. In the subsequent treatment, we analyzed the patients' bone&#xD;
      density changes (T value &gt;-1 indicates normal,-2.5≤T value≤-1 indicates mild osteoporosis, T&#xD;
      value &lt;-2.5 indicates severe osteoporosis) each half year for 3 years, analyzed the patients'&#xD;
      liver function and kidney function changes each half year for 3 years (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL,&#xD;
      DBIL,UREA and CREA values &gt; 2 times ULN indicates abnormal), analyzed the patients'&#xD;
      blood-lipoids (LDL, HDL, TG and TC) each half year for 3 years, the occurrence rates of&#xD;
      adverse reactions (skin flush, joint pain, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, et&#xD;
      al), the causes and rates of treatment termination between the 2 groups, the 3 years DFS and&#xD;
      OS between two groups, and the factors associated with survival and prognosis, and identified&#xD;
      the benefit individuals of AI therapy.&#xD;
