  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ultra Q Reflex® (Ellex) constitutes the only Nd:YAG laser approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      vitreous floaters. No randomized controlled clinical trial has been carried out to this day&#xD;
      in order to investigate its superiority over sham treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, 60 eyes will be randomized and blinded into 2 groups, one receiving up&#xD;
      to two sessions of laser vitreolysis the other scheduled for two sessions of sham treatment.&#xD;
      After a maximum of two (sham) treatment sessions (1 per month), patients' utility value score&#xD;
      and BCVA will be re-assessed. A follow-up period of 12 months (with visits at month 1, 6 and&#xD;
      12 post-treatment) will ensue the &quot;treatment phase&quot; to register any late adverse events that&#xD;
      may be associated with laser vitreolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As vitrectomy constitutes a highly invasive procedure, which must therefore be restricted to&#xD;
      severe cases only, laser vitreolysis may present a valuable treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with moderate vitreous floaters that are not eligible for vitrectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A great number of patients seek out their ophthalmologists when troubled by vitreous&#xD;
      floaters. The majority of these patients are reassured when the diagnosis is made and are&#xD;
      content to get accustomed to these &quot;mouches volantes&quot;. A considerable proportion, however,&#xD;
      feels permanently irritated by vitreous floaters which may result in a significant decrease&#xD;
      of patients' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, pars plana vitrectomy constituted the only established therapeutic option.&#xD;
      Though a standard surgical procedure, the potential adverse events associated with vitrectomy&#xD;
      are not negligible and patients must allow for an extended period of visual rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Therefore, treatment was restricted to severe cases and thus only a very small percentage of&#xD;
      patients received any treatment at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reports exist on Q-switched Nd:YAG laser surgery for vitreous opacities, membranes and&#xD;
      vitreoretinal bands in 59 eyes. The results of early laser vitreolysis are sobering with an&#xD;
      improve in visual acuity in only 18 eyes but considerable adverse events such as retinal&#xD;
      holes with detachment (1 eye), minor retinal hemorrhages (4 eyes) and focal opacities of the&#xD;
      crystalline lens (5 eyes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to another study, the Q-switched system allowed treatment of a wider variety of&#xD;
      indications in the posterior pole and requires fewer sessions when compared to a mode-locked&#xD;
      system. Due to the higher energy levels required by Q-switch system, however, complications&#xD;
      occurred more frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional study presented more favorable results; in all 15 cases the symptoms of&#xD;
      vitreous floaters disappeared after treatment and no adverse events were reported during a&#xD;
      follow-up period of at least 1 year. Nevertheless, the reported energy levels (5-7.1mJ and&#xD;
      total energy 71-742mJ) were considerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further results suggested that laser vitreolysis moderately improved symptoms in 38% of all&#xD;
      patients, while 61,5% registered no improvement; no adverse events were reported. In&#xD;
      contrast, vitrectomy resulted in full resolution of symptoms in 93,3% of eyes - with one&#xD;
      patient suffering post-operative retinal detachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study presented 3 cases of chronic open-angle glaucoma secondary to ND:YAG&#xD;
      vitreolysis (3 eyes of 2 patients). The latency period between vitreolysis and onset of&#xD;
      elevated IOP ranged from 1 week to 8 months; other potential factors promoting a rise in IOP,&#xD;
      namely &quot;inflammation, steroid use, or other identifiable causes&quot; are reported as absent. In&#xD;
      two eyes, SLT followed by glaucoma surgery (Trabectome) was required to stabilise IOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas the treatment of floaters located in the anterior vitreous resulted in no obvious&#xD;
      change, treatment in the mid-vitreous and posterior vitreous lead to an increase in protein,&#xD;
      the refractive index and the viscosity of the vitreous humor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It appears that the current literature remains inconclusive as to the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Nd:YAG vitreolysis. In the review literature, floater vitrectomy - especially with small&#xD;
      sutureless gauge instruments and a corevitrectomy - yields excellent success rates combined&#xD;
      with a low risk profile. In contrast, the efficacy of vitreolysis ranges between 0 and 100%.&#xD;
      The key factor to success in vitreolysis is the use of appropriately high energy levels and&#xD;
      the application of a sufficient amount of shots. In his retrospective, observational study&#xD;
      (including 168 eyes, treatment with the Ultra Q Relfex®) 92% of patients were satisfied with&#xD;
      the result;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, vitreolysis is performed with the Ultra Q Reflex® laser - to this day&#xD;
      the only laser officially approved for vitreolysis. It features an ultra-Gaussian beam mode,&#xD;
      teamed with a fast-pulse rise time and a small-spot size. Due to the tightly controlled&#xD;
      plasma with its higher power density fewer shots are required which results in a lower&#xD;
      cumulative dose. Moreover, the co-axial alignment of the practitioner's vision, the target&#xD;
      illumination, and the treatment beam grants better illumination of vitreous opacities and&#xD;
      thus allows for more precise focusing. This patented design facilitates the vaporization of&#xD;
      floaters and minimizes the risk of collateral damage to adjacent tissues.&#xD;
