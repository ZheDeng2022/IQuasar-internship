      Cardio-metabolic risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, smoke, alcohol abuse,&#xD;
      high blood lipids or sugar and arterial hypertension. Systems for self-learning and&#xD;
      self-monitoring may help people improve and maintain a healthy lifestyle through tailored&#xD;
      suggestions about diet, weight control, physical activity, fatigue,stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEMEOTICONS exploits the human face as an indicator of individual's health status and&#xD;
      translates signs obtained from the face using contactless sensors into measures and&#xD;
      descriptors to be automatically evaluated by a an interactive smart mirror. This &quot;Wize&#xD;
      Mirror&quot; extracts descriptors from videos, images and gas concentration signals and integrates&#xD;
      them in a virtual model used to compute and trace the evolution of an individual's wellness&#xD;
      index. A health diary enables each individual to evaluate and personally relate his/her&#xD;
      lifestyle to his/her well-being. Coaching messages are provided, in relation to the evolution&#xD;
      of the wellness index and of each descriptor, to provide useful suggestions on correct&#xD;
      lifestyle self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is assess the accuracy of the information derived from the Wize&#xD;
      Mirror in expressing the health status of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reproducibility and repeatability study will evaluate whether measurements are stable&#xD;
      over short time spans and whether they are influenced by meals light and temperature&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify whether the Wize Mirror is able to detect variations in physical and emotional&#xD;
      health status with appropriate lifestyle changes, the validation study will cross-check&#xD;
      measurements from the Wize Mirror against reference clinical tests at enrolment and after 3&#xD;
      months of personalized suggestions for healthy behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference tests include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of blood oxygen content and skin end products of sugar metabolism,body&#xD;
           composition, energy expenditure, vascular function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory profile and exhaled gas composition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires on quality of life and lifestyle (food, sleep, physical activity,&#xD;
           smoking, alcohol, stress).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wize Mirror measures include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D reconstruction of face images for roundness, color, stress and fatigue&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heart and respiratory rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of skin sugar metabolism end-products and of eye lipid deposits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small vessel vasodilating ability with local heating The results will allow to assess&#xD;
           whether the Wize Mirror is easy to use and helpful for self-monitoring of&#xD;
           cardio-metabolic risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardio--metabolic (CM) risk is a cluster of risk factors indicative of a patient's overall&#xD;
      risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      worldwide and type-2 diabetes. CM risk factors include obesity, physical inactivity, smoke,&#xD;
      alcohol abuse, abnormal lipid metabolism, hyper-glycaemia and arterial hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational programs and lifestyle interventions represent effective tools to improve the&#xD;
      risk profile but they need time consuming and expensive counselling and supervision of&#xD;
      various health professionals . A rational alternative to intensive individual coaching is the&#xD;
      use of systems for self-learning and self-monitoring, to help people change and maintain a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle through tailored suggestions about nutrition, weight control, physical&#xD;
      activity, fatigue, and stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SEMEOTICONS exploits the human face as an indicator of individual's health status and&#xD;
      translates signs obtained from the face into measures and descriptors to be automatically&#xD;
      evaluated by a computerized application, an interactive smart mirror, which seamlessly&#xD;
      integrates contactless sensors, such as 3D optical sensors, a multispectral camera, gas&#xD;
      detection sensors, and microphones and a touch-screen interface for user's interactions and&#xD;
      output visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This &quot;Wize Mirror&quot; collects data in the form of videos, images and gas concentration signals,&#xD;
      and extracts a number of biometric, morphometric, colorimetric, and compositional descriptors&#xD;
      that represent individual's facial signs. The integration of such descriptors constitute a&#xD;
      virtual model used to compute and trace the evolution of an individual's wellness index. A&#xD;
      health diary about this index enables each individual to evaluate and personally relate&#xD;
      his/her lifestyle to his/her well-being. Coaching messages are provided, in relation to the&#xD;
      evolution of the wellness index and of each descriptor to provide useful suggestions on&#xD;
      correct lifestyle self-monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is assess the accuracy of the information derived from the Wize&#xD;
      Mirror in expressing the health status of an individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 Reproducibility and repeatability study (to be performed at the French site Lyon only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reproducibility and repeatability study will evaluate whether Wize Mirror measurements&#xD;
      are influenced by meals, light and temperature conditions in 6 healthy volunteers Data will&#xD;
      be acquired during 4 modules corresponding to different use conditions of the mirror&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Changes in the fasting state Under artificial lights and at environment temperature&#xD;
           (18-20°C), Wize Mirror measurements will be acquired at baseline in the fasting state&#xD;
           and at 30, 60 and 120 minutes after a standardized breakfast during three consecutive&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Changes in light conditions Wize Mirror measurements will be performed at baseline&#xD;
           under artificial lights and at environment temperature (18-20°C) then at 30' under&#xD;
           artificial lights and at environment temperature (18-20°C) for 3 times consecutively&#xD;
           during the same morning with 20 minutes interval between acquisitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Changes in temperature conditions Wize Mirror measurements will be performed at&#xD;
           baseline under artificial lights and at environment temperature (18-20°C) then at 30'&#xD;
           under artificial lights and at temperature increased to 28- 30°C, for 3 times&#xD;
           consecutively during the same morning with 20 minutes interval between acquisitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Simultaneous changes in light and temperature conditions Wize Mirror measurements will&#xD;
           be performed at baseline under artificial lights and at environment temperature&#xD;
           (18-20°C) then at 30' under natural lights and at temperature increased to 28- 30°C, in&#xD;
           6 volunteers for 3 times consecutively during the same morning with 20 minutes interval&#xD;
           between acquisitions. The visit will last approximately 3 hours. A breakfast will be&#xD;
           offered at the end of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess whether measurements are stable over short time spans one of the 6 volunteers will&#xD;
      undergo a last visit for the repeatability study in the fasting state. Wize Mirror&#xD;
      measurements will be performed at T0 under artificial lights and at environment temperature&#xD;
      (18-20°C) for 10 consecutive times with a 30 minutes interval between acquisitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each visit the following Wize Mirror measurements will be performed:&#xD;

      is able to detect variations in physical and emotional health status with appropriate&#xD;
      lifestyle changes, measurements will be cross-checked at enrolment and after 3 months of&#xD;
      personalized suggestions for healthy behavior.&#xD;
