      The purpose of this study is to develop and pilot test recruitment methods for a future study&#xD;
      of prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STI), including the human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV), among Black adolescent boys through sexual health education by their fathers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are&#xD;
      a health problem for all adolescents, regardless of race. Presently, there are nearly 110&#xD;
      million cases of sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the United States. Annually, there&#xD;
      are more than 19.7 million new STI cases, of which half are accounted for by youth. Of those,&#xD;
      more than half are accounted for by youth ages 15 to 24 years. However, Black males between&#xD;
      the ages of 13 and 17 are disproportionately affected by STIs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea,&#xD;
      syphilis, and HIV/AIDS; they currently account for 50% of HIV infections among all youth.&#xD;
      Additionally, the rate of HIV infection among young black gay or bisexual men is twice that&#xD;
      of young white men. Researchers have pointed to the need to involve Black men who are fathers&#xD;
      in interventions to decrease the epidemic of STIs and HIV among Black adolescent boys.&#xD;
      However, youth-focused interventions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#xD;
      (CDC) include only one intervention with a focus on the father and son as a dyad. Thus more&#xD;
      research is clearly needed with this focus, but challenges with recruitment need to first be&#xD;
      addressed. Challenges in recruiting Black men for health research are reflected in efforts by&#xD;
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to promote research that includes minorities and in&#xD;
      particular Black fathers. Barriers to research participation include ongoing distrust of&#xD;
      health researchers because of the historic failing of the medical field in the Tuskegee&#xD;
      syphilis study of rural Black men; this occurred more than 47 years ago but still remains&#xD;
      important today. Barriers also include lack of knowledge of the benefits of research. Because&#xD;
      of this lack of participation of Black men in research we have only limited understanding of&#xD;
      their perceptions of many health issues. In order to involve this population in research,&#xD;
      barriers and challenges to their involvement must be overcome. One way to begin this is to&#xD;
      engage with leaders in their communities, to effectively communicate research objectives and&#xD;
      begin building trusting relationships. Establishing relationships with community leaders can&#xD;
      facilitate recruitment in research and help to overcome some of the barriers and challenges&#xD;
      for Black men. Important elements of building those relationships include discussing research&#xD;
      procedures, hypotheses, pilot data, and plans to bring results of research back to the&#xD;
      community for future utilization. This proposed study will therefore seek to implement these&#xD;
      elements of trust with local barbers and barbershops. In the Black community, barbers have&#xD;
      been identified as community leaders and a great recruiting source for work on health&#xD;
      promotion and disease prevention in the areas of hypertension and prostate cancer. However,&#xD;
      few studies have used barbershops for sexual health related content focusing on Black fathers&#xD;
      and their adolescent boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To create a successful recruitment process for Black men and their sons, a strategic plan of&#xD;
      action is necessary prior to implementing a study. The first step is to gain a deeper&#xD;
      understanding of effective strategies to include Black men in research. Therefore, the&#xD;
      proposed pilot study will develop and test the feasibility of a recruitment process for Black&#xD;
      men who are fathers and their adolescent sons, using barbershops and barbers as recruiters&#xD;
      and advocates. Barbers will be assessed for their willingness to serve as recruiters and&#xD;
      advocates for sexual health related studies involving Black fathers and their adolescent&#xD;
      sons, and their ideas for recruitment for this group. With this information we will develop&#xD;
      and pilot a recruitment strategy, to be used in a future qualitative study: Assessing Black&#xD;
      fathers' attitudes towards discussing sexual health with their adolescent son and Assessing&#xD;
      Black adolescent boys' attitudes towards their father as a sexual health educator. This&#xD;
      future study will identify fathers' attitudes towards their adolescent sons and sex and major&#xD;
      influences on sexual behaviors of adolescent boys, identify fathers' perspectives on what and&#xD;
      who is important to include in an intervention focused on STI and HIV prevention, develop a&#xD;
      survey tool to assess a larger sample of African American fathers for a future study, and&#xD;
      gain adolescent males' perspectives on the role of their fathers in their sexual health.&#xD;
      Research has suggested that clear communication between Black parents and their youth about&#xD;
      sexual health is associated with higher rates of sexual abstinence, condom use, and intent to&#xD;
      delay initiation of sexual intercourse, which can prevent infectious diseases. However,&#xD;
      barriers exist for parents in educating their youth about sexual health, including lack of&#xD;
      knowledge and discomfort in talking about safe sex. Further, little research has been&#xD;
      conducted specifically on the parental role of Black fathers in educating their sons. This&#xD;
      study will identify the best strategies for recruiting Black fathers and their sons for&#xD;
      research on the parental role of Black fathers in helping their sons avoid risky sex.&#xD;
