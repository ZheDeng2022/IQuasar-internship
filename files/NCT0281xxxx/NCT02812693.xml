    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate work in treating patients with melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that&#xD;
      has spread to nearby tissue or other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell&#xD;
      growth. Giving pembrolizumab and imatinib mesylate may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that has spread to nearby tissue or other&#xD;
      places in the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the best overall response rate (BORR = complete response + partial response) of&#xD;
      the combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib for treatment of melanomas harboring c-Kit&#xD;
      mutation or amplification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and adverse effect profile of the combination of pembrolizumab and&#xD;
      imatinib in patients with melanomas harboring c-KIT aberrations (mutations or&#xD;
      amplifications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the median time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assessment of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 expression in melanoma patients with&#xD;
      c-KIT aberrations before and after combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and imatinib&#xD;
      mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 9 weeks&#xD;
      for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
