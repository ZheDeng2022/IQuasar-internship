  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are important cause of death, and of these have highlighted the&#xD;
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and its various clinical manifestations. The chest pain&#xD;
      suggestive of ischemic heart disease is frequent complaint in medical consultations and&#xD;
      hospitalizations . Complementary tests and images exams for risk stratification as Cardiac&#xD;
      Stress Test (ET), the Myocardial Perfusion scintigraphy of (SPECT) are established for risk&#xD;
      stratification and assessment workup in suspected ischemic heart disease. Coronary tomography&#xD;
      angiography (CTA) has emerged as a robust method for non-invasive assessment of CAD, showing&#xD;
      data diagnostics that directly correlate with invasive coronary angiography. Recently, the&#xD;
      Myocardial Perfusion by Tomography Computed (CTP) has emerged as a new technique to measure&#xD;
      the flow limitation for coronary microcirculation. In clinical practice, the exercise testing&#xD;
      with electrocardiogram changes compatible with myocardial ischemia can lead to other&#xD;
      examinations for elucidation of ischemic etiology, the most usual myocardial scintigraphy.&#xD;
      However, a SPECT without evidence of ischemia, does not explain ischemic electrocardiographic&#xD;
      changes triggered by physical stress, although it is a good marker prognostic. A CTP is a&#xD;
      emerging tool in the evaluation of myocardial ischemia. Recent studies point to a good&#xD;
      accuracy of the method compared to nuclear medicine. To test this hypothesis, this study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate whether the CTP has a better diagnostic performance in detecting of obstructive&#xD;
      or not obstructive CAD compared to the SPECT in the population of patients with exercise&#xD;
      stress testing compatible with myocardial ischemia, and the computed tomography angiography&#xD;
      (CTA) as the reference method. In addition, data from the exercise test (functional capacity,&#xD;
      hemodynamics, electrocardiogram changes) will be compared to findings of CTA and CTP.&#xD;

      Patients will be recruited in private Nuclear Medicine Service to perform myocardial&#xD;
      perfusion scintigraphy with physical stress (SPECT-ET) that present the exercise test (less&#xD;
      than 60 days) positive for ischemia, as electrocardiographic criteria enshrined in current&#xD;
      guidelines of the Brazilian Society of Cardiology. These patients will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study, guided and included after signing an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will be submitted to 2 images exams protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with physical stress (SPECT-ET):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients referred from other services with exercise testing positive ischemic response&#xD;
           will be instructed to discontinue the drugs in use that may affect the ET as negative&#xD;
           and coronary vasodilator action inotropic drugs. They will undergo perfusion study&#xD;
           myocardial scintigraphy (SPECT) at rest and physical stress (1 day protocol), starting&#xD;
           with Sestamibi Tn in injection 99 mtc at a dose of 10 millicurie and capture resting&#xD;
           scintigraphic images in Gamma Camera GE millenium. Then they will undergo phase of&#xD;
           physical stress, with maximum ET exercise, until exhaustion or intense physical exertion&#xD;
           on the Borg Scale modified under Bruce protocol. At the peak of the effort will be&#xD;
           injected into the radio tracer TC-99m Sestamibi at a dose of 30 mCi (milli Curie), and&#xD;
           then quantified in Gamma Camera GE millenium scintigraphic images after physical stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During the exercise test electrocardiographic variables will be evaluated as magnitude&#xD;
           and morphology of ST segment changes, precocity and duration of these changes,&#xD;
           hemodynamic variables such as behavior of the pressure curve and clinical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The perfusion myocardial study by Gated SPECT (single-photon emission computed&#xD;
           tomography) will be analyzed qualitatively by 2 experienced examiners and&#xD;
           semi-quantitatively using severity scores widely validated in the literature (SSS -&#xD;
           Summed Stress Score; SRS - Summed Rest Score: SDS - summed Difference Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Myocardial Perfusion and Angiography by Computed Tomography. Patients will undergo&#xD;
           myocardial perfusion computed tomography with multiple detectors after dipyridamole, as&#xD;
           established protocol anteriores10 studies, followed by coronary angiography at rest&#xD;
           (CTA) in tomography with 128 multi-detector channels Optima 660 CT (GE ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to perform absolute fast 4 hours for the exam, and fasting for 24&#xD;
      foods with caffeine and medications containing xanthine derivatives. It will be obtained&#xD;
      venous access caliber in the right upper limb and cardiac monitoring continues. They will be&#xD;
      assessed and recorded weight, height, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) at rest and&#xD;
      respiratory rate before, during and after the examination tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the pharmacological stress PMTC be performed after dipyridamole&#xD;
      administration in a dose of 0,56mg / kg for 4 minutes. images, according to protocol&#xD;
      previously validated in this study instituição10 immediately after injection of iodinated&#xD;
      contrast After 2 minutes of dipyridamole administration of completion will be performed.&#xD;
      Approximately 60ml of nonionic iodinated intravenous contrast medium is administered by an&#xD;
      automated gun to a 3ml / s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the stress phase and the pharmacological reversal with aminophylline (240 mg), will be&#xD;
      held the control of heart rate (metoprolol 5 mg IV every 5 minutes [max. 20mg] with the&#xD;
      objective of reaching a HR ≤ 60), for carrying out the acquisition of coronary angiography.&#xD;
      The acquisition parameters for CTA (resting phase) will be individualized according to the&#xD;
      weight, sex and heart rate of each patient, in order to maintain a total dose of not more&#xD;
      radiation 15mSv therefore a safe dose of radiation with the image quality maintenance.&#xD;
      three-dimensional reconstructions and perfusion algorithm will be performed with the use of&#xD;
      dedicated workstation (ADW4.6 [GE]).&#xD;
