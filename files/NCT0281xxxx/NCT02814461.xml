      The goal of this study is to conduct a phase I clinical trial evaluating the safety and MTD&#xD;
      of axitinib in combination with RT for advanced HCC. There are some rationales of conducting&#xD;
      this clinical trial. Firstly, there is evidence of benefit from the combination of a variety&#xD;
      of anti-angiogenic agents with RT at the pre-clinical level. Numerous pre-clinical models&#xD;
      have documented improved outcome with the combination of RT (e.g. bevacizumab ... etc).&#xD;
      Potential increasing the oxygenation of tumors with anti-angiogenesis is also expected to&#xD;
      improve the therapeutic ratio of radiation therapy to hypervascular caner like HCC. Secondly,&#xD;
      spatial cooperation may exist between local treatment (e.g. RT) and systemic therapy (e.g.&#xD;
      axitinib). From the experience of sorafenib, the majority of patients eventually progress&#xD;
      within the liver and die of liver failure, providing rationale to use local therapies like&#xD;
      RT. On the other hand, from the experience of RT, the most common site of first recurrence&#xD;
      was in the liver outside the irradiated volume, providing rationale for studies combining&#xD;
      regional or systemic therapies with RT. Thirdly, clinical experiences with RT and&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic agent are few but still exist with encouraging results. For example, one&#xD;
      retrospective review from Taiwan with advanced HCC treated with RT and sunitinib (a TKI with&#xD;
      similar mechanisms as sorafenib) reported objective response rate of 74% and a median&#xD;
      survival of 16 months, and concluded hypofractionated RT and sunitinib can be delivered&#xD;
      safely in HCC patients, which was compatible with the result of several phase I or II studies&#xD;
      using sorafenib plus. Fourthly, the safety and MTD of axitinib combined with RT is needed to&#xD;
      be established before launch of a phase II study&#xD;

The final prescribed dose is based on an upper limit of mean liver dose of 18 Gy for all plans. (Daily Entecavir 0.5-1mg or Telbivudine 600mg is recommended for patients with positive hepatitis B during and 3 months after RT.)</description>
