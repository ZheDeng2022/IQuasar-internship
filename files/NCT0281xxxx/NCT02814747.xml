  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the use of DNA chips for diagnostic purposes, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is&#xD;
      transforming the field of developmental diseases, from fundamental research to care.&#xD;
      Nonetheless, before HTS can be transferred to everyday clinical practice, in particular for&#xD;
      expert diagnosis using exome HTS, it is necessary to anticipate the nature of the information&#xD;
      to be given to patients and to parents in order to obtain consent for exome HTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective in terms of public health is to allow patients with rare diseases to benefit&#xD;
      from innovative technologies in optimal conditions of information and accompaniment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the objectives of this project are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate the preferences of families of patients with development disorders as regard to&#xD;
           suspicious and incidental findings from HTS before its introduction for diagnostic&#xD;
           purpose,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. and then, following the exome analyses carried out for diagnostic purposes, describe,&#xD;
           analyse and understand the experience, expectations and reactions of families and&#xD;
           geneticists concerning the diagnostic trajectory in general and at the time the results&#xD;
           of the HTS were announced in particular A methodology that associated quantitative and&#xD;
           qualitative approaches was chosen so as to combine the advantages and overcome the&#xD;
           shortcomings of each: a quantitative study to investigate a large number of patients,&#xD;
           which would ensure a certain representativeness of the population and allow sub-groups&#xD;
           analyses to study the upstream phase concerning indications for high-throughput&#xD;
           sequencing; and a qualitative study, which though it allows only a small number of&#xD;
           patients to be investigated, makes it possible to describe, analyze and understand in&#xD;
           depth the complex downstream phenomena of high-throughput sequencing results&#xD;
