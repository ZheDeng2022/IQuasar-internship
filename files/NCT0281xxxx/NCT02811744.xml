  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to use 11C-acetate PET/CT to preliminarily test and validate methods&#xD;
      for imaging astrocyte activation as an early indicator of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease (AD). 11C-Acetate PET/CT has been shown to quantify astrocyte activation in vivo, but&#xD;
      no reports have evaluated its potential in AD. The investigators propose to test 11C-Acetate&#xD;
      PET/CT as a marker for astrocyte activation associated with pathologic amyloid deposition in&#xD;
      AD. The investigators will compare binding between subjects with early stage AD and healthy&#xD;
      controls. Further, the investigators will investigate the correlation between amyloid and&#xD;
      acetate binding. If the investigators find increased astrocyte activation in response to&#xD;
      cerebral amyloid by showing a group difference in brain acetate uptake between disease and&#xD;
      controls or a strong correlation between acetate and amyloid PET/CT binding. Validating&#xD;
      neuroinflammation markers in AD ultimately may guide therapeutic modulation of beneficial and&#xD;
      damaging neuroinflammation to slow disease progression, as well as providing new insights&#xD;
      into AD pathophysiology.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (up to 14) will be recruited primarily from the Penn Memory Center (PMC). Clinical diagnostic criteria (described in further detail in Study Procedures section) will be used to identify subjects who are meet criteria for amnestic MCI. Participants will receive injection of radioactive tracer 11C-acetate and complete a PET/CT scan.</description>

    <description>Normal control subjects in the same age range (up to 6) will be recruited from a current ongoing study investigating neuroinflammation in late life depression and healthy controls, from the control group in which all subjects receive MRI and LP and from the PMC research cohort. Participants will receive injection of radioactive tracer 11C-acetate and complete a PET/CT scan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for amnestic MCI cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants will be at least 65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Positive brain amyloid PET/CT scan within 6 months of study screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score â‰¥ 24 at screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of&#xD;
             11C-Acetate PET/CT and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study&#xD;
             analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as a part of&#xD;
