  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To make these definitions of neural inspiratory time (Ti) and expiratory delay clearly.The&#xD;
      present study was undertaken to examined the physiological signals of patients and healthy&#xD;
      subjects during spontaneous breathing and noninvasive mechanical ventilation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total, 8 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, 8 patients with&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (ILD) and 8 healthy subjects were recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was studied at the afternoon in a semirecumbent position. After the application&#xD;
      of topical anaesthesia (2% xylocaine), the patient was asked to swallow two balloon-tipped&#xD;
      catheters and the multi-pair esophageal electrode catheter through the nose into the their&#xD;
      right position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first period, the stable signals of unassisted spontaneous breathing (about 5min) were&#xD;
      chosen to be recorded. After this period, the patient was placed on noninvasive pressure&#xD;
      support ventilation(PSV). The inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was initially&#xD;
      titrated by patient's tolerance . The noninvasive ventilation lasted at least 20 minutes&#xD;
      until the breathing was stable. All the raw signals were recorded. The last 15 minutes of the&#xD;
      stable computer-stored data were calculated and analyzed. The leaks were monitored by the&#xD;
      display of the ventilator and the computer during the procedure. When the leak was observed,&#xD;
      the mask was carefully adjusted to prevent. Esophageal and gastric balloon-catheters were&#xD;
      used to detect the intra-thoracic and abdominal pressure. Airway pressure was also measured&#xD;
      simultaneously. EMGdi was recorded from a multipair esophageal electrode .During ventilation&#xD;
      Airflow and ventilation were measured with pneumotachograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory rate, tidal volume,the time difference between the initial increase and the&#xD;
      termination of the diaphragm electromyogram(EMGdi) , time difference between maximal value of&#xD;
      EMGdi and the end of inspiratory flow,time difference between the point of zero flow between&#xD;
      inspiration and expiration ,and the time difference between the onset of the upward&#xD;
      deflection in transdiagramic pressure( Pdi) and the return of Pdi were calculated during the&#xD;
      unassisted spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
