  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of severe post-partum hemorrhage has been increasing in developed countries.&#xD;
      The reason for this is at least partially unknown. Surgical techniques, holistic treatment&#xD;
      protocols and strategies in blood product administration may have changed patient outcome&#xD;
      and, for example the incidence of transfusion related side effects. A retrospective analysis&#xD;
      of the whole cohort of parturients in 2009-2015 in Tampere University Hospital will be made&#xD;
      to assess the risk factors for severe PPH (ie. estimated blood loss more than 1500ml during&#xD;
      delivery) and examine the possible change in blood transfusion strategies and its effect on&#xD;
      bleeding (for example, implementation of massive transfusion protocol, amount of blood&#xD;
      products used, effect of red blood cell:fresh-frozen plasma ratio, use of pharmacological&#xD;
      agents for coagulation management, introduction of new angiological and surgical techniques&#xD;
      etc.) and complications, laboratory parameters and patient outcome.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) still remains one of leading causes of morbidity in the&#xD;
      obstetric population and a recent report from the United Kingdom revealed that hemorrhage is&#xD;
      the sixth most important direct cause of maternal mortality. During labor, the blood flow in&#xD;
      the uterus increases and obstetric hemorrhage may quickly turn to massive bleeding requiring&#xD;
      massive transfusion of allogeneic blood products. Although introduction of massive&#xD;
      transfusion protocols (MTP) may have improved survival in trauma patients, administration of&#xD;
      allogeneic blood products, although life-saving, is also associated with considerable side&#xD;
      effects. That is why a stepwise progressive approach and implementation of treatment&#xD;
      protocols describing the timely use of different pharmacological agents and surgical or&#xD;
      radiological interventions are called for. Risk factors for blood transfusion (as a surrogate&#xD;
      marker for PPH) at delivery in Finland have been recently studied , and the results seem to&#xD;
      be in consonance with reports from several developed countries, which demonstrate a marked&#xD;
      increase in incidence of PPH. However, the causes for the increase in postpartum hemorrhage&#xD;
      remain at least partly unclear. Also, complication rates of blood transfusion and other&#xD;
      adverse outcomes in the treatment of an obstetric patient with severe bleeding are not very&#xD;
      recently studied (19). Identification of PPH risk factors, change in transfusion strategies&#xD;
      and surgical techniques and implementation of holistic treatment protocols may have had an&#xD;
      effect on the complication rate, costs and total amount of blood product usage and bleeding,&#xD;
      but to investigators' knowledge, these are underreported in current studies.That is why it&#xD;
      seems justified to examine a cohort of parturients with severe PPH under a long time span to&#xD;
      find out whether the change in practice is reflected in patients' outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From 2009 to December 2015, all patients having a marked post-partum hemorrhage (estimated&#xD;
      blood loss 1500ml) will be tracked from Tampere University hospital's computerized perinatal&#xD;
      database (iPana). Approximate number of patients is 900: according to the database, the&#xD;
      incidence of severe PPH in our hospital is 130-160/year. General patient characteristics will&#xD;
      be recorded: age, weight, height, parity, gestational age, previous deliveries and cesarean&#xD;
      sections, chronic diseases, complications and medication during pregnancy. The mode of&#xD;
      delivery, labour characteristics (duration, interval between PROM and delivery,&#xD;
      chorioamnionitis), use of uterotonic agents and diagnoses of obstetric disease will be&#xD;
      recorded (e.g. placental abnormalities). Laboratory parameters during treatment of PPH will&#xD;
      be collected: a baseline aPTT, PT (INR), Fibrinogen concentration, ATIII, Hb, platelet count&#xD;
      and respective (lowest) values during treatment of PPH and blood gas analysis information,&#xD;
      especially lowest base excess and lactate and lowest ca-ion. Other possible factors affecting&#xD;
      hemostasis such as body temperature, hemodynamic parameters during resuscitation and surgical&#xD;
      treatment will be searched from medical records. Total amount of bleeding and allogeneic&#xD;
      blood products, fibrinogen concentrate, prothrombin complex concentrate, FXIII and&#xD;
      recombinant factor VII consumption will be recorded as primary end points. As secondary&#xD;
      endpoints, the number of emergency hysterectomies, intensive care admissions,&#xD;
      transfusion-related side effects and thromboembolic complications will be studied and&#xD;
      recorded up to 30 days after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' aim is to identify risk factors for severe PPH (ie. estimated blood loss&#xD;
      more than 1500ml during delivery) and examine the possible change in blood transfusion&#xD;
      strategies and its effect on bleeding (for example, implementation of massive transfusion&#xD;
      protocol, amount of blood products used, effect of red blood cell:fresh-frozen plasma ratio,&#xD;
      use of pharmacological agents for coagulation management, introduction of new angiological&#xD;
      and surgical techniques etc.) and complications, laboratory parameters and patient outcome.&#xD;
