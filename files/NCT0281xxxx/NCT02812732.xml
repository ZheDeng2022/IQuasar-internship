  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After completing over 600 interviews with parents, adolescents, and clinicians to determine&#xD;
      reasons why HPV vaccines are used or not used, the investigators recently piloted a&#xD;
      communication-based educational intervention with healthcare clinicians to improve&#xD;
      communication around HPV vaccination. The intervention combined education and quality&#xD;
      improvement methods using a mechanism called Performance Improvement Continuing Medical&#xD;
      Education. This type of intervention is attractive to clinicians because they improve their&#xD;
      cancer prevention practices while fulfilling requirements for maintaining board&#xD;
      certification. The intervention consists of seven education and feedback sessions along with&#xD;
      baseline and follow-up chart reviews and facilitated group discussions of clinician and&#xD;
      practice vaccination rates. The pilot intervention was effective: at the two pilot&#xD;
      intervention sites, girls were 60% and boys were 15 times more likely to receive HPV&#xD;
      vaccination than at control sites both during and after the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed research is to broadly test the intervention's effectiveness in a&#xD;
      diverse group of pediatric and family medicine practices serving low-income and minority&#xD;
      patients. First, the investigators will perform a randomized trial in five community health&#xD;
      centers to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. Second, the investigators will&#xD;
      examine what made the intervention successful and identify barriers to sustainability with&#xD;
      the goal of ensuring that the intervention can be successfully replicated in other settings.&#xD;
      Third, the investigators will explore the effects of the intervention on parent-clinician&#xD;
      communication by surveying parents and clinicians and observing clinical encounters when&#xD;
      vaccination is discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention represents an innovative and scalable model for promoting cancer&#xD;
      prevention and screening activities by clinicians. Unlike programs that increase&#xD;
      administrative burdens on busy clinicians, the proposed intervention allows clinicians to&#xD;
      improve cancer prevention practices while simultaneously fulfilling requirements to maintain&#xD;
      their board certification and improving the quality of cancer prevention care. It therefore&#xD;
      has great potential for widespread dissemination.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, and oral cancers, which&#xD;
      disproportionately affect low-income and minority populations. Universal HPV vaccination has&#xD;
      the potential to decrease burdens and to reduce disparities in these diseases. However, HPV&#xD;
      vaccination rates for U.S. adolescents remain low. Clinician recommendation is the most&#xD;
      important factor influencing HPV vaccine uptake; thus enhancing clinician communication about&#xD;
      HPV vaccines is a critically important target for interventions to prevent cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past six years, the investigators' research has identified factors affecting HPV&#xD;
      vaccine communication and utilization. the investigators recently piloted a communication&#xD;
      intervention with clinicians, and at the two pilot intervention sites, girls were 60% and&#xD;
      boys were 15 times more likely to receive HPV vaccination than at control sites both during&#xD;
      and after the intervention period. The investigators aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      this intervention in a randomized trial, and to directly examine its effects on&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To evaluate intervention effectiveness on raising HPV vaccination rates using a&#xD;
      stepped wedge randomized trial in federally qualified health centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To conduct a process evaluation that examines barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      intervention implementation and intervention sustainability, and to assess intervention&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To describe specific effects of the intervention on clinician-parent communication&#xD;
      about HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Aim 1, the investigators will perform a stepped wedge randomized trial in five&#xD;
      community health centers to determine the effectiveness of the intervention. The intervention&#xD;
      consists of a seven session Performance Improvement Continuing Medical Education (PI CME)&#xD;
      program that employs HPV education and training in motivational interviewing to improve&#xD;
      clinicians' HPV vaccine communication, and allows clinicians to improve the quality of&#xD;
      vaccine care while fulfilling board certification requirements. To address Aim 2, the&#xD;
      investigators will individually interview a selected group of providers and clinical leaders&#xD;
      using the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) model of&#xD;
      process evaluation, and will analyze audio recordings of clinical interactions to measure&#xD;
      intervention fidelity. Aim 3, an exploration of the intervention's effects on&#xD;
      parent-clinician communication, will be conducted by surveying parents and clinicians and&#xD;
      observing clinical encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CANCER RELEVANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rates of HPV related cancers have been increasing, but vaccination rates have remained&#xD;
      stagnant since 2011. Recognizing the potential impact of HPV vaccination, the President's&#xD;
      Cancer Panel stated in 2014 that raising HPV vaccination rates was a national priority. The&#xD;
      proposed intervention represents an innovative and scalable model for promoting cancer&#xD;
      prevention and screening activities by clinicians.&#xD;

    <description>The primary goals of the DOSE HPV intervention are to 1) change clinician HPV vaccine recommendations and responses to hesitant parents, and 2) support systems changes to improve the vaccination process. The first four sessions follow a standardized curriculum, while the last three sessions include development and implementation of tailored activities designed to meet individual practice needs.&#xD;
Sessions 1 and 2 generate motivation for the project through feedback of vaccination rates (Session 1) and education on HPV disease (Session 2). Brief Negotiated Interview (BNI) skills are taught in Sessions 3&amp;4. Action Plans are developed in Session 5. Sessions 6&amp;7, which follow a standard quality improvement format: plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles.</description>
