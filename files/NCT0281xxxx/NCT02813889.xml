  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop a SmarToyGym where sensitized, wireless toys are strategically hung&#xD;
      and placed within reach of infants to elicit toy-oriented body and arm/hand movements. Each&#xD;
      toy will be equipped with sensors capable of measuring the infant's grasping actions such as&#xD;
      squeezing, pinching, tilting, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A low-cost 3D motion capture system will be used to collect video data and the infants'&#xD;
      reaching and body kinematics in response to the toys. A pressure mat will be used to measure&#xD;
      postural changes to detect weight shifts, rolling, crawling and other movements away from the&#xD;
      initial posture. By capitalizing on these wireless and low-cost technologies, it will permit&#xD;
      the regular and non-invasive monitoring of infants, which can lead to detailed,&#xD;
      non-obtrusive, quantitative evaluation of motor development. In this vein, the investigators&#xD;
      also aim to conduct proof-of-concept testing of the SmarToyGym with atypical and typical&#xD;
      developing infants. The investigators will include infants' ages 3 to 11 months who are&#xD;
      categorized as high-risk or low-risk using the Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research is specifically designed to investigate the ability of a novel tool to&#xD;
      identify atypically developing infants from their typically developing peers. Twenty-four&#xD;
      infants will be recruited to participate, including 12 who are developing typically and 12&#xD;
      who are identified as at-risk for neuromotor delay. Infants with typical development will be&#xD;
      at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age, score in the low-risk category on the&#xD;
      Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS), score a greater than 85 on all sub-scales&#xD;
      of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-II), have no history of significant cardiac,&#xD;
      orthopedic, or neurological condition, and gestational age at least 37 weeks. Infants at risk&#xD;
      for neuromotor delay will be at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age (corrected for&#xD;
      preterm birth if applicable), score in the moderate or high risk categories on the BINS, and&#xD;
      score an 85 or less on the motor sub-scales of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development&#xD;
      (BSID-II). In an effort to decrease variability of the data, infants in each group will be&#xD;
      further stratified into an older group (8-10+ months) and a younger group (3-5 months).&#xD;
