  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to research the comparative effectiveness of two potential&#xD;
      models of health care to deliver preventive services and chronic care management to the&#xD;
      growing population of adult and pediatric survivors of childhood cancer. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that survivorship care delivered by a subject's primary care doctor after the&#xD;
      subject is empowered with individualized follow-up recommendations prepared by a cancer&#xD;
      survivor specialist is similar to care provided in a specialty survival clinic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although 80% of children with cancer will be cured of their primary disease, at least 70% of&#xD;
      survivors will develop chronic medical, neurocognitive, and/or emotional conditions as a&#xD;
      complication of their therapy. Most of these conditions are amenable to prevention and early&#xD;
      intervention. In response, the Institute of Medicine strongly advised that all cancer&#xD;
      patients should receive survivorship care with the following key elements: 1) a summary of&#xD;
      previous cancer therapy, 2) individualized life-long screening for potential adverse&#xD;
      therapy-related effects, and 3) education regarding desirable health behaviors. However, less&#xD;
      than 30% of survivors receive recommended care. There is a tremendous need for research that&#xD;
      addresses how to best implement evidence-based recommendations for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two main health care delivery models have been advocated for survivorship care, but no&#xD;
      comparison studies exist. The first model is a specialty survivor clinic, usually at a cancer&#xD;
      treatment center. The second model, termed the empowered primary care model, involves&#xD;
      patients receiving an individualized &quot;prescription&quot; for follow-up care prepared by a cancer&#xD;
      survivor specialist to be implemented by the primary care doctor. Each model poses unique&#xD;
      strengths and weaknesses. Specialty survivor clinics can be expensive and geographically&#xD;
      inaccessible, can cause anxiety and stress to patients, and can accommodate limited numbers&#xD;
      of patients. Primary care doctors may lack adequate expertise and time for these complex&#xD;
      patients. Unless we know how these approaches compare with regard to quality of care and&#xD;
      risks, advocates and policy makers will be stymied in their efforts to support the health&#xD;
      needs of cancer survivors. This study seeks to compare subjects randomized to the empowered&#xD;
      primary care model vs. a specialty survivor clinic.&#xD;
