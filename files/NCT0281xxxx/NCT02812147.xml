  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to determine whether treatment with L-&#xD;
      Dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS) versus placebo (an inactive substance that looks like study&#xD;
      drug) in addition to other Parkinson Disease (PD) drugs will improve balance, walking, and&#xD;
      reduce risk of falls and/or severity of falls in PD subjects. The study is also being done to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of L-DOPS, and whether it will decrease&#xD;
      Freezing of Gait (FOG), improve apathy (generalized disinterest) or show a relationship&#xD;
      between apathy and slowed movement and fall risk.&#xD;

      Among the top three priorities presented to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders&#xD;
      and Stroke (NINDS) Council 22 as final recommendations of critical needs for advancing&#xD;
      Parkinson Disease (PD) research in 2014 is to develop effective treatments for dopa-resistant&#xD;
      features of PD. These features include symptoms such as gait and balance problems, and&#xD;
      freezing of gait leading to falls. In order for these goals to be realized, dysfunctional&#xD;
      motor patterns in patients with gait and balance problems need to be accurately defined and&#xD;
      assessed using body-fixed sensors and other newer computation technology to enhance&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of measurement to facilitate long-term follow-up. The proposed&#xD;
      research will meet the challenge of determining appropriate intervention (L-DOPS) for&#xD;
      dopa-resistant features of PD in improving gait and posture using innovative quantitative&#xD;
      analyses derived from body-worn sensors. Injuries associated with fall incidences continue to&#xD;
      pose a significant burden to persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) both in terms of human&#xD;
      suffering and economic losses. Annual fall incidence rates range from 50-70% of patients with&#xD;
      PD. Recurrent falls especially, are a major cause of disability in PD. The resulting loss of&#xD;
      independence and treatment costs add substantially to the healthcare expenditures in PD which&#xD;
      was estimated to be $27 billion annually2. This number may rise substantially in the coming&#xD;
      decades as the entire US population ages. Any intervention that is cost effective at reducing&#xD;
      fall risk could have important benefits for patients and families, and for the entire&#xD;
      healthcare system. In this study, we will determine whether treatment with L-&#xD;
      Dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS, Northera) in addition to dopaminergic drugs will improve&#xD;
      postural stability and activity of daily living, and reduce fall risk and/or severity of&#xD;
      falls in PD patients.Falls, early in PD (within 5 years of diagnosis) probably arise from&#xD;
      slowed locomotion. Slowed locomotion is corrected by dopaminergic drugs, hence falls early in&#xD;
      PD are decreased by such drugs. Later in PD (5 or years after diagnosis) falls, recurrent&#xD;
      falls, occur despite such drugs. There is evidence that falls late in PD occur because of&#xD;
      impaired postural stability which does not respond to dopaminergic drugs or may be made worse&#xD;
      by such drugs. A single fall, although serious, may be only partly related or even unrelated&#xD;
      to PD. &quot;Serious fall&quot; is defined as: all four limbs hit the ground, the skull hits the&#xD;
      ground, or there is soft tissue or bone injury. However, some people with PD fall repeatedly.&#xD;
      In such patients the role of impaired postural stability was stressed. Although the&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying impaired postural stability are not well-known in patients with PD,&#xD;
      attention is focused on the noradrenergic system. L-DOPS, a drug that enhances norepinephrine&#xD;
      levels in the peripheral and central nervous systems, has been shown to moderate orthostatic&#xD;
      hypotension, and often improve some PD symptoms. There is evidence that mechanisms related to&#xD;
      norepinephrine centers in the basal forebrain and the locus ceruleus play a role in&#xD;
      maintaining postural stability in activities of daily living. They may play a role in&#xD;
      preventing or ameliorating falls and freezing of gait. FOG is a major problem in patients&#xD;
      with PD who fall. There is evidence that L-DOPS, by improving FOG, decreases risk of falls.&#xD;
      Additionally, evidence indicates that L-DOPS decreases falls independent of improving FOG.&#xD;
      Apathy, a major and disabling non-motor symptom of PD, may be related to decreased central&#xD;
      norepinephrine levels. Apathy may be associated with slowed movements and slowed movements&#xD;
      may contribute to falls. There is evidence that L-DOPS, by increasing central norepinephrine,&#xD;
      may improve apathy and this may result in a decreased risk of falls.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will be on levodopa/carbidopa, and may be on additional dopaminergic drugs including dopamine agonists and/or monoamine type B oxidase inhibitors or amantadine. L-dihydoxyphenylserine will be added, administered as an oral capsule 3 times a day for 4 months. Dosing will begin at 100 mg of L-DOPS three times per day and titrated upward, by 100 mg three times a day, as tolerated. Tolerability will be evaluated based upon questionnaires, patient interviews, vital signs and investigator examination. In order to participate in the study, all subjects must be able to tolerate a minimum tolerated dose of 400 mg three times per day (1200mg/day). Subject maximum dose will be 600 mg three times per day (1800mg/day). Patients will be maintained on this dose for 4 months (until the cross-over). After a 7-day washout, participants will cross over to the Placebo arm.</description>
