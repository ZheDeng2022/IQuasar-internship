  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal describes a pilot study to gather preliminary evidence of efficacy,&#xD;
      tolerability and toxicity of oral PLE among a high-risk skin cancer population for the&#xD;
      prevention of Actinic keratosis (AKs) and keratinocytes (KCs) to gain insight into optimal&#xD;
      methods for recruitment, intervention development, data collection, and promoting protocol&#xD;
      adherence prior to conducting a fully powered trial. The primary clinical outcome is AKs as&#xD;
      measured by a clinical dermatologist, with skin cancer as a secondary clinical outcome. The&#xD;
      investigators will also assess histologic markers of Ultra Violet (UV) damage, which have&#xD;
      previously been shown to be reduced with oral PLE use in human studies, namely formation of&#xD;
      UV-induced cyclo pyrimidine dimer positive cells and number of sunburn cells among epidermal&#xD;
      keratinocytes. Results generated from this proposal will form the foundation of a fully&#xD;
      powered clinical trial of the effect of PLE on the risk of AKs and KCs. The results may also&#xD;
      provide information about this promising dietary supplement which may provide extra&#xD;
      protection for a high-risk skin cancer population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polypodium leucotomos is a tropical fern, the extract of which has shown photoprotective&#xD;
      effects in animal and human models, and is currently available as an over-the-counter dietary&#xD;
      supplement. Polypodium leucotomos extract (PLE) has been shown in laboratory, animal, and&#xD;
      clinical studies to serve as a potent antioxidant that helps mitigate UV-induced damage by&#xD;
      scavenging free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Oral consumption of PLE in human&#xD;
      studies has been shown to significantly reduce the number if UV-induced sunburn cells and DNA&#xD;
      damage, and to inhibit photosensitization. Importantly, PLE appears to be exceptionally&#xD;
      well-tolerated with no serious reported adverse side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLE has been studied in numerous trials for many conditions, including skin diseases. Doses&#xD;
      up to 1200 mg per day have been used in clinical studies, though doses for prevention of&#xD;
      sun-damage are typically in the range of 480 mg per day. To date, no serious adverse effects&#xD;
      have been clearly attributed to the use of PLE (this high tolerability is one of the reasons&#xD;
      for the great interest in the clinical use of PLE). Oral consumption of other fern species,&#xD;
      such as Polypodium vulgare, have been associated with low blood pressure and increased heart&#xD;
      rate. On theoretical grounds, similar side effects may be possible with PLE.&#xD;
