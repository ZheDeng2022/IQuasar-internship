      The investigators intend to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing 3 methods of&#xD;
      induction of labor in term primiparous women with singleton. First group will be women&#xD;
      induced with Foley catheter and pitocin, second group Foley catheter and vaginal dinoprostone&#xD;
      and third group will be induced with vaginal dinoprostone alone. The investigators compare&#xD;
      time for induction to delivery and way of delivery.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Labor induction, an iatrogenic initiation of labor is one of the most common obstetric&#xD;
      procedures performed nowadays. The rate of induction of labor more than doubled from 1990&#xD;
      through 2010 from 9.6% to 23.8% in the United State alone. There are many methods to promote&#xD;
      labor induction, including mechanical and pharmacological methods that can be used alone or&#xD;
      in conjugation. Choosing the right method for the right patient can be challenging, and up&#xD;
      until now there is limited information regarding the most suitable and effective approach for&#xD;
      cervical ripening and labor induction. Out of the vast options for cervical ripening, the&#xD;
      Foley catheter and vaginal prostaglandins are frequently used. To date, few clinical trials&#xD;
      have compared the different methods to evaluate the effectiveness and the risk in each&#xD;
      method. Two randomized controlled trials compared the Foley catheter method with the vaginal&#xD;
      dinoprostone method. In one study, the Foley catheter was found to be superior to the vaginal&#xD;
      dinoprostone with regards to time to delivery, whereas in the other study no difference was&#xD;
      found. In an additional trial, Foley bulb with vaginal Misoprostol was compared to&#xD;
      Misoprostol alone. The first treatment resulted in a shorter time to delivery. These finding&#xD;
      did not correlate with previous trials that either found no difference or superiority to&#xD;
      Misoprostol alone. A recent study comparing Foley catheter with PGE2 in term oligohydramnios&#xD;
      pregnancies showed that time to delivery was shorter in the PGE2 group. A meta-analysis&#xD;
      comparing Misoprostol with dinoprostone showed that the first is more effective, but the&#xD;
      latter is safer. Since in some obstetrics conditions such as preeclampsia and Intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction (IUGR) an expeditious induction of labor may be needed, a combination of&#xD;
      methods may fasten the induction to delivery interval. A recent study presented as an oral&#xD;
      presentation at the society of maternal fetal medicine a month ago used a combination of&#xD;
      Foley catheter and prostaglandins to induce labor. They found that this arm had the shorter&#xD;
      induction to delivery time and had no serious side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, The investigators intend to compare the mechanical (Foley catheter combined&#xD;
      with Oxytocin) method, to a pharmacological one (dinoprostone-PGE2) and to a combination of&#xD;
      the two methods in cervical ripening in an unfavorable cervix. The investigators will also&#xD;
      examine if using the two methods in tandem will provide an additive effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 3 groups; in each group about 100 participants will be enrolled, which&#xD;
      will be suited to the including and excluding criteria. The investigators have about 200&#xD;
      inductions per year of primigravida women. The investigators expect to enroll 300&#xD;
      participants in about 2 years' time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On enrollment the patient will receive a number and will be assigned to one of the three&#xD;
      groups. All the participants will be assigned to a 20 minute reassuring monitor before&#xD;
      insertion the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A perineal US will be performed before the intervention to evaluate Angle of progression&#xD;
      (AOP), cervical length and head position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Foley and Oxytocin protocol The patient will lie in a lithotomy position and will be&#xD;
      covered by sterile sheets. A direct visualization of the cervix will be achieved with sterile&#xD;
      speculum, the cervix will be sterilized with iodine, if the patient is allergic to iodine&#xD;
      &quot;septal- scrub&quot; will be used. The Foley will be inserted through the internal cervical os,&#xD;
      filled with 80 ml of normal saline, and taped to the patient thigh with gentle traction. An&#xD;
      hour after placing the Foley bulb, monitor will be performed. If less than 3 contractions per&#xD;
      10 min interval appears in the monitor the patient will be transferred to the delivery room&#xD;
      and Oxytocin will be administrated. If 3 contraction or more appear in 10 min. interval,&#xD;
      further intervention will be personalized according to medical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Foley catheter will be removed if any of the following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expulsion&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Non reassuring fetal heart rate, NRFHR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tachysystole&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. spontaneous rupture of membranes, SROM&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. If 24 12 hours elapsed since placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foley with dinoprostone protocol. First the Foley bulb will be placed as instructed above. An&#xD;
      hour after placing the Foley bulb, a monitor will be performed. If less than 3 contractions&#xD;
      per 10 min. interval appears in the monitor a propess tape will be placed in the posterior&#xD;
      fornix. The patient will be left recumbent for 30 minutes. One hour after placing the&#xD;
      dinoprostone, fetal monitor will be performed. If less than 3 contractions per 10 min&#xD;
      interval appears in the monitor the patient will be remained for observation and a monitor&#xD;
      will be performed every 6 hours. If after placing the Foley bulb 3 contractions or more&#xD;
      appear in 10 minutes interval the patient will be excluded from the research and further&#xD;
      intervention will be personalized according to medical decision&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 Dinoprostone protocol Dinoprostone will be removed from the freezer in direct&#xD;
      connection with insertion. The patient will lie in a lithotomy position. Dinoprostone will be&#xD;
      inserted to the posterior vaginal fornix using small amount of water soluble lubricant&#xD;
      according to the manufactory protocol. The reminding of the tap will be inserted to the&#xD;
      vagina. The patient will be left recumbent for 30 minutes. An hour after placing the&#xD;
      dinoprostone, fetal monitor will be performed and then every 6 hours. If less than 3&#xD;
      contractions per 10 min interval appears in the monitor the patient will be transferred for&#xD;
      observation and a monitor will be performed every 6 hours. If 3 contraction or more appear in&#xD;
      10 min. interval the patient will be examined and in dilatation of 3 cm or more will be&#xD;
      transferred to the delivery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dinoprostone will be removed if any of the following will occur:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NRFHR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tachysystole&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SROM&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If 24 hours elapsed since placement In all the groups, if after 24 hours since the start&#xD;
           of the study, the bishop score will be still less than 6 and active labor will not&#xD;
           initiate the same method (study arm) will be repeated. If after the second try the&#xD;
           cervix is still unripe the patient will be defined as failed induction.&#xD;
