      The purpose of this study is to confirm the utility for hypnosis in the coronary angiographic&#xD;
      examination. The technique would be an alternative to prevent the consumption of anesthesic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The coronary angiography is a medical imaging acquisition used in cardiology to highlight the&#xD;
      coronary arteries after a coronary disease suspicion. According to an expert consensus it is&#xD;
      performed under local anesthesia. Indeed the examination is quite painless, apart from the&#xD;
      initial arterial puncture. Moreover, any patient chest pain must be detected during the&#xD;
      examination to locate the guilty coronary injury. This is not possible with a patient under&#xD;
      general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But, no general anesthesia may be a source of anxiety for patients, and the technique can be&#xD;
      painful at several times: during the puncture, the exploration of probe into the winding,&#xD;
      spastic or over-calcified arteries, or even during the dilation by the balloon swelling which&#xD;
      obstructs downstream the artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficiency evaluation of the hypnosis made by INSERM in 2015 concludes that &quot;the use of&#xD;
      hypnosis during a surgical practice or during a medical or a interventional radiological act&#xD;
      allows to reduce the consumption of sedative drugs and/or pain medication preoperatively&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis, is that hypnosis can contribute to a decreasing of anxiety and the pain&#xD;
      for patients undergoing coronary angiography, and even a decreasing of complications due to a&#xD;
      better control of hemodynamic (heart rate and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could entail a better comfort for operator during the coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the initial anxiety state before the coronary angiographic performing scheduled&#xD;
      for adults with no earlier coronary angiography, according to they will undergo a hypnotic&#xD;
      session or not before the examination, with posthypnotic suggestions of self-hypnosis to make&#xD;
      during the coronary angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between the two groups of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pain during and after the coronary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic factors heart rate, blood pressure before and after the examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  operator comfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  use of sedative drugs, pain medication and local anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  outbreak of major and minor complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety measured using self-report questionnaire (STAI-Y-A ), before coronary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trait anxiety (STAI-Y-B questionnaire) State anxiety the eve of coronary angiography Pain&#xD;
      before and during the coronary angiography : Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure before and after the coronary angiography Comfort for the operator of the&#xD;
      angiography : Likert scale into 5 points (1 : the worst comfort, 5 : the best possible&#xD;
      comfort) Dose of sedative drugs, pain medication and local anesthesia injected during the&#xD;
      coronary angiography Outbreak of major complications during the coronary angiography (death,&#xD;
      stroke, tamponade, hemorrhagic shock, anaphylactic shock against the imaging tracer,&#xD;
      ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, severe bradycardia) or minor&#xD;
      complications (vagal reaction, hematoma at the puncture point, skin allergy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficiency comparative study, randomized, simple-blind (angiography operator in blind),&#xD;
      single center, routine clinical care Only one medical check per patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a patient is taken over in cardiology department the eve of a scheduled coronary&#xD;
      angiography, the cardiologist purposes them to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If they accept, a first evaluation of anxiety (trait and state) is performed. The following&#xD;
      day, before going to the coronary angiography room, the patients are splitted randomly into&#xD;
      two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A group of patients which undergo a hypnotic session before examination with&#xD;
           posthypnotic suggestions of self-hypnosis to be performed during the angiography. A&#xD;
           medical prescription for anxiolytics can be made according to the patient clinical signs&#xD;
           of anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Another group becomes only a prescription of anxiolytics according to the patient&#xD;
           clinical signs of anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The State Anxiety is measured after the setting of the patient in the coronary angiography&#xD;
      room, before performing the examination. The pain and the hemodynamic factors are measured&#xD;
      during and after the coronary angiography. The comfort of operator is evaluated too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be contacted by phone one month after the coronary angiography to evaluate&#xD;
      their satisfaction with their medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients number :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that the control group has a mean score of 50 (standard deviation 10) with STAI-Y A,&#xD;
      and a clinically significant difference (from 5 points), 85 patients must be included in each&#xD;
      group, so totally 170 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Duration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected study start: first semester of 2016 Inclusion duration: 12 months Duration per&#xD;
      patient: 1 mois Total study duration: 18 months (including the data analysis et the report of&#xD;
      results)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: comparison of the mean scores STAI-Y A between the two groups (T test&#xD;
           of Student), with adjustment on the potential factors of confusion (multiple linear&#xD;
           regression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: comparison of the quantitative criteria (T tests of Student) and&#xD;
           qualitative criteria (Fischer's exact test) between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Benefits :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since coronary angiography is an invasive procedure without general anesthesia affecting a&#xD;
      noble organ, this procedure could be anxiogenic and even psychologically traumatic emergency.&#xD;
      Not practice under general anesthesia prevents potential risks for the patient, but anxiety,&#xD;
      non-comfort and pain are existing. We think that hypnosis could improve the patient care&#xD;
      psychologically and physically and for any invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this case, fewer or no sedative drugs and pain medication will be necessary, and it would&#xD;
      decrease their potential iatrogenesis, the patient care will be improved. It will be an&#xD;
      alternative for patient to decrease their drugs consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance Plan :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be recorded in a Paper Case Report from medical records. The patients will undergo&#xD;
      only one medical examination for the study. No follow-up is expected.&#xD;
