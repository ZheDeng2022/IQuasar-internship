  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to support the regulatory application of OneTouch Select® Plus test strips in&#xD;
      China. The blood glucose test strip is regulated as an In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) product and&#xD;
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) regulation of IVDs should be complied with. The&#xD;
      result of this study will be used to support regulatory filing in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OneTouch Select® Plus test strips (test with OneTouch Select® Plus glucose meter)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess Lay User and Health Care Professional (HCP) fingertip test results obtained on&#xD;
           OneTouch Select® Plus BGMS compared to a validated method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer&#xD;
           results), according to International Standards Organization( ISO) 15197:2003(E) section&#xD;
           8.0 and ISO 15197:2013(E)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lay User System Use evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effectiveness of the instructions for use of OneTouch Select® Plus BGMS&#xD;
           (Owner's booklet) and insert of test strips for the lay user.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator(control) Product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      YSI 2300 glucose analyser&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      User Performance of the OneTouch Select® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring system(described as&#xD;
      OneTouch Select Plus below) is met if the lay user and HCP results obtained with OneTouch&#xD;
      Select Plus meet the requirement stated in section 7.4.1 of ISO () 15197:2003(E). Further to&#xD;
      meet the requirements of ISO 15197:2013(E) , the lay user results obtained with OneTouch&#xD;
      Select Plus should meet the requirements stated in section 8.2 of ISO 15197:2013(E). The&#xD;
      effectiveness of instructions for use is met , if for each item on the Instructions for Use&#xD;
      Questionnaire, the 90% lower confidence limit (90% LCL) for the correct response rate is&#xD;
      equal to or greater than 70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and subject population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is an open, non-randomized clinical evaluation and will be conducted at a minimum&#xD;
      of 2 sites in China. At least 240 evaluable diabetic subjects who meet the enrolment criteria&#xD;
      will participate in this evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each potential Subject (or legally authorized representative) reads and signs the&#xD;
           Informed Consent Form, and receives a signed copy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After completing an in-clinic familiarization session, the Subject lances a fingertip,&#xD;
           obtains a drop of blood large enough for two meter tests, and performs a self-test using&#xD;
           OneTouch Select Plus BGMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study staff immediately performs a blood glucose test from the same blood drop with a&#xD;
           second set of OneTouch Select Plus BGMS with the same lot of test strips.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Within 5 minutes of the Subject's self-lancing, study staff collects blood from the same&#xD;
           finger puncture for hematocrit and reference plasma glucose testing (duplicate tests on&#xD;
           the YSI 2300 performed by study staff).&#xD;
