  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major health problem and its diagnosis remains a challenge&#xD;
      for the emergency physician. The management of a suspected ACS is well codified, based on&#xD;
      troponin assays, renewed if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, the criteria leading to initiate a diagnostic procedure in chest pain to the&#xD;
      Emergency department are unclear. The fear is, firstly, to miss a potentially life treating&#xD;
      diagnosis and, secondly, exposing many patients to unnecessary examinations. The advent of&#xD;
      highly sensitive troponin assays also increases the risk of over-investigation by a larger&#xD;
      number of elevations of the biomarker in non-coronary circumstances leading to a prolongation&#xD;
      of hospitalization and, possibly, unnecessary treatments and invasive investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CARE rule could help to streamline this first step. It is established by assigning a value&#xD;
      from 0 to 2 to the items: Characteristic of pain, Age, Risk factors and ECG. The search for&#xD;
      an ACS is not justified if the sum of points is ≤1 (negative rule) and, conversely, a&#xD;
      troponin should be performed if the sum is &gt; 1 (positive rule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, CARE rule corresponds to the first 4 items of the HEART score (the latter standing&#xD;
      for troponin at admission) whose reliability has been demonstrated, a ≤3 income excluding ACS&#xD;
      with a risk of false negatives &lt;2%. A negative CARE rule always corresponds to a HEART score&#xD;
      ≤3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study aims to confirm the interest of CARE rule to streamline the search for an ACS in&#xD;
      chest pain as an observational European multicenter prospective study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CARE rule was evaluated in a prospective study of routine care on 641 patients among which&#xD;
      9.8% had a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). 200 patients (31%) had a negative rule and&#xD;
      none showed MACE during the 45-day follow-up (0% [0-1.9]). Among these 200 patients, 119 had&#xD;
      a standard troponin assay, a single dosage was increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to demonstrate the reliability of CARE rule to exclude ACS in chest&#xD;
      pain, using an observational Franco-Belgian multicenter study in routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the reliability of CARE rule is confirmed in Emergency departments, it could be evaluated&#xD;
      to be used in other circumstances such as in pre-hospital or in private practice for the&#xD;
      general practitioner or cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the ICARE study is intended to allow a rationalization of the management of&#xD;
      patients with chest pain, limiting the use of unnecessary investigations while ensuring the&#xD;
      safety of care.&#xD;

    <measure>The failure rate of the diagnostic strategy will be evaluated by the rate of MACE recorded in the course of the phone call follow-up at 45 days of patient's inclusion in the group of patients with negative CARE rule.</measure>

    <description>This rate is a composite criterion including myocardial infarction, percutaneaous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting or sudden death for which a cardiac cause cannot be excluded.
