  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been explored as a possible&#xD;
      therapeutic agent that reduces the excitatory (glutamate) - inhibitory (gamma amino-butyric&#xD;
      acid, GABA) imbalance in autism pathology and improves social and communication deficits.&#xD;
      While some studies have shown positive results, a large clinical trial failed to show benefit&#xD;
      possibly because different subsets of autism responded differently to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator proposes a pilot, exploratory, clinical follow-on study using proton&#xD;
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to determine whether baseline glutamate/GABA levels&#xD;
      in certain regions of the brain may help predict treatment response to Memantine in autistic&#xD;
      subjects. At study onset, subjects will be assessed on the behavioral scales such as the&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Clinical Global Impressions scale, followed by MRS imaging.&#xD;
      Memantine treatment will be started post imaging. Assessment measures will be repeated at&#xD;
      week 12 during treatment. Glutamate and GABA levels in brain regions will be correlated to&#xD;
      improvements on assessment measures. Expected results include higher glutamate and/or lower&#xD;
      GABA levels in the anterior cingulate cortex at baseline in responders to memantine. If the&#xD;
      hypotheses are confirmed, it will provide evidence of a relevant neural biomarker to predict&#xD;
      treatment response to memantine with important implications for clinical care including&#xD;
      improving individualization of treatments.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined complex neurodevelopmental disorder&#xD;
      characterized by early childhood onset of marked deficiencies in social and communication&#xD;
      skills and presence of restrictive, repetitive behaviors. Its phenotypic heterogeneity makes&#xD;
      studying ASD and its treatment a challenging task. Currently, only two FDA approved drugs,&#xD;
      risperidone and aripiprazole, are available to treat ASD that manage irritability associated&#xD;
      with the disorder. None have shown conclusive benefit for core features of social and&#xD;
      communication deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research indicates that a disrupted balance between excitation (glutamate) and inhibition&#xD;
      (gamma amino-butyric acid, GABA) is likely to be one of the underlying mechanisms of ASD.&#xD;
      This hypothesis is supported by a number of magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies that&#xD;
      report an excess of glutamatergic excitation and/or a reduction in GABAergic inhibition&#xD;
      observed in different brain regions including the limbic system and the anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex. Similar findings have also been reported in post mortem studies of the ASD&#xD;
      brain.Thus, it is expected that drugs targeting this imbalance could be beneficial. For&#xD;
      example, the GABAB agonist, arbaclofen, was tested in ASD for this reason and showed&#xD;
      promising results but a large trial failed to show improvement on the primary endpoints of&#xD;
      lethargy and social withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memantine, a moderate affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is known to&#xD;
      improve communication in patients with Alzheimer's disease and is an FDA approved treatment&#xD;
      for that disease. Examination of the efficacy of memantine in treating ASD has also been&#xD;
      driven by the excitatory (glutamate) - inhibitory (gamma amino-butyric acid, GABA) imbalance&#xD;
      hypothesis of ASD pathology. Memantine binds to the glutamatergic NMDA receptors and&#xD;
      attenuates glutamatergic excitation. This reduction in excessive glutamatergic activation is&#xD;
      thought to decrease the &quot;noise&quot; in the neural network system and facilitate learning and&#xD;
      memory. A few small studies have shown effectiveness for memantine in the treatment of social&#xD;
      and communication aspects of ASD spectrum disorder (ASD) as well. However, one large clinical&#xD;
      trial using memantine in ASD reported a failure to respond. These discrepancies in results&#xD;
      could possibly be due to the heterogeneity in the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance between ASD&#xD;
      patients thereby causing a variation in response. In such a scenario, having a biomarker to&#xD;
      predict an individual's treatment response would be invaluable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR Spectroscopy is a non-invasive tool used to examine the biochemical profile of brain&#xD;
      tissue associated with different psychiatric and neurological conditions including ASD.&#xD;
      Specifically, 1H-MRS studies in ASD demonstrated the excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in&#xD;
      various cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, a finding also reported in post mortem&#xD;
      brain tissue studies. The use of this technique to determine if Glutamate/GABA concentrations&#xD;
      in certain regions of the brain can predict response to treatment with memantine would be an&#xD;
      innovative breakthrough in providing more effective individualized treatment for patients&#xD;
      since very little research has been done to explore this possibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar approach has been adopted in a recent ongoing study that uses proton MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy to map changes in glutamate and GABA following use of riluzole in ASD. Riluzole&#xD;
      is a drug commonly used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is a glutamate antagonist&#xD;
      that works by blocking presynaptic glutamate release and noncompetitive inhibition of NMDA&#xD;
      receptors. However, riluzole is not clinically used in the treatment of ASD. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, only one study so far (apart from the ongoing study mentioned) has examined the&#xD;
      effects of riluzole in ASD, but as an adjunct to risperidone. The primary outcomes of the&#xD;
      Ghaleiha et al. study were irritability and repetitive motor behaviors and not core social&#xD;
      and communication deficits as in the present proposal. The purpose of riluzole in this MR&#xD;
      spectroscopy study is a proof of principle for its effects on spectroscopy based on its&#xD;
      glutamate antagonistic effects. By contrast, memantine, which will be studied in the present&#xD;
      proposal, has some documented evidence from small studies of being beneficial in treating&#xD;
      social and communication deficits associated with ASD in clinical settings, despite the&#xD;
      failure of the larger trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's lab has previously utilized MR spectroscopy techniques to map these&#xD;
      different compounds in a group of 14 subjects with ASD and identify glutamate and GABA&#xD;
      alterations in the cerebellum, discovering a relationship to cerebrocerebellar connectivity&#xD;
      and behavioral outcomes in individuals with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: The investigator proposes a pilot, exploratory, clinical follow-on study&#xD;
      using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to examine whether the following&#xD;
      measures can be used to predict treatment response to memantine in ASD:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Glx and/or GABA and the Glx/GABA ratio in the anterior cingulate cortex,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Glx levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Markers of neuronal integrity, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), myo-inositol, choline and&#xD;
           creatine/phosphocreatine levels in the anterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
           cortex and cerebellum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To examine whether resting state functional connectivity between the&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate and the cerebellum, holds predictive value&#xD;
      for treatment response to memantine in ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum have been&#xD;
      have been chosen as regions of interest (ROIs) due to known atypical glutamate and GABAergic&#xD;
      profiles in these regions associated with ASD. The approach of limiting to selected ROIs has&#xD;
      been adopted in order to ensure patient comfort during the imaging process by reducing the&#xD;
      time spent in the scanner. Since altered levels for markers of neuronal integrity, such as&#xD;
      NAA, choline, creatine/phosphocreatine and myoinositol have also been reported in ASD, we&#xD;
      will be mapping these biochemicals as well in order to explore their effect on treatment&#xD;
      response. Resting state functional connectivity will also be analyzed for possible&#xD;
      association with treatment outcome prediction since as mentioned before, a previous study&#xD;
      from the investigator's has shown a link between alterations in resting state&#xD;
      cerebrocerebellar connectivity, excitatory-inhibitory ratio in the cerebellum and behavioral&#xD;
      outcome in ASD using MR spectroscopy.&#xD;
