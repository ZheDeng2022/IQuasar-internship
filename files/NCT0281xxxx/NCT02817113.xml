  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NC-6004 is a polymeric micelle containing cisplatin as an active moiety. The nanoparticle&#xD;
      provides sustained release of the active moiety and utilizes the enhanced permeability and&#xD;
      retention (EPR) effect to target release of platinum to tumors. This Phase I study aims to&#xD;
      establish a recommended dose (RD) for the triplet combination of NC-6004 plus 5-FU and&#xD;
      cetuximab as first-line treatment in patient with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma of the head and neck for further clinical study development.&#xD;

      1. Primary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           ♦ To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of NC-6004 according to the Dose&#xD;
           Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in combination with 5-FU plus cetuximab as firstline treatment&#xD;
           in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and&#xD;
           neck (SCCHN), and to decide the RD for the following studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives 1). To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of NC-6004 in&#xD;
           combination with 5- FU plus cetuximab 2). To assess the pharmacokinetic effects of&#xD;
           NC-6004 3). To assess the antitumor effects of NC-6004&#xD;
