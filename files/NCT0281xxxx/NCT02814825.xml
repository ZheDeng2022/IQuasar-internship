    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market study is to collect data on ViviGen and how its use affects&#xD;
      fusion rates in the cervical spine when used as additional grafting material to fill the&#xD;
      cervical spacer. The patient population of interest is patients who have already elected to&#xD;
      undergo a 2-3 level ACDF surgical procedure using ViviGen, per standard of care.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates who satisfy ALL of the following inclusion criteria and consent to participate&#xD;
        in the study may be considered eligible for enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosed by the investigator with at least one (1) of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Symptomatic cervical spondylosis;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Degenerative disc disease (DDD), defined as discogenic pain with degeneration of&#xD;
                  the disc confirmed by history and imaging studies;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who are candidates and have already elected to undergo contiguous two or&#xD;
             three-level ACDF surgery between C2-C7 of the cervical spine&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Skeletally mature adults between 21 and 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand the purpose&#xD;
             of the study and are willing to return for all the required post-operative standard of&#xD;
             care follow-up visits and have their data collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Candidates who meet ANY of the following exclusion criteria are not considered eligible for&#xD;
        study participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Posterior instrumentation necessary at same levels being treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Instability associated with major reconstructive surgery for primary tumors or&#xD;
             metastatic malignant tumors of the cervical spine&#xD;

             equal to 2.5 SD below the mean for a young, healthy adult) that may prevent adequate&#xD;
             fixation of screws and thus preclude the use of a cervical plate system&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who have a known or suspected allergy to any of the following antibiotics&#xD;
             and/or reagents: Gentamicin Sulfate, Meropenem, Vancomycin, Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO),&#xD;
             and Human Serum Albumin (HSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Immune compromised subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pre-existing neurological abnormalities other than deficits produced by the spinal&#xD;
             fusion (e.g. MS, Parkinson's, CVA, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Conditions that could preclude the possibility of fusion in the Investigator's opinion&#xD;
             (e.g. cancer, kidney dialysis, smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, osteopenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of pre-operative dysphagia&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Symptomatic shoulder pathologies under active treatment&#xD;

             that would compromise their participation and follow-up in this clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
             Intraoperative exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Intraoperative decision by the surgeon to use implants not compatible or cleared for&#xD;
             use with ViviGen&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Intraoperative decision by the surgeon to use other bone grafts substitutes such as&#xD;
             DBM or rhBMP&#xD;
