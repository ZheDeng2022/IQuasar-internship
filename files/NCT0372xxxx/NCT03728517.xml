  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Managing pain in postoperative patients presents challenges in striking a balance between&#xD;
      achieving adequate pain control and over-prescribing opioids that have the potential to&#xD;
      contribute to the opioid epidemic. There are no clear guidelines informing postoperative&#xD;
      opioid prescribing in obstetrics and gynecology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim for this study are to better understand the factors that impact opioid use&#xD;
      for pain management in gynecologic surgery patient after discharge. The second aim is to&#xD;
      develop a model that incorporates individual patient baseline measures (e.g. anxiety,&#xD;
      fibromyalgia score, inpatient narcotic consumption) to predict the amount of opioids needed&#xD;
      following discharge.&#xD;

      Managing pain in postoperative patients presents challenges in striking a balance between&#xD;
      achieving adequate pain control and over-prescribing opioids that have the potential to&#xD;
      contribute to the opioid epidemic. There are no clear guidelines informing postoperative&#xD;
      opioid prescribing in obstetrics and gynecology. A recent study by As-Sanie et al.&#xD;
      demonstrated that gynecologists at a large academic medical center prescribe twice the amount&#xD;
      of opioids than the average patient uses after hysterectomy.1 Similarly, a study completed at&#xD;
      Vanderbilt University Medical Center showed that obstetricians were overprescribing narcotics&#xD;
      to patients after cesarean deliveries.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to rates of opioid prescribing, other factors affect postoperative opioid&#xD;
      consumption, including individual patient measures of anxiety, depression, and self-reported&#xD;
      pain scores prior to surgery. Preoperative Fibromyalgia symptom scores, STAIT state anxiety&#xD;
      scores and NRS pain expectations are independent predictors for morphine consumption&#xD;
      following hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a pressing need to better understand the factors that impact opioid use in women who&#xD;
      undergo gynecologic surgery in order to mitigate the over-use of opioids for pain control&#xD;
      upon discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Understand the factors that impact opioid use for pain management in gynecologic surgery&#xD;
           patients after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Is opioid consumption during the immediate postoperative recovery phase associated&#xD;
                with consumption after discharge?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Are variables that are known to be associated with opioid consumption, also&#xD;
                associated with opioid consumption after discharge?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Are there factors which we can use to predict opioid consumption in postoperative&#xD;
                patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop a model that incorporates individual patient baseline measures (e.g. anxiety,&#xD;
           fibromyalgia score, inpatient narcotic consumption) to predict the amount of opioids&#xD;
           needed following discharge.&#xD;
