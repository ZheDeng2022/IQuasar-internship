  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pinometostat and how well it&#xD;
      works with standard chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia and a type of genetic mutation called MLL gene rearrangement. Pinometostat may stop&#xD;
      the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used&#xD;
      in standard chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin hydrochloride and cytarabine, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pinometostat with standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine a safe and tolerable schedule of pinometostat continuous intravenous infusion in&#xD;
      combination with daunorubicin hydrochloride (daunorubicin) and cytarabine in patients with&#xD;
      untreated, newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring MLL rearrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the rate of complete remission (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete&#xD;
      hematologic recovery [CRi]) in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia harboring&#xD;
      MLL rearrangement after treatment with pinometostat in combination with daunorubicin and&#xD;
      cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Estimate biologic activity of 7 day window&#xD;
      treatment of pinometostat monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate the toxicity profile of pinometostat alone (week 1) and in combination with&#xD;
      daunorubicin and cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Estimate event free and overall survival of patients with MLL rearranged acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia after combination treatment with pinometostat, daunorubicin, and cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Estimate the early death rate (death =&lt; 30 days) of pinometostat, daunorubicin, and&#xD;
      cytarabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity by clinical flow&#xD;
      cytometry on post-treatment recovery bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of pinometostat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pinometostat intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-35, daunorubicin&#xD;
      hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 8-10 and cytarabine IV continuously on days 8-14&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not achieve CR/CRi after treatment receive pinometostat6 IV continuously on&#xD;
      days 1-28, daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1 and 2 and cytarabine IV&#xD;
      continuously on days 1-5 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 1 year, then every&#xD;
      3 months for up to 4 years.&#xD;

             disease-related restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of pinometostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because other small molecule inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used&#xD;
             in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry for the duration of study participation, and for 4&#xD;
             weeks after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate barrier contraception prior to the study, for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days after completion of pinometostat&#xD;
             administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
             or, for patients with impaired decision-making capacity, the consent of a close legal&#xD;
             guardian who is readily available&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia with t(15;17)(q22;q12) and/or PML-RARA molecular&#xD;
             rearrangement, or other atypical RARA translocation partner&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy for AML, excluding hydroxyurea for count&#xD;
             control, or ATRA for APML that was initially suspected but later ruled out&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any prior investigational agent for acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a cumulative lifetime exposure (prior to study entry) of greater&#xD;
             than 300 mg/m^2 doxorubicin equivalent anthracycline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received chest radiation (unless organ-sparing) and who have a&#xD;
             cumulative lifetime exposure (prior to study entry) of greater than 240 mg/m^2&#xD;
             doxorubicin equivalent anthracycline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
             (i.e., have residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of alopecia, or&#xD;
             peripheral neuropathy (up to grade 2 is permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to pinometostat or other agents used in study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or&#xD;
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible unless the offending medication can be safely&#xD;
             stopped prior to enrollment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference.&#xD;
             As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled&#xD;
             on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need&#xD;
             to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or&#xD;
             herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring antibiotics (with exception), symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable cardiac arrhythmia not controllable with&#xD;
             medications, electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients receiving an&#xD;
             anti-microbial agent may be eligible if the patient remains afebrile and&#xD;
             hemodynamically stable for 72 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pinometostat is a small molecule&#xD;
             inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there&#xD;
             is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with pinometostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with pinometostat. These potential risks may also apply to other&#xD;
             agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with known symptomatic leukemia of the central nervous system including&#xD;
             leptomeningeal leukemic involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active other malignancy that limits survival to less than 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ongoing viral or drug induced liver injury, including active chronic hepatitis C virus&#xD;
             (HCV), chronic active hepatitis B, clinically known alcoholic liver disease,&#xD;
             non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, primary biliary&#xD;
             cirrhosis, other cirrhosis of the liver, history of hepatic encephalopathy, or portal&#xD;
             hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other prior condition that could, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise&#xD;
             patient safety or evaluation of the primary outcome&#xD;
