    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of ALRN-6924 when given together&#xD;
      with paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places in&#xD;
      the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ALRN-6924 and&#xD;
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924 (ALRN-6924) in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients&#xD;
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors with wild-type (WT) TP53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in&#xD;
      patients with advanced or metastatic WT TP53 solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of ALRN-6924 in combination with paclitaxel in solid&#xD;
      tumors (in dose escalation) and hormone-receptor positive breast cancer (in expansion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel in plasma following single&#xD;
      and multiple intravenous (IV) infusions (cycle 1 day 1, day [D]2, D15 and cycle 2 D1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess predictive and pharmacodynamic (PD) markers of response. II. Assess the effects of&#xD;
      ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell proliferation and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the effects of ALRN-6924 and paclitaxel on cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      (cfDNA) dynamics and macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and MDM2/MDMX inhibitor ALRN-6924&#xD;
      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year and&#xD;
      then every 3 months thereafter.&#xD;
