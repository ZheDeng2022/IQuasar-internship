  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study of the proposed randomized trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      automated mobile phone text message-based intervention in improving lifestyle modification,&#xD;
      medication adherence and CVD risk factors (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C], systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure [SBP], and LDL-cholesterol) over 12 months among patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with diabetes have multiple risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, and&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, or with arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The purpose of the&#xD;
      study of the proposed randomized trial will examine the effect of health text messages in&#xD;
      improving lifestyle modification, medication adherence and CVD risk factors (glycated&#xD;
      hemoglobin [HbA1C], systolic blood pressure [SBP], and LDL-cholesterol) over 12 months among&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes. This study is a multicenter prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. The eligible participants will be randomly allocated into&#xD;
      intervention and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group will receive text&#xD;
      messages in addition to usual care for 12 months, while the control group will receive usual&#xD;
      care. The messages will target lifestyle recommendation, glucose control, blood pressure&#xD;
      control, healthy eating, medication adherence, physical activity and smoking cessation. Each&#xD;
      message will be sent on 6 of 7 randomly selected weekdays and arrived at random times the day&#xD;
      during working hours. The primary outcome is the combined changes in HbA1C, SBP and&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol levels, simultaneous modeled using a scaled marginal model. The Secondary&#xD;
      outcome includes the net change of CVD risk factors (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1C], systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure [SBP], and LDL-cholesterol), and the proportion of participants with HbA1C &lt;7%&#xD;
      (&lt;7.5% if with clinical CVD), BP&lt;140/90 mm Hg, and LDL-cholesterol &lt;100 mg/dL, and net change&#xD;
      in estimated 10-year risk of CHD and CVD. The primary outcome and secondary outcome will be&#xD;
      measured at month 3, 6, and 12 visits.&#xD;
