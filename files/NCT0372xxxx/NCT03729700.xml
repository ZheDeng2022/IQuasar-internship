  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator hypothesizes that regular consumption of almonds will 1) improve the facial&#xD;
      wrinkle severity in post-menopausal women, 2) improve the evenness of facial skin&#xD;
      pigmentation, 3) diversify the gut microbiome and increase the short chain fatty acids in the&#xD;
      blood, and 4) improve the skin barrier biophysical properties.&#xD;

      This study will be a 24 week supplementation study that utilizes two study groups: 1) control&#xD;
      group and 2) almond supplementation: 20% energy intake. This will be a randomized,&#xD;
      rater-blinded, and controlled study. There will be a total of 60 subjects, with 30 assigned&#xD;
      to the control group and 30 assigned to almond supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited from the UC Davis Dermatology Clinic, UC Davis Main campus,&#xD;
      California State University- Sacramento, and from the surrounding community physicians and&#xD;
      the community in a 100 mile radius. The greater Sacramento area has a population of over 2&#xD;
      million to draw from and recruitment will be conducted through the use of Social Media and&#xD;
      flyer based recruitment. Postmenopausal women have previous been recruited successfully in a&#xD;
      previous study. The study visits will be performed at the UC Davis Dermatology Clinic located&#xD;
      at 3301 C Street, Suite 1400, Sacramento, CA 95816.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will collect medical history and current medications from study participants-&#xD;
      this is outlined in the HIPAA form. The two intervention groups will consist of those&#xD;
      receiving almonds and those that are receiving a calorie matched snack. The almond dose will&#xD;
      be provided as 20% of total energy (20% E) in the diet. This dose was selected based on a&#xD;
      previous randomized trial examining lipid parameters in response to 0, 10%, and 20% E as&#xD;
      dietary almonds and a recent meta-analysis of intervention trials of tree nuts [5, 6]. The&#xD;
      control snack will be a typical western diet snack (see Table 1) . The calorie matched snacks&#xD;
      are commercially available prepackaged snack items that will be purchased from Costco. Once a&#xD;
      subject has met inclusion criteria and has signed IRB consent, anthropometric data will be&#xD;
      obtained, 1-24 hour recall will be collected, training will be provided for recording dietary&#xD;
      records, and estimated caloric needs will be calculated. Estimated energy needs (EER) will be&#xD;
      determined using the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation and total daily energy needs (TDE) calculated&#xD;
      as EER x activity factor of 1.3-1.5 for sedentary to average activity, or a higher activity&#xD;
      level as indicated. A representative example of a 60 year old woman, 5'4&quot;, 140 pounds with&#xD;
      typical activity level yields TDE of approximately 1,600 - 1,800 kcal/day, and 20% E of&#xD;
      320-360 kcal/day. The intervention and control snacks would be 56.7 g of almonds and 56.7 g&#xD;
      pretzel + one-24 g chewy granola bar, respectively.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current smokers, those that have smoked within the past year, and former smokers with&#xD;

          -  Those with an autoimmune photosensitive condition or a known genetic condition with a&#xD;
             deficiency in collagen production (such as Ehler-Danlos), as this can be a confounder&#xD;
             for the development of facial wrinkles&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those that already obtain 20% of their energy intake from nut consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those with implausible reported energy intakes of &lt;1,000 kcal/d or &gt;3,000 kcal/d&#xD;
