      This trial is to investigate the use of nivolumab in sequence with standard of care surgery&#xD;
      and radiation/chemoradiation in locally advanced oral cavity Squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      oral cavity.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity is usually treated with surgery, often followed by&#xD;
      radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Unfortunately despite this treatment, it&#xD;
      recurs or spreads in about half of patients. In this trial the investigators aim to&#xD;
      investigate the use of nivolumab in sequence with standard of care surgery and&#xD;
      radiation/chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following confirmation of eligibility patients will be treated with a single dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab 1-2 weeks prior to surgery to remove their tumour. Based on pathological risk&#xD;
      factors determined following surgery, patients will be assigned to undergo adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Patients with high risk criteria (Extra capsular spread,&#xD;
      involved margins) will be assigned to chemoradiotherapy. A further single dose of nivolumab&#xD;
      will be given between surgery and commencement of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of chemo/radiation, patients will commence adjuvant nivolumab, with a&#xD;
      total of 6 doses given at 4 weekly intervals. Patients will be followed up for 12 months post&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this trial is to determine disease free survival at 12 months post&#xD;
      surgery and the feasibility of recruiting to both cohorts.&#xD;
