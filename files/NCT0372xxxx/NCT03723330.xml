      The purpose of the research is to assess the impact of co-consuming plant sterols-enriched&#xD;
      food product as part of a healthy eating pattern diet on endothelial function (brachial&#xD;
      artery FMD, vasodilation-related and vasoconstriction-related biomarkers) and blood pressure&#xD;
      management (24-hour ambulatory and classic blood pressure) in Singapore individuals with&#xD;
      MetS.&#xD;

      This is a 13-wk double-blinded, randomized, crossover study design. Following a 1-wk&#xD;
      pre-intervention baseline period, subjects will be randomly assigned to follow a healthy&#xD;
      eating pattern diet either contain 2.0 g free plant sterols equivalent of their palmityl&#xD;
      esters (Plant Sterol Diet) or do not contain plant sterols (Control Diet) for 4 weeks. After&#xD;
      a 4-week dietary 'washout' period, they will consume the alternative diet for 4 weeks. The&#xD;
      random assignment will be done with SAS 9.4 software. Body size measurement, dietary&#xD;
      assessment, brachial artery FMD and blood pressure measurements, and fasting-state blood&#xD;
      collection will be conducted at week 1, 5, 9, and 13, which correspond to before and during&#xD;
      the last 1 week of the two 4-week intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study week 1 and weeks 6-9, all subjects will consume their habitual, unrestricted&#xD;
      self-chosen diets. During study weeks 2-5 and 10-13, all subject will follow a healthy eating&#xD;
      pattern diet, referred to as the &quot;My Healthy Plate&quot; designed by HPB. Each subject's energy&#xD;
      requirement will be estimated using sex-specific equations and Recommended Dietary Allowances&#xD;
      for healthy Singaporean. One-on-one dietary counselling and written instructions for each&#xD;
      subject will be provided by a research dietitian and trained research staff to achieve a&#xD;
      healthy eating pattern diet. Compliance with the plant sterols consumption will be promoted&#xD;
      by frequent online and in-person contact.&#xD;
