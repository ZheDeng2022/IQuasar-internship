  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is common in preterm infants. In the presence of a large PDA,&#xD;
      significant systemic to pulmonary shunting occurs, which may results in pulmonary&#xD;
      hyperperfusion and systemic hypoperfusion. As consequence of splanchnic hypoperfusion ensuing&#xD;
      from left-to-right PDA shunting, a possible association between hemodynamically significant&#xD;
      PDA and adverse gastrointestinal outcomes has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An impaired blood flow velocity in superior mesenteric artery, evaluated by Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound, has been previously reported before and after feeds in infants with large PDA,&#xD;
      whereas evidence on PDA effect on splanchnic tissue oxygenation, measured by Near Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy, is scarce and controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether splanchnic oxygenation patterns in response to enteral&#xD;
      feeding introduction in preterm infants may be affected by PDA status.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a common condition among preterm infants. In the presence&#xD;
      of a large PDA, significant systemic to pulmonary shunting occurs, possibly resulting in&#xD;
      pulmonary blood flow overload and systemic hypoperfusion. A possible association with&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant PDA and the occurrence of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes has&#xD;
      been reported as a possible consequence of mesenteric hypoperfusion ensuing from&#xD;
      left-to-right shunt through the PDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous attempts to assess by Doppler ultrasound the effect of PDA on blood flow velocity in&#xD;
      superior mesenteric artery (SMA BFV) showed a decreased SMA BFV before and after feedings and&#xD;
      attenuated postprandial increases in infants with large PDA. Near-infrared spectroscopy&#xD;
      (NIRS) provides a non-invasive measurement of regional tissue oxygen saturation and has been&#xD;
      previously applied in neonatal settings for the monitoring of cerebral (CrSO2) or splanchnic&#xD;
      (SrSO2) oxygen saturation. Current evidence on the effect of PDA on SrSO2 is scarce and&#xD;
      controversial; moreover, a possible effect of PDA on SrSO2 patterns in response to enteral&#xD;
      feeding introduction has not been evaluated yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether SrSO2 patterns in response to enteral feeding&#xD;
      introduction in preterm infants may be affected by the ductal status. The development of&#xD;
      intestinal complications in relation to PDA are also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm infants &lt;32 weeks admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are&#xD;
      consecutively enrolled in the study if younger than 3 days and if no enteral feeding has been&#xD;
      administered prior to the enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written, informed consent to participate in the study is obtained from the parents/legal&#xD;
      guardians of each infant before introducing enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enteral feeding introduction, the enrolled infants undergo a continuous&#xD;
      monitoring of CrSO2 and SrSO2 by means of INVOS 5100 oximeter. NIRS recording is performed&#xD;
      from 30 minutes before to 3 hours after feeding administration. CrSO2 and SrSO2 are recorded&#xD;
      every 5 seconds. Values recorded before, during and after feeding administration are&#xD;
      clustered into 5-minute intervals and considered for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Splanchnic-cerebral oxygen ratio (SCOR), which derives by the ratio between SrSO2 and CrSO2&#xD;
      and has been previously proposed as a valid marker for gut hypoxia-ischemia, is also&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per normal routine, an echocardiographic evaluation is performed before enteral feeding&#xD;
      introduction, in order to evaluate hemodynamics and PDA status of the infant. In relation to&#xD;
      the PDA status, enrolled infants are divided into the following groups: PDA&#xD;
      (echocardiographic evidence of patent ductus arteriosus at the time of first feed) and noPDA&#xD;
      (echocardiographic evidence of closed ductus arterious at the time of first feed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal characteristics, including gestational age, birth weight, antenatal Doppler status,&#xD;
      and echocardiographic PDA characteristics at the introduction of enteral feeding and the&#xD;
      occurrence of intestinal complications during hospital stay, defined as the development of&#xD;
      feeding intolerance (enteral feeding withholding for at least 24 hours because of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms), necrotizing enterocolitis and spontaneous intestinal perforation,&#xD;
      are recorded in a specific case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SrSO2, CrSO2 and SCOR patterns in response to first feed are evaluated and compared between&#xD;
      PDA and noPDA infants and adjusted for possible influencing clinical variables using a&#xD;
      multivariate model. Moreover, the rate of intestinal complications is compared between the&#xD;
      two study groups by chi-square test. Data are analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 25&#xD;
      (IBM Corporation, IBM Corporation Armonk, New York, United States).&#xD;
