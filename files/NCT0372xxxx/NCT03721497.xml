    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is an effective method in the treatment of severe obesity and type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus achieving high remission rates. However, weight loss also causes loss of&#xD;
      skeletal muscle and bone mass which at least partly could be prevented by exercise and&#xD;
      dietary intervention although the counselling of obese and sedentary individuals in order to&#xD;
      increase their physical activity presents a challenge. As up to 78.8% of men undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery have low levels of testosterone, testosterone therapy could be considered&#xD;
      an attractive alternative or supplement to prevent the immense loss of muscle mass during&#xD;
      weight loss. Furthermore, low testosterone levels are associated with sarcopenia, insulin&#xD;
      resistance, increased body fat, reduced quality of life, loss of libido and reduced sexual&#xD;
      function. The study is a long-term randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the&#xD;
      effects of testosterone therapy combined with exercise and diet counselling on body&#xD;
      composition, components of the metabolic syndrome, hormones, inflammation, sexual function&#xD;
      and quality of life before and after weight loss in obese, hypogonadal men undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction Obesity, poor physical fitness and low muscular strength are associated with&#xD;
      all-cause mortality. Loss of bodyweight is commonly achieved by diet with or without exercise&#xD;
      intervention. However, both diet and diet+exercise programs are often followed by weight&#xD;
      regain and it is generally difficult to achieve long-term weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many challenges associated with the counselling of obese and sedentary individuals&#xD;
      in order to increase their physical activity (PA), and there may be a need for a tight&#xD;
      schematic counselling to achieve positive results. Additionally, promoting PA among patients&#xD;
      that have undergone bariatric surgery has also shown to be challenging even though PA may be&#xD;
      of a great importance regarding several postoperative outcomes. Lifestyle changes following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery may be important for the overall effect of the BS in the long term.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is vital to find an appropriate and well-suited setting to improve PA among&#xD;
      these patients. When structuring PA counselling, the five AÂ´s (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist,&#xD;
      Arrange) might be a helpful tool and it is considered important to engage the patients in PA&#xD;
      counselling both before and after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Loss of bodyweight reduces morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is the most effective&#xD;
      method to treat severe obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus achieving high remission rates.&#xD;
      However, weight loss also decreases skeletal muscle mass which might counterbalance the&#xD;
      positive effects of a bariatric surgery since low lean body mass is linked to increased&#xD;
      mortality under various circumstances (i.e., heart disease, cancer, burn injuries).&#xD;
      Furthermore, a substantial loss of bone mass is seen after bariatric surgery despite weight&#xD;
      stability in the second-year post-operative, which could have important clinical implications&#xD;
      for long-term skeletal health with increased fracture risk. On the other hand, the loss of&#xD;
      muscle and bone mass could merely be a natural adaptation to a lower weight after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Studies trying to establish whether the loss of muscle mass is disproportionately in&#xD;
      patients following bariatric surgery compared to BMI-matched controls are conflicting,&#xD;
      showing lower muscle mass in both sexes after surgery compared with their respective matched&#xD;
      controls assessed by magnetic resonance imaging in one study whereas another study has shown&#xD;
      comparable fat-free mass 24 months post-operative assessed by bioelectric impedance.&#xD;
      Currently, there are no effective approaches to prevent the immense loss of muscle and bone&#xD;
      mass following bariatric surgery although several approaches can be considered, e.g. exercise&#xD;
      and dietary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low testosterone levels have been associated with sarcopenia, insulin resistance, increased&#xD;
      body fat, reduced quality of life and loss of libido and sexual function. Testosterone&#xD;
      therapy increases lean body mass (i.e. muscle mass), improves bone density and decreases fat&#xD;
      mass. As up to 78.8% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery suffer from low testosterone&#xD;
      levels, testosterone therapy prior to and after bariatric surgery may prevent or reduce the&#xD;
      considerable loss of muscle mass during the weight loss period. So far, no studies have&#xD;
      evaluated the effect of testosterone therapy combined with exercise and diet counselling on&#xD;
      body composition and quality of life in men undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testosterone therapy and cardiovascular risk Studies on cardiovascular risk during&#xD;
      testosterone therapy are conflicting. A study in old men with limitations in mobility showed&#xD;
      significantly more cardiovascular events during testosterone therapy compared to placebo and&#xD;
      the study was ended prematurely. Low HDL levels are linked to an increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of cardiovascular disease. A significant small decrease in HDL cholesterol levels&#xD;
      in men treated with testosterone was reported in a meta-analysis and a systematic review.&#xD;
      However, a large observational study on pooled data in obese, hypogonadal diabetic men during&#xD;
      six years of testosterone therapy reported a favorable change in lipid profile along with&#xD;
      reduced pulse pressure and reduced arterial stiffness, which are independent risk factors for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. Another approach in clarifying the effect of testosterone therapy on&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease risk is the evaluation of biomarkers for cardiovascular disease during&#xD;
      therapy, i.e. soluble Klotho, a protein, which may function as a hormone. Higher levels of&#xD;
      soluble Klotho are independently associated with a lower likelihood of having cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease. To date, no reports on Klotho have been published in obese patients undergoing&#xD;
      bariatric surgery during testosterone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have addressed the influence of testosterone therapy on the haemostatic system.&#xD;
      Thrombin generation (TG) measures are risk markers of cardiovascular disease and address the&#xD;
      composite of multiple factors that influence blood coagulation. One intervention study showed&#xD;
      that i.m. testosterone treatment for one year in elderly men with low testosterone levels had&#xD;
      no impact on thrombin generation measured at one year. A significant number of patients&#xD;
      sustaining venous thrombotic events after initiation of testosterone therapy often had&#xD;
      inherited cardiovascular risk factors such as Factor V Leiden, and thrombotic events were&#xD;
      primarily observed within the first months of testosterone treatment, suggesting that&#xD;
      testosterone therapy triggers cardiovascular events in thrombosis prone individuals. Thus,&#xD;
      studies on both the short term and the long term impact of testosterone treatment on the&#xD;
      haemostatic system are warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome Central obesity results in a cluster of metabolic abnormalities&#xD;
      contributing to premature death, so-called Pseudo-Cushing's syndrome. Glucocorticoids&#xD;
      regulate adipose-tissue differentiation, function and distribution, and in excess, cause&#xD;
      central obesity. To our knowledge, no studies have reported results on levels of cortisol and&#xD;
      testosterone before and after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Trial plan and design General aim To investigate the effect and clinical relevance of&#xD;
      testosterone therapy combined with exercise and diet counselling in hypogonadal men&#xD;
      undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To evaluate the effect of testosterone therapy combined with exercise and diet&#xD;
      counselling on muscle strength, body composition, hormones, components of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, inflammation, sexual function, and quality of life after weight loss in obese,&#xD;
      hypogonadal men undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspective The study will investigate whether testosterone therapy can stabilize muscle&#xD;
      function, prevent the substantial decrease in muscle mass (lean body mass), and improve&#xD;
      components of the metabolic syndrome, inflammation and quality of life in patients after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A two centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on testosterone&#xD;
      therapy combined with lifestyle intervention, in men eligible for bariatric surgery with low&#xD;
      testosterone levels. Routine bariatric procedure will be conducted between 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after inclusion. The end of the study is 52 weeks postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study in men eligible for&#xD;
      bariatric surgery and low testosterone levels (total testosterone &lt; 12.0 nmol/l). Routine&#xD;
      bariatric procedure will be conducted between 3 and 6 months after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study population Recruitment Patients will be recruited among bariatric patients at&#xD;
      Hospital of Southwest Jutland and at Odense University Hospital. As part of a review of&#xD;
      existing clinical practice in the Region of Southern Denmark, patients who are entitled to&#xD;
      bariatric surgery are currently subject to an audit with the establishment of a quality and&#xD;
      research database. As part of the audit, patients have had their testosterone levels in the&#xD;
      blood measured. The investigators of the study may obtain these results from the journal, if&#xD;
      there is a signed consent statement during the audit, where the patients also have agreed to&#xD;
      be contacted for future projects. Inclusion will be in the beginning of the mandatory 8%&#xD;
      weight loss period lasting 3-6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization After the baseline assessment, the patients will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      testosterone or placebo. The randomization sequence will be created using OPEN Randomise,&#xD;
      stratifying patients with a 1:1 allocation using random block sizes of 2, 4 and 6. The&#xD;
      allocation sequence will be concealed from the researcher enrolling and OPEN Randomise will&#xD;
      send an e-mail to an email address each time a randomization is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Treatment of patients Treatment regimen&#xD;

      Study medicine is administered at the departments of endocrinology at SVS. Study medicine is&#xD;
      handled according to annex 13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are treated with Testosterone Undecanoate 1000 mg/4 ml, intramuscular (i.m.) or&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medicine and placebo have been produced by Bayer Health Care. Packing, blinding,&#xD;
      labeling and randomization of study medicine are done by the pharmacy of Odense University&#xD;
      Hospital according to annex 13: Name of sponsor, route of administration, batch number, trial&#xD;
      reference code, user manual for study medicine, storage of study medicine expiration date (a&#xD;
      copy of the label is placed in the trial master file).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicine (active and placebo) is delivered to the pharmacy from Bayer with no labels.&#xD;
      Identical labels will be put on the ampules, with the exception of the randomization number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medicine can be used only in clinical trials. Sponsor is responsible for the&#xD;
      destruction of surplus medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments stop:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmed increase in serum PSA &gt; 3 ug/l and clinical symptoms and at least 20% increase&#xD;
           since baseline is followed by referral to urological evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspicion of prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematocrit (EVF) &gt; 0.52 and at least 20% increase since baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum ALAT &gt;3 times upper normal limit and at least 20% increase since baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients can leave the study prior to end of study, due to safety issues (increased&#xD;
           safety parameters), fulfillment of exclusion criterion, at own request or due to lack of&#xD;
           compliance including failure to achieve 8% weight loss prior to operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination (baseline, per/postoperative weeks 0, 28 and 52) (Table 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical examinations: 1. testosterone levels (baseline) 2. PSA, EVF, ALAT (baseline,&#xD;
           preoperative weeks 6 and 18, postoperative weeks 0, 16, 28 and 52)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical relevant abnormal measurements are repeated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurements of hematocrit: testosterone therapy increases the hematocrit level and high&#xD;
           levels of hematocrit leads to higher risks of venous thrombosis (Danish Urological&#xD;
           Society (DUS) 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to take into account the Danish Urology Cancer Group (DUCG) 2013 report on&#xD;
           prostate cancer, and the Danish Urological Society report on androgen substitution&#xD;
           (2013) the exclusion criterion for PSA in the study is based on the above level.&#xD;
