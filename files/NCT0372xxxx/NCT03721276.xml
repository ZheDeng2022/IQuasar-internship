  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop an evidence-based psychosocial intervention for sexual&#xD;
      minority women. This intervention will specifically target the adverse mental and behavioral&#xD;
      health outcomes disproportionately experienced by sexual minority women, including&#xD;
      depression, suicidality, and alcohol abuse, which are known to be driven by stigma-related&#xD;
      stressors associated with their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stress processes).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt ESTEEM (Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men),&#xD;
      developed by Dr. John Pachankis, to simultaneously target the multiple adverse health&#xD;
      outcomes sexual minority women disproportionately face, including depression, suicidality,&#xD;
      and alcohol abuse, that are linked to minority stress processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project EQuIP will adapt the ESTEEM program for sexual minority women in three distinct&#xD;
      phases. The focus of this registered protocol will be Phase 3, however Phases 1, 2 and 3 are&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will involve conducting interviews with 20 sexual minority women (SMW) who report&#xD;
      experiencing depression, suicidality, and alcohol abuse. Information from these interviews&#xD;
      will be used to gather insight from participants that can help inform the adaptation of a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment approach to specifically target sexual minority women's unique&#xD;
      experiences with minority stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will involve consultation interviews with 10 community-based mental health experts&#xD;
      who treat psychosocial health problems among at-risk SMW. Involvement of key community&#xD;
      members in intervention design optimizes intervention dissemination and allows frontline&#xD;
      professionals to shape the intervention that they would be most willing to implement. Input&#xD;
      of mental health experts working with the SMW community will be used in order to translate&#xD;
      existing, but largely untapped, clinical wisdom regarding SMW's minority stress experiences,&#xD;
      mental health, and alcohol use into the development of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 will involve pilot testing the adapted cognitive-behavioral treatment through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with 60 SMW who report experiencing depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      alcohol abuse.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The measure depression in participants, the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) will be used. An overall depression score is computed as the sum of the 20 items, with Items 3, 11, 14, and 16 reversed. In cases with internally missing data (items not answered), the sums were computed after imputation of the missing values: # items on scale / # actually answered, multiplied by the sum obtained from the answered items. A higher score indicates more depressive symptomatology during the past week. Range is 0 - 60.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Symptom Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Severity Index of the 18-item BSI provides a mean score across depression, anxiety, and somatization subscales, and assesses psychological distress (e.g., &quot;feeling nervousness or shakiness inside&quot;) on a 5-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) for the past 7 days. Scores range from 0-72, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes (greater symptoms severity).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol use will be measured using the Short Index of Problems for Alcohol (SIP-A). The SIP-A is a 15-item, binary response (yes/no) measure that has a range of scores from 0-15. The highest score of 15 is an indicator of the greatest amount of alcohol use related problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Depression Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>ODSIS is a 5-item scale that asks individuals to rate the severity and impairment associated with past-week symptoms of depression (e.g., &quot;In the past week, when you have felt depressed, how intense or severe was your depression?) from 0 (little or none: Depression was absent or barely noticeable.) to 4 (extreme: Depression was overwhelming.). Scores range from 0-20, with higher scores indicating greater depression and associated impairment in the past week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>OASIS is a 5-item scale that asks individuals to rate the severity and impairment associated with past-week anxiety symptoms (e.g., &quot;In the past week, when you have felt anxious, how intense or severe was your anxiety?&quot;) from 0 (little or none: Anxiety was absent or barely noticeable.) to 4 (extreme: Anxiety was overwhelming. It was impossible to relax at all. Physical symptoms were unbearable). Scores range from 0-20, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety and associated impairment in the past week.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>SIDAS is a 5-item scale that assesses past-month frequency and controllability of suicidal thoughts, how close one has come to making an attempt, and distress and impairment associated with thoughts of suicide (e.g., &quot;In the past month, how often have you had thoughts about suicide?&quot;). Responses range from 0 (never or not at all) to 10 (always or extremely) on each item, with item 2 reverse scored. Scale scores range from 0-50, with higher scores indicating more (worse) suicidal ideation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale-Internalized Homonegativity Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Three-month pre-intervention, Immediate Pre-intervention, Post-intervention, Three-month Follow-up (Post Intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Internalized stigma was assessed us- ing the mean score on a three-item scale, the Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Scale-Internalized Homonegativity Subscale, that asks individuals to rate thoughts and feelings related to their LGBTQ identity (e.g., &quot;If it were possible, I would choose to be straight&quot;). Responses range from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree strongly). Scores range from 3-18 with higher scores indicating higher internalized stigma.</description>

        <description>The measure depression in participants, the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D) will be used. An overall depression score is computed as the sum of the 20 items, with Items 3, 11, 14, and 16 reversed. In cases with internally missing data (items not answered), the sums were computed after imputation of the missing values: # items on scale / # actually answered, multiplied by the sum obtained from the answered items. A higher score indicates more depressive symptomatology during the past week. Range is 0 - 60.</description>

        <title>Sexual Minority Women's Rejection Sensitivity Scale</title>
        <description>The Sexual Minority Women Rejection Sensitivity Scale asks participants to rate 16 vignettes in terms of how concerned or anxious each would make them about being rejected because of their sexual orientation, and their likelihood of attributing the rejection to their sexual orientation. For example, one item states, &quot;You are on a date with a woman at a restaurant. Your waiter provides you and your date with poor service.&quot; Responses to the anxiety and likelihood stems range from 1 (very unconcerned/very unlikely) to 7 (very concerned/very likely). Total score is the sum of the products of anxiety and likelihood scores for all items. We adapted the scale to indicate &quot;woman, gender nonconforming, or non-binary partner&quot; and &quot;heterosexual, cisgender&quot; as relevant. Scale scores range from 16-112, with higher scores indicating higher rejection sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Simple Rathus Assertiveness Schedule-Short Form</title>
        <description>The Simple Rathus Assertiveness Schedule-Short Form (SRAS-SF), a 19-item scale, asks individuals to rate the personal typicality of assertive and unassertive behavior (e.g., &quot;I find it embarrassing to return merchandise,&quot; &quot;I have avoided asking questions for fear of sounding stupid&quot;) along a scale from 1 (very uncharacteristic of me) to 6 (very characteristic of me), for a summed total score.&#xD;
Scores range from 19-114 with higher scores indicating greater unassertiveness (scale was reverse-scored).</description>

      <desc>Participants' risk for suicide was assessed at baseline, 3-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up assessments using the Brief Symptom Inventory and Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale, and through participant self-disclosure (e.g., during therapy). Participants randomized to waitlist were assessed for the 3-month waiting period, and then assessed while in therapy for the 3-month period. Participants randomized to immediate therapy were assessed for adverse events for the full 6 months.</desc>
