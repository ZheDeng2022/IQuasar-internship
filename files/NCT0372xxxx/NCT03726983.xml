  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to develop an e-heath management platform(eHMP) for women with&#xD;
      high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to evaluate the longitudinal effects&#xD;
      between groups of eHMP intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for&#xD;
      developing type2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome in their later life. Infants of&#xD;
      mothers with GDM are more susceptible to stillbirth and more serious health concerns. With&#xD;
      limited time for visits and the predicament of education, applying web-based intervention has&#xD;
      become a convenient tool for health management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The approved project aimed to develop an e-heath management platform(eHMP) for&#xD;
      women with high risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to evaluate the longitudinal&#xD;
      effects between groups of eHMP intervention. The eHMP integrate GDM health care knowledge,&#xD;
      self-awareness of health, self-monitoring of health status (i.e., recording weight and&#xD;
      measurement data of metabolic syndrome risk factors and monitoring changes in data trends);&#xD;
      participation in discussions or browsing forums; healthy lifestyle guidance and counseling;&#xD;
      reminder systems, a token system of earning points in exchange for prizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Pregnant women aged 18-45 years with high risk of metabolic syndrome who have a&#xD;
      singleton pregnancy, are eligible to participate in this study. Women who agree to&#xD;
      participate in the study will be given a participant information sheet and consent form.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Pregnancy diabetes Clinic, at Chang Gung memorial&#xD;
      hospital and introduced to the eHMP using the mobile phone in the clinic. Participants will&#xD;
      also be given the URL to access to the program and they can learn the modules at home by&#xD;
      using their home PCs, mobile phones, or tablets. They were followed up for three times: 28&#xD;
      weeks' gestation, 36-40 weeks' gestation and 6-12 weeks postpartum. SPSS version 20.0&#xD;
      software was used to compile and analyze the research data, including questionnaires and&#xD;
      blood test for metabolic index.&#xD;
