  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of thoracic ultrasound has expanded widely within the las couple of years, and&#xD;
      several studies have proved a high diagnostic accuracy for many of the most common causes of&#xD;
      respiratory failure and dyspnoea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound scan is a bed-side, and dynamic examination, which demands sufficient&#xD;
      theoretical and practical knowledge and competence by the operator, but so far, no studies&#xD;
      have explored the effect of simulation-based training for gaining adequate competence&#xD;
      compared to traditional hands-on training on healthy figurants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine whether TUS training on a simulator is superior to&#xD;
      training on healthy figurants. Secondly, to examine whether the choice of hands-on training&#xD;
      has an effect on the number of examinations performed by the trainees from baseline to 4&#xD;
      months follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) differs from ultrasound examinations in other organ systems,&#xD;
      because it is not possible in the healthy, ventilated lung to visualize structures or&#xD;
      anatomical parts of the lung, like it is when examining abdomen or performing an&#xD;
      echocardiography. It is therefore not possible to transfer results directly from educational&#xD;
      studies using simulation-based training in other areas of medicine, to thoracic ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TUS examinations are considered safe, and without pain, exposure to radiation or delay of&#xD;
      patients' course, but ultrasound in general is highly operator dependent and lack of&#xD;
      theoretical knowledge or practical skills could potentially lead to incorrect diagnosis and&#xD;
      thus treatment. Therefore simulation-based training, theoretical and practical tests could be&#xD;
      the key to a &quot;pre-trained novice&quot; with a level of competency higher than a complete novice&#xD;
      when performing the first TUS examination on a patient in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to examine whether TUS training on a simulator is superior to&#xD;
      training on healthy figurants, which today is a commonly used method for gaining skills and&#xD;
      competencies in TUS. Secondly, to examine whether the choice of hands-on training has an&#xD;
      effect on the number of examinations performed by the trainees from baseline to 3 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The design is a three-armed, multicentre, blinded randomized controlled trial. The&#xD;
      trial takes place at three simulation centres at university hospitals in Denmark; Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, and Aarhus University Hospital. The intervention period&#xD;
      is scheduled to run from August 2018 to May 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants All physicians employed at public hospitals in Region of Southern Denmark,&#xD;
      Capital Region of Denmark, Region Zealand, and Central Denmark Region, are eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion in the trial. Because physicians from a wide range of specialities can benefit from&#xD;
      TUS examinations, no exclusion criteria are established based on the specialities from the&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trainees sign up for participation, and inclusion by mail, and will receive a reply including&#xD;
      information about the trial. Exclusion criteria are; lack of informed consent, physicians&#xD;
      with connection to the trial, or involvement in the design or conduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to intervention Prior to the randomization all participants will complete an online&#xD;
      survery and educational programme in TUS in order to reach sufficient theoretical knowledge.&#xD;
      Included participants must pass a theoretical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included participants will receive a study identification number that makes it possible&#xD;
      to pair the results from the questionnaire to the intervention and performances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All materials needed prior to the theoretical test, including online educational material,&#xD;
      log-in to questionnaire and test will be send to the participants by mail. The online&#xD;
      educational material comprises access to Munksgaards' online e-portal in basic ultrasound.&#xD;
      The theoretical part is estimated to 2-3 hours. The theoretical test is administered in&#xD;
      Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) provided by Odense Patient data Explorative Network&#xD;
      (OPEN). Participants will be excluded if they do not complete the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part two of the trial will take place in one of the simulation centres. All participants will&#xD;
      receive an introduction to the ultrasound machine. A medical student working on the project&#xD;
      will do the introduction. Subsequently the randomization is done in REDCap, which allows an&#xD;
      online, computer-generated allocation sequence concealed to the project leaders. The ratio is&#xD;
      1:1:1 with no stratification for site (location).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial intervention The trial intervention includes a new experimental educational approach;&#xD;
      in vitro simulation-based TUS training. The TUS module for the US Mentor Simulator is made in&#xD;
      collaboration with 3D Systems (3D Systems Healthcare, Littleton, USA, formerly known as&#xD;
      Simbionix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This simulation model will serve as first intervention arm. The group randomized for&#xD;
      simulation-based training is allowed to practice for 2.5 hours prior to assessment. The&#xD;
      second intervention arm in the trial is the conventional hands-on training method;&#xD;
      examination of healthy volunteers (figurants), in this case medical students who signed up&#xD;
      for the job, and who is a part of the research group. Trainees are as well allowed to train&#xD;
      for up to 2.5 hours, and the medical students are not allowed to help or guide the trainee&#xD;
      during the examinations. Last group will not receive any hands-on training other than the&#xD;
      general information, and will serve as controls. Figure 1 present a flowchart of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When trainees have finished the hands-on training, they will continue to assessment of&#xD;
      competencies, done by an instructor blinded to the intervention. The assessment will take&#xD;
      place in the emergency department examining real patients suspected to have thoracic&#xD;
      pathology/pathologies. As assessment tool the LUS-OSAUS (Lung Ultrasound - Objective&#xD;
      Structured Assessment of Ultrasound Skills) score sheet is used. The assessment will be&#xD;
      repeated twice. The instructor assessing the participants is blinded to the intervention. The&#xD;
      data-managers providing the statistical analysis are going to be blinded when performing the&#xD;
      analyses and when drawing conclusions of the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and statistics Significance 5%, Power 90%, mean difference wanted between the two&#xD;
      interventional groups is 8.5 point. Standard deviation 8.67. Sample size per group = 22&#xD;
      (total; 66 participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be accessed using OPEN analyse, and analysed using STATA and SPSS. OPEN Analyse&#xD;
      acts as terminal server solution from the researcher's private PC with logging if files, but&#xD;
      data are stored and processed on a server at the Regional IT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-sided significance level of 0.05 will be used. Statistical methods for the primary and&#xD;
      secondary outcomes are presented in Table 1, and include Post Hoc ANOVA with Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction, hands-on training facility as independent variable (SIM, FIG, controls), and&#xD;
      LUS-OSAUS scores as dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analysed as intention to treat, therefore missing data will be handled by&#xD;
      multiple imputation technique, even though missing data are expected to be minimal because&#xD;
      instructors are registering a great amount of the data to the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The patient scanned at the assessment will be given oral information&#xD;
      about the trial including aim, running and assessment of participants, and that ultrasound is&#xD;
      a non-invasive and radiation-free radiological examination with no risk of complications or&#xD;
      side effects. Subsequent, orally informed consent will be given from the patient. If the&#xD;
      ultrasound examination provides further information to the patient inquiry, which is&#xD;
      suspected as new information, the physician in charge of the patient will be informed orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial complies with the Declaration of Helsinki on biomedical research and with the act&#xD;
      on processing personal data. The Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern&#xD;
      Denmark has been given the project description and protocol, and found that in accordance to&#xD;
      Danish regulations, ethical approval is not required for carrying out the trial&#xD;
      (S-20172000-44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is notified to the Danish Data Protection Agency under the in Region of Southern&#xD;
      Denmark, and, as prescribed, a data management contract is going to be signed with authors&#xD;
      and supervisors outside the region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion The presented trial is set to investigate whether a TUS simulator as hands-on&#xD;
      training facility, can provide a higher level of competencies after 2.5 hour training, than&#xD;
      training on healthy figurants, which is a commonly used model today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation-based medical education (SBME) has several advantages, and is a complex&#xD;
      educational intervention that enables both immersive and experimental learning, and makes it&#xD;
      possible to acquire and maintain skills in a calm and safe environment without putting&#xD;
      patients at risk if a wrong decision or interpretation is made. The use of this approach has&#xD;
      increased within the last decade, and in various specialities using technical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, all pathologies considered mandatory to the content or course are possible to&#xD;
      explore, and a trainee is able to practice a particular case or high-risk cases, over and&#xD;
      over again, if doubt arises or if the trainee does not provide a satisfying result. Seen in a&#xD;
      research perspective, SBME makes it possible to compare results of different trainees for&#xD;
      research purpose, because of a standardized set-up. On the other hand, disadvantages in&#xD;
      simulation training appear; e.g. if the fidelity drops for a short moment, the trainee may&#xD;
      use a lot of effort to move back into the simulation setting, the technical models require&#xD;
      updates, maintenance, and an instructor is often necessary in the beginning for introduction,&#xD;
      and for emphasizing trainee reflection and peer review elements. Last, but not least&#xD;
      simulation training cannot replace traditional apprenticeship or stand alone, but must be&#xD;
      seen as and add-on approach prior to supervised training in a clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today in TUS, it is often a fixed number of examinations on patients that determines whether&#xD;
      a physician can do a sufficient ultrasound examination sufficiently. Otherwise a supervisor,&#xD;
      subjectively, accepts and approves a trainee's skills, but none of those methods ensure the&#xD;
      professional level of competencies, and can be affected by external factors and cause&#xD;
      feasibility problems. There will be situations where a patient is seriously ill, and rapid&#xD;
      start of treatment is basis for a good outcome. In these situations education is not first&#xD;
      priority, and is easily put in line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, due to the varying incidence of various pulmonary diseases and pathologies,&#xD;
      hands-on training on patients in a clinical setting does not ensure examination of all&#xD;
      important sonographic findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge no previous studies have been published, comparing the effects of different&#xD;
      hands-on training facilities in TUS. Several studies have shown a positive effect of one&#xD;
      particular modality, e.g. laboratory animals, cadavers, phantoms, or like in this trial,&#xD;
      healthy figurants or simulators, but did not compare the effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies that have investigated simulation training in ultrasound of other organ&#xD;
      systems than lungs or thorax, or ultrasound guided procedures, have showed large and&#xD;
      significant effect when compared to no training, but in order to provide realistic and&#xD;
      transferable comparison the control group should not be no training, but training as is the&#xD;
      case today; training on healthy figurants. In order to implement simulation training for&#xD;
      gaining TUS competencies, and rethink the educational tasks for physicians, the results for&#xD;
      the simulator group are expected to be better than the group of comparison and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limitations The study will suffer from a number of limitations. Given the nature of the trial&#xD;
      it is not possible to blind the participants, but the instructor assessing the participant is&#xD;
      blinded to the intervention. During the analyses and reporting, the allocation will be&#xD;
      blinded to the data-managers.&#xD;
