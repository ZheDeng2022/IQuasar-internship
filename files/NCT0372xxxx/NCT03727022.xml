  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group study&#xD;
      is to provide an initial evaluation of two intra-articular (IA) injections of SM04690 (each&#xD;
      at the dose of 0.07mg per 2mL injection) approximately six months apart into the target knee&#xD;
      of moderately to severely symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) subjects. Subjects who complete&#xD;
      this 52-week long study will be eligible to enter the extension phase for an additional 52&#xD;
      weeks of treatment.&#xD;
