    <textblock>
      People who eat diets low in choline should deplete their choline (Cho) stores, and&#xD;
      measurements of Cho pool size using isotope dilution should reflect this depletion.&#xD;
      Investigators will identify a biomarker panel that correlates well with measured Cho pool&#xD;
      size across the range of different degrees of depletion.The investigators propose that, as&#xD;
      body stores of Cho diminish, cells and organs will reach the point when metabolism/function&#xD;
      in the cell is altered, and that this will result in a progression of changes in biomarkers&#xD;
      that reflect Cho status.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choline (Cho) is an essential nutrient and most Americans' diets do not achieve the&#xD;
      recommended intake. Diets low in Cho are associated with liver and muscle disease and with&#xD;
      suboptimal fetal development, while diets too high in choline may be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk for heart disease. Cho is a required nutrient and in 1998, an Adequate Intake&#xD;
      (AI) and a Tolerable Upper Limit (UL) for Cho was established In 2016, the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) set a Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) for Cho based on the AIs as part of&#xD;
      the new Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods (published in the Federal Register on May&#xD;
      27, 2016; FDA-2012-N-1210-0875, Federal Register Number:2016-11867). The AI/RDI varies by age&#xD;
      and gender, but is 550 mg/d in adolescent and adult men and 425 mg/d in adult women (more in&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating women) and 400 mg/day for adolescent women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no validated biomarker for choline status (the availability of the various forms of&#xD;
      Cho needed to sustain optimal cellular function). Measurement of plasma Cho concentrations is&#xD;
      not adequate as plasma choline is homeostatically regulated. Based on extensive preliminary&#xD;
      and published data this group identified a panel of potential biomarkers that could be used&#xD;
      to assess Cho status, and now the investigators propose to validate this biomarker panel&#xD;
      against measures of Cho pool size using isotope dilution. The largest stores of Cho are&#xD;
      located in the liver, and mass resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of liver has been used in the&#xD;
      past to assess Cho status in humans. This method is not practical for use as a biomarker in&#xD;
      clinical or public health practice as it is expensive and the availability of the&#xD;
      instrumentation is limited. However, the MRS can be utilized to confirm correlations between&#xD;
      the biomarker panel and the isotope dilution method. Liver biopsy is risky and not practical,&#xD;
      making measurement of hepatic Cho and Cho metabolites concentrations a poor choice for&#xD;
      assessing Cho status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perhaps there is a panel of biomarkers that together will more accurately and reliably&#xD;
      reflect Cho status. By making measurements in people fed 3 different dietary amounts of Cho&#xD;
      for two weeks at a time, and comparing the biomarker measures to body total Cho pool size&#xD;
      assessed using isotope dilution (a proxy for the availability of the various forms of Cho),&#xD;
      investigators will be able to identify the combination of biomarkers and algorithm for&#xD;
      calculating a Cho status score that best predicts total Cho pool size, and therefore predicts&#xD;
      choline nutritional status (the availability of the various forms of Cho needed to sustain&#xD;
      cellular function). People who eat diets low in choline should deplete their choline (Cho)&#xD;
      stores, and measurement of Cho pool size using isotope dilution should reflect this&#xD;
      depletion. The investigators will identify a biomarker panel that correlates well with&#xD;
      measured Cho pool size across the range of different degrees of depletion. This study tests a&#xD;
      method for using stable isotope dilution to measure body choline stores, and then asks how&#xD;
      this measure correlates with a panel of biomarkers in plasma and with liver fat measured&#xD;
      using Fibroscan®. Using isotope dilution can provide an estimate of the size of the body pool&#xD;
      of Cho. The investigators' proposed method is conceptually similar to the method for&#xD;
      measuring total body water from a bolus dose of labeled water. Similar methodology was used&#xD;
      recently in studies of metabolic flux of Cho in pregnant women. Isotope dilution is a&#xD;
      well-established method used to estimate pool size for other nutrients, such as vitamin A.&#xD;
      Similar to vitamin A, the major storage pools for Cho are in the liver, and ingested Cho is&#xD;
      rapidly absorbed and accumulated by liver. MRS/MRI scans will also be performed to&#xD;
      investigate correlation between these &quot;gold standard&quot; measures and the other methods&#xD;
      described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consume meals provided in two week dietary intervals with 3 different&#xD;
      levels of choline with a 2 week washout periods between those dietary intervals. Participants&#xD;
      will receive 100% of the recommended intake (RDI) of Cho (550mg Cho/day); 50% of the RDI of&#xD;
      Cho (275mg/day); and 25% of the RDI of Cho (137.5mg/day). The meal order will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned and all participants will receive all diets at some point in the study. There will&#xD;
      be a minimum of a two week washout between diet intervals. Both participants and researchers&#xD;
      will be blinded to the diet order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have brief exercise challenges (Biodex) to assess muscle function as an&#xD;
      additional predictor of choline status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled prior to 3/2020 completed MRI/MRS scans. We have determined that&#xD;
      Fibroscan provides adequate measurement of liver fat such that we eliminated the added&#xD;
      inconvenience to participants of travel to Winston-Salem for MR scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva, stool, and urine samples will be collected.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participant dietary arm assignment is randomized by a randomization plan created by the study coordinator at www.randomization.com. Each of the 3 hormonal related demographic groups (male, premenopausal females, and postmenopausal females) will have a list of the same order of diets created by the randomizer. Each participant will be assigned upon entry into the study into the next open diet for their group as ordered by the randomizer. No one collecting or processing data will be informed of the choline levels the participant is experiencing in their dietary arms at any given time to attempt to eliminate bias and ensure appropriate data collection. All staff who interact with participants or who are handling samples/data, will not be informed of the code linking dietary choline levels to diet order.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in Liver Choline Pool Size by Isotope Dilution</measure>
    <time_frame>24h following administration of choline-d9 on day 12 of each dietary intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The liver choline pool will be determined by the dilution of the deuterated choline metabolites formed in liver and released to plasma. The fraction of plasma phosphatidylcholine-d9 (PCd9) derived from liver is expressed as the tracer to tracee ratio (TTR), and is millimoles PCd9 (tracer) divided by millimoles of unlabeled PC (tracee): TTR = PCd9/PC. The liver choline pool size is the dose of Chod9 given (2.2 mmoles) divided by the TTR. Choline pool sizes at the end of each intervention will be compared.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of 2 weeks of 100% or 50% or 25% Cho diet</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in metabolites measured by untargeted metabolomics methods: carnitine, butyrylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, isovaleryl-L-carnitine, propionylcarnitine, hippurate, 3-indolepropionic acid, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid, creatinine, myo-inositol, pyridoxylate, erythronic acid, urate, pseudouridine, glutamine, pyroglutamate, valine, glutamyl-valine, glycine, leucine, trans-4-hydroxyproline, and stachydrine, will be studied. Differences in peak sizes at the end of each dietary intervention will be compared using linear mixed model. Peak sizes for an additional ~10,000 plasma and urine metabolites will also be assessed for changes associated with the interventions. Supervised Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Regression will be used to identify a panel of metabolites associated with choline pool size, and assign weight to each metabolite. The selected metabolites will be used to calculate a composite choline status score to predict choline pool size.</description>

    <measure>Phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and their associations with choline pool size</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of 2 weeks of 100% or 50% or 25% Cho diet</time_frame>
    <description>DNA will be collected and evaluated for the presence of the various PEMT SNPs. Genotypes will be measured by RT-PCR (real time polymerase chain reaction) and a custom Illumina Expanded Multi-Ethnic genotyping array (Mega-Ex). The magnitude of changes in choline pool size at the end of each dietary intervention will be compared among subjects with different genotypes in PEMT SNPs. Linear mixed model with repeated measures will be performed for each group (healthy men, pre- and postmenopausal women) separately to study the genotype effect and genotype*intervention interaction effect on choline pool size (or choline status score). The P values from this analysis will be adjusted for multiple testing correction.</description>
