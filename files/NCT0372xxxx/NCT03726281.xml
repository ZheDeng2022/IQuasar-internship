      To assess the clinical activity of nivolumab monotherapy, as measured by the&#xD;
      investigator-assessed clinical benefit rate (CBR), in patients with platinum-recurrent or&#xD;
      platinum-refractory metastatic germ cell tumors (GCT). CBR is defined by sum of complete&#xD;
      responses (CR), partial responses (PR) and stable disease (SD) for at least 3 months, with&#xD;
      stable or declining tumor markers (αFP and HCG), using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For patients with testicular GCT, there is no consensus on the most effective treatment for&#xD;
      men who relapse after first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease, between salvage&#xD;
      conventional cisplatin-based dose chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with&#xD;
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue (ASCT). A significant number of patients with&#xD;
      recurrent metastatic testicular GCT can still be cured with salvage chemotherapy but long&#xD;
      term survival becomes negligible for cisplatin-refractory disease or for patients beyond&#xD;
      second relapse. HDCT with ASCT should be considered for patients with recurrent metastatic&#xD;
      disease, at least beyond second relapse, although its therapeutic impact has not yet been&#xD;
      proven in randomized controlled trials. In contrast, patients with platinum-refractory&#xD;
      metastatic GCT and those with recurrent primary mediastinal nonseminomatous GCT (PMNSGCT) are&#xD;
      rarely cured by conventional dose salvage chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated clinical activity in&#xD;
      multiple malignancies, with durable remissions and long-term survivors in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell cancer, and are&#xD;
      being studied in several other tumor types. In GCT a recent study identified PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      in 73% of all seminomas and in 64% of all non-seminomas. Patients with low PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      had significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and OS compared to patients with&#xD;
      high PD-L1 expression. Frequent expression of PD-L1 in testicular GCT suggests that these&#xD;
      patients may benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatment with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1&#xD;
      antibodies. So far there are only case reports of nine patients with GCT treated with immune&#xD;
      check-point inhibitors. One patient, initially diagnosed with metastatic melanoma but&#xD;
      subsequently reclassified as non-seminomatous GCT, was treated with a single dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab and experienced clinical resolution of lymphadenopathy, decrease in serum tumor&#xD;
      markers and a 47% tumor burden reduction by immune-related response criteria. Another report&#xD;
      includes seven patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) as a&#xD;
      compassionate use off-label treatment attempt for highly-pretreated GCT. Four patients died&#xD;
      shortly after beginning treatment due to tumour progression, the remaining three patients&#xD;
      received treatment for at least 6 months and long-term tumor response was achieved in two of&#xD;
      the three, both of them with tumors highly positive for PD-L1 staining. Another case report&#xD;
      was published of a man with a poor-risk nonseminomatous GCT who had disease progression after&#xD;
      HDTC/ASCT and had a durable response to immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a single arm phase II trial of pembrolizumab in patients with incurable platinum&#xD;
      refractory GCT was presented at ASCO Annual Meeting 2017. This was the first reported trial&#xD;
      evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in GCT, enrolling 12 male patients age ≥ 18 with&#xD;
      metastatic GCT that had progressed after first line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and after at&#xD;
      least 1 salvage regimen (CDCT or HDCT). All patients had non-seminoma, the primary tumor site&#xD;
      was testis in 11 patients and mediastinum in 1 patient. 5 patients had late relapse (&gt; 2&#xD;
      years) and 6 patients had received prior HDCT. No partial or complete responses were&#xD;
      observed, 2 patients achieved radiographic stable disease for 12 and 9 weeks but with&#xD;
      continuing rise of AFP, suggesting that Pembrolizumab has no clinically meaningful activity&#xD;
      in refractory GCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, with limited and conflicting data, further studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent metastatic GCT are required.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug&#xD;
             administration, impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol therapy, or&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.&#xD;
