  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavanols are natural substances who are frequently found in our nutrition. A lot of research&#xD;
      has already been executed in the past to investigate what effects this flavanols could have&#xD;
      in the human population. Based on these examinations, the investigators think and suggest&#xD;
      that flavanols can have positive effects on the vascularly system, more specifically on the&#xD;
      peripheral and cerebral blood vessels. The effects are only observed in a healthy&#xD;
      populations, meanwhile patient populations like diabetes patients could really benefit from&#xD;
      this. This is why the investigators will execute this study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population is divided into 3 main groups, namely healthy controls, patients with&#xD;
      diabetes type 2 (defined by American Diabetes Association's (ADA)) and patients with&#xD;
      essential hypertension (the latter group is again divided into 3 subgroups: use of&#xD;
      betablockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers&#xD;
      (ARBs). Each main goup will consist of minimal 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this interventional study the investigators ask the patient to come twice. One time they&#xD;
      get capsules with real flavanols and the other time they get capsules with a placebo. The&#xD;
      study will be double blinded so nor the investigators, nor the patients now at which&#xD;
      investigation they get the real flavanols or the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after the intake of these capsules, a few measurements will take place. These&#xD;
      measurements will be compared on the one hand with the second investigation day&#xD;
      (inter-patients and intra-patient) and on the other hand with the pre-intake measurements&#xD;
      (intra-patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different examinations are a Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) test, blood pressure analysis&#xD;
      and an exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator who performs the FMD-test, followed a course and needed to pass an&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure measurements will be continuously for 20 minutes to avoid to much bias.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The different capsules are separated into 2 boxes but both sorts of capsules have the same colour and size. They just have a different number marked on the white box. During the investigation day, the participant chooses an envelope marked with number 1 or number 2 leading to the decision of the box and thus the capsules they will get.</masking_description>
