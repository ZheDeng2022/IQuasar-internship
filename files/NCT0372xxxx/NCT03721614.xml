  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, active control, open-label, multinational, randomized clinical trial comparing&#xD;
      single long BioMime™ Morph Coronary Stent System vs. two overlapping Xience family Coronary&#xD;
      Stent Systems to evaluate safety and performance in approximately 200 patients with long de&#xD;
      novo lesions will be randomly enrolled in a 2:1 ratio [BioMime™ Morph (n=133) vs. XIENCE&#xD;
      family (n=67)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population should include patients with symptomatic ischemic heart disease due to&#xD;
      de novo lesions (lengths ≥26 mm and ≤56 mm irrespective of number of lesions) in native&#xD;
      coronary arteries with a reference vessel diameter of (proximal to distal) 2.75 - 2.25 mm,&#xD;
      3.00 - 2.50 mm and 3.5 - 3.00 mm in patients eligible for Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary&#xD;
      Angioplasty (PTCA) and stenting procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must meet all the study inclusion / exclusion criteria before enrolment in the&#xD;
      study. All subjects shall accept clinical follow up at 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, 24&#xD;
      months post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10% of the patients [(2:1) BioMime™ Morph (13) vs. Xience (7)] will be assessed for OCT&#xD;
      analysis from pre-designated site(s) and based on availability of OCT console at the site and&#xD;
      Patient's consent. [Time Frame: Post-procedure and 6 months (±14 days)]&#xD;
