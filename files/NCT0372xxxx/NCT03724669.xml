  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective surveys and group interviews focusing on the prescription and abuse of&#xD;
      benzodiazepines will be carried out in China. Based the results of retrospective surveys and&#xD;
      group interviews and guidelines of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs standardized use, a real-world&#xD;
      randomized control trial of would be carried to evaluate the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention of using electronic content push in reducing the use rate of psychiatric BZDs&#xD;
      and Z-drugs and improving clinical efficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and Z-drugs are commonly used sedative and hypnotic drugs in&#xD;
      psychiatry. A small number of studies have suggestted that there may be improper use or even&#xD;
      abuse in recent years. Long-term use of BZDs and Z-drugs may have the risk of impairing&#xD;
      memory, respiratory depression, and increasing accidents risk. At present, there is no risk&#xD;
      investigation on psychiatric BZDs and Z-drugs abuse in China, and many psychiatric&#xD;
      practitioners lack of knowledge on the standard use of BZDs and Z-drugs. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to understand the use of benzodiazepines in psychiatric outpatient clinics in China&#xD;
      and to develop a BZDs and Z-drugs standardized use electronic intervention guidebook and to&#xD;
      verify the effectiveness of this electronic intervention in reducing the use of BZDs and&#xD;
      Z-drugs in psychiatric outpatient clinics and improving clinical efficiency. Through&#xD;
      retrospective surveys and focus interview groups, the study was conducted to understand the&#xD;
      use of BZDs and Z-drugs and related factors of abuse in psychiatric outpatient clinics in&#xD;
      Shanghai, Hunan, Sichuan, Wuhan and Jiangsu provinces. Based on the consensus and guidelines&#xD;
      of domestic experts, BZDs and Z-drugs standardized electronic intervention was used. The&#xD;
      real-world randomized controlled research method was combined with electronic content push&#xD;
      and periodic electronic evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in&#xD;
      reducing the use rate of psychiatric BZDs and Z-drugs and improving clinical efficiency. The&#xD;
      research can deeply understand the use of BZDs and Z-drugs in domestic psychiatry and form an&#xD;
      effective BZDs and Z-drugs standardized electronic intervention manual, which will provide&#xD;
      practical value for regulating domestic BZDs and Z-drugs in the future.&#xD;
