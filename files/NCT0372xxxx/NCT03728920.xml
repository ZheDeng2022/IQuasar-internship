      Hypothesis We hypothesise that hip muscle strength can predict the outcome of hip&#xD;
      arthroscopy. A relationship between strength and outcome can improve the success of the&#xD;
      procedure and avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The primary objective is to evaluate the relationship between hip muscle strength&#xD;
      and outcomes of hip arthroscopy. The secondary objective is to determine a 'threshold&#xD;
      strength' above which the operation becomes successful. If this relationship is established,&#xD;
      it would launching a randomised control trial with targeted physiotherapy as the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Hip arthroscopy is key-hole surgery to the hip joint which is performed for&#xD;
      femoroacetabular impingement; a condition which describes a shape mismatch between the&#xD;
      ball-and-socket hip joint. The number of procedures is increasing, however, studies have&#xD;
      shown success in only half of patients undergoing the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several factors have been linked with outcomes; however, the influence of muscle strength has&#xD;
      never been investigated. We performed a systematic review of this topic, revealing that&#xD;
      muscles around affected hips are significantly weaker. We also developed a standardised&#xD;
      protocol for the measurement of muscle strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan Patients awaiting hip arthroscopy will undergo muscle strength testing pre- and&#xD;
      post-operatively. There will be no deviation of treatment from their NHS care. Validated&#xD;
      outcome measure questionnaires will be completed at five months post-operatively. Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging and electromyography tests will be performed on a subset of patients&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
