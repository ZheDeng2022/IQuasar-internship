  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, multicenter, 30-day, unsupervised AUS among targeted (at-risk)&#xD;
      adult and adolescent consumers designed to mimic an OTC-like environment. More specifically,&#xD;
      &quot;at-risk&quot; consumers, as discussed with the FDA, will comprise elderly consumers (&gt;65 years of&#xD;
      age), consumers with an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding or cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) adverse events, consumers who experience severe pain, low literacy subjects, and&#xD;
      adolescents (12-17 years of age). The total number of subjects expected to enroll into the&#xD;
      study is approximately 820. Sites will be pharmacies in diverse geographic locations around&#xD;
      the US. Prospective adult subjects will be recruited via general population and targeted risk&#xD;
      condition advertising (although participants will not be informed as to specific health&#xD;
      conditions for which they are being recruited), while adolescents will be recruited using&#xD;
      targeted, outbound pre-recruiting telephone calls. Subjects (or the parents/guardians of&#xD;
      prospective adolescent subjects) responding to the advertisements or recruitment calls will&#xD;
      be initially screened by telephone, and eligibility will subsequently be verified in-person&#xD;
      at the pharmacy site.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The Actual Use Trial (AUT) design utilizes a real world setting to assess the ability of consumers to use an investigational product that will be marketed in an over-the-counter setting according to the proposed product labelling. The primary objective of this AUT is to evaluate compliance with the labeled dosing directions for Advil 12 Hour and to understand why misuse occurred and if it was a conscious decision by the subject. A secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of Advil 12 Hour in unsupervised actual use and how it relates to misuse.</intervention_model_description>

        study:&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 6 months prior&#xD;
             to study entry and/or during study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen, aspirin, or any other NSAIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with the following clinical conditions which place them at excessively high&#xD;
             risk or have ≥20% 10 year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as&#xD;
             defined by the 2013 ACC/AHA Guidelines on the Assessment of Atherosclerotic&#xD;
             Cardiovascular Risk, will not be included in the study: clinically established&#xD;
             coronary heart disease; cerebrovascular disease; peripheral artery disease; abdominal&#xD;
             aortic aneurysm; and chronic kidney disease. Subjects who have experienced a prior non&#xD;
             fatal cardiovascular disease event (angina, heart failure, heart disease, heart&#xD;
             attack, stroke/transient ischemic attack) or have had heart surgery or who currently&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subjects with concurrent or recent (within 30 days) use of anticoagulants, a prior&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition including recent (within the&#xD;
             past year) or active suicidal ideation or behavior or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product (IP)&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant female subjects; breastfeeding female subjects; and male and female subjects&#xD;
             of childbearing potential who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method&#xD;
             of contraception as outlined in this protocol for the duration of the study and for 28&#xD;
             days after the end of their 30-Day Use Phase or, for subjects who use the&#xD;
             investigational product after Day 30, 28 days after the last recorded dose of&#xD;
             investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. 18 years of age or older and classified as normal literacy (REALM Test score ≥61)&#xD;
             after the normal literacy group quotas (approximately 70% of adult subjects) are full&#xD;
             or refuses to complete the REALM Test (note there is no corresponding literacy&#xD;
             exclusion criterion for adolescent subjects based on REALM Teen score).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. 18 years of age or older and classified as moderate (less frequent) oral OTC pain&#xD;
             reliever user (&lt;30 doses per month on average in the preceding 3 months) after the&#xD;
