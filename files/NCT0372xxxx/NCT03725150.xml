  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of anaemia remains unacceptably high during pregnancy. Over a third of women are&#xD;
      anaemic by their third trimester of pregnancy. The most common cause is iron deficiency. One&#xD;
      key factor is rising iron requirements throughout pregnancy. There are risks associated with&#xD;
      anaemia for the mother and infant. Anaemia in the first and second trimester has been&#xD;
      significantly correlated with low birth weight and pre-term birth, and is associated with&#xD;
      impaired neurological development of the baby. It also increases the risk of intrauterine&#xD;
      fetal death, and the likelihood of the mother requiring blood transfusions during or after&#xD;
      delivery.This study is a prospective cohort study, which aims to better define the natural&#xD;
      history and understand how to use oral iron therapy for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant&#xD;
      women. This includes documenting the impact of treatment on anaemia symptoms, side effects,&#xD;
      and the level of success of iron therapy using several haematological tests. Pregnant women&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in this study and treated using a treatment schedule as&#xD;
      described in national guidelines. Additional blood samples will be taken for subsequent&#xD;
      detailed analysis of pathways of iron metabolism to better predict the response to oral iron&#xD;
      therapy during pregnancy.&#xD;
