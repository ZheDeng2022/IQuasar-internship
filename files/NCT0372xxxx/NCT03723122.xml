  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: To face cancer-related stress, patients and caregivers activate individual and&#xD;
      dyadic coping responses. Opened communication, adequate involvement, reciprocal supportive&#xD;
      roles, self-disclosure and responsiveness enhance dyadic coping. Nevertheless, little is&#xD;
      known about the optimal content of dyadic interventions designed to improve dyadic&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled trail was designed to assess the efficacy of a dyadic&#xD;
      intervention centered on a cancer-related communication reinforcement. Patient-caregiver&#xD;
      dyads are randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a waiting list group. Patients&#xD;
      and caregivers complete self-reported scales that assessed emotional distress, individual&#xD;
      coping, cancer-related dyadic communication frequency, satisfaction, self-efficacy and coping&#xD;
      at baseline and post-treatment (intervention group), or 6 weeks after baseline (waiting list&#xD;
      group). This dyadic communication reinforcement intervention (DCRI) consists of a weekly&#xD;
      4-session intervention. This intervention includes specific communication tasks aiming the&#xD;
      improvement of some cancer-related dyadic communication competencies such as concerns&#xD;
      disclosure and request for support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: DCRI would lead to improvements in cancer-related dyadic communication&#xD;
      self-efficacy, cancer-related dyadic communication satisfaction and dyadic coping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. Aim of the trial: A randomized longitudinal study assessing the efficacy of a dyadic&#xD;
           communication reinforcement intervention (DCRI) between cancer patients and their&#xD;
           caregivers. Efficacy of the DCRI will be assessed by the analysis of changes over time&#xD;
           in both patients and caregivers self-reported questionnaires/scales measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants: Patients and caregivers are recruited from oncology clinics at Erasme&#xD;
           Hospital and Jules Bordet Institute (Brussels, Belgium). Recruitment and all study&#xD;
           procedures were approved by a central ethics committee (Erasme - ULB Ethics Committee)&#xD;
           and all participants are providing written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design: Participants are randomly assigned to the experimental group, consisting&#xD;
           of the DCRI, or to the control group, consisting of a waiting list. Dyads in the waiting&#xD;
           list can complete the DCRI after the last assessment if they want to. Investigator,&#xD;
           psychologist in charge of the intervention and participants are blinded for this&#xD;
           randomization. Dyads completed a follow-up assessment (T2), either 2 weeks after the&#xD;
           DCRI in the experimental group or 6 weeks after baseline in the control condition. All&#xD;
           assessment time were completed either at the outpatient clinic or at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DCRI content: DCRI aims communication reinforcement by a weekly 4-sessions program. DCRI&#xD;
           is manualized and is conducted by an experienced psychologist (same psychologist for all&#xD;
           participating dyads). Sessions focus on reciprocal cancer-related stress communication&#xD;
           between patients and their caregivers using a specific communication task that promotes&#xD;
           self-disclosure and request for support. All sessions are divided into four times: (1)&#xD;
           session introduction, (2) first communication task, (3) second communication task and&#xD;
           (4) session conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1)Session introduction: Firstly, psychologist assesses if any significant moment occurred&#xD;
      before the actual session and let dyad members talk about it if they want. Secondly,&#xD;
      psychologist addresses some theoretical information about the session subject. First and&#xD;
      second session subject is about personal cancer-concerns disclosure and close one supportive&#xD;
      response to this disclosure. Third and fourth session subject is about personal request for&#xD;
      support to face a cancer-related stress and close one response to this request for support.&#xD;
      In the first and second session, psychologist therefore discusses the importance of sharing&#xD;
      stress appraisal, stress describing, thoughts and emotions expressing and how to be&#xD;
      supportive in responding. In the third and fourth session, psychologist discusses the&#xD;
      importance of the personal needs communication and the clarity of the request for support to&#xD;
      be well understood by the partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (2 &amp; 3) First and second communication task: This communication task is divided into an&#xD;
      audio-recorded communication exercise and the debriefing of this communication exercise. In&#xD;
      each session, there are therefore two communication tasks (two exercises and two debriefing).&#xD;
      An exercise lasts 5 minutes and psychologist stays with the dyad but does not intervene&#xD;
      during it. This exercise consists in patient and caregivers embody a specific role:&#xD;
      &quot;discloser&quot; and &quot;listener&quot;. Each role is associated with specific instructions. Exercise (and&#xD;
      therefore task) is performed twice a session to let patient and caregiver experiment each of&#xD;
      these roles. In the first and second session, the discloser has to express a personal&#xD;
      cancer-related stress to the listener. The listener has to listen and respond supportively to&#xD;
      this expressed cancer-related stress. In the third and fourth session, the discloser has to&#xD;
      ask for help about a personal cancer-related stress to the listener. The listener has to&#xD;
      listen and respond to this request for support. The exercise debriefing consists in the&#xD;
      listening, in session, of the exercise record. After the listening, psychologist asks to the&#xD;
      listener what kind of the discloser communicational behavior help him to understand the&#xD;
      expressed cancer-related stress. Psychologist asks also to the discloser what kind of the&#xD;
      listener communicational behavior help him to feel supported. After that, psychologist&#xD;
      reinforces each positive communication strategy used by the discloser and the listener.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (4) Session conclusion: Psychologist summarizes the two communication tasks and notes all&#xD;
      positive communication strategies used by the patient and the caregiver in&#xD;
      self-disclosing/responding (first and second session) or request for support/responding to&#xD;
      request for support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Assessment procedure: Patients and caregivers are assessed by self-reported measures at&#xD;
      baseline (T1) (after enrollment) and 2 weeks after the intervention (in the experimental&#xD;
      group) or 6 weeks after baseline (T2) (in the control group). Patients and caregivers&#xD;
      complete exactly the same self-reported questionnaires and scales. Patients had a medical&#xD;
      information questionnaire in addition at baseline and study personnel rated their performance&#xD;
      status, based on the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale, at T1 and T2. Other specific&#xD;
      oncologic information was collected by medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1, demographic questionnaire assesses gender, age, cultural background, education level,&#xD;
      native speaking, professional situation, familial situation (children) and psychiatric&#xD;
      history. At T1, dyadic information questionnaire assesses relationship type, relationship&#xD;
      length, living situation and contact frequency between patients and caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and caregivers complete following self-reported scales in T1 and T2: (1)&#xD;
      Cancer-related dyadic communication frequency, (2) cancer-related dyadic communication&#xD;
      satisfaction, (3) cancer-related communication self-efficacy, (4) Dyadic Coping Inventory,&#xD;
      (5) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and (6) Ways of Coping Checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis consisted in a comparative analysis of groups&#xD;
      at baseline using parametric and nonparametric tests as appropriate (Student's t test,&#xD;
      Mann-Withney U test or Chi-squared test). Patients and caregivers outcomes at baseline and&#xD;
      after the DCRI, or after the waiting period, were compared using repeated measures analysis&#xD;
      of variance (MANOVA). Time and group-by-time effects were processed using MANOVA. Effect size&#xD;
      will be report with eta-squared (η²) given by MANOVA. All tests were two-tailed, and the&#xD;
      alpha was set at 0.05. All analyzes were performed using SPSS®, version 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data Quality Control: There are 6 study collaborators: (1) recruitment manager, (2)&#xD;
      investigation coordinator, (3) assessor, (4) psychologist in charge of the intervention, (5)&#xD;
      data manager and (6 &amp; 7) two data assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment manager manages the recruitment process. Every recruitment steps have been&#xD;
           approved by institution ethics committee. Patients phone numbers meeting inclusion&#xD;
           criteria are provided by the medical staff to the recruitment manager only. These phone&#xD;
           numbers are destroyed after the recruitment phase. Recruitment manager calls each&#xD;
           patient to give them basic information about the study. If they are interested in,&#xD;
           recruitment manager calls the designated caregiver with the patient consent. If the&#xD;
           caregiver agrees too, recruitment manager makes an appointment to provide a written&#xD;
           informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigation assistant provides the randomization number for each participating dyad to&#xD;
           the data manager. He books all DCRI session for the psychologist in the good time lapses&#xD;
           (regarding the group).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessor assists participants in questionnaires and scales if they need it and he rates&#xD;
           each patient by a Karnofsky score. A numerical copy is made for each assessment. This&#xD;
           copy is put on a encrypted hard drive disk. Paper version is given in person to data&#xD;
           manager. Paper versions are stored in a secure location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychologist conducts the DCRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data manager manages randomization number, securing data storage, data encoding and&#xD;
           encoding checking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Data assistants encode data provide by the questionnaires and scales. They only have a&#xD;
           participant ID and no randomization information. Double encoding, checked by the data&#xD;
           manager, reduces encoding error.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 7-persons functioning guarantees complete masking procedure from recruitment to&#xD;
      encoding.&#xD;

    <description>Cancer-related dyadic communication self-efficacy through a self-reported scale for patients and caregivers. The perceived dyadic communication self-efficacy was measured by a 6-dimension scale: Dyadic Communication Competencies. Each dimension is divided into 5 items. Subject has to rate each item on a 0-100 range (0 = not certain; 100 = absolutely certain) to report how he is certain to matser the communication competency. A total score (ranging 0-100) for each dimension is computed by making the mean of all item scores. A higher score reflects a higher perceived communication self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Cancer-related dyadic coping through a validated self-reported scale for patients and caregivers: Dyadic Coping Inventory (DCI). It is composed of the following six different dimensions: stress communication, supportive dyadic coping, delegated dyadic coping, negative dyadic coping, common dyadic coping and evaluation of dyadic coping. The DCI has a 5-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;Rarely&quot;; 5 = &quot;Very Frequently&quot;) and provides a total score (35-175) by summing all items. A higher score reflects a better dyadic coping.</description>

    <description>Emotional distress levels through a validated self-reported scale for patients and caregivers: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). It is composed by 2 dimensions (anxiety and depression) and has a 4-point Likert scale that vary at each item. HADS provides a total score (0-42 range) by summing all item scores. A higher score reflects a higher emotional distress. Anxiety subscale score (0-21 range) is providen by summing all Anxiety-items. A higher score reflects more anxiety. Depression subscale scores (0-21 range) is providen by summing all Depression-items. A higher score reflects more depression.</description>
