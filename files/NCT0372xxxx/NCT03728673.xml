  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will include grade IV glioma patients treated with SSRIs during&#xD;
      approximately a 17 week study period. Changes in cognition and evaluation of psychosocial&#xD;
      factors from baseline to after 17 weeks of treatment with SSRI study drug will be calculated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As many as 85% of glioma patients experience cognitive impairment. This is not only from&#xD;
      direct tumor involvement, but also worsens with therapy such as cranial radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, which further degrade neuronal function. Commonly, impairments in visuospatial&#xD;
      skills and executive function are seen. There is evidence that serotonin selective reuptake&#xD;
      inhibitors (SSRIs) such as escitalopram improve modulation and function of resting state&#xD;
      networks, contribute to neuroplastic changes in brain regions subserving these abilities, and&#xD;
      provide general functional support to neuronal cells. In addition to either improving&#xD;
      cognition or preventing cognitive decline, treatment with an SSRI may also improve outcomes&#xD;
      critical to overall survival in this vulnerable population, including functional&#xD;
      independence, psychosocial stability, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that following treatment with escitalopram patients will experience improved&#xD;
      cognitive and mood function over time. We will also correlate changes in mood structural MRI&#xD;
      and electrophysiological correlates of visual pathway function. The addition of escitalopram&#xD;
      has the potential to enhance cognitive function and hence functional independence thereby&#xD;
      improving quality of life in these patients.&#xD;
