  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapy with light emitting diodes (LED) is a good resource to accelerate the recovery of the&#xD;
      athlete and reduce muscle damage caused by exercise. Objective: To evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      LED therapy applied at different times on late muscle pain (DOMS), functional performance,&#xD;
      inflammatory and ergogenic response of rugby athletes. Methodology: Randomized crossover&#xD;
      clinical trial, composed of three groups that will receive treatment with LED at three&#xD;
      different times. Sample made up of rugby athletes of both sexes, aged between 18 and 35&#xD;
      years. On the first day of the study, there will be an anamnesis, where the participants will&#xD;
      answer questions about personal data, history of injuries and training time, right after the&#xD;
      participants receive weight, height, heart rate and measured blood pressure, in addition to&#xD;
      collecting a blood sample. to standardize the individual's baseline values. After the initial&#xD;
      assessment, participants will be randomized to not receive the LED (CO) or receive LED&#xD;
      therapy at three different times: before (Lpré), in the interval (Lin) and after (Lpós) the&#xD;
      performance tests. Then, the modified Star Trek Balance Test (SEBTm), the Single Jump Test&#xD;
      (SGHT) and the Triple Jump Test (THT) will be performed. After that, the Bangsbo Sprint (BST)&#xD;
      test will be performed, followed by the Yo-Yo level 1 intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1).&#xD;
      At the end of this test, the subjects will remain at rest for 10 minutes and will be&#xD;
      subjected to the same tests (BST and Yo-Yo IR1) again. They will be measured at the end of&#xD;
      the second battery of tests, heart rate, blood pressure, subjective perception of effort,&#xD;
      muscle pain threshold, blood samples collected and repeated functional tests. After 48 hours&#xD;
      of the performance tests, the blood sample will be collected again, the functional tests&#xD;
      carried out and they answered a Stress Recovery Questionnaire for Athletes (RESTQ-Sport-76).&#xD;
      At 7, 14 and 21 days after the initial tests, the same test and evaluation protocol will be&#xD;
      performed, but the participants will receive LED therapy before, during or after the&#xD;
      performance tests, according to their randomization. LED therapy will be performed on the&#xD;
      rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles; bilateral femoral,&#xD;
      semitendinosus and gastrocnemius biceps.&#xD;

      Randomized crossover clinical trial, composed of three groups that will receive LED treatment&#xD;
      at three different times. Sample made up of rugby athletes of both sexes, aged between 18 and&#xD;
      35 years. On the first day of the study, there will be an anamnesis, in which the&#xD;
      participants will answer questions about personal data, history of injuries and training&#xD;
      time, right after receiving weight, height, heart rate and blood pressure, in addition to&#xD;
      collecting a blood sample. standardize the baseline values of the individual. After the&#xD;
      initial assessment, participants will be randomized to not receive the LED (CO) or receive&#xD;
      LED therapy at three different times: before (Lpré), in the interval (Lin) and after (Lpós)&#xD;
      of the performance tests. Then, the modified Star Trek Balance Test (SEBTm), the Single Jump&#xD;
      Test (SGHT) and the Triple Jump Test (THT) will be performed. Soon after, the familiarization&#xD;
      protocol with the Bangsbo Sprint test (BST) will begin, with the participants positioned&#xD;
      close to the initial marker (photocell) and the signal, they must execute a maximum of 34.2&#xD;
      meters, performing seven repetitions, with twenty-five seconds duration for active recovery&#xD;
      between sprints. At the end of the sprints, the participant will rest for 10 minutes and then&#xD;
      perform the intermittent Yo-Yo level 1 recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1). At the end of this test,&#xD;
      participants remain at rest for 10 minutes and then perform the same tests (BST and Yo-Yo&#xD;
      IR1) again. At the end of the second battery of tests, heart rate, blood pressure, perceived&#xD;
      exertion, blood sample and functional tests will be measured again. After 48 hours of&#xD;
      performance tests, blood samples will be collected and functional tests will be carried out,&#xD;
      in addition to all participants answering the Stress Recovery Questionnaire for Athletes&#xD;
      (RESTQ-Sport-76), to quantify the recovery and psychophysiological stress during the test and&#xD;
      recovery days. At 7, 14 and 21 days after the initial tests, the same test and evaluation&#xD;
      protocol will be performed, but the participants will receive LED therapy before, during or&#xD;
      after the performance tests, according to their randomization. All participants will receive&#xD;
      LED therapy at the three times, only the application sequence will be randomized. LED therapy&#xD;
      will be performed at two points on the quadriceps, two on the hamstrings and two on the&#xD;
      gastrocnemius bilaterally. At each point, irradiation will be applied for 60 seconds, with a&#xD;
      wavelength of 850nm (± 20nm) and an energy density of 8 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2).&#xD;

Consists of 19 scales (General Stress, Emotional Stress, Social Stress, Conflicts / Pressure, Fatigue, Lack of Energy, Complaints Somatic, Success, Social Recovery, Physical Recovery, General Welfare, Sleep Quality, Intervals, Emotional Exhaustion, Injuries, Fitness, Self Acceptance, Self-Efficacy and Self-Regulation), with four questions on each scale, totaling 76 questions. The values of the scales are calculated by the mean values of the items, which can vary from 0 to 6. High scores on the scales associated with stress activities reflect intense subjective stress, while high scores on the scales associated with recovery reflect many recovery activities.</description>
