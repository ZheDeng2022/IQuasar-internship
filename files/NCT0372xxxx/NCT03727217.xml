      Thyroid and parathyroid surgery concerns around 50 000 patients a year in France. One of its&#xD;
      main complications is paralysis of vocal cords, and the consequences can be serious.&#xD;

      In this study, the main gold is to evaluate diagnostic performances of ultrasound for an&#xD;
      early diagnosis (as soon as awakening of the patient) of vocal cords paralysis in the&#xD;
      post-operative period in order to prevent at best complications.&#xD;

      Thyroid and parathyroid surgery concerns around 50 000 patients a year in France. One of its&#xD;
      main complications is paralysis of vocal cords. Indeed, the anatomy of the thyroid and its&#xD;
      close location with the recurrent laryngeal nerve (responsible for the vocal cord movement)&#xD;
      involves a possible lesion or inflammation of the nerve during the surgical procedure. This&#xD;
      complication is common, affecting around 10% of thyroid or parathyroid patients following&#xD;
      surgery. This complication can be reversible, with a speech therapy or a specific endoscopic&#xD;
      treatment by an otolaryngologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a postoperative screening is performed by nasofibroscopy in the recovery room to&#xD;
      directly visualize vocal cord mobility. This examination may be painful or badly tolerated by&#xD;
      some patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have highlighted the performance of ultrasound in this diagnosis. The protocol&#xD;
      for these studies included an ultrasound distant of the intervention, while it is known that&#xD;
      vocal cord paralysis may have earlier consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators would like to evaluate diagnostic performances of vocal&#xD;
      cords ultrasound for an early diagnosis (as soon as awakening of the patient) of vocal cords&#xD;
      paralysis in the post-operative period in order to prevent at best complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main limitation of vocal cord ultrasound is mainly related to surgery. Surgery creates&#xD;
      anatomical rearrangements, so the secondary objective of this study will be to test whether&#xD;
      the preoperative visualization is predictive of a good postoperative visualization.&#xD;
