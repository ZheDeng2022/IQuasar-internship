    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Global Impression of Improvement scale is global index that may be used to rate the response of a condition to a therapy.&#xD;
It is a 7-point scale where a score of 1 indicates that the patient is &quot;very much improved,&quot; a score of 4 indicates that the patient has experienced &quot;no change,&quot; and a score of 7 indicates that the patient is &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire contains four items: frequency of urinary incontinence, amount of leakage, overall impact of urinary incontinence and self-diagnostic. The first item has 6 response categories (never, once a week, two or three times a week, once a day, a few times a day, always) and is scored from 0 to 5. The second item has 4 response categories (none, small amount, moderate amount, large amount) and is scored 0, 2, 4, or 6. The third item (how much urine leakage affects your daily life) has 5 response (not at all, mildly, moderately, severely, to a great extent) and is scored from 0 to 10. The first three items are scored and then summed to produce a total score, ranging from 0 to 21. The last item is a diagnostic item to assess the perceived cause of incontinence. This item is included upon the request of clinicians and is not used for scoring. A higher ICIQ-UI-SF score indicates higher frequency, severity, and lower quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire on Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire evaluates several pelvic floor dysfunctions including questions regarding intestinal, vaginal, sexual symptoms and quality of life impact. It includes 14 questions (dragging abdominal pain, vaginal soreness, reduced sensation around vagina, vagina too loose/lax, lump coming down in vagina, lump coming out of vagina, dry vagina, digitation for bowel opening, tight vagina, current sex life, worries about vagina affect sex life, relationship, sex life spoilt, overall impact on everyday life) and divided into three independent domains. Vaginal symptoms score varies from 0 to 53. Sexual symptoms score varies from 0 to 58. Quality of life impact score varies from 0 to 10. Usually each question has 3 to 5 possible answers; the higher the score, the most severe is the symptom or the negative quality of life impact.</description>
