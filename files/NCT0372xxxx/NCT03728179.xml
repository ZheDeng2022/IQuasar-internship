  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic incurable Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes&#xD;
      (TIL)-negative solid tumors who are not eligible for, declined or failed standard therapy&#xD;
      will be treated with a combination nivolumab, low-dose ionizing radiation (RT) (0.5-2 Gy),&#xD;
      aspirin (ASA)(cohorts 1 and 2)/celecoxib (cohorts 3, 4 and Phase Ib), and either ipilimumab&#xD;
      or low-dose cyclophosphamide. The study comprises 2 phases: The aim of Phase Ia, is to&#xD;
      determine safety and tolerability of a given combination therapy, as well as the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase Ib dose (RP1bD) of radiotherapy. Phase Ib aims to&#xD;
      further explore safety and tolerability of this treatment in an expansion cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase Ia, 4 distinct cohorts will receive the following combination therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort1: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 0.5 Gy every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat&#xD;
      dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort2: combination therapy for 5 cycles (C0-C4) which includes: RT 1 Gy every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (Q2W), Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W (cycles C0 to C4); ASA (300 mg) daily, with nivolumab 240 mg flat&#xD;
      dose Q2W and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg (Q6W) will be administered (cycles C1 to C4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 3a and 4a: Patients will receive Cy (200 mg/m2) Q2W, celecoxib (2x200mg daily),&#xD;
      nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3a will receive 1 Gy of&#xD;
      low-radiation dose and cohort 4a will receive 2 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts 3b and 4b: Patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg flat dose) Q2W, ipilimumab 1 mg/kg&#xD;
      (Q6W), celecoxib (2x200mg daily) and low-dose radiation. Cohort 3b will receive 1 Gy of&#xD;
      low-radiation dose and cohort 4b will receive 2 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase Ia, the safety of combination (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide) or (nivolumab, celecoxib, low-dose irradiation and ipilimumab) will be&#xD;
      evaluated , and MTD or RP1bD will be defined. RP1bD will be the MTD or, in the absence of&#xD;
      dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), the biologically best RT dose based on pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase Ib, patients will be treated with the MTD or RP1bD dose of RT and will follow the&#xD;
      selected schema of treatment used in the Phase Ia cohort 3 or 4. At the end of the 5th cycle,&#xD;
      patients eligible for nivolumab maintenance, will be treated with nivolumab at 240 mg Q2W&#xD;
      until progression or excessive toxicity; celecoxib will be maintained according to&#xD;
      tolerability.&#xD;

             scan will be irradiated at the investigator's discretion. It is at the discretion of&#xD;
             the investigator to exclude a metastatic site from the radiation field that, due to&#xD;
