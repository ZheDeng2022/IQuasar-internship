  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous collection of more than 100 different&#xD;
      pulmonary disorders. Surgical lung biopsie in combination with multidisciplinary discussion&#xD;
      is recommend in combination to reach a consensus diagnosis when the initial clinical&#xD;
      evaluation is inconclusive in the diagnosis of ILD. Cryobiopsy via bronchoscopy is approved&#xD;
      for lung biopsies and allows harvesting of large tissue samples of excellent. This technique&#xD;
      is not jet standardized. In this prospective randomised study the investigators want to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic yield comparing two different techniques of performing transbronchial&#xD;
      cryobiopsy. In this study would be compared a shorter freezing time and more number of&#xD;
      biopsies vs a longer freezing time and less number of biopsies.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators design a prospective randomised multicenter study to assess the diagnostic&#xD;
      value of cryobiopsy in patients with suspected Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia by comparing&#xD;
      two different interventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with suspected ILD in which the clinical, radiological and BAL-data are insufficient&#xD;
      to establish a definitive clinical diagnosis, requiring then tissue specimen to determine a&#xD;
      diagnosis would be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this all patients will undergo transbronchial cryobiopsy. If a definitive diagnosis&#xD;
      even after cryobiopsy and MDD cannot be made, SLB will be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cryobiopsies the 1.9 mm cryoprobe and ERBECRYO®2 with carbon dioxide will be used.&#xD;
      All transbronchial cryobiopsies have to be obtained of one or two lobes of the same lung and&#xD;
      in at least two different segments. The bronchopulmonary segment for the cryobiopsy will be&#xD;
      selected based on the radiological features shown on a high resolution computed tomography&#xD;
      (HRCT) of the chest. The areas with exclusively fibrotic changes should be avoided. After&#xD;
      having touched the pleura with the cryopobe, the probe is retracted one to two centimetres&#xD;
      and then in this position the freezing process will be initiated. The flexible bronchoscope&#xD;
      with the inserted cryoprobe will be removed through the rigid bronchoscope after the sample&#xD;
      was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cryobiopsies can be performed in rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. The use of a Fogarty&#xD;
      occlusion balloon is left to the discretion of the bronchoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group nº1: A total of 3 samples with a freezing time of 7 seconds at least for the first&#xD;
      biopsy and a freezing time from ≥5 seconds for the following biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group nº 2: A total of 8 samples with a freezing time of 3 seconds at least for the first&#xD;
      biopsy and a freezing time from &lt;5 seconds for the following biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preselection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Inpatients with suspected ILD based on clinical and radiological features&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inpatients with probable pulmonary sarcoidosis without hilar or mediastinal lymph node&#xD;
           enlargement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Male or female patients aged ≥18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Signed the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bleeding risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Known predisposition to bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. International randomised ratio (INR) &gt;1,5,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Platelet count &lt; 80000/ul)&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients who required full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation or double antiplatelet&#xD;
                therapy which can not be stopped as recommended before the cryobiopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Oxygen saturation &lt; 90% with supported Oxygen 2l/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Diffusing capacity (DLCO) &lt;35% or FVC&lt; 50%&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Significant pulmonary emphysema&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Severe cardiac disease (angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction in the last 6&#xD;
           month, acute hearth failure)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Documented pulmonary hypertension PAP sys &gt;50mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Typical UIP-Pattern in HRCT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited patients who present all characteristics of the inclusion criteria and none of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria and who signed the inform consent undergo cryobiopsy. All patients&#xD;
      undergo a clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical evaluation a MDD will take place. In the first MDD a provisional clinical&#xD;
      diagnose is proposed. If a transbronchial cryobiopsy is indicated by the MDD, patients are&#xD;
      randomised to the groups 1 or 2 immediate before the bronchoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the histological result is achieved, another MDD including the pathologist for&#xD;
      establishing the definitive clinical diagnose take place. As all local pathologists of the&#xD;
      participating centres are experienced in ILD, the samples are evaluated by the respective&#xD;
      pathologist. If case of uncertainty, the samples can be evaluated by a second pathologist in&#xD;
      one of the participating centres.&#xD;
