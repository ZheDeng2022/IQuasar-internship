    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial comparing fractional dose Yellow Fever vaccination to the full&#xD;
      dose among children aged 9-23 months in Uganda. Children will have immune response assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 months after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. One-fifth fractional dose (0.1 ml) administered subcutaneously B. One-half fractional dose&#xD;
      (0.25 ml) administered subcutaneously C. Full dose (0.5 ml) administered subcutaneously&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yellow fever (YF) is a potentially fatal disease causing some 29,000 - 60,000 deaths in&#xD;
      Africa alone in 2013. Vaccination with the YF vaccine is the most effective way of preventing&#xD;
      YF and a single full dose of vaccine provides life-long protection. Indeed, over half a&#xD;
      billion doses of the YF vaccine have been successfully used worldwide since its introduction&#xD;
      over 80 years ago in the 1930s, including in children &lt;2 years of age. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) recommends that YF vaccine be administered to all people ≥ 9 months of&#xD;
      age. It should be noted that four YF vaccines are prequalified for use by WHO. Between 2007&#xD;
      and 2016, more than 105 million people have been vaccinated against YF in 14 African&#xD;
      countries, including millions of children 9-24 months of age. Each year 6 million doses of YF&#xD;
      vaccine are placed into an emergency stockpile to assist in the rapid response and control of&#xD;
      outbreaks. During 2016, large outbreaks of YF in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo&#xD;
      (DRC) depleted the stockpile multiple times and led to critical shortages in YF vaccine.&#xD;
      Given the acute vaccine shortage, the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed available data&#xD;
      and determined that the use of fractional dose YF vaccination was a safe and effective option&#xD;
      for mass vaccination to control outbreaks. Fractional 1/5th dose of YF vaccine manufactured&#xD;
      by BioManguinhos, 17DD, was then used in a campaign targeting 8 million people in DRC's&#xD;
      capital city of Kinshasa. However, only persons aged 2 years of age and older were given the&#xD;
      fractional dose as there were no data regarding its use in children. To optimize vaccination&#xD;
      coverage and vaccine use in outbreak responses, studies of fractional dose YF vaccine&#xD;
      effectiveness in children less than 2 years of age were assessed as a research priority by&#xD;
      the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this critical information need, the investigators will conduct a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing fractional dose 17DD YF vaccination to the full dose among children&#xD;
      aged 9-23 months in Uganda. Exclusion criteria will include children who have previously&#xD;
      received YF vaccine or who have contraindications or precautions to YF vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of three arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. One-fifth fractional dose (0.1 ml) administered subcutaneously B. One-half fractional dose&#xD;
      (0.25 ml) administered subcutaneously C. Full dose (0.5 ml) administered subcutaneously&#xD;
&#xD;
      The one-fifth and one-half doses of YF vaccine were both recommended for further research by&#xD;
      WHO and YF vaccine experts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three large public health centers that provide vaccination through the Ministry of Health of&#xD;
      Uganda's Expanded Programme on Immunization will be selected in Kampala and nearby districts&#xD;
      as study sites. Blood samples (3 ml) will be collected from participants before vaccine&#xD;
      administration as well as at follow-up visits 4 weeks and 12 months after vaccination.&#xD;
      Presence of YF virus-specific neutralizing antibodies in the collected specimens will be&#xD;
      determined using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Seroconversion will be&#xD;
      defined as seronegative participants (&lt;1:10 titers) at enrollment who become seropositive&#xD;
      (≥1:10) at 4 week follow-up. An immune response will be defined as either participants that&#xD;
      seroconvert or participants who demonstrate a four-fold or greater change in titers between&#xD;
      the baseline and 4 week specimens, e.g. a change from 1:20 to 1:80. The proportion of&#xD;
      children seroconverting in each of the fractional dose arms will be compared to the full dose&#xD;
      arm using a non-inferiority test. The safety profile also will be described for both&#xD;
      solicited and unsolicited adverse events following immunization (AEFIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect data on all illnesses encountered by study participants during&#xD;
      the first 28 days post-vaccination to assess potential AEFI as recommended by the WHO. Since&#xD;
      almost all AEFI occur during the first 2 weeks post-vaccination, parents/guardians will be&#xD;
      interviewed at 2 weeks to determine if there are any signs and symptoms that could be&#xD;
      consistent with a serious AEFI known to be associated with YF vaccination. In addition,&#xD;
      parents will be asked to take their child's temperature twice during the day and complete a&#xD;
      structured diary card to document all of their child's signs and symptoms for pre-specified&#xD;
      and un-specified adverse events during the first 2 weeks. This will be reviewed by study&#xD;
      staff at the 2 week visit as described above. At the 4 week visit, parents/guardians will be&#xD;
      asked about illnesses during the interval between their 2 week and 4 week visits as described&#xD;
      above. In addition, parents will be reminded and instructed at all interactions during the&#xD;
      first 28 days after vaccination to call study staff anytime on the 72-hour study phone line&#xD;
      and bring their child directly to the study hospital if they develop any condition(s)&#xD;
      requiring medical attention during the first 28 days after vaccination. Any adverse events&#xD;
      observed will be reported to the national reporting system.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Verbal or written report of previous vaccination against YF&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Verbal or documented history of YF disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Contraindication for YF vaccine including:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Allergy to eggs, gelatin, or neomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Severe immune deficiency immunological including symptomatic HIV infection and&#xD;
                  HIV- infected persons with CD4 T-cell counts ≤200 cells/ mm³, primary&#xD;

                  corticosteroids (or equivalent), having received immunomodulatory or&#xD;
                  chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;

               4. History of malignant neoplasm or recent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Serious illness/fever (mild illness without fever is not an exclusion criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Administration of immunoglobulins or other blood derivative within 6 months of&#xD;
             enrollment in the study or during the study&#xD;

             YF vaccination is not a contraindication; however, if Uganda introduces&#xD;
             measles-rubella vaccine (MR), participants will not be able to receive MR on the same&#xD;
             day as YF vaccine due to possible interference between rubella and YF vaccine. In this&#xD;
