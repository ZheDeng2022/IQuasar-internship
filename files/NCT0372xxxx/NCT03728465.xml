  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma will develop brain metastases&#xD;
      during their lifetime. A possible treatment options for patients with brain metastases are&#xD;
      surgery and radiotherapy but usually for lesions in the range of &lt; 3 brain metastases. This&#xD;
      study was performed to evaluate the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with&#xD;
      stage IV melanoma with &gt; 3 symptomatic brain metastases, who are not eligible for surgery or&#xD;
      radiosurgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are a frequent problem in patients with melanoma. Up to 50% of patients with&#xD;
      unresectable metastatic melanoma will develop brain metastases during their lifetime with a&#xD;
      median overall survival of 4 months. Surgical removal or stereotactic radiosurgery of brain&#xD;
      metastases can improve overall survival in patients with a limited number of lesions, usually&#xD;
      in the range of one to three brain metastases depending on neuroanatomical localization. This&#xD;
      benefit is no longer present when considering patients with &gt; 3 brain metastases. As&#xD;
      cytotoxic chemotherapy and multiple chemotherapeutic agents show only limited activity in &gt; 3&#xD;
      brain metastases patients, immune checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab&#xD;
      offer new opportunities to improve disease outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This open label phase II study evaluates safety and efficacy of combined treatment with&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with stage IV melanoma with four or more symptomatic&#xD;
      brain metastases, who are not eligible for surgery or radiosurgery.&#xD;
