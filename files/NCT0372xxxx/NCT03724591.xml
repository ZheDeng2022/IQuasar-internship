  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rectal cancer is one of most frequently diagnosed cancers and one of the leading causes of&#xD;
      cancer death around the world. Surgery remains the main treatment for rectal cancer.&#xD;
      Anastomosis leakage (AL) is an unresolved, devastating and lethal complication after rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery and remains to be a serious difficulty for surgeons despite its causes,&#xD;
      preventions and treatments having been extensively studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve a radical dissection of lymph nodes, it is necessary to remove the central lymph&#xD;
      nodes at the root of inferior mesenteric artery(IMA) trunk.From the perspectives of lymph&#xD;
      nodes dissection and tension-free anastomosis, it is preferred to perform a high ligation of&#xD;
      IMA. However, there is still a controversy whether IMA should be high ligated or not. The&#xD;
      argument mainly focuses on whether this performance will compromise the blood perfusion of&#xD;
      the proximal limb of the anastomosis leading to the occurrence of AL. Some studies suggested&#xD;
      that a high ligation did not increase the rate of AL. There are still many surgeons prefer&#xD;
      the transection of IMA distal to the left colic artery(LCA) with the intention to preserve a&#xD;
      good blood supply of the left colon after the performance of lymph node dissection around&#xD;
      IMA. Some studies suggests that the preservation of LCA in anterior resection for mid and low&#xD;
      rectal cancer is associated with lower rates of AL. Further investigations are needed to&#xD;
      resolve the controversy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, eligible patients will be randomly allocated to receive total mesorectal&#xD;
      excision (TME) for rectal cancer either by a high ligation of IMA without preservation of&#xD;
      left colic artery or a low ligation of IMA with preservation of left colic artery.&#xD;
      Postoperative complications, including anastomosis leakage, anastomosis bleeding, will be&#xD;
      recorded. Patients will be followed up every 3 months for 2 year, every 6 months for 3 years&#xD;
      postoperatively to study the long term effects.&#xD;
