      This phase IIIb trial compares a single dose of the Cervarix vaccine in girls to 3 doses of&#xD;
      the Gardasil vaccine in young women for the prevention of human papillomavirus (HPV)&#xD;
      infection. Cervarix is a vaccine used to prevent cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and&#xD;
      18. Gardasil is vaccine used to prevent cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer caused by HPV&#xD;
      types 16 and 18 and genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. Giving only one dose of the&#xD;
      Cervarix vaccine in girls may work the same as 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccine in young women&#xD;
      in preventing HPV infection and ultimately, cervical and other HPV-related cancers.&#xD;
      Currently, many women around the world cannot get HPV vaccines because they are too&#xD;
      expensive. If this trial can show one dose given to young girls is enough to prevent cancer,&#xD;
      more girls might be able to get the vaccine.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To demonstrate that the immunogenicity (as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&#xD;
      [ELISA]) of a single dose of recombinant human papillomavirus bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) in&#xD;
      9-14 year old girls is non-inferior to the immunogenicity of three doses of quadrivalent&#xD;
      human papillomavirus (types 6, 11, 16, 18) recombinant vaccine (Gardasil), administered at 0,&#xD;
      2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women 36 months after initial vaccination, with an interim&#xD;
      analysis at 24 months after initial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the distribution of HPV -16 and HPV-18 antibodies levels, assessed at 24 and 36&#xD;
      months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14 year old girls&#xD;
      and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare rates of seroconversion based on HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels, assessed&#xD;
      at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination, following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-14&#xD;
      year old girls and three doses of Gardasil, administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year&#xD;
      old women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare geometric mean titers (GMTs), distributions, and seroconversion rates for&#xD;
      HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination,&#xD;
      following a single dose of Cervarix in 9-11 year old girls and three doses of Gardasil,&#xD;
      administered at 0, 2, and 6 months, in 18-25 year old women; to perform a similar comparison&#xD;
      restricting to 12-14 year old girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To compare GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for HPV-16 and HPV-18&#xD;
      antibodies, assessed at 1-month after vaccination and 1-year after vaccination, following a&#xD;
      single dose of Cervarix in 9-10 year old girls and a single dose of Cervarix in 11-14 year&#xD;
      old girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate whether baseline variables (e.g. geographic district, initial antibody levels,&#xD;
      date of vaccination) are associated with GMTs, distributions, and seroconversion rates for&#xD;
      HPV16 and HPV-18 antibodies, assessed at 24 and 36 months after initial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Participants 9-14 years old receive Cervarix intramuscularly (IM) at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Participants 18-25 years old receive Gardasil IM at baseline and at 2 and 6 months&#xD;
      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of trial vaccine dose(s), participants are followed up at 1, 12, 24, and 36&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
