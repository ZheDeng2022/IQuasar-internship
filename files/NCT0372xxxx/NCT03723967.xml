    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the phase II trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of a&#xD;
      combination of Durvalumab with the Carboplatin/Paclitaxel as first line treatment in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN not eligible to standard chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For recurrent or metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN), the&#xD;
      standard first-line treatment is chemotherapy by cisplatin-fluorouracil and cetuximab which&#xD;
      allows a median overall survival of 10.1 months. Due to its toxicity, this combination could&#xD;
      be proposed only to patients younger than 70 years, good PS (ECOG PS0 or PS1) and adequate&#xD;
      renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In routine practice it is estimated that the proportion of eligible patients is about two&#xD;
      third. One third of patients were ineligible to first-line chemotherapy by&#xD;
      cisplatin-fluorouracil-cetuximab. Among them, 25% due to PS2 and the others for various&#xD;
      reasons (older than 70 years, renal insufficiencyâ€¦.). For these ineligible patients, an&#xD;
      alternative chemotherapy should be proposed. The carboplatin-paclitaxel scheme with weekly&#xD;
      paclitaxel is safe for poor population and demonstrated efficacy in head and neck cancers&#xD;
      with overall survival varying from 4.9 months to 12.8 months in first line. The response rate&#xD;
      varies from 20% to 52% and is about 25% in our experience. Even for frail patients it should&#xD;
      be a safe and active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD1 demonstrated survival benefit compared with&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based first line (median OS&#xD;
      of 7.5 months versus 5.1 months and 12-month OS rate of 36.0% versus 16.6%). Safety data&#xD;
      confirm these antibodies are of interest in a population of frail patients. Only 58.9% of&#xD;
      patients experienced treatment-related adverse events with nivolumab arm and 13% of grade&#xD;
      3/4. Durvalumab, an anti-PDL1 antibody is currently tested in SCCHN with promising results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Head and neck cancers are rapidly progressive and due to the delayed action of immunotherapy,&#xD;
      and the recent demonstration that immunotherapy with anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 can be responsible&#xD;
      of hyperprogression, patients will probably benefit from addition of chemotherapy to&#xD;
      immunotherapy, mostly for patients unfit for cisplatin-fluorouracil because their poor&#xD;
      condition is often related to the cancer and a rapid response is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial proposes to study the addition of Durvalumab to chemotherapy in first line&#xD;
      treatment for frail patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to this evaluation, a run-in tolerance study in a limited number of patients to ensure&#xD;
      that the experimental treatment combination is safe.&#xD;

                  with polyangitis, Grave's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis,&#xD;

             the past 6 months.&#xD;

          -  Allogeneic organ transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented hypersensitivity to the active substance or excipient of the study drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             o Ongoing or active infection, including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that&#xD;

             surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (positive HIV 1/2 antibodies). Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined&#xD;
             as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are&#xD;
             eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to&#xD;
