  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fifty adults with mild to moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss will be fit with&#xD;
      hearing amplification using two adjustment techniques. For the &quot;audiologist fitting&quot;&#xD;
      technique, a licensed audiologist will adjust the hearing device using the standard of care&#xD;
      procedures which include adjustment and verification of output to match prescribed targets&#xD;
      (NAL-NL2) and subsequent fine tuning to optimize adjustments based on participant feedback.&#xD;
      The second technique is &quot;user-adjustment&quot; of the device consisting of adjustment to overall&#xD;
      level, high-frequency boost, and low-frequency cut by the participant while listening to&#xD;
      speech. A cross-over design will be used in which half the participants are initially fit&#xD;
      using the audiologist technique and the other half are initially fit using the user&#xD;
      self-adjustment technique. Following a seven-day field trial, participants will return to the&#xD;
      lab and the aids will be reset use the other technique. Participants will be blinded to the&#xD;
      condition. During each seven-day field trial, users will have access to a volume control,&#xD;
      Following the end of the two trials, participants will return to the lab for outcome&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
