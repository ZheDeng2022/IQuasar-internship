    <textblock>
      This study consists of two periods. The objective of Period 1 is to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      upadacitinib in combination with a 26-week corticosteroid (CS) taper regimen compared to&#xD;
      placebo in combination with a 52-week CS taper regimen, as measured by the proportion of&#xD;
      participants in sustained remission at Week 52, and to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      upadacitinib in participants with giant cell arteritis (GCA). The objective of period 2 is to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuing versus withdrawing upadacitinib in maintaining&#xD;
      remission in participants who achieved remission in Period 1.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Patient Global Satisfaction Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medications (TSQM) is a generic ePRO measure of treatment satisfaction, developed to compare treatment satisfaction between medication types and conditions. TSQM comprises of 14 items to assess 4 domains (effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction). The TSQM items are rated on a Likert scale (1 = extremely dissatisfied to 7 = extremely satisfied). Scores for each of the 4 domains range from 0 to 100, with higher scores corresponding to higher satisfaction.</description>
