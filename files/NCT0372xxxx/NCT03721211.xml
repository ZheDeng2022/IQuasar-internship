  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a PET imaging tracer as a possible means of imaging breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging agent involved in this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -[11C]Martinostat (called C-eleven-Martinostat)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this study imaging agent in patients who have breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved [11C]Martinostat as an&#xD;
      investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few&#xD;
      research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called&#xD;
      [11C]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called&#xD;
      histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids&#xD;
      that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research&#xD;
      suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators&#xD;
      are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help&#xD;
      them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide&#xD;
      treatment of breast tumors in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including&#xD;
      the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called&#xD;
      [11C]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [11C]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because&#xD;
      amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous&#xD;
      studies of [11C]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have&#xD;
      been no problems). While this is not the first time [11C]Martinostat has been used in humans,&#xD;
      it is the first study in which the investigators are using this tracer to study breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Impaired elimination (as defined as having problems with urination)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metallic foreign bodies that would be affected by the MRI magnet, or fear of enclosed&#xD;
