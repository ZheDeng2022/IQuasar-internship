  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placing the head of bed (HOB) at 0-degrees has been shown in small studies to improve blood&#xD;
      flow to the brain in patients with ischemic stroke caused by large artery occlusions, thereby&#xD;
      reducing stroke symptom worsening. This simple yet potentially impactful intervention has yet&#xD;
      to be tested in a large clinical trial in hyperacute large artery ischemic stroke patients,&#xD;
      but may provide nurses with a powerful contribution to acute stroke care that is capable of&#xD;
      preventing worsening of stroke symptoms and promoting stabilization. Because stroke is the&#xD;
      leading cause of preventable long-term disability in adults, this study may show that simple&#xD;
      methods such as 0-degree HOB positioning should be considered one of the very first actions&#xD;
      taken in the emergent management of acute ischemic stroke patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positioning of the patient during hyperacute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment is an important,&#xD;
      yet understudied aspect of nursing care that could impact the course of treatment and&#xD;
      clinical outcome. Since 1968, clinical symptom worsening in AIS patients has been documented&#xD;
      with the head of bed (HOB) elevated to 30 degrees or higher, while clinical improvement or&#xD;
      symptom stability has been noted with zero degree HOB positioning. Mechanisms for zero degree&#xD;
      HOB clinical improvement include favorable gravitational blood flow conditions and&#xD;
      recruitment of collateral blood channels, while in the case of treatment with clot-busting&#xD;
      medications, increased blood flow may allow more medication to reach occluded arteries&#xD;
      facilitating clot breakdown. Despite this, there is currently divide within the clinical&#xD;
      community about what position is best for patients, although it has been argued that zero&#xD;
      degree head positioning should be among the first steps taken to improve blood flow to the&#xD;
      brain and prevent stroke symptom worsening. The investigators have shown that elevated ICP is&#xD;
      absent in early AIS, and that pneumonia is rare using these piloted methods. However, no&#xD;
      large clinical trial has examined efficacy and safety of zero degree HOB positioning within&#xD;
      hyperacute large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke patients with potentially viable&#xD;
      brain tissue, leaving the acute stroke community confused as to what constitutes best&#xD;
      practice. ZODIAC is a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) clinical trial of&#xD;
      head positioning to determine if zero degree HOB positioning during the early phase of&#xD;
      hyperacute LVO ischemic stroke management prevents neurological symptom worsening. Mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy (MT) eligible patients (n=182) will be randomized to one of two groups: 1) Zero&#xD;
      degree HOB positioning; or, 2) thirty degree HOB positioning. The hypothesis is that optimal&#xD;
      HOB position can be determined by early neurological symptom worsening during the&#xD;
      intervention (Aim 1) prior to initiation of the thrombectomy procedure, and the investigators&#xD;
      propose that real-time deterioration may be a surrogate measure for decreased downstream&#xD;
      perfusion, potentially impacting viability of brain at risk for infarction. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      confirm that use of zero degree HOB positioning for AIS is safe. Use of this nursing measure&#xD;
      holds significant promise as an innovative adjunct method to improve AIS symptoms, and&#xD;
      ultimately reduce disability.&#xD;
