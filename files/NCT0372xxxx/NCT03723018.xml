  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether meditation is beneficial for genetic counselors&#xD;
      and genetic counseling students. The main goal is to see if meditation can help with&#xD;
      professional well-being (burnout for genetic counselors, stress for genetic counseling&#xD;
      students). The investigators will also explore whether meditation has other benefits for the&#xD;
      genetic counseling profession.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 390-420 genetic counselors and 189-210 genetic counseling&#xD;
      students. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups of roughly the same size:&#xD;
      two meditation groups and an observational group. All three groups will fill out online&#xD;
      surveys at several points in the study. The only thing the observational group will be asked&#xD;
      to do is fill out these surveys. The meditation groups will be asked to meditate for 10&#xD;
      minutes a day for 8 weeks. Participants will be provided with an app or website that&#xD;
      instructs them on how to meditate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome analyses will be done with an intention to treat approach. Outcomes will be assessed&#xD;
      using linear regression with the outcome variable as the dependent variable and baseline&#xD;
      outcome measure, baseline mindfulness, and treatment group as the independent variables.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be considered exploratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is funded by the Jane Engelberg Memorial Foundation&#xD;
