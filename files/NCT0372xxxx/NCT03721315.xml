    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether increasing health literacy among COPD patients and their&#xD;
      designated health coach during a hospital admission caused by symptoms exacerbation will lead&#xD;
      to better health outcomes including increased health quality, and lower healthcare&#xD;
      utilization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, contemporary methods to chronic disease management have failed to&#xD;
      consistently tailor approaches among patients with low health literacy. They have produced&#xD;
      mixed results in terms of successful interventions to address the needs of these populations.&#xD;
      Low health literacy is especially common in medically underserved communities, including in&#xD;
      North Philadelphia. This is reflected in the predominantly low-income and racial/ethnic&#xD;
      minority population of the patients at this medical center. Management of chronic conditions&#xD;
      such as COPD is complex. Patients with low health literacy find it especially challenging to&#xD;
      self-navigate disease management. However, there is a lack of information on approaches to&#xD;
      improve health outcomes among COPD patients with low health literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to develop and evaluate a model of interventions to improve healthcare&#xD;
      outcomes for socially disadvantaged populations. The objective is to pilot a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that evaluates the effects of an intervention that provides enhanced&#xD;
      education and material support, on adherence to care, among patients admitted for&#xD;
      COPD-related issues and their home support dyad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis is that: compared to the standard educational intervention delivered&#xD;
      by a registered nurse, the addition of an enhanced intervention (enhanced education,&#xD;
      problem-solving skills and facilitative support) and the inclusion of a patient-designated&#xD;
      support pair will result in greater adherence care and improves quality of life, especially&#xD;
      among patients with low health literacy.&#xD;
