  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will evaluate the safety, durability and efficacy of repetitive&#xD;
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) as a promising non-invasive therapeutic treatment&#xD;
      for improving memory in older adults with mild or moderate Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) who&#xD;
      have been experiencing residual memory or cognitive problems that affect daily functioning.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in both AD and TBI test non-pharmaceutical interventions that target chronic&#xD;
      symptom improvement (e.g., non- invasive brain stimulation, exercise and cognitive training).&#xD;
      In order to provide targeted therapies to patients who suffer from chronic sequela of TBI it&#xD;
      is necessary to understand mechanisms of repair within the context of an aging brain.&#xD;
      Repetitive TMS (rTMS) delivers therapeutic, noninvasive brain stimulation, is FDA-approved&#xD;
      for treatment for major depression and currently used for treatment of pain, PTSD, anxiety,&#xD;
      improvement of executive function in mild and moderate TBI, severe TBI, memory enhancement&#xD;
      and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment can induce neuronal long-term potentiation resulting in synaptic repair&#xD;
      leading to improvements in memory function through hippocampal- cortical circuits and brain&#xD;
      connectivity measured by resting state-fMRI (rs fMRI) particularly in default mode and&#xD;
      central executive network (DMN &amp; CEN). The study primarily proposes to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      rTMS to improve memory performance and to test rs-fMRI (i.e. DMN) as a potential biomarker to&#xD;
      capture response to treatment in older patients suffering with chronic symptoms related to&#xD;
      previous brain injuries (depression, PTSD etc). In addition, the study will assess other&#xD;
      established biomarkers longitudinally (e.g.,hypometabolism via PET FDG, cortical oscillation&#xD;
      via electroencephalography (EEG), Brain Derived Nerve Growth Factor (BDNF)and hippocampal&#xD;
      volume from structural MRI) to capture patient response to treatment that may signal early&#xD;
      dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with TBI who receive active rTMS treatment (rTMS_A) will: a) show significantly&#xD;
      greater improvement from baseline in memory performance post rTMS intervention compared to&#xD;
      subjects who received sham rTMS treatment (rTMS_S), and b) show stronger functional&#xD;
      connectivity within and between DMN and CEN post rTMS intervention compared to patients who&#xD;
      received sham (rTMS_S).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of Life (QOL): scores on QOL scale will improve with rTMS treatment in patients&#xD;
           who receive rTMS treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sustained Improvement: At 6-month follow-up, patients with TBI in rTMS_A group would be&#xD;
           more likely to have sustained greater brain connectivity compared to patients in the&#xD;
           rTMS_S group predicting better memory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Moderators of Response: The following variables may moderate memory function improvement&#xD;
           in patients with TBI post intervention and at 6-month follow-up: Age, health condition&#xD;
           variables (severity of symptoms at baseline, time to injury, baseline cognitive&#xD;
           performance, TBI type,comorbidities (PTSD, sleep, depression), substance abuse,&#xD;
           medication use, fatigue); physiological and biological variables (baseline hippocampal&#xD;
           volume and/or microstructure, baseline connectivity in DMN &amp; CEN, EEG resting and&#xD;
           task-related cortical oscillations, and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)&#xD;
           genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mediators of Response: To assess the mechanism of rTMS in synaptic repair/regeneration,&#xD;
           pre and post changes will be assessed in depression and PTSD measures, Plasma BDNF, FDG&#xD;
           PET hypometabolism in precuneus/posterior cingulate area, EEG resting and task-related&#xD;
           cortical oscillations, and connectivity of DLPFC (stimulation site &amp; part of CEN) with&#xD;
           other DMN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: a) To assess the efficacy of rTMS to predict improvement in memory&#xD;
      performance pre and post rTMS intervention in older patients with TBI, and b) To assess&#xD;
      rs-fMRI as a biomarker to detect these changes in memory performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To assess the mechanism of rTMS in synaptic repair/regeneration by&#xD;
      assessment of structure &amp; functional brain activity (PET/MRI, fMRI, &amp; EEG), genetic,&#xD;
      cognitive and behavioral function factors (including QOL, depression and PTSD).&#xD;

    <description>Test for visual memory and new learning: it is a hippocampal-mediated paired associates learning task. This test has twenty-one outcome measures, covering the errors made by the participant, the number of trials required to locate the pattern(s) correctly, memory scores and stages completed (Administration time 10 minutes). The main score provided is the sum of pairs reproduced over three trials (range: 0-30).

    <description>Measure of Quality of Life change following rTMS treatment. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. We will look at these standardized eight scores as outcomes measures as well as a total composite score as an outcome measure.</description>
