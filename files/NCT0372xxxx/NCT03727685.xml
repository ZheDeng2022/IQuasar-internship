  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penn Medicine has created a novel, online, evidence-based advance care planning (ACP)&#xD;
      platform through its Center for Health Care Innovation. The platform is called &quot;Our Care&#xD;
      Wishes&quot; and utilizes a 'shopping-cart' approach to ACP, allowing users to name surrogate&#xD;
      decision makers, make choices about quality of life and medical treatments, outline medical&#xD;
      wishes and organ donation, and share preferences for their end of life experience. Our Care&#xD;
      Wishes then creates an easy to read, updatable ACP document that can be electronically shared&#xD;
      with loved ones and uploaded to a patient's electronic medical record in PennChart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is believed that this platform may help to overcome engagement and infrastructure barriers&#xD;
      previously identified in the literature regarding the completion of ACP documents. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of multi-channel information dissemination regarding Our Care&#xD;
      Wishes to Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania patients admitted through two locations&#xD;
      (the Emergency Department, Silverstein 1 Admission Office) and outpatients who are seen in&#xD;
      Pre-Admission Testing (PAT). All patients visiting these two locations during the&#xD;
      intervention phase will receive a paper handout with information regarding Our Care Wishes&#xD;
      included in their customary admission folder packet. The registration representative (RR) at&#xD;
      these three locations will provide a brief explanation of the site as they check the patients&#xD;
      in, as well send the patients a direct link to the site for non-ED admits via email and text&#xD;
      message.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Registration representatives (RR) from Silverstein 1 Admission Office, the Emergency&#xD;
      Department, and the Pre Admission Testing office will be administering the intervention at&#xD;
      the three sites. The current workflow is for the RR to provide all new admits with an&#xD;
      admission packet created by Guest Services and also ask ALL patients whether they have&#xD;
      completed an Advance Directive as mandated by the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1991 with&#xD;
      little attention paid to encouraging AD completion. During the control/baseline phase of this&#xD;
      trial, this workflow will remain the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention phase, a flyer describing the Our Care Wishes platform will be added&#xD;
      to the back pocket of admission packets for patients being admitted via the Silverstein 1&#xD;
      Admission Office and the Emergency Department and for patients being seen in the Pre&#xD;
      Admission Testing office. The interventions will vary slightly between Silverstein 1/PAT and&#xD;
      the Emergency Department given concern for limited bandwidth by RR in the ED setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients admitted through Silverstein 1 and who visit PAT, they will present to the RR&#xD;
      per usual and the RR will follow the current workflow. At the point where the RR asks the&#xD;
      patient if they have an AD and if it is present, the RR will remind the patient of the&#xD;
      importance of having a document that records their care wishes. The RR will then inform the&#xD;
      patient that Penn has created a free, online resource called Our Care Wishes to help patients&#xD;
      with Advance Care Planning. The platform allows patients to upload their wishes right into&#xD;
      PennChart using their MyPennMedicine login. The RR will then show the flyer in the back&#xD;
      pocket of the admission folder to the patient. For patients being admitted via Silverstein 1&#xD;
      Admission Office and those being seen in the Pre Admission Testing office, the RR will then&#xD;
      proceed to ask patients if they would like to be sent a link to Our Care Wishes by email or&#xD;
      text. For those patients who respond affirmatively, the RR will ask for the preferred email&#xD;
      or phone number and will then complete the necessary fields to refer on&#xD;
      www.ourcarewishes.org/refer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients admitted through the Emergency Department, a weekly report will be created that&#xD;
      generates a list of admissions during the prior week along with their active PennChart email&#xD;
      address and date of death if applicable (maternal and child health will be excluded). The&#xD;
      research coordinator will email non-deceased patients 7-14 days after their admission date.&#xD;
      The email will be sent to patients with an email address in PennChart. The email will not&#xD;
      include any personally identifiable information regarding the patient or mention of their&#xD;
      recent admission/visit. The email will include high-level information regarding Our Care&#xD;
      Wishes, effectively summarizing the information that the patient received in their admission&#xD;
      folder and stating the value of ACP, along with a direct link to access Our Care Wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this process, it is estimated that the RR will spend 60-90 seconds noting the presence of&#xD;
      the handout in the admissions folder and sending the patient a direct link (for those that&#xD;
      opt-in). Frequency of the intervention will be every patient admitted via Silverstein 1&#xD;
      Admissions office and seen in Pre-Admission Testing during the intervention timeframe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week, a report will be constructed via EPIC reporting to identify the patients that are&#xD;
      admitted via these offices during this timeframe. The report will be made available to only&#xD;
      key personnel on this research study. The report will also include this information which is&#xD;
      routinely collected during the course of a hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics (date of birth, sex, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Date of death (if recorded in the EHR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place of death (if recorded in the EHR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dates of hospitalization(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information (email address and mobile phone number)MRN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unit admitted to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of AD in EHR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission source (need ED and Silver 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outside hospital transfer? (exclude if yes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mother/baby? (exclude if yes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PAT appointment date&#xD;
