  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether there is a difference in postoperative (after&#xD;
      surgery) endoscopic appearance of the sinus cavities (the way that the sinuses look through a&#xD;
      camera) between sinuses that receive one of two types of resorbable steroid eluting sinus&#xD;
      packing (a sponge-like material which dissolves within several days while releasing a&#xD;
      steroid): 1) Propel Implant or 2) Nasopore soaked with triamcinolone at the time of&#xD;
      endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis.&#xD;

      1. The Propel 'implant' is composed of small, flexible tubes which dissolve while releasing&#xD;
           Mometasone which is one type of steroid. This application has been approved for use by&#xD;
           the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Nasopore soaked with triamcinolone. This &quot;packing' is a sponge-like material which&#xD;
           dissolves while releasing triamcinolone, which is another type of steroid. Triamcinolone&#xD;
           has been approved for use topically elsewhere on the body, although the specific use of&#xD;
           Triamcinolone in the sinuses has not been approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both of these procedures are currently used regularly by Dr. Pearlman in practice at the&#xD;
      conclusion of ESS for treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. As standard of care, treatment is&#xD;
      determined intraoperatively (during surgery), at the discretion of the surgeon. In this&#xD;
      study, each subject will have both treatments (one in each cavity). The 'experimental' aspect&#xD;
      relates to directly comparing the two procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being done because there is currently a lack of consensus regarding&#xD;
      the optimal nasal packing regimen. There have been no comparison studies and practice&#xD;
      patterns vary widely. Our study looks to compare the Propel implant to Nasopore packing&#xD;
      soaked in Triamcinolone.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Each subject will have both treatments (Propel and Nasopore), with one treatment on one side and the other treatment on the opposite side.

    <masking_description>Subjects will not have access to what treatment each cavity received through randomization. The information will be available should an emergency arise that would require the treating physician to know this information in order to best treat the subject. The subjects right to access this information will be reinstated when the study period is over (12 weeks after surgery).</masking_description>

    <measure>Change from Pre-operative score in Patient's nasal endoscopy, as measured by Perioperative Sinus Endoscopy (POSE) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operatively; Post-operatively at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Validated endoscopy grading score.The score is calculated by determining several characteristics of the appearance of the sinus cavities. The score ranges from 0-32 (or 0-40 if frontal and sphenoid sinuses are opened at the time of surgery). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-operatively; Post-operatively at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The score is calculated by determining the amount of polyp, edema, and secretion in the nasal cavity on both sides. The score ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</description>
