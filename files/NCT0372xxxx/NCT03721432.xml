      -  Background: The previous reports tried to reduce shivering and improve neuroaxial&#xD;
           anesthesia characteristics by the systemic use of different drugs. This study was&#xD;
           directed to evaluate the effect of pregabalin premedication on both shivering and&#xD;
           epidural outcome data following single shot loading.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and Methods: Eighty patients, ASA grade I and II, undergoing surgeries under&#xD;
           epidural anesthesia were studied. The patients were divided into two groups: Pregabalin&#xD;
           group and Control group in which the patients received 150 mg of pregabalin and placebo&#xD;
           capsules respectively sixty minutes prior to surgery. Following epidural loading, the&#xD;
           onset and degree of shivering were compared between the two groups. Also, the epidural&#xD;
           outcome including onset, level and duration were traced and compared. The perioperative&#xD;
           hemodynamics, sedation scores, patient satisfaction and side effects were followed up&#xD;
           and registered.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After obtaining the ethical committee approval of Beni Suef University hospital, in Egypt and&#xD;
      an informed consent from the patients, Eighty female patients with an American society of&#xD;
      Anesthegiologists physical status (ASA) I-II who were undergoing gynecological surgery&#xD;
      (Posterior repair and transobturator transfixation) under epidural anesthesia, were enrolled&#xD;
      in this randomized double -blind study in May 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were excluded from the study if ASA class was more than II, anticipated&#xD;
      difficult epidural insertion or there was any contraindication to epidural anesthesia, if any&#xD;
      patient developed wet or bloody tab, or the patients were under psychotropic or antiepileptic&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 80 Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups (using sealed opaque numbered&#xD;
      envelopes indicating the group of each patient, carried out by an independent&#xD;
      anesthesiologist and given to the ward nurse) [40 patients in each group]:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregabalin group (P), [n=40]: received pregabalin 150 mg capsules (Lyrica®,Pfizer) sixty&#xD;
           minutes prior to the epidural insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group (C), [n=40]: received placebo capsules sixty minutes prior to epidural&#xD;
           insertion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to administration of study drugs, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR),&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SpO2), and tympanic temperature (T temp) were taken as [baseline reading].&#xD;
      Upon reaching the operation theater, a second set of readings were taken [preoperative&#xD;
      reading], together with sedation score using a 4 points &quot;Modified Wilson&quot; Sedation Scale&#xD;
      [1=awake; 2=drowsy but arousable to command; 3= asleep but arousable to mild physical&#xD;
      stimulation; and 4= asleep but not arousable to mild physical stimulation].&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the operating table and after attaching the standard monitoring [5 lead ECG, pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, non-invasive arterial blood pressure], the epidural anesthesia was standardized for&#xD;
      all patients. After intravenous infusion of 500 ml of lactated Ringer's solution in a&#xD;
      wide-bore canula, the epidural catheter was inserted in a lateral position. Following the&#xD;
      exclusion of both subarachnoid and intravascular insertion of the catheter, a loading&#xD;
      epidural dose of 10 ml levo-bupivacaine 0.5% and 50 mcg fentanyl were injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic readings [MAP, HR and SpO2] were monitored and registered every 5 minutes (as&#xD;
      routine practice) and tympanic temperature [T temp] was taken upon arrival to operating room,&#xD;
      after activation of epidural, then every 15 minutes till the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperatively, arterial blood pressure was maintained within 20 % of the baseline readings&#xD;
      using intravenous boluses of Lactated Ringer's solution and 6 mg increments of ephedrine (if&#xD;
      required). Bradycardia (HR less than 60 beats per minutes) was treated with intravenous&#xD;
      atropine boluses 0.6 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, all patients were active warmed using a convection machine (hot air blower).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering (as a primary outcome) was graded by a blinded observer during the intraoperative&#xD;
      and postoperative period using the scale validated by Crossley and Mahajan and Tsai and Chu:&#xD;
      [0= no shivering, 1= piloerection or peripheral vasoconstriction but no visible shivering, 2=&#xD;
      muscular activity in only one muscle group, 3= muscular activity in more than one muscle&#xD;
      group but not generalized shivering, 4= shivering involving the whole body]. Grades 3, and 4&#xD;
      shivering for at least 3 minutes were considered positive, and maximum shivering was&#xD;
      considered if generalized shivering interfering with ECG monitoring. Positive shivering or&#xD;
      lower grade shivering but described as distressful by the patient were treated with&#xD;
      intravenous administration of meperidine 20 mg. If no improvement after this management, the&#xD;
      patient was excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the selection of safe and effective anti-shivering treatment, the medications were&#xD;
      revised and meperidine in this small dose was picked up due to its effectiveness in treatment&#xD;
      and the epidural parameters will not be significantly affected when compared to ketanserine,&#xD;
      doxapram, clonidine, magnesium, ketamine, orphenadrine, methylphenidate, pentazocin and&#xD;
      nefopam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of surgery, the patients were transferred to PACU (for one hour), where&#xD;
      hemodynamics and tympanic temperature were taking (every 15 minutes). Shivering was also&#xD;
      observed and scaled and treated the same way as intraoperatively. Patients were only&#xD;
      discharged from PACU if modified Aldrete score was ≥ 9 after registering and treating any&#xD;
      other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, when the patients started to experience pain at the surgical site and&#xD;
      according to the acute pain management protocol by the anesthesia department in the hospital,&#xD;
      a loading of levo-bupivacaine 0.125% 8 ml was given followed by infusion of levo-bupivacaine&#xD;
      0.125% and fentanyl 2mcg/ ml at a rate of 6 ml/hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any perioperative complications (e.g. bradycardia, hypotension, desaturation or nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting) were observed, registered and treated appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following were observed (by anaesthetist blinded to the studied drugs):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic data (age, weight and height), duration of surgery (in minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tympanic temperature (T temp.) in Celsius degree as baseline (before drug intake),&#xD;
           preoperative (on arrival to operating room), after epidural loading, then every 15&#xD;
           minutes intraoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shivering (as a primary outcome): incidence of positive shivering (at any time),&#xD;
           incidence of maximum shivering (at any time) and median and range of shivering severity&#xD;
           between the two studied groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sedation: assessed 60 minutes after studied drug in take (preoperatively).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural characteristics (as secondary outcome): onset of the block (the time from&#xD;
           epidural loading until feeling of numbness in the lower extremities), duration of the&#xD;
           block (the time from the onset till starting feeling of pain at the surgical site) and&#xD;
           level of the block (assessed by the ice technique).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Meperidine consumption: total consumed dose of meperidine in both groups.&#xD;
