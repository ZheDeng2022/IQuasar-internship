  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality rate of lung cancer is the highest in the world. Current studies&#xD;
      have found that tumor markers, inflammatory or nutritional indicators have a good predictive&#xD;
      value for the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Neuron specific&#xD;
      enolase (NSE) and serum albumin (Alb) are important indicators for monitoring tumor&#xD;
      progression and nutritional status in lung cancer patients, respectively. Previous studies&#xD;
      suggested that the higher the NSE, the worse prognosis of NSCLC patients, while the lower the&#xD;
      Alb, the worse the prognosis of patients with malignant tumors. Through a retrospective&#xD;
      study, the investigators found that NAR (NSE Alb Ratio) was higher and prognosis was poorer&#xD;
      in patients undergoing NSCLC surgery. This is better than the previous assessment indicators&#xD;
      PLR (platelet to lymphocyte ratio), NLR (neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio), AGR (albumin to&#xD;
      globulin ratio), NAR can better assess prognosis. Therefore, on the basis of the previous&#xD;
      retrospective analysis, the optimal NAR cut-off value was calculated according to ROC curve,&#xD;
      and the value was grouped into multi-center prospective cohort study, and the relationship&#xD;
      between NAR and other clinical indicators was studied by chi-square test. Univariate and&#xD;
      multivariate analysis of Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to determine the&#xD;
      prognostic factors. Finally, NSCLC patients were stratified according to tumor stage and&#xD;
      pathological classification, and the differences of survival time between high NAR group and&#xD;
      low NAR group were compared again under different stages and types, and the different stages&#xD;
      of NAR in NSCLC patients were further analyzed. The clinical significance of typing. By&#xD;
      exploring and validating the relationship between NAR and the prognosis of NSCLC patients,&#xD;
      the investigators try to establish a new prognostic index. Obviously, it has important value&#xD;
      for clinical application.&#xD;

    <description>Previous studies have shown that inflammation and nutrition-related factors such as CRP/Alb (C-reactive protein-albumin ratio), PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) can help to assess the prognosis of malignant tumors. This study is the first time to combine NSCLC tumor marker NSE and patient nutrition-related indicators Alb to predict the prognosis of patients, trying to find high sensitivity and specificity for NSCLC prognostic indicators to guide clinical work.</description>
