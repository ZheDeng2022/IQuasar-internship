    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a prevalent and under-recognized disorder in adolescence, particularly in girls,&#xD;
      with long-term repercussions for mental and physical health. This study assesses&#xD;
      manifestation of autonomic hyperarousal and vulnerability to insomnia using a sample of male&#xD;
      and female adolescents with and without Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) Insomnia&#xD;
      Disorder. Outcomes from this study have the potential to inform prevention and treatment&#xD;
      interventions for insomnia that can be implemented at a young age before chronic negative&#xD;
      sequelae of this common disorder manifest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is highly prevalent in adolescence, particularly in post-pubertal girls and tends to&#xD;
      persist over time. Insomnia is considered a hyperarousal disorder, in which abnormally&#xD;
      elevated levels of cognitive and physiological activation, particularly evident at bed-time,&#xD;
      prevent individuals from falling asleep and having a restorative night's sleep. Hyperarousal&#xD;
      is a major pathophysiological mechanism linking insomnia with poor mental and physical&#xD;
      health, including cardiovascular (CV) disease. The investigators and others have shown&#xD;
      evidence of autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction such as hyperactivation of the&#xD;
      sympathetic branch of the ANS - a major etiological factor in CV disease - in young and&#xD;
      midlife adults, both before and during sleep. It is unknown if ANS hyperarousal is evident in&#xD;
      adolescents with insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological basis for an emerging sex difference in insomnia prevalence in adolescence is&#xD;
      unknown. The investigators' pilot data reveal intriguing evidence of sex-differences in basic&#xD;
      and stress-dependent ANS modulation during sleep in adolescents with girls showing a greater&#xD;
      ANS response to stress. These data suggest the existence of a predisposing and&#xD;
      stress-dependent ANS vulnerability in female adolescents, a potential pathway to develop&#xD;
      insomnia. This study takes a novel approach to investigating the manifestation of&#xD;
      physiological ANS and CV hyperarousal in adolescents with insomnia by experimentally&#xD;
      manipulating the pre-sleep arousal state via stress-induced ANS up-regulation and&#xD;
      relaxation-driven ANS down-regulation. In addition, the study focuses on sex differences in&#xD;
      ANS and CV responses to pre-sleep ANS manipulation, potentially addressing the question of&#xD;
      why female sex is a major risk factor for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to test 110 male and female high-school students (16-20y) with and&#xD;
      without DSM-5 Insomnia Disorder, during a regular in-lab polysomnographic night (baseline)&#xD;
      and under experimental pre-sleep stress (psychosocial stressor) and pre-sleep relaxation&#xD;
      (Virtual reality ANS bio-feedback) intervention nights, using state-of-the-art, noninvasive,&#xD;
      beat-to-beat ANS and CV measures, including blood pressure, to assess nocturnal ANS and CV&#xD;
      function in adolescents with insomnia (Aim 1); the impact of pre-sleep ANS arousal levels on&#xD;
      nocturnal ANS and CV function, and sleep in adolescents with and without insomnia,&#xD;
      considering possible sex differences (Aim 2), and the extent to which nocturnal ANS and CV&#xD;
      function mediate the effect of pre-sleep arousal levels on objective and perceived sleep&#xD;
      quality (Aim 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the potential to elucidate pathophysiological ANS hyperarousal underlying&#xD;
      Insomnia Disorder in adolescence, including potential reasons for the vulnerability to&#xD;
      insomnia in girls, leading to better recognition and potentially new treatment strategies of&#xD;
      this disorder targeted at the state of ANS hyperarousal in the pre-sleep period.&#xD;
