      of stage IV NSCLC, at diagnosis (treatment naïve) and at the moment of progression to&#xD;
      EGFR-TKIs. This study is non-indication seeking (NIS), descriptive in nature and does not&#xD;

      Objectives and Hypotheses : The objectives of this study are to evaluate molecular testing&#xD;
      and treatment patterns for EGFR mutation in two different cohorts of stage IV NSCLC, at&#xD;
      diagnosis (treatment naïve) and at the moment of progression to EGFR-TKIs. This study is&#xD;
      non-indication seeking (NIS), descriptive in nature and does not attempt to test any specific&#xD;
      a priori hypotheses. The following study objectives will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate parameters associated with molecular testing patterns at diagnosis of&#xD;
           advance disease and progression to EGFR TKIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate parameters associated with treatment patterns at frontline and at&#xD;
           progression to a EGFR TKI therpay&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the rate of central nervous system (CNS) metastases at diagnosis and after&#xD;
           disease progression in EGFR+ NSCLC patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate parameters associated with biopsy related complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be an observational retrospective study of patients with Stage IV&#xD;
      NSCLC in two different cohorts from participating sites in Uruguay, Argentina, Costa Rica,&#xD;
      Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Republica Dominicana. Cohort 1: newly diagnosed Stage IV NSCL who&#xD;
      are treatment naive Cohort 2: stage IV NSCLC EGFRm progressed after first or second&#xD;
      generation EGFR-TKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data of patients meeting the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be collected from&#xD;
      diagnosis of Satge IV (cohort 1) or diagnosis of progression after first or second generation&#xD;
      EGFR-TKI (cohort 2) until the maximum follow up registered in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and entered in the electronic case report form (eCRF). All data will&#xD;
      be collected using patient medical records. The investigator will be responsible for ensuring&#xD;
      that all the required data is collected and entered into the eCRF. The site will collect the&#xD;
      data that will be uploaded according to the data entry procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      1: all registered cases of stage IV NSCLC patients, treatment naïve, diagnosed in the&#xD;
      participant institution during one year (from Jan 1st 2017 to Dec 31st 2017). Cohort 2: all&#xD;
      EGFR positive patients progressed to an EFGR-TKI in the same period of time (from Jan 1st&#xD;
      2017 to Dec 31st 2017)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case one patient meets eligibility criteria for both cohorts, this patient will be&#xD;
      included only in the EFGR-TKI progressed cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposures There are no specific drug exposures or interventions being evaluated, as cohort&#xD;
      eligibility is not exposure-based, but rather disease-based.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographic and clinical characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular testing rates at Stage IV and at progression to EGFR TKI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Molecular testing EGFR mutation results (common/uncommon mutations at advanced&#xD;
           diagnosis, and T790M at progression)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment patterns at frontline and progression to EGFR TKIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy-related complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patinets presenting with CNS metastasis at diagnosis of stage IV and at&#xD;
           progression to EGFR TKIsCNS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients diagnosed with Stage IV NSCLC at diagnosis and at progression to an EGFR-TKI;&#xD;
      from January 1st , 2017 to December 31st, 2017 in selected centers of Uruguay, Argentina,&#xD;
      Chile, Colombia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis No formal hypothesis testing is specified. Study measures including&#xD;
      patient demographics and clinical characteristics, molecular testing rates and patterns,&#xD;
      treatment patterns. Continuous study measures (e.g., age) will be reported descriptively with&#xD;
      mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be&#xD;
      used to document categorical measures of interest (e.g., number and proportion of patients&#xD;
      with a molecular test, number and proportion of patients with a EGFR mutation) and will&#xD;
      include 95% CIs for key outcome variables.&#xD;
