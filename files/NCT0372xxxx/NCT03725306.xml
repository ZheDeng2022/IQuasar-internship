    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the endometrial&#xD;
      ablation device Librata in reducing menstrual blood loss at 12 months post-treatment when&#xD;
      used in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia due to benign causes for whom childbearing is&#xD;
      complete.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menorrhagia is ovulatory (cyclic), heavy bleeding, that should be treated when it interferes&#xD;
      with quality of life or causes anemia. It is a common problem and it is estimated that 5% of&#xD;
      women aged 30 to 49 seek referral for evaluation and treatment. No structural cause is found&#xD;
      in the majority of women with menorrhagia and treatment intends to reduce blood loss and&#xD;
      improve quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First line treatment is medical therapy with hormonal therapy using either the combined&#xD;
      contraceptive pill or the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system. These treatments are&#xD;
      not suitable for all women and indeed some women may not find them acceptable. For these&#xD;
      women, surgical management is then offered with either endometrial ablation or hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical success defined as a&#xD;
      reduction of menstrual bleeding, defined as a score of 75 or less or 50% reduction from&#xD;
      baseline on the Menstrual Pictogram scoring diary at 12 months post-treatment. Additionally,&#xD;
      a secondary objective is to determine the primary safety incidence of serious adverse events&#xD;
      (SAEs) by 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, controlled trial to&#xD;
      demonstrate that the percentage of subjects with reduction in menstrual bleeding at 12 months&#xD;
      is significantly greater than 66%. A total of 200 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include pre-menopausal women, aged 25-50 with a history of&#xD;
      menorrhagia due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.&#xD;
