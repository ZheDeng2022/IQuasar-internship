      Data role of salivary inflammatory markers in migraine and Tension Type headache (TTH) are&#xD;
      lacking. Τhe investigators studied whether headache attacks are associated with changes in C&#xD;
      reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin -1β and Interleukin -6 in saliva in patients with Tension&#xD;
      Type Headache and Migraine and age matched healthy controls . Τhe investigators, also&#xD;
      investigated whether these markers could be influenced by comorbidities such as depression&#xD;
      and anxiety.&#xD;

      Sixty subjects of both genders, aged from 18 to 60 years old, with primary headaches TTH and&#xD;
      migraine, according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition&#xD;
      (beta version), were enrolled from the outpatient headache clinic of University Hospital of&#xD;
      Athens between January to March 2016. 30 healthy control subjects aged matched were recruited&#xD;
      mainly from hospital staff and patients' relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, the participants completed the Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), Scale Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory (BDI). All patients had to keep a headache diary during the four-week run-in&#xD;
      period. All headache suffers were instructed to collected salivary headache-free baseline&#xD;
      samples at the time of study screening when they had been free of headache for at least 48&#xD;
      hours (time point A). All headache suffers collected additional samples during&#xD;
      moderate/severe headache (time point B), and at self-defined resolution phase 24 hours of&#xD;
      their headache attack (time point C). Healthy control subjects were instructed to collected&#xD;
      samples at the time of study screening (time point D). Every week, until four weeks and one&#xD;
      month after the end of the study, participants were contacted, in order to ensure the&#xD;
      compliance and the appropriate use of the technique. One year later longitudinal data would&#xD;
      also be obtain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Saliva Sample Collection Detailed instructions for the correct collection of saliva samples&#xD;
      were given to all participants. Such instructions include avoiding eating a major meal and&#xD;
      teeth brushing 60 minutes prior to sample collection. Also consumption of high sugar and&#xD;
      caffeine content foods as well as high acidity foods have to be excluded before saliva sample&#xD;
      collection. Mouth rinse with water in order to remove any food residue and saliva sample&#xD;
      collection at least 10 minutes after mouth rinse was recommended. Unstimulated whole saliva&#xD;
      that pooled on the mouth floor were collected from patients and healthy volunteers in high&#xD;
      quality polypropylene vials by the passive drool technique. Finally, all samples were stored&#xD;
      in a plastic container at 2-4 ° C until analysis. Saliva was collected from the participants,&#xD;
      at 8.00 a.m. in the morning in order to rule out any confounding factor caused by circadian&#xD;
      rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Analysis Morning samples were kept in the refrigerator at 4°C and at the end of the&#xD;
      day were brought to the laboratory where they were centrifuged 3000 rpm at 4°C and the&#xD;
      supernatant was aliquoted in to polypropylene Cryogenic vials. Vials were frozen in -80°C&#xD;
      until analyzed. Saliva transferrin levels were measured by competitive immunoassay kits and&#xD;
      Interleukin-6, Interleukin-1β and CRP levels were measured by sandwich ELISA kits.&#xD;
      Transferrin levels were used as a screening tool for the presence of blood in saliva samples&#xD;
      and samples with transferrin values greater than 1 mg/dl were considered as candidates for&#xD;
      exclusion in other salivary assays. Cortisol assay has a sensitivity of &lt; 0.007 μg/ml and an&#xD;
      inter-assay coefficient of variation of &lt; 11% while these characteristics are 0.07 pg/ml and&#xD;
      8 for Interleukin-6, 0.37 pg/ml and 7 for Interleukin-1β, 10 pg/ml and 11.2 for CRP as well&#xD;
      as 0.08 mg/dl and 7.2 for transferrin respectively.&#xD;
