      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study in preparation for the main multicentre randomised trial, which&#xD;
      is anticipated to have two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: the current best standard of care [rehabilitation exercises]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: the current best standard of care [rehabilitation exercises] + the experimental&#xD;
           intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this feasibility trial the following aspects will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment rates [that is also willingness to be randomised]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of providing the experimental intervention at the NHS study sites&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Retention rate/drop out rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility and acceptability of (i) proposed primary outcome [patient-centred], (ii) a&#xD;
           range of additional patient-centred and clinician-centred outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard deviation of the proposed primary outcome so to inform sample size calculation&#xD;
           of the main trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety/toxicity of the study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of trial: Multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial in 50 patients with&#xD;
      radiotherapy-induced fibrosis of the head and neck.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Participants over the age of 18, with radiotherapy-induced fibrosis of the head and neck will&#xD;
      be given information about the trial and invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 participants who consent will be recruited and randomised to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with pentoxifylline 400 mg tablets twice a day [total 800mg/day] + 500IU&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibrosis is a common and irreversible adverse effect of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is used&#xD;
      with curative intent in most individuals (~70%) with head and neck cancer (HNC), often in&#xD;
      combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy. It is estimated that up to 60% of these&#xD;
      individuals will experience persistent fibrosis as a toxic effect of the radiotherapy&#xD;
      including trismus and dysphagia. As 680,000 new HNC cases/year are diagnosed worldwide, it is&#xD;
      estimated that approximately 270,000 individuals will develop persistent trismus and/or&#xD;
      dysphagia, with consequent reduced quality of life (QoL) due to impaired talking, eating,&#xD;
      chewing and swallowing. Malnutrition, psychological and social issues add further suffering&#xD;
      to affected individuals. Mortality is also significantly increased due to aspiration&#xD;
      pneumonia. In the UK there are ~10,000 new H&amp;N cancer cases/year, which translates into&#xD;
      approximately 4,200 individuals experiencing radiotherapy-induced fibrosis (RIF) every year.&#xD;
      Increasing incidence rates of H&amp;N cancer suggest that these figures will increase over the&#xD;
      next few years. This group of cancer survivors represent a challenge for the NHS: they have a&#xD;
      chronic condition reducing their quality of life and no realistic therapeutic option as no&#xD;
      intervention has proven long-term effective. Current best NHS practice consists of&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy (exercises). Although available literature suggests potential&#xD;
      efficacy, evidence is very weak: relevant benefits seem to be short-lived, the effect size is&#xD;
      usually small, and compliance with treatment is often poor. As preparatory work for this&#xD;
      proposal we have performed a systematic review of the literature, which shows that five&#xD;
      prospective studies investigated rehabilitation exercises, pentoxifylline and botulinum A in&#xD;
      the therapy of post-RT trismus. Four prospective studies investigated rehabilitation&#xD;
      exercises and electrical stimulation in the therapy of post-RT dysphagia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall studies were at high risk of bias, and there was very limited evidence supporting the&#xD;
      efficacy of the above interventions in the post-RT setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remains little ongoing clinical research in this field at the present moment (clinical&#xD;
      trials databases searched in March 2018). Most ongoing recruiting studies focus on preventive&#xD;
      strategies during HNC radiotherapy. In terms of trials aimed at reducing established post-RT&#xD;
      fibrosis, we could only find one recruiting Canadian study on manual therapy and one American&#xD;
      study on self-care program, with no UK study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIF has been traditionally considered an irreversible disorder characterised by the&#xD;
      generation of reactive oxygen species, vascular damage, pro-fibrotic inflammation, promotion&#xD;
      of collagen formation and the development of excessive fibrous tissue. However research&#xD;
      during the last 15 years has shown that co-administration of pentoxifylline and tocopherol&#xD;
      (vitamin E) can reduce and reverse the fibrotic process. Pentoxifylline is known to improve&#xD;
      microcirculation, inhibit fibroblast proliferation, reduce extracellular matrix production,&#xD;
      and increase collagenase activity. Tocopherol (Vitamin E) has antioxidant properties. The&#xD;
      precise mechanisms by which the pentoxifylline/tocopherol (vitamin E) combination interacts&#xD;
      with fibro-atrophic tissues and induces fibrotic process reversibility are still unclear. It&#xD;
      has been suggested that the anti-fibrotic effects are consequence of the inhibition of&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix production, increased collagenase activity,&#xD;
      as well as a reduction in reactive oxygen species. Clinical trials have indicated that the&#xD;
      combination of pentoxifylline and tocopherol (vitamin E) can decrease and even reverse RIF in&#xD;
      individuals irradiated to the breast, pelvis, lung, and prostate, leading to functional and&#xD;
      aesthetic benefits. It is not known whether this therapy may have similar beneficial effects&#xD;
      in HNC survivors with permanent RIF (trismus and/or dysphagia). Preliminary small-scale&#xD;
      studies suggest that this may be the case, and support the notion that pentoxifylline and&#xD;
      tocopherol (vitamin E) represent a promising treatment that is worth investigating in&#xD;
      well-designed clinical trials. The best available evidence comes from a 2001 uncontrolled,&#xD;
      small (16 subjects) pilot study that showed functional improvement in subjects with&#xD;
      established post-radiotherapy trismus after an 8-week course of pentoxifylline as&#xD;
      monotherapy. Other studies have reported the beneficial effects of pentoxyfilline monotherapy&#xD;
      or in combination with tocopherol (vitamin E) in reducing and/or preventing RIF in HNC, but&#xD;
      these focused on cutaneous/subcutaneous neck fibrosis and did not measure trismus/dysphagia.&#xD;
      There is a clear need for better-designed clinical research as more robust evidence is&#xD;
      required in order to influence changes in NHS practice and improve the quality of life of HNC&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study will be a multicentre randomised controlled trial with two arms including the&#xD;
      experimental intervention plus the current best standard treatment versus the current best&#xD;
      treatment as comparator [1:1]. The main outcome will be anticipated to be patient-centred and&#xD;
      measured via a validated instrument (QoL questionnaire), with secondary outcomes including&#xD;
      other patient-centred measures (validated functional questionnaires) as well as&#xD;
      clinician-rated and instrumental outcomes. However several aspects of the main trial remain&#xD;
      unknown/unclear and would require clarification via a feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PITSTOP is a feasibility 36-month randomised trial of the best standard therapy alone&#xD;
      [rehabilitation exercises] vs treatment with pentoxifylline and tocopherol (vitamin E) in&#xD;
      addition to best standard therapy (rehabilitation exercises) in 50 participants with&#xD;
      radiotherapy-induced fibrosis of the head and neck. It is a two-centre study with a 1:1&#xD;
      randomisation into two study arms. At each site a blocked randomisation list will be used to&#xD;
      ensure an approximate balance in numbers between the two groups. Allocation concealment will&#xD;
      be ensured using an online randomisation service (Sealed Envelope).&#xD;
