  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is the safest and most accessible,&#xD;
      non-invasive brain stimulation technique available for testing causal links between different&#xD;
      brain regions and functions, by manipulating cognitive abilities. By identifying key&#xD;
      experimental factors that can improve the reliability and robustness of stimulation effects&#xD;
      on cognitive performance in different age groups, this project should lead to the widespread&#xD;
      adoption of these design features in future applications. This study will investigate the&#xD;
      extent to which tDCS to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (or dlPFC) impacts recollection&#xD;
      accuracy and working memory performance as a function of time-of-day in younger and older&#xD;
      adults. Moreover, this study will test the extent that tDCS to dlPFC impacts memory&#xD;
      performance by impacting information-specific processes and/or cognitive control processes&#xD;
      that operate across different types of information, thereby informing basic theories of how&#xD;
      dlPFC contributes to memory in younger and older adults.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Episodic memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>This task is performed immediately after tDCS is administered, and lasts approximately 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>To measure episodic memory performance, participants will perform a recollection task. They will first study picture and word stimuli (encoding phase). On the subsequent memory test (retrieval phase), participants will be asked to differentiate between studied and non-studied items, as well as recollecting the previous format for studied items (i.e. recollecting the picture or word). For each tested item, participants will also be asked to make a confidence judgement about their response. The primary dependent variable (DV) will be recollection accuracy: the proportion of correctly recollected studied items minus the non-studied item baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Working memory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>This task lasts approximately 10 minutes and is performed immediately after the episodic memory task (approximately 20 minutes after the end of the tDCS session).</time_frame>
    <description>To measure working memory performance, participants will perform two versions of the N-back task -- a verbal version (i.e., presenting the numbers 1-9 in a varied sequence) and a visuospatial version (i.e., presenting a colored square in one of 9 locations on a 3x3 grid in a varied sequence). The primary DV will be working memory accuracy: proportion of targets correctly identified minus the proportion of lures incorrectly endorsed.</description>

             - with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For individuals in the 'younger adults' group, must be between 18 and 30 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For individuals in the 'older adults' group, must be between 60 and 75 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of 23 or above on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (out of 30,&#xD;
             education-corrected) is required. This is to minimize the inclusion of suspected mild&#xD;
             cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, targeting individuals that score in the normal&#xD;
             range according to the recent meta-analysis of MoCA's ability to differentiate normal&#xD;
             aging from MCI in Carson et al. (2018, Int. J of Geriatric Psychiatry).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance above threshold on the episodic memory task during the baseline session.&#xD;
             The threshold is defined as having a hit rate that is at least 5% greater than the&#xD;
             false alarm rate, where hit rate is defined as the number of studied items identified&#xD;
             as studied, divided by the total number of studied items, and false alarm rate is&#xD;
             defined as the number of new items identified as studied, divided by the total number&#xD;
             of new items. We don't anticipate this threshold to exclude many, if any subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neuropsychological conditions associated with cognitive decline or seizure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cochlear implants or metal in the brain/skull (except titanium)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals above a threshold score on an assessment of depression, specifically, a&#xD;
             score of 10 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)(Manea et al., 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Risk of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low tolerance of skin irritation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior brain stimulation experience (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A prior positive diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) or strongly&#xD;
             suspected diagnosis resulting from symptoms of COVID-19&#xD;
