  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TAK-079 in comparison&#xD;
      with matching placebo, administered once every 3 weeks over a 12-week dosing period in&#xD;
      participants with active SLE who are receiving stable background therapy for SLE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAK-079 is being tested in a study population with moderate to severe SLE. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and biologic activity of TAK-079 or matching placebo in combination with&#xD;
      stable SLE background therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 24 participants across 3 sequentially enrolling cohorts.&#xD;
      Each cohort will enroll 8 participants, where 6 participants will be assigned to TAK-079&#xD;
      injection, and 2 participants will be assigned to Placebo. Participants will receive TAK-079&#xD;
      or matching placebo in combination with principal investigator directed background therapy&#xD;
      for SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make&#xD;
      multiple visits to the clinic, and will be followed up for the safety assessment for the&#xD;
      additional 12 weeks up to Week 24 after receiving their last dose of study drug. Based on the&#xD;
      clinical assessments, participants may complete or may advance to long-term safety follow up&#xD;
      period for an additional 12-week safety monitoring period up to Week 36.&#xD;
