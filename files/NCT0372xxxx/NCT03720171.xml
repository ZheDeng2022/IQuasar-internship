  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The e-OPRA Implant System, is a further development of the OPRA (Osseointegrated Prostheses&#xD;
      for the Rehabilitation of Amputees) Implant System, approved under HDE (Humanitarian Device&#xD;
      Exemption) H080004. The e-OPRA Implant system is an implant system for direct skeletal&#xD;
      anchorage of amputation prostheses. The added feature in the e-OPRA Implant system, is a&#xD;
      bidirectional interface into the human body that allows permanent and reliable communication&#xD;
      using implanted electrodes. These electrodes will provide long-term stable bioelectric&#xD;
      signals for an improved control of the prosthetic limb. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of a lower limb amputee with the e-OPRA Implant System exhibiting&#xD;
      full neural control over a neuro-mechanical prosthetic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of six subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will undergo a surgery where the&#xD;
      e-OPRA Implant System will be implanted. The subjects will participate in follow-up sessions&#xD;
      of which the last one occurs approximately 24 months after the surgery. This is a&#xD;
      prospective, non-randomized, uncontrolled study.&#xD;

    <measure>Preferred walking speed</measure>

    <description>Preferred walking speed, as each subject ambulates with the neuromechanical prosthesis, will be evaluated. Preferred walking speed will be compared to a non-amputee height/weight match for each enrolled subject. A baseline data set will first be collected for each subject ambulating with a conventional prosthesis. Each subject will be timed as they traverse a predetermined distance at a steady speed that they deem most comfortable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A potential subject will be included in the study if she/he meets all of the following&#xD;
        inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or Female age 22-65 at the time of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have a medical condition requiring performance of a unilateral&#xD;
             transfemoral amputation with a minimum of 13 cm of residual femur after amputation,&#xD;
             and:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A: At a minimum level of amputation of 20 cm or greater above the knee joint line if&#xD;
        physical therapy and prosthetist evaluation is commensurate with a standard K3 ambulatory&#xD;
        status; or, B: At a minimum level of amputation of 16 cm above the knee joint line as part&#xD;
        of a single-stage procedure if physical therapy and prosthetist evaluation is commensurate&#xD;
        with a more active K3 or less active K4 postoperative ambulatory status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have undergone independent consultation with at least two lower&#xD;
             extremity surgical specialists to ensure they have exhausted all limb salvage options&#xD;
             prior to undergoing amputation, as well as a psychiatric evaluation to ensure&#xD;
             appropriate capacity and volition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have the ability to ambulate at variable cadence (an expected lower&#xD;
             extremity prosthesis functional level of K3 or above).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must have adequate bone stock to support the implanted device.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigators, normal cognitive function and absence of any&#xD;
             physical limitations, addictive diseases or underlying medical conditions that may&#xD;
             preclude patient from being a good surgical and/or study candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness, ability and commitment to participate in baseline and follow-up&#xD;
             evaluations for the full length of the study including the prescribed rehabilitation&#xD;
             program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study provided by the patient or legal&#xD;
             representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy during the first twelve (12)&#xD;
             months of the post-surgical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have not been completely abstinent from tobacco use for at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection or dormant bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects would have less than 2 mm of remaining cortex bone available around the&#xD;
             implant, if implanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of or a documented history of severe peripheral vascular disease, diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus (type I or type II), skin diseases, Neuropathy or neuropathic disease and&#xD;
             severe phantom pain, or osteoporosis, such that, in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             will not allow the subject to be a good study candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of any active skin disease involving the proposed surgical limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of systemically administered corticosteroids, immune-suppressive therapy or&#xD;
             chemotherapy drugs within six (6) months of implant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe co morbidity, atypical skeletal anatomy, or poor general physical/mental health&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the subject to be a good&#xD;
             study candidate (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity, substance abuse,&#xD;
             shortened life expectancy, vulnerable patient population, BMI &gt;40, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is currently involved in another clinical study where that participation&#xD;
             may conflict or interfere with the treatment, follow-up or results of this clinical&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
