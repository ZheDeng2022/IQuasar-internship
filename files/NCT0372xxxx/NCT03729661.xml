  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to breathing and other motions, tumours, such as breast and lung cancer, as well as their&#xD;
      surrounding organs (e.g. the heart), move, which poses a challenge for radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Reducing or even stopping breathing, e.g. by irradiating during inspiration, is a&#xD;
      way to decrease tumour and organ motion resulting in a reliable target coverage with smaller&#xD;
      margins. These smaller margins can result in a better sparing of normal tissues. Furthermore,&#xD;
      in some patients, during inspiration, the heart may move away from the target volume making&#xD;
      it possible to better spare the heart. Finally, during inspiration, the lung volume is larger&#xD;
      and the lung density is lower, which can lead to a lower dose to the surrounding normal lung&#xD;
      tissue. Reduction of radiation dose to normal tissues leads to less radiation-induced&#xD;
      toxicity. This makes treating breast and lung cancer patients in breath hold (BH) conditions&#xD;
      an attractive strategy. Standard BH durations in RT treatment are around 20 seconds, which is&#xD;
      not enough to perform a complete CBCT. The health status of lung cancer patients is generally&#xD;
      worse compared to breast cancer patients, making it more difficult to treat this patient&#xD;
      group during breath hold. Nasal High Flow Therapy (NHFT) is a non-invasive system that&#xD;
      provides controlled oxygen concentrations and low levels of positive pressure via a nasal&#xD;
      interface. NHFT improves oxygenation in diverse patient groups, and is increasingly used as&#xD;
      an alternative to mechanical ventilatory support. It has been shown to be a safe device in&#xD;
      several clinical situations and patient populations, such as COPD patients, but also in&#xD;
      apneic conditions under general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Due to breathing and other motion, tumours, such as breast and lung cancer, as well as their&#xD;
      surrounding organs (e.g. the heart), move, which poses a challenge for radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment. Reducing or even stopping breathing, e.g. by irradiating during inspiration, is a&#xD;
      way to decrease tumor and organ motion resulting in a reliable target coverage with smaller&#xD;
      margins. These smaller margins can result in a better sparing of normal tissues. Furthermore,&#xD;
      in some patients, during inspiration, the heart may move away from the target volume making&#xD;
      it possible to better spare the heart. Finally, during inspiration, the lung volume is larger&#xD;
      and the lung density is lower, which can lead to a lower dose to the surrounding normal lung&#xD;
      tissue. Reduction of radiation dose to normal tissues leads to less radiation-induced&#xD;
      toxicity. This makes treating breast and lung cancer patients in breath hold (BH) conditions&#xD;
      an attractive strategy. A BH has to be stable and long enough for the duration of a planning&#xD;
      CT-scan, cone beam CT (CBCT) scan and treatment delivery. Treatment of left-sided breast&#xD;
      cancer with radiotherapy in moderate deep inspiration breath hold (mDIBH) is well&#xD;
      established. Also, in MAASTRO clinic, left-sided breast cancer patients are treated in mDIBH,&#xD;
      but this is done without any support or control of the breath hold. Standard BH durations in&#xD;
      RT treatment are around 20 seconds, which is not enough to perform a complete CBCT. The&#xD;
      health status of lung cancer patients is generally worse compared to breast cancer patients,&#xD;
      making it more difficult to treat this patient group during breath hold. mDIBH in lung cancer&#xD;
      patients is therefore not widely used, and not yet performed in MAASTRO clinic. Ventilation&#xD;
      techniques that can support patients in holding their breath might make it a feasible&#xD;
      approach in patients with a less favourable performance status, and might increase the&#xD;
      duration of a breath hold. Nasal High Flow Therapy (NHFT) is a non-invasive system that&#xD;
      provides controlled oxygen concentrations and low levels of positive pressure via a nasal&#xD;
      interface. NHFT improves oxygenation in diverse patient groups, and is increasingly used as&#xD;
      an alternative to mechanical ventilatory support. It has been shown to be a safe device in&#xD;
      several clinical situations and patient populations, such as COPD patients, but also in&#xD;
      apneic conditions under general anesthesia. It has however never been used in the context of&#xD;
      breath hold support, neither has it been used in radiotherapy practice. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that supporting BH with nasal high flow therapy (NHFT) will allow robust&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatments of moving targets in a broad patient population allowing for BHs that&#xD;
      are long enough, stable and reproducible during a whole treatment course.&#xD;
