    <textblock>
      Burn patients meeting inclusion criteria will receive the esterified hyaluronic acid matrix&#xD;
      as the matrix for their wound, in conjunction with the standard of care for managing these&#xD;
      types of wounds. The study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will entail intervention&#xD;
      with the wound matrix and will continue until one of the following occur, sufficient&#xD;
      granulation has occurred and the patient can receive a STSG and proceed to Phase II, the&#xD;
      patient's physician determines an STSG is no longer necessary or two applications with the&#xD;
      wound matrix occur and no STSG is approved. Phase II will begin following the STSG procedure.&#xD;
      In this phase, the wound will be monitored and proportion of STSG take will be evaluated but&#xD;
      no application of the wound matrix device will take place. This phase will continue for 28&#xD;
      days or if the physician deems the patient no longer needs regular care to monitor the wound,&#xD;
      whichever occurs earlier.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a wound originating from a thermal or electrical burn&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target burn area is less than 20% of TBSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Target burn wound is greater than 0.5% of TBSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has undergone escharectomy procedure or will undergo escharectomy on the&#xD;
             target burn and resulting wound will likely need a split thickness skin graft, but&#xD;
             wound site is not immediately ready for grafting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with diabetes, an A1C hemoglobin level between 11 percent (taken within&#xD;
             90 days)&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current active diagnosis of substance abuse, per the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient currently taking non-inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient needs or is likely to need negative pressure wound therapy of the target wound&#xD;
             after application of Hyalomatrix Wound Device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant, planning to become pregnant during study period, or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unstable medical condition as determined by the site investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known sensitivities to hyaluronan, hyaluronan derivatives, silicone, or&#xD;
