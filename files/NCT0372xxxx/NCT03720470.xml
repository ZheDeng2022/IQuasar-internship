  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B7451029 is a Phase 3 study to investigate PF-04965842 in adult patients who have moderate to&#xD;
      severe atopic dermatitis and use background topical therapy. The efficacy of two dosage&#xD;
      strengths of PF-04965842, 100 mg and 200 mg taken orally once daily will be evaluated&#xD;
      relative to placebo over 12 weeks. The efficacy of the two dosage strengths of PF-04965842&#xD;
      will be compared with dupilumab in terms of pruritus relief at 2 weeks. The two dosage&#xD;
      strengths of PF-04965842 and dupilumab 300 mg injected subcutaneously once every two weeks&#xD;
      (with a loading dose of 600 mg injected on the first day) will also be evaluated relative to&#xD;
      placebo over 16 weeks. The safety of the investigational products will be evaluated over the&#xD;
      duration of the study. Subjects will use non-medicated emollient at least twice a day and&#xD;
      medicated topical therapy such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors or PDE4 inhibitors,&#xD;
      as per protocol guidance, to treat active lesions during the study. Subjects who are&#xD;
      randomized to receive one of the two dosage strengths of PF-04965842 will also receive&#xD;
      placebo injectable study drug every two weeks until Week 16 and then will continue on&#xD;
      receiving only the oral study drug for 4 weeks. Subjects who are randomized to receive&#xD;
      dupilumab injections every two weeks will also receive oral placebo to be taken once daily&#xD;
      until Week 16 and will then continue to receive only the oral placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects&#xD;
      who are randomized to the placebo arms, will receive both daily oral placebo and injectable&#xD;
      placebo every two weeks until Week 16, after which they will receive either 100 mg or 200 mg&#xD;
      of PF-04965842 taken orally once daily for 4 weeks, dependent upon which arm they have been&#xD;
      allocated to. Eligible subjects will have an option to enter a long-term extension study&#xD;
      after completing 20 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire consisted of 2 components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. US value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adults in the study, range from 1 to -0.109. Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>POEM is a 7-item participant reported outcome (PRO) measure used to assess the impact of AD (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping) over the past week. Each item is scored as following: &quot;no days (0)&quot;, &quot;1-2 days (1)&quot;, &quot;3-4 days (2)&quot;, &quot;5-6 days (3)&quot; and &quot;every day (4)&quot;. The score ranges from 0 to 28, where higher score indicated greater severity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) Total Score Week 1 to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Response &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8 12 and 16</time_frame>
    <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects aged 18 years or older at the time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD) for at least 1 year and current status of moderate&#xD;
             to severe disease (&gt;= the following scores: BSA 10%, IGA 3, EASI 16, Pruritus NRS&#xD;
             severity 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented recent history (within 6 months before the screening visit) of inadequate&#xD;
             response to treatment with medicated topical therapy for AD for at least 4 weeks, or&#xD;
             who have required systemic therapies for control of their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to comply with standardized background topical therapy, as&#xD;
             per protocol guidelines throughout the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are of childbearing potential must not be intending to become&#xD;

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI Response &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 and 16</title>
        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of body surface area (BSA) affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

          <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving EASI Response =100% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>EASI evaluates severity of participants' AD (excluded scalp, palms, soles) based on severity of AD clinical signs and % of BSA affected. Severity of clinical signs of AD (erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation and lichenification) scored separately for each of 4 body regions (head and neck, upper limbs, trunk [including axillae and groin] and lower limbs [including buttocks]) on 4-point scale: 0= absent; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe. EASI area score was based upon % BSA with AD in body region: 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0 to &lt;10%), 2 (10 to &lt;30%), 3 (30 to &lt;50%), 4 (50 to &lt;70%), 5 (70 to &lt;90%) and 6 (90 to 100%). Total EASI score =0.1*Ah*(Eh+Ih+Exh+Lh) + 0.2*Au*(Eu+Iu+ExU+Lu) + 0.3*At*(Et+It+Ext+Lt) + 0.4*Al*(El+Il+Exl+Ll); A = EASI area score; E = erythema; I = induration/papulation; Ex = excoriation; L = lichenification; h = head and neck; u = upper limbs; t = trunk; l = lower limbs. Total EASI score ranged from 0.0 to 72.0, higher scores = greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>4 body regions were evaluated: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (including axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Scalp, palms and soles were excluded. BSA was calculated using handprint method. Number of handprints (size of participant's hand with fingers in a closed position) fitting in the affected area of a body region was estimated. Maximum number of handprints were 10 for head and neck, 20 for upper limbs, 30 for trunk and 40 for lower limbs. Surface area of body region equivalent to 1 handprint: 1 handprint was equal to 10% for head and neck, 5% for upper limbs, 3.33% for trunk and 2.5% for lower limbs. Percent BSA for a body region was calculated as = total number of handprints in a body region * % surface area equivalent to 1 handprint. Overall % BSA for an individual: arithmetic mean of % BSA of all 4 body regions, ranges from 0 to 100%, with higher values representing greater severity of AD.</description>

        <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

          <description>DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life. Scores from all 10 questions added up to give DLQI total score range from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much). Higher scores indicated more impact on quality of life of participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) Index Value at Week 12 and 16</title>
        <description>EQ-5D-5L: standardized participant completed questionnaire consisted of 2 components: a health state profile and an optional VAS. EQ-5D health state profile had 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, and 5= extreme problems. Responses to 5 dimensions comprised a health state/a single utility index value. E.g. if a participant responded &quot;no problems&quot; for each 5 dimensions, then health state was coded as &quot;11111&quot; with a predefined index value to it. Every health state (coded as combination of responses on each of 5 dimensions) had a unique predefined utility index value assigned to it, by EuroQol. US value sets (with all possible health states) was used for adults in the study, range from 1 to -0.109. Higher (positive) scores = better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) - Anxiety Scale at Week 12 and 16</title>
        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) scale and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scale, both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

          <title>HADS - Anxiety Scale at Week 20</title>
          <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire. HADS consisted of 2 subscales: HADS-A scale and HADS-D scale, both of these subscales comprised of 7 items each. Each item was rated on a 4-point scale, score range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicates more anxiety/depression symptoms. HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks). HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). HADS-A: sum of all 7 items resulted in score range of 0 (no presence of anxiety) to 21 (severe feeling of anxiety); higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pruritus and Symptoms Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (PSAAD) Total Score Week 1 to Week 16</title>
        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

        <title>PSAAD Total Score at Week 18 and 20</title>
        <description>PSAAD is a daily participant reported symptom electronic diary. Participants rated their symptoms of AD over the past 24 hours, using 11 items (itchy skin, painful skin, dry skin, flaky skin, cracked skin, bumpy skin, red skin, discolored skin [lighter or darker], bleeding from skin, seeping or oozing fluid from skin [other than blood], and skin swelling). Participant had to think about all the areas of their body affected by their skin condition and chose the number that best described their experience for each of the 11 items, from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), higher scores signified worse skin condition. Total PSAAD score = arithmetic mean of 11 items, 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (extreme symptoms), where higher score = worse skin condition.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) Response &gt;=50% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16</title>
        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With SCORAD Response &gt;=75% Improvement From Baseline at Week 2, 4, 8 12 and 16</title>
        <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>

          <description>SCORAD: scoring index for AD combining extent, severity, subjective symptoms. Extent (A): rule of 9 was used to calculate BSA affected by AD as a % of whole BSA for each body region- head and neck 9%; upper limbs 9% each; lower limbs 18% each; anterior trunk 18%; back 18%; 1% for genitals. The score for each body region was added to determine A (0-100). Severity (B): severity of each sign (erythema; edema; oozing; excoriation; skin thickening; dryness) was assessed as none=0, mild=1, moderate=2,severe=3. The severity scores were summed to give B (0-18). Subjective symptoms (C): pruritus and sleep, each of these 2 were scored by participant/caregiver using visual analogue scale (VAS) where &quot;0&quot; = no itch/no sleeplessness and &quot;10&quot; = the worst imaginable itch/sleeplessness, higher scores=worse symptoms. Scores for itch and sleeplessness were added to give 'C' (0-20). The SCORAD for an individual was calculated: A/5 + 7*B/2 + C; range from 0 to 103; higher values of SCORAD=worse outcome.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set till Week 16 included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication up to Week 16. Here, &quot;Overall Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>
