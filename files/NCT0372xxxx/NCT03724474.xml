    <textblock>
      This study aims to increase weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and&#xD;
      improve sleep quality in a sample of mid-life adults between ages 50 and 64 years.&#xD;

      This 2-year study will develop, test, and refine a cloud-based feedback system, and evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of a 3 month randomized controlled feasibility pilot intervention - the&#xD;
      Bio-behavioral systems to Motivate and Reinforce Heart Health trial (Be SMART) on changes in&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sleep among mid-life adults between ages 50&#xD;
      and 64 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will examine the acceptability of the Be SMART system. We will conduct a 6-week proof-&#xD;
      of-concept study in 10 mid-life adults to specifically examine recruitment plausibility,&#xD;
      adherence and attrition rates, satisfaction, and implementation fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will quantify the impact of the Be SMART intervention (n=30) on changes in MVPA and&#xD;
      sleep metrics compared to a Fitbit-only condition (n=30) among mid-life adults (N=60).&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2a: At 3 months, participants in the Be SMART condition will show significantly&#xD;
      greater weekly minutes of MVPA compared to the Fitbit-only condition, controlling for&#xD;
      baseline. Hypothesis 2b: At 3 months, participants in the Be SMART condition will be&#xD;
      significantly more likely to report adequate sleep duration, shorter sleep latency, and&#xD;
      earlier sleep timing, compared to the Fitbit-only condition, controlling for baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 will explore the extent to which changes in MVPA and sleep metrics impact blood&#xD;
      pressure changes among mid-life adults (N=60). Secondly, this study will quantify the extent&#xD;
      to which Be SMART participants (n=30) achieve their weekly goals and if goal achievement&#xD;
      impacts changes in blood pressure at 3 months. Hypothesis 3a: Changes in MVPA and sleep&#xD;
      metrics will be related to changes in blood pressure. Hypothesis 3b, the degree of goal&#xD;
      achievement will be related to changes in blood pressure.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects randomly assigned to the Be SMART condition (n=30) will first meet with a credentialed health coach to help create personally relevant weekly, short-term (6-weeks) and long-term (12-weeks) PA and sleep goals, and an initial action and coping plan. At 6- weeks (study mid-point), Be SMART subjects will complete a short telephonic &quot;booster&quot; session with the health coach. Throughout the 12-week intervention, our agent-based feedback system will communicate weekly messages via short message service (SMS) based on their weekly goal achievement, informed by the continuous collection of their Fitbit data. In addition, subjects in the Be SMART condition will also take their morning blood pressure using a blue-tooth enabled device that wirelessly sends this data to the Be SMART server.</description>

    <description>Subjects who are randomly assigned to the active control condition (n=30) will receive a Fitbit device and wireless blood pressure monitor (same as Be SMART condition). However, subjects in the Fitbit Only condition will not meet with a health coach for establishing SMART goals and creating an action/coping plan, nor will Fitbit Only subjects receive any feedback messages or prompts from the Be SMART server, although data from their Fitbit devices will be continuously collected throughout the q12 week intervention.</description>
