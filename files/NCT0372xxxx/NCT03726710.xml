      The recently published LA Barbershop in the New England Journal of Medicine (Victor et al. N&#xD;
      Engl J Med 2018; 378: 1291-301) solid evidence of the efficacy of a pharmacist-led medication&#xD;
      management intervention to reduce blood pressure in black men that patronize barbershops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most significant logistical inefficiencies of the LA Barbershop Study was the&#xD;
      amount of time the pharmacists spent driving for face-to-face visits with participants. On&#xD;
      average, each round trip was 40 miles and pharmacists drove 2 hours per day. By using&#xD;
      telemedicine, the study team can minimize the number of face-to-face in-person visits and&#xD;
      increase pharmacist efficiency by 25%. the study team aim to increase the scalability of our&#xD;
      novel, evidence-based barbershop model by addressing this inefficiency with the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the LA Barbershop trial, each participant averaged 7 in-person visits in 6 months. the&#xD;
      study team found that the initial in-person visits between the pharmacist, barber, and patron&#xD;
      were essential for establishing trust as well as obtaining baseline electrolyte and serum&#xD;
      creatinine levels (with our validated point-of-care device, iSTAT). However, once rapport has&#xD;
      been established and blood pressure control achieved, the study team postulate that the&#xD;
      effect can be maintained remotely with telemedicine. Our data indicate that most patients'&#xD;
      can achieve their blood pressure goal in 3 months or less. the study team propose replacing&#xD;
      additional in-person visits with telemonitoring (via Skype or FaceTime) at this juncture,&#xD;
      provided blood chemistries are stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study team plan to pilot this in 20 patients from 2 to 3 barbershops for 12 months.&#xD;

      recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine (Victor et al. N Engl J Med 2018;&#xD;
      378: 1291-301) solid evidence of the efficacy of a pharmacist-led medication management&#xD;
      intervention to reduce blood pressure in black men that patronize barbershops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study enrolled a cohort of 319 hypertensive non-Hispanic black male patrons from 52&#xD;
      black-owned barbershops in Los Angeles County into a cluster-randomized trial in which&#xD;
      barbershops (non-traditional health care setting) were assigned to either a pharmacist-led&#xD;
      intervention (in which barbers encouraged in-person meetings with pharmacists who then&#xD;
      prescribed drug therapy under a collaborative practice agreement with the participants'&#xD;
      doctors) or an active control approach (in which barbers encouraged lifestyle modification&#xD;
      and doctor appointments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months, the mean systolic blood pressure fell by 27.0 mmHg in the intervention group and&#xD;
      by 9.3 mmHg in the control group. A blood pressure level of less than 130/80 was achieved in&#xD;
      64% of the participants in the intervention versus 12% of participants in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study team are applying for this grant as a first step in transitioning this&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention into a scalable program. Specifically, the study team will do a&#xD;
      pilotstudy to test whether the impressive effects on blood pressure can be maintained just as&#xD;
      well if face-to face meetings are substituted with telemonitoring after blood pressure is at&#xD;
      goal. If successful this approach would markedly increase efficiency by increasing the number&#xD;
      of patients a single pharmacist can manage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Hispanic black men have the highest rate of hypertension-related death of any racial,&#xD;
      ethnic, or sex group in the United States. Black men have less physician interaction than&#xD;
      black women and lower rates of hypertension treatment and control, necessitating community&#xD;
      outreach. Because black men with hypertension often have multiple cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors, marked reductions in blood pressure - if sustained with the use of our approach and&#xD;
      then initiated more widely - might reduce the high rates of hypertension-related disability&#xD;
      and death among black men in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team want to demonstrate that participants in this pilot can achieve similar blood&#xD;
      pressure reduction at 12 months (as compared to those in our previous trial) when&#xD;
      telemedicine is substituted for in-person pharmacist visits after 3 months.&#xD;
