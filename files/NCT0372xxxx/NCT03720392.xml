      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved FMT for this use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After HCT, the body's microbiome (the natural existence of various bacteria and organisms) in&#xD;
      the intestinal tract may be affected, in that the number and types of good bacteria is&#xD;
      reduced (also called a reduction in microbial flora diversity). Studies have shown that the&#xD;
      number and types of good bacteria in the gut can impact whether or not a person develop a&#xD;
      disease called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donated bone marrow cells&#xD;
      attack the body with an immune response. Researchers believe that more microbial flora&#xD;
      diversity in the gut is linked to a lower risk of developing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FMT is a process utilizing microbial components which are the good, healthy bacteria that&#xD;
      would otherwise naturally occur in the body. Since the participant may have decreased&#xD;
      microbial flora diversity after HCT, these microbial components are taken from a 3rd party&#xD;
      donor. They are extracted from fecal matter (stool) and put into a capsule which the&#xD;
      participant then ingest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers believe that FMT administration may play a role in restoring higher microbial&#xD;
      flora diversity in the gut. Therefore, FMT administration may play a role in decreasing the&#xD;
      likelihood of developing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are...&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examining the microbial flora diversity of your gut after FMT administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Looking for incidence rate of GVHD and other post-HCT complications&#xD;
