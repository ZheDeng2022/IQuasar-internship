  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC-10004) in subjects with mild to&#xD;
      moderate plaque psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 574 subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for the first 16 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Phase - up to 35 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Double-blind Placebo-controlled Phase - Weeks 0 to 16&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Subjects will be randomly assigned to either apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID or&#xD;
           placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally BID.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apremilast Extension Phase - Weeks 16 to 32&#xD;
&#xD;
           - All subjects will be switched to (or continue with) apremilast 30 mg BID. All subjects&#xD;
           will maintain this dosing through Week 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observational Follow-up Phase - 4 weeks - Four-week Post-Treatment Observational&#xD;
           Follow-up Phase for all subjects who complete the study or discontinue the study early.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Response at Week 16 During the Placebo-Controlled Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The sPGA is a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 =severe. Scores incorporate an assessment by the Investigator of the severity of the 3 primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation.&#xD;
An sPGA response is defined as sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a ≥ 75 Percent (%) Improvement From Baseline in Affected Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The BSA is a measurement of involved skin over the whole body. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand. The surface area of the whole body is made up of approximately 100 palms or &quot;handprints&quot; (each entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Affected BSA at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The BSA is a measurement of involved skin over the whole body. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand. The surface area of the whole body is made up of approximately 100 palms or &quot;handprints&quot; (each entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area).&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates a reduction of affected BSA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.&#xD;
PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement of disease symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved BSA ≤ 3% for Participants With Baseline Affected BSA &gt; 3% at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The BSA is a measurement of involved skin over the whole body. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the participant's hand. The surface area of the whole body is made up of approximately 100 palms or &quot;handprints&quot; (each entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With ≥ 4-point Reduction From Baseline in Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Score at Week 16 Who Had Baseline Whole Body Itch NRS ≥ 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The whole body itch NRS is a self-reported measure where participants were asked to assess whole body itch and select a number on a scale of 0-10, where 0 represents no itch, and 10 represents the worst imaginable itch. A reduction in score from baseline represents an improvement in symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Scalp Physician Global Assessment (ScPGA) Response at Week 16 Among Participants With Baseline scPGA Score ≥ 2 at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The ScPGA is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an Investigator's assessment of the severity of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevation of the overall scalp.&#xD;
An ScPGA response is defined as and ScPGA score clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline among participants with a baseline ScPGA score ≥ 2.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Total Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16 of the placebo-controlled phase</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI is a 10 item questionnaire dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being 0 (not at all), 1 (a little) and 2 (a lot).&#xD;
Total scores have a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst health-related quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in health-related quality of life scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Placebo: Day 1 to Week 16; Apremilast Day 1 to a maximum of Week 32 (plus 4 week safety follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of a study. A TEAE is any AE that occurs following administration of study treatment.&#xD;
Frequency of TEAEs was assessed as well as severity and treatment relatedness.&#xD;
A TEAE was considered severe based on the Investigator's assessment. A TEAE could be severe if it was serious or non-serious, had symptoms causing discomfort or pain, requiring medical or surgical attention or intervention, interfered with activities of daily life and if drug therapy was required.</description>

There is no end date for eligibility to submit a data sharing request for this study.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Qualified researchers may submit a request containing the research objectives, the Amgen product(s) and Amgen study/studies in scope, endpoints/outcomes of interest, statistical analysis plan, data requirements, publication plan, and qualifications of the researcher(s). In general, Amgen does not grant external requests for individual patient data for the purpose of re-evaluating safety and efficacy issues already addressed in the product labelling. Requests are reviewed by a committee of internal advisors. If not approved, a Data Sharing Independent Review Panel will arbitrate and make the final decision. Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement. This may include anonymized individual patient data and/or available supporting documents, containing fragments of analysis code where provided in analysis specifications.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score.&#xD;
PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement of disease symptoms.</description>

        <description>The DLQI is a 10 item questionnaire dealing with the participant's skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the participant responds on a four-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Item Number 7 is a multi-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the participant's skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if &quot;No,&quot; then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being 0 (not at all), 1 (a little) and 2 (a lot).&#xD;
Total scores have a possible range of 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst health-related quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score.&#xD;
A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in health-related quality of life scores.</description>

Frequency of TEAEs was assessed as well as severity and treatment relatedness.&#xD;
A TEAE was considered severe based on the Investigator's assessment. A TEAE could be severe if it was serious or non-serious, had symptoms causing discomfort or pain, requiring medical or surgical attention or intervention, interfered with activities of daily life and if drug therapy was required.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
