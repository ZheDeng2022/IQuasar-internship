      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess how an amino acid based medical food (Enterade®) helps maintain the intestine's&#xD;
      ability to absorb and retain fluids, leading to a reduction in diarrhea due to Neuroendocrine&#xD;
      Tumors (NET) and/or Carcinoid Syndrome. This improvement in the absorption will be assessed&#xD;
      in part by evaluating changes in average daily stool frequency from baseline in patients&#xD;
      receiving Enterade®. Each subject serves as his or her own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess subject reported health-related quality of life in subjects before and after&#xD;
           compound administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of Enterade® as measured by the&#xD;
           number of total 8-oz Enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial, and average drinks&#xD;
           per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of Eenterade®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalization for dehydration secondary&#xD;
           to diarrhea between control observation period and active Enterade® period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate difference in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications&#xD;
           between control observation period and Enterade® period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare subjective feeling of bloating and flatulence before and after administration&#xD;
           of Enterade®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of Enterade®.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, phase 2 study is to assess how Enterade® will affect patient-reported&#xD;
      quality of life and intestinal absorption in patients with Carcinoid Syndrome and&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine Tumors. The hypothesis is that Enterade® when combined with standard&#xD;
      supportive care will improve patient-reported quality of life and help maintain the small&#xD;
      bowel's ability to absorb and retain fluids, possibly leading to a reduction in diarrhea&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a non-randomized, supportive-care study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potentially eligible patients will be screened in the University of Kentucky Markey&#xD;
           Cancer Center clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the screening visit, immediately after signing informed consent, the participant&#xD;
           will be given both flavors of enterade® (original vanilla and refreshing orange) to test&#xD;
           tolerability and taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible subjects will be given a stool diary and will be asked to document daily stool&#xD;
           output (frequency and consistency of stool), use of anti-diarrheal medication and&#xD;
           gastrointestinal discomforts (bloating, cramping).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All lab and screening tests should be completed within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
           registration/initiation of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study is broken into 3 distinct segments and will apply to all enrolled&#xD;
           participants: Baseline observation (Weeks 1-4), Enterade® administration period (4&#xD;
           weeks), Post-Enterade® Period (4 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After relapse of diarrhea is documented or the 4 weeks of post-Enterade® observation are&#xD;
           completed (whatever happens first), participants will be given the option to restart&#xD;
           Enterade® for 1 additional month.&#xD;
