  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some stimuli, such as sinusoidal networks in motion, or the best known, Necker's cube, are&#xD;
      simple visual stimulations generating interpretations of unstable and oscillatory shapes or&#xD;
      movements, mutually exclusive. Currently, the explanatory models of these perception&#xD;
      phenomena are based on adaptation and learning mechanisms as well as the importance of noise&#xD;
      in the perceptual and decision-making system. Often noise is a harmful component, but it can&#xD;
      also be a facilitator in perceptual systems: the investigator's eye is always in motion, it&#xD;
      is the micro-movements during eye fixation (phase of eye stability). In particular, the role&#xD;
      of micro-eye movements has been identified in perceptual systems, and it will be necessary&#xD;
      here to relate these micro-movements to the perceptive tilts facing multisable stimuli.&#xD;
      However, how to access the perceptive states is a real question, since it has been shown that&#xD;
      the participant's transfer of his perceptual state by means of a motor response can alter the&#xD;
      very state of the percept. This is why the EEG activity will be analyzed to learn to&#xD;
      discriminate the different percepts over time, without disruption of the participant's&#xD;
      perceptual exploration endogenous activity.&#xD;

      Each participant will benefit from a medical interview before inclusion to eliminate the&#xD;
      contraindications to this study. The maximum duration of the individual participation of each&#xD;
      subject in this study is 5 hours in two sessions. Each session lasts 2h30. Both sessions are&#xD;
      spaced a maximum of 14 days apart. Each session includes EEG headset placement and oculometer&#xD;
      calibration (20 min), followed by recording EEG and eye tracking activity during a visual&#xD;
      cognitive task where the participant will be presented with multi-stable visual stimuli to&#xD;
      watch. for one or two minutes after the tests. By repeating the essays and the conditions of&#xD;
      presentation, each session will be organized in six blocks of 20 minutes each, interspersed&#xD;
      with a break.&#xD;
