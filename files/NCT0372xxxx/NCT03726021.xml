      This research study is a Phase 2 clinical trial. It will test the efficiency and safety of an&#xD;
      investigational drug f Irinotecan,Oxaliplatin, and S1, with the goal of determining the OS of&#xD;
      advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have a newly diagnosed stage 4 untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal cancer&#xD;
      and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment consists of treatment with Irinotecan 165mg/m2, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 on day 1, and&#xD;
      S1 40mg orally on day 1-14, every 21 days each cycle. Treatment will be administered until&#xD;
      untolerable toxicities or progression or subject death, or either the subject or sponsor&#xD;
      discontinues the study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  • Cytologically- or histologically-confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma or poorly&#xD;
             differentiated pancreatic carcinoma that is metastatic to distant sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other histologies such as neuroendocrine and acinar cell carcinoma are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients are eligible if they received adjuvant treatment after surgical&#xD;
                  resection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants are required to have measurable disease (RECIST v1.1), defined as at&#xD;
                  least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
                  (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;&#xD;
                  10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable&#xD;
                  disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants enrolled must have disease that is accessible for tumor biopsies and&#xD;
                  must agree to a pre-treatment tumor biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available&#xD;
                  in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will&#xD;
                  be eligible for future pediatric trials.&#xD;

               -  Patients must have completed any major surgery or open biopsy ≥4 weeks from start&#xD;
                  of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Creatinine ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal OR&#xD;

                       levels above 1.5 × upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;

             advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, targeted&#xD;
                  therapy, immunotherapy, or biological agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical&#xD;
                  trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive&#xD;
                  neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other&#xD;
                  adverse events. Screening for brain metastases with head imaging is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or&#xD;
                  biologic composition to above drugs or other agents used in study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  History of prior or current synchronous malignancy, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  o Malignancy that was treated with curative intent and for which there has been&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
                  active infection, NYHA class III/IV congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
