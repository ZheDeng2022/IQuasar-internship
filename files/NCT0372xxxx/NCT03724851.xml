      This is an open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of vactosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal or gastric/gastroesophageal junction&#xD;

      This is phase 1b/2a, open label, multi-center study to assess safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity of vactosertib in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with mCRC including CMS4 or diffuse GC/GEJC with two phases (Dose Finding Phase and&#xD;
      Dose Expansion Phase). At screening, CMS4 will be classified by an experienced pathologist in&#xD;
      the central lab that will examine the histology of primary surgical tissues. Approximately,&#xD;
      67 total patients are expected to be enrolled in this study. The first phase of the study,&#xD;
      the Dose Finding Phase, will determine the MTD of the combination regimen. The second phase,&#xD;
      the Dose Expansion Phase, will further evaluate the combination regimen to confirm RP2D.&#xD;
