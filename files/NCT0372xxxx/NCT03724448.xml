      Psycho-traumatic disorders are a disabling condition whose epidemiological data vary&#xD;
      according to the country but also the populations studied and the measuring instruments used.&#xD;
      The estimated prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appeared to be increasing in&#xD;
      recent years, and this appears to be due, among other things, to the improvement of the&#xD;
      standardized evaluation procedure. The survey &quot;Mental Health in General Population&quot;,&#xD;
      conducted in metropolitan France between 1999 and 2003 on more than 36,000 people estimated&#xD;
      its instantaneous prevalence (last month) of a full PTSD was 0.7% in the SMPG overall sample,&#xD;
      with almost equal frequency between men (45%) and women (55%). This figure is close to that&#xD;
      reported in a European population for the ESEMeD study. A very significant psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity was found in subjects with PTSD, particularly with mood disorders, other anxiety&#xD;
      disorders and addictive behaviors. The link with the suicidal risk was clearly established,&#xD;
      which is the gravity of this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important publications are made by American teams who have identified and evaluated&#xD;
      the treatment of this pathology among veterans of the various wars led by the country.&#xD;

      Barrois defines traumatic neurosis as &quot;a group of psychological disorders that arise after a&#xD;
      longer or shorter latency, following a very intense emotional shock&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-traumatic stress disorder is defined by the ICD-10 classification as a &quot;delayed or&#xD;
      prolonged&quot; response to a stressful situation or event (short or long-term) that would provoke&#xD;
      distress symptoms in anyone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American classification of the DSM-V, the diagnosis of PTSD is strictly&#xD;
      established according to different criteria. Exposure to a traumatic event (&quot;the person has&#xD;
      been exposed, witnessed or confronted with an event or events that have involved death or&#xD;
      death, or serious injury or threat to their physical integrity or 'others'), and reacting to&#xD;
      it with a feeling of intense fear, helplessness or horror (criterion A). The event is&#xD;
      constantly relived, manifested by at least one symptom of the repetition syndrome (criterion&#xD;
      B) that can be repetitive and invasive memories of the event (including images, thoughts,&#xD;
      perceptions), repetitive and painful dreams of the event, the impression or sudden acts &quot;as&#xD;
      if&quot; the traumatic event recurred, an intense psychological distress when exposed to internal&#xD;
      or external stimuli resembling an aspect of the trauma, a physiological reactivity during&#xD;
      exposure to internal or external stimuli resembling or symbolizing an aspect of the trauma.&#xD;
      Criterion C requires persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with trauma and blunting of&#xD;
      general responsiveness (not present before trauma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criterion D refers to the impairment of cognition and mood associated with one or more&#xD;
      traumatic events manifested by at least two symptoms, including dissociative amnesia,&#xD;
      persistent and exaggerated negative self-perceptions of others, and world, a clear reduction&#xD;
      of interest in important activities, a feeling of detachment and a persistent inability to&#xD;
      feel positive emotions. There are also symptoms of neurovegetative activation, with at least&#xD;
      two symptoms (criterion E) among sleep difficulties, irritability or anger, difficulty&#xD;
      concentrating, hyper vigilance, startled reactions exaggerated. Criterion F concerns the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms B, C and D which must exceed one month. The problem results in&#xD;
      clinically significant distress or dysfunction at the social, occupational or other important&#xD;
      operational level (criterion G). Criterion H eliminates that these symptoms are not due to&#xD;
      the consumption of a substance (drug or alcohol) or another condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this awareness of the functional impact of these psycho traumatic disorders, this&#xD;
      pathology has remained under-identified both by health professionals and the general public&#xD;
      and subsequently insufficiently treated, particularly in Tunisia. Several therapeutic&#xD;
      protocols are proposed. The share of antidepressant treatments (yet first-line treatment in&#xD;
      all international guidelines) is only 30% and the remaining 70% includes anxiolytics,&#xD;
      hypnotics and herbal medicine. Several meta-analyzes have evaluated the efficacy of different&#xD;
      families of antidepressants, but scientific research remains very poor in the field of herbal&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
