  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of macrophage activation syndrome has been mainly studied in pediatric&#xD;
      genetic primary forms. There is little data in secondary forms related to bacterial sepsis.&#xD;
      Because of the seriousness of this entity (43% of deaths in intensive care in the largest&#xD;
      cohort published so far by the medical resuscitation team of Rouen University Hospital), it&#xD;
      is necessary to better understand the physiopathological mechanisms to be able to propose a&#xD;
      suitable therapy. For now, the management of this syndrome is far from consensual. Some&#xD;
      authors advocate a single etiological treatment, while others suggest the need for intensive&#xD;
      management of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive type. The fragility of resuscitation&#xD;
      patients does not allow intensive immunosuppressive therapies as proposed by some authors. In&#xD;
      the era of immunotherapy, the precise knowledge of physiopathological data would make it&#xD;
      possible to propose a targeted therapy with little risk of adverse effects. Recent work has&#xD;
      indeed shown excellent tolerance of immunotherapy during sepsis and could be applied&#xD;
      eventually in patients with macrophage activation syndrome.&#xD;
