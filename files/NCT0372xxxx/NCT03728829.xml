  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the genetic background of patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that benefit&#xD;
      from trastuzumab combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, identify clinically actionable&#xD;
      mutations that associated with trastuzumab resistance or drug efficacy, we designed this&#xD;
      Observational phase II trial. The primary endpoint is genetic profile of HER2+ breast cancer&#xD;
      patients treated with trastuzumab combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      included pathological complete response (pCR) rate and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients with stage II-III breast cancer still accounts for a large population in&#xD;
      China, and neoadjuvant therapy is considered the standard treatment for them. The&#xD;
      pathological complete response (pCR) rate takes for an indicator for regimens efficacy, and&#xD;
      the achievement of pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with favorable outcomes&#xD;
      including disease-free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HER2+ breast cancer represents an invasive and poor prognosis subtype, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy for these patients has been greatly augmented by the addition of&#xD;
      trastuzumab. However, more than 50% of HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab&#xD;
      combined neoadjuvant chemotherapy cannot achieve pCR, even experience primary drug resistance&#xD;
      and rapid disease progression. Therefore, to explore the genomic features of the population&#xD;
      that benefited from trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy is of great significance for&#xD;
      personalized treatment of HER2+ breast cancer, aiming to avoid overtreatment and identify&#xD;
      clinically actionable mutations for future therapy instructions.&#xD;

    <description>100 cases of patients with stage II-III HER2+ breast cancer will be assigned participants to neoadjuvant treatment regimen, including Trastuzumab combined with Docetaxel and Carboplatin. 5-10 ml peripheral blood will be collected from each patient and formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) blocks/sections or fresh tumor tissues/biopsies will be obtained from the hospitals before and after neoadjuvant therapy. The genomic characteristics between patients achieved pCR and non-pCR will be analyzed. The clinically actionable mutations for future therapy instructions will be identified.</description>
