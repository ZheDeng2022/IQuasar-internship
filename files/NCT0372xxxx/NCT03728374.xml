  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anlotinib is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in domestic research and&#xD;
      development. It can inhibit the angiogenesis related kinase, such as VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and&#xD;
      tumor cell proliferation related kinase -c-Kit kinase. In the phase Ⅲ study, patients who&#xD;
      failed at least two kinds of systemic chemotherapy (third line or beyond) or drug intolerance&#xD;
      were treated with anlotinib（12mg，po. qd. on day 1to14 of a 21-day cycle） or placebo, the&#xD;
      anlotinib group PFS and OS were 5.37 months and 9.63 months, the placebo group PFS and OS&#xD;
      were 1.4 months and 6.3 months. Subgroup analysis results suggest that elderly patients may&#xD;
      get longer mPFS and mOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators envisage an open, single-arm, single-center clinical trial using&#xD;
      anlotinib in elderly patients with EGFR wild-type lung adenocarcinoma who refused&#xD;
      chemotherapy, to find if anlotinib is a better option in NSCLC second-line therapy.&#xD;

      It is an open, single-arm, single-center clinical trial conducted in China, and plan to&#xD;
      Recruiting 38 patients (≥65 years old, ECOG PS 0-2) who were progressed after first line&#xD;
      systemic therapy and refused/can't tolerate chemotherapy. Patents receive 12mg anlotinib&#xD;
      orally daily on day 1to 14 of a 21-day cycle until progression of disease, assess safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the drug.&#xD;
