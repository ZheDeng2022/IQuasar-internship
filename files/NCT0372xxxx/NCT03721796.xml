  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, qualitative study consisting of observation and audio recording of the&#xD;
      initial physician-patient consultations in newly diagnosed cancer patients occurring at the&#xD;
      Duke University Medical Center (DUMC). Semi-structured debriefing interviews with&#xD;
      participating oncologists and patients will follow the initial encounter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine oncologist and patients communication and&#xD;
      how patient participation in shared decision-making may impact cancer treatment. Patients who&#xD;
      are HIV positive and newly diagnosed with cancer and their treating oncologist may&#xD;
      voluntarily participate in this study. The study team will record and observe the initial&#xD;
      consultation visit between the patient and treating oncologist. Typically, at this visit,&#xD;
      specific treatment options for a new cancer are reviewed in detail. Semi-structured&#xD;
      debriefing interviews with participating oncologists and patients will follow the initial&#xD;
      encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient interviews will occur in person or by telephone within 72 hours of the initial&#xD;
      consultation. Oncologists will be interviewed in person within one week following the&#xD;
      clinical interaction. Clinical interactions at the initial consultation visit and interviews&#xD;
      with oncologists will be audio recorded and transcribed. Interviews will be conducted over&#xD;
      45-60 minutes and will be semi-structured with open-ended questions to allow the interviewee&#xD;
      to direct the flow of the conversation. A research assistant trained in qualitative research&#xD;
      methods will administer interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two to three visits: one visit to complete the informed consent process, the&#xD;
      recording of the initial consultation visit, and lastly a debriefing interview visit. The&#xD;
      debriefing interview may be conducted in person or over the phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following instruments and question probes will assess three main areas of&#xD;
      decision-making:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician Rationale for Decision-Making: In debriefing interviews with physicians,&#xD;
           research staff will ask how they arrived at their treatment recommendation and what&#xD;
           alternatives they entertained. The extent to which medical comorbidities (including HIV)&#xD;
           influenced treatment decision-making and what additional information would have been&#xD;
           useful in arriving at the treatment recommendation will be assesssed. We will ask&#xD;
           physicians what challenges they encountered in communicating treatment options to the&#xD;
           patient, how patient preferences influenced treatment recommendations, and their&#xD;
           assessment of how likely the patient is to pursue cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength of Physician Treatment Recommendations: The Physician Recommendation Coding&#xD;
           System (PhyReCS) is a validated tool to measure the strength of physician&#xD;
           recommendations using direct observation of clinical encounters.64 It is a global,&#xD;
           5-point scale ranging from -2 (strong recommendation against treatment) to +2 (strong&#xD;
           recommendation for treatment) that captures how physicians portrayed treatment options&#xD;
           during the entirety of the clinical appointment. The PhyReCS addresses major limitations&#xD;
           with prior physician decision-making research by having the flexibility to capture&#xD;
           multiple nuanced recommendations, for example, patients with early stage breast cancer&#xD;
           choosing whether to receive breast-conserving therapy (lumpectomy plus radiation) or&#xD;
           mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Preferences: In debriefing interviews with patients, we will elicit beliefs and&#xD;
           preferences regarding cancer treatment (e.g. self-efficacy, fear of toxicity, financial&#xD;
           hardship, challenges with dual management of co-morbidities and cancer, family support.&#xD;
           We will ask patients about their understanding of risks, benefits, and alternatives to&#xD;
           treatment and their satisfaction with communication regarding cancer management and&#xD;
           outcomes. Patients will be asked if they plan to pursue cancer treatment and if so,&#xD;
           which elements of physician communication were most influential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient treatment choice will be determined via chart review 6 months after the initial&#xD;
      recorded appointment. We will measure concordance between physician recommendation, strength&#xD;
      of the physician recommendation (PhyReCS), and patient treatment choice.&#xD;
