  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic lung diseases travelling by plane often suffer with symptoms related to&#xD;
      lower oxygen levels they are exposed to while flying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, patients with respiratory conditions are routinely assessed to establish if they&#xD;
      need supplemental oxygen in flight. A hypoxic altitude simulation test (HAST) is often part&#xD;
      of this assessment and consists in having patients breathe a oxygen/nitrogen blend with a&#xD;
      lower oxygen concentration compared to normal room air, simulating in-flight conditions.&#xD;
      Oxygen levels are measured before and after the test through a blood sample (from the earlobe&#xD;
      or an artery in the wrist) and with a finger probe. In-flight oxygen is required if the&#xD;
      oxygen level in the blood is lower than 6.6 kPa. HASTs are time consuming, costly, and&#xD;
      require a dedicated hospital appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using historical data, the Investigators developed scores based on capillary blood gas (blood&#xD;
      sample from the earlobe), diagnosis and sex to predict the outcome of the HASTs. The&#xD;
      Investigators validated the proposed scores in a separate historic cohort of patients and&#xD;
      showed it had good concordance with the HASTs results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the Investigators want to confirm prospectively if the score, based on blood&#xD;
      results (venous and/or earlobe), can predict the outcome of the HASTs and therefore reduce&#xD;
      the number of tests performed, travel time for patients, and costs for the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, aged 18 or older, who are having a HAST for clinical purposes at the&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory lab at Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust will be invited to take part in&#xD;
      the study. The Investigators will record diagnosis, results of HAST and previous spirometry&#xD;
      from the medical notes, perform a spirometry if not done in the previous 12 months and&#xD;
      collect a blood sample (one tube, 4 mls). With these data, the Investigators will calculate&#xD;
      the score and assess its agreement with the outcome of the HAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's involvement in the study will last for approximately 90-120 minutes, which&#xD;
      is the normal duration of a HAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to include up to 280 subjects in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last two decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of people&#xD;
      flying on a regular basis. As a result, more individuals with chronic respiratory disease are&#xD;
      being referred for formal assessment to assess if they require inflight oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At cruising altitude, passengers are exposed to reduced atmospheric pressure equivalent to an&#xD;
      altitude of 8000 ft, corresponding to a reduction of oxygen from 21% to approximately 15%.&#xD;
      National and International recommendations on air travel suggest screening patients with&#xD;
      chronic lung diseases for the need of in-flight oxygen supplementation. However, due to the&#xD;
      paucity of available evidence, there is no consensus on which investigation should be&#xD;
      performed and the precise risk factors associated with in-flight complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The British Thoracic Society, which published the most recent and comprehensive&#xD;
      recommendations on this topic, recommends that patients with respiratory diseases should be&#xD;
      assessed clinically, and in specific situations, a hypoxic altitude simulation tests (HAST)&#xD;
      should be performed. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these recommendations are level C at&#xD;
      best, as current evidence is limited to a handful of prospective or retrospective analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard hypoxic altitude simulation test requires the patients to breathe a blend of 15%&#xD;
      oxygen in nitrogen for 20 minutes. This simulates the oxygen tension at 8000 ft, the&#xD;
      equivalent cabin pressure. Blood gas measurements are taken before and after the test. A fall&#xD;
      in the pO2 below 6.6 kPa is considered indicative for use of in-flight oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often the HASTs yield negative results (i.e. no inflight oxygen required). These tests are&#xD;
      heavy on resources, time consuming, costly, not widely available and require dedicate&#xD;
      hospital appointment. Thus, predictors of outcomes of HASTs are needed to reduce the number&#xD;
      of HASTs performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have looked at predictors of oxygen desaturation during HAST in varying&#xD;
      populations with the aim of better selecting patients who need the test. However, results&#xD;
      have been inconclusive. Data on the role of baseline oxygenation, FEV1 and exercise test in&#xD;
      predicting oxygen desaturation during the HAST are conflicting and most studies have been too&#xD;
      small to provide decisive answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators recently developed and validate, on historical data, three scores to&#xD;
      predict negative HASTs, according to the BTS 2011 recommendations (i.e. scores predicting&#xD;
      which patients do not need to undergo a formal assessment). All of these had good ROC AUC and&#xD;
      agreement with the outcome of the HAST in the retrospective dataset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesise that the multivariable score (Model 1), based on a combination&#xD;
      of CBG variables (bicarbonate and oxygen saturation) and baseline diagnosis (ILD and COPD)&#xD;
      would be the best predictor of negative response in a formal HAST. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      Investigator hypothesise that the score could be further simplified for the use in clinical&#xD;
      practice by measuring the serum bicarbonate and oxygen saturation through a pulse oximeter&#xD;
      (Model 1s). This is in light of the good arterio-venous concordance previously demonstrated&#xD;
      for bicarbonate and of the good reliability of non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation.&#xD;
      Such a simplified score, if its predictive value is confirmed, would not only reduce the&#xD;
      number of unnecessary HAST performed, but also minimise patients' discomfort and hospital&#xD;
      appointments, reducing the costs for the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective single centre study, the Investigators will assess the validity of the&#xD;
      best performing score (Model 1) derived in our retrospective study for negative HAST. In&#xD;
      addition, the Investigators want to verify whether the use of SpO2 in place of SO2 and of&#xD;
      serum bicarbonate in place of capHCO3 would allow for similar results. The investigators also&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the performance of the other predictive scores previously derived in our&#xD;
      retrospective analysis, and, if none of these models are a good and effective predictor, we&#xD;
      aim to develop a new model based on newly measured data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators aim to enroll up to 280 subjects, but interim analyses will be performed&#xD;
      with the scope to early terminate the study if primary outcome is met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and baseline characteristics of patients will be analysed on the whole population&#xD;
      and by the cohorts depending on the underlying diagnosis and the outcome of the HAST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves will be plotted to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      the scores are good predictors of negative HASTs. Diagnostic values of the scores will be&#xD;
      expressed by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.&#xD;
