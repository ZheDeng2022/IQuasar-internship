    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequent and important complication to cardiac surgery. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology is multifactorial, but renal functions in this setting is determined by a&#xD;
      complex interplay between renal perfusion, fluid status, cardiac output, mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure and back pressure to venous outflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal perfusion may be quantified with novel ultrasound techniques. Ultrasonography of the&#xD;
      kidney and renal vasculature allows for assessment of renal afferent flow and renal venous&#xD;
      flow and, together with venous flow patterns of the portal vein and liver veins, may identify&#xD;
      patients in risk of AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is observational and will describe the diagnostic accuracy of the ultrasound&#xD;
      measures in predicting postoperative AKI. Patients will be examined with ultrasound of kidney&#xD;
      and liver flow along with echocardiography on on the day before surgery and on the 1st and&#xD;
      4th. In addition, patients are followed with markers of kidney function, fluid balance and&#xD;
      invasive measures of mean arterial pressure and central venous pressure.&#xD;

AKI is defined by the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria and graded in four stages from no AKI to stage 1-3 AKI based on serum creatinin change and/or changes in urine output, with stage 3 being the worst stage.</description>
