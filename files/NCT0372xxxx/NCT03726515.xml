        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. One of the following diagnoses of GBM:&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme that is histologically confirmed by&#xD;
             pathology review of surgically resected tissue; OR b. An integrated&#xD;
             molecular/pathologic diagnosis of diffuse astrocytic glioma, IDH-wildtype, with&#xD;
             molecular features of glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. This diagnosis requires patients&#xD;
             have one of the following: i. High-level amplification of EGFR; OR ii. Combined whole&#xD;
             chromosome 7 gain and whole chromosome 10 loss (+7/-10); OR iii. TERT promoter&#xD;
             mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Undergone tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior systemic therapies, radiation, tumor-treating fields, or intratumoral&#xD;
             therapeutic agents including Gliadel wafers are allowed. Tumor resection must be the&#xD;
             only tumor-directed treatment that the patient has received for glioboblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Tumor tissue is positive for EGFRvIII expression, as performed by either the&#xD;
             University of Pennsylvania's in-house fusion transcript panel (RNA-based assay using&#xD;
             Illumina HiSeq platform) or NeoGenomics Laboratories (quantitative RT-PCR assay).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Tumor tissue is negative for MGMT promoter methylation (i.e. the tumor is&#xD;
             MGMT-unmethylated), as performed by either the University of Pennsylvania's in-house&#xD;
             pyrosequencing protocol or NeoGenomics Laboratories.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ECOG performance status 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Provides written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must have adequate organ function as measured by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. White blood count ≥ 2500/mm3; platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL;&#xD;
                  without transfusion or growth factor support&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. AST, ALT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase within 2.5 x upper normal limit, and total&#xD;
                  bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Adequate cardiac function (LVEF ≥ 45%)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use acceptable birth control methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or lactating women&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inadequate venous access for or contraindications to leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection, or other active, uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum&#xD;
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies which in&#xD;
             the opinion of the investigator may post an increased risk of serious infusion&#xD;
             reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Requirement for immunosuppressive agents including but not limited to cyclosporine,&#xD;
             MMF, tacrolimus, rapamycin, or anti-TNF agents within 4 weeks of eligibility&#xD;
             confirmation by the physician-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with a history of known or suspected, severe or uncontrolled autoimmune or&#xD;
             connective tissue disease. Patients with vitiligo, controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus&#xD;
             (on stable insulin dose), residual autoimmune-related hypothyroidism (due to&#xD;
             autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement), or psoriasis (not requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment), or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external&#xD;
             trigger, are permitted to enroll.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Prior allogenic bone marrow or solid organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Any uncontrolled active medical or psychiatric disorder that would preclude&#xD;
        participation as outlined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        12. Severe, active co-morbidity in the opinion of the physician-investigator would preclude&#xD;
        participation in this study, including but not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Unstable angina within 6 months prior to eligibility confirmation by the&#xD;
             physician-investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to eligibility&#xD;
             confirmation by the physician-investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. New York Heart Association grade II or greater congestive heart failure requiring&#xD;
             hospitalization within 12 months prior to eligibility confirmation by the&#xD;
             physician-investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Serious and inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;

             perforation, intra-abdominal abscess major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or&#xD;
             significant traumatic injury within 28 days prior to eligibility confirmation by the&#xD;
             physician-investigator, with the exception of the craniotomy for tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             13. Patients with tumors primarily localized to the brain stem or spinal cord.&#xD;
