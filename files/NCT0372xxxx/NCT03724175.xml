  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown, but intestinal bacteria-involved in&#xD;
      the production of molecules that impact health-are widely accepted to play a key role. A&#xD;
      significant proportion of IBD patients with pouches (surgically created rectums after the&#xD;
      diseased colon is removed) continue to have inflammation similar to their previous disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few microbes are known to have the capability to modify primary bile acids (PBAs) made&#xD;
      by the liver to secondary bile acids (SBAs). SBAs are some of the most common metabolites in&#xD;
      the colon and play key roles in several diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will investigate if ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may reduce&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and improve quality of life (as assessed by validate survey) in those&#xD;
      subjects with active antibiotic refractory or antibiotic dependent pouchitis.&#xD;

      The cause of Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unknown, but intestinal bacteria-involved in&#xD;

      significant proportion of IBD patients with pouches (surgically created rectums after the&#xD;

&#xD;
      Only a few microbes are known to have the capability to modify primary bile acids (PBAs) made&#xD;
      by the liver to secondary bile acids (SBAs). SBAs are some of the most common metabolites in&#xD;
      the colon and play key roles in several diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous study, the investigators examined bile acid levels in stool from pouches&#xD;
      (surgically-created &quot;rectums&quot; made of small bowel) in colectomy-treated patients with&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis (UC) versus colectomy-treated controls without inflammatory disease. This&#xD;
      comparison revealed that certain SBAs are significantly decreased in stool from UC compared&#xD;
      to control pouches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will investigate if ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may reduce&#xD;
      inflammatory markers and improve quality of life (as assessed by validate survey) in UC pouch&#xD;
      patients (colectomy-treated patients with ulcerative colitis) with active antibiotic&#xD;
      refractory or antibiotic dependent pouchitis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Written informed consent;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects, ≥18 years of age who have undergone an ileal pouch-anal&#xD;
             anastomosis (IPAA) for UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of pouchitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             Documented evidence of active pouchitis, based on endoscopy, symptoms and&#xD;
             histopathology, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Endoscopic score &gt;=2 on the endoscopic component of a modified Mayo endoscopic score&#xD;
             (where friability is scored as &gt;2) Note: the area within 1 cm of the pouch staple, or&#xD;
             pouch suture line, is not considered evaluable&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Symptomatic disease (stool frequency):&#xD;
&#xD;
             Subjects must demonstrate increased stool frequency compared to what is considered&#xD;
             &quot;normal&quot; after their IPAA operation (&quot;baseline&quot;). Stool frequency must be an absolute&#xD;
             value of &gt; 6 stools per day, and &gt; 3 stools per day above the post-IPAA &quot;baseline&quot;.&#xD;
             Note: The measurement of stool frequency will be a 7-day average rounded to the&#xD;
             nearest integer. The most recent 7 days of data will be used to calculate the average.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Histology: evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Modified PDAI (mPDAI) score &gt;= 5. The mPDAI consists of the symptom (range: 0-6) and&#xD;
             endoscopy (range: 0-6) subscores.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must have chronic antibiotic refractory or antibiotic dependent pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lack of effective contraception Women of childbearing potential may not participate&#xD;
             unless they are surgically sterile or are using adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following contraceptive methods are acceptable: hormonal (eg oral, injection,&#xD;
             transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring), barrier (eg condom or diaphragm with&#xD;
             spermicidal agent), intrauterine system or intrauterine device. If hormonal&#xD;
             contraceptives are used by female subjects, they must be established for 6 weeks&#xD;
             before the first administration of test product. Male sterilization is considered an&#xD;
             acceptable form of contraception if the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation&#xD;
             (absence of sperm) is provided in the subject's medical notes. Sexual abstinence is&#xD;
             considered acceptable if this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
             subject; periodic abstinence (eg calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation&#xD;
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential and female subjects who&#xD;
             are neither surgically sterilized nor post-menopausal (defined as no menses for one&#xD;
             year or a follicle-stimulating hormone value &gt; 40 IU/L) will be required to use&#xD;
             effective contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of allergy or adverse event to UDCA;&#xD;
&#xD;
             Stable use of concomitant medications for pouchitis is generally permitted, doses of&#xD;
             concomitant medication, where taken, should be optimised in accordance with&#xD;
             local/national practice guidelines, and dose levels and types of baseline medications&#xD;
             for pouchitis will be documented and any changes during the study will be recorded.&#xD;
             Changes in use of medications for pouchitis and high doses of oral steroids are not&#xD;
             permitted. It is particularly important to maintain stable medication through to&#xD;
             measurement of the primary end-point at Week 10. Criteria which would lead to&#xD;
             exclusion of subjects from the study are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Changes in dose to strong analgesia, such as opioid containing compounds within 4&#xD;
             weeks of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of regular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Oral 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) compounds; exclude subjects who have discontinued or&#xD;
             changed doses of oral 5-ASA within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Oral budesonide &gt; 6.0 mg/day is not permitted; exclude subjects who have received&#xD;
             budesonide for &lt; 6 weeks, or who have changed doses of budesonide within 4 weeks of&#xD;
             the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Oral steroids other than budesonide: exclude subjects who exceed a daily dose of 15 mg&#xD;
             prednisolone or equivalent, who have received oral steroids for &lt; 6 weeks, or who have&#xD;
             changed dose within 4 weeks of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of rectal compounds is not permitted; these agents must be discontinued at the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Immunosuppressant therapy (azathioprine, 6- mercaptopurine, methotrexate,&#xD;
             cyclosporin); exclude subjects who have received treatment for &lt; 12 weeks, or who have&#xD;
             changed doses within 8 weeks of the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Biological agents (Anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti - TNF) therapy, vedolizumab and /&#xD;
             or ustekinumab); exclude subjects who have received biological agents for &lt;6 months&#xD;
             prior to the screening visit, or who changed doses of the biological agent within 6&#xD;
             months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Previous use of UDCA is permitted: treatment course must have completed at least 12&#xD;
             weeks prior to the Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. All other agents targeted to pouchitis, including experimental agents, must have been&#xD;
             discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, or for a period equivalent&#xD;
             to 5 half-lives (t1⁄2) of the agent (whichever is longer) It is acceptable to recruit&#xD;
             subjects who remain on optimised, stable doses of oral 5-ASA, oral steroids (below the&#xD;
             doses stipulated above) and immunosuppressants.&#xD;
&#xD;
             It is acceptable to recruit subjects who terminated treatment with oral 5-ASA or oral&#xD;
             steroids 4 weeks before the Screening Visit, or immunosuppressants 8 weeks before the&#xD;
             Screening Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Analgesic use should remain stable throughout the trial where possible.&#xD;
             Paracetamol is the analgesic of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: VSL#3 probiotic treatment (and other probiotic treatments) will be permitted as&#xD;
             long as maintained stable for 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit, and maintained at&#xD;
             a stable dose throughout the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             Also excluded are subjects with:&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Anastomotic stricture&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Unable to undertake endoscopic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;

             the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Subjects with any laboratory tests considered clinically significant at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Subjects who may be unavailable for the duration of the trial, likely to be&#xD;
             noncompliant with the protocol, or who are felt to be unsuitable by the Investigator&#xD;
