  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to show that the repeated (twice-daily) measurement of&#xD;
      expired CO during hospitalization helps reduce smoking.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking in France represents 25 billion euros per year in care, hospitalizations and drugs&#xD;
      and 78000 deaths / year are linked to a pathology attributable to this addiction. In&#xD;
      addition, active consumption of cigarettes is a destabilizing factor for chronic respiratory&#xD;
      diseases. During hospitalization for acute respiratory illness, evaluation of smoking&#xD;
      cessation remains declarative. Although stopping advice and possibly nicotine replacement&#xD;
      therapy are prescribed, no objective measure of smoking is performed to assess the adequacy&#xD;
      of this attitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to objectively evaluate smoking during hospitalization by measuring twice&#xD;
      daily exhaled CO. The impact of this intervention on the duration of hospitalization and&#xD;
      smoking 3m after initial admission will also be evaluated. Tobacco consumption patterns based&#xD;
      on reason for hospital admission and background pathology will be highlighted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the impact of expired CO measurement during hospitalization on the smoking&#xD;
           status 1 month and 3 months after initial admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine smoking patterns during hospitalization according to reason for admission&#xD;
           and background pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the effect of iterative CO measurement on the duration of stays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure and compare the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the variability of expired CO measurements.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is designed to compare one group of patients who had morning (6-8 am) and evening (5-7 pm) measurements of expired carbon monoxide (COexp) every day during their hospitalization (the twice-daily COexp group) versus a second group who had COexp measurements only the first morning following admission and the morning just prior to discharge (control group). A high potential for arm-contamination led the investigators to exclude a randomised design. The frequent COexp intervention was therefore deployed throughout months 1 and 3 of the four-month inclusion period, while the control intervention was deployed on months 2 and 4.</intervention_model_description>
