  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During hospitalization, medication administration errors (MAEs) occur daily in health care&#xD;
      and can lead to serious harm. Improvement of medication safety is a major concern to&#xD;
      policymakers and health care workers. Inpatient self-administration of medication (SAM)&#xD;
      during hospital admission could be a way to reduce MAEs. Therefore the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to determine the effect of inpatient self-administration of medication on the number of&#xD;
      medication administration errors during hospitalization.&#xD;

      Objective: the main objective of this study is to determine the effect of inpatient&#xD;
      self-administration of medication on the number of medication administration errors during&#xD;
      hospitalization. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The effect of inpatient self-administration of medication on the severity of medication&#xD;
           administration errors during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effect of inpatient self-administration on medication adherence after&#xD;
           hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The effect of inpatient self-administration of medication on patient satisfaction during&#xD;
           hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The effect of inpatient self-administration of medication on staff satisfaction during&#xD;
           hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: multicentre prospective quasi-experimental study with a pre-post design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: hospitalized â‰¥ 16 years old patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: the implementation of self-administration of medication by hospitalized&#xD;
      patients. SAM will be compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters: The primary outcome measure of the study is the proportion of&#xD;
      medication administrations with one or more medication administration errors (MAEs).&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be: severity of MAEs, medication adherence after&#xD;
      hospitalization, patient satisfaction during hospitalization, and staff satisfaction. For all&#xD;
      outcome measures the effect of SAM will be compared to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: all subjects have to fulfil two questionnaires, one during hospitalization and&#xD;
      one approximately three months after leaving the studied ward, e.g. hospital discharge or&#xD;
      transfer. The subjects that are included in de post study period have to self-administrate&#xD;
      medication that's suitable for SAM. The risk of SAM during hospitalization is estimated as&#xD;
      the risk patients are at home when using medication. The burden of SAM is classified as low&#xD;
      because results of a recent questionnaire shows that admitted patients have the urge to act&#xD;
      in SAM schemes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of medication administration errors</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The doctor's prescriptions as noted in the CPOE system will be compared to the observed medication administration and any discrepancy will be marked as an MAE. The number of erroneous medication administrations (containing 1 or more errors) will be divided by the number of observed drug administrations plus the number of omissions (concept of opportunities).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of MAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of MAEs will be determined by two healthcare professionals, a physician and a pharmacist.To classify the severity of MAEs the NCC MERP Index for categorizing medication errors will be used. Thereafter consensus will be reached. The experts will be blinded to the period (usual care or intervention) during which the problem occurred.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence after hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence after hospitalisation will be measured using the Medication Adherence Reasons Scale (MAR-Scale). The MAR-Scale measures medication non-adherence based on the reasons for non-adherence so that each reason can be matched with a corresponding intervention. Approximately three months after hospitalization, a questionnaire consisting of six questions concerning the patient's medication use will be sent to all included patients by email.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Staff satisfaction will be measured using The Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM), Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM), and Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM). These are four-item measures of implementation outcomes that are often considered &quot;leading indicators&quot; of implementation success. These measures can be administered to a wide range of stakeholders to determine the extent to which they believe an intervention or an implementation strategy is acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. At the end of the study hospital staff will be asked to complete the questionnaires.</description>
