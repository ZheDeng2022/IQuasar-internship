      This is a phase I-II study with the herbal formulation (HF2) for treatment of active&#xD;
      ulcerative colitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two-stage study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will comprise an open label single arm exploratory study of 10 active ulcerative&#xD;
      colitis (UC) patients investigating oral HF2 therapy for induction of remission in&#xD;
      outpatients with active UC. Active disease is defined as (SCCAI) score ≥5 and a score of ≥2&#xD;
      in the modified Mayo endoscopic sub-score. Clinical remission is defined as a SCCAI score of&#xD;
      ≤2 The patients will receive HF2 therapy for 4 weeks. Stage 2: If clinical response (defined&#xD;
      as a drop of ≥3 points of the SCCAI score ) is achieved in ≥ 3 patients and no significant&#xD;
      safety signals will emerge, the investigators will proceed to a prospective pilot randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.Patients will be randomized into one of two arms: HF2 once daily or&#xD;
      placebo formulation (2:1 proportion) for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients in clinical remission at week 4 after&#xD;
      initiation of therapy.&#xD;

      1.1 Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of HF2 to induce remission in patients&#xD;
      with active UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a two-stage study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 will comprise an open label single arm exploratory study of 10 active UC patients&#xD;
      investigating HF2 therapy for induction of remission in outpatients with active UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: If clinical response is achieved in ≥ 3 patients and no significant safety signals&#xD;
      will emerge, the investigators will proceed to a prospective pilot randomized&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Open label study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7 Primary outcome stage I The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients in&#xD;
      clinical remission (SCCAI score of ≤2) at week 4 after initiation of therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes (phase 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7.1 The percentage of patients who had a rapid clinical response at day 7 after induction&#xD;
      of therapy 1.7.2 The percentage of patients who had a clinical response at week 4 after&#xD;
      initiation of therapy 1.7.3 Improvement in endoscopic score at week 4 compared to baseline&#xD;
      according to modified endoscopic Mayo score (improvement of ≥ 1 point) 1.7.4 Achievement of&#xD;
      mucosal healing (endoscopic modified Mayo score of ≤1). 1.7.5 Percentage of patients who&#xD;
      achieve normalization and/or &gt;50% improvement in C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or calprotectin&#xD;
      levels (computed out of patients with abnormal values at baseline for these indices).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7.6 Time-to-response defined as number of days to achieve a drop of ≥3 points of the SCCAI&#xD;
      score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7.7. Time-to-ceasing of bleeding, defined as number of days for complete absence of blood&#xD;
      in stools (SCCAI bleeding sub-score of 0), in those patients who has at least some blood in&#xD;
      stool at entry (SCCAI bleeding sub-score of 1 or more).&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7.8 The percentage of patients in clinical remission at day 7 after induction of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.7.9. Improvement in IBD quality of life as gauged by questionnaire (IBDQ). 2 Intervention:&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with active UC will receive HF2 therapy for 4 weeks. 3 Procedures: 3.2 At&#xD;
      inclusion: clinical and endoscopic assessment, blood and stool tests, cardiac echo and liver&#xD;
      ultrasonography 3.4 clinical and endoscopic assessment, blood and stool tests, cardiac echo&#xD;
      and liver ultrasonography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II: A multicenter randomized placebo controlled trial. The study will be performed in&#xD;
      Sheba Medical Center and up to 2 additional European centers (TBD). For this stage of the&#xD;
      trial , the patients will received HF2 combintation or similar (as described above) (2:1&#xD;
      allocation) for 8 weeks. After completion of 8 weeks, all responders previously on active&#xD;
      drug will receive additional 8 weeks of oral curcumin or placebo as per original arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: a composite outcome of clinical response (reduction in SCCAI of ≤3 OR&#xD;
      achievement of clinical remiision defined as SCCAI ≤2) coupled with an objective evidence of&#xD;
      response ( Mayo score improvement of ≥1 or 50% FcAL reduction ) at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients in clinical remission (SCCAI≤2) at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The percentage of patients who had a clinical response at week 8 after initiation of&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in endoscopic score at week 8 compared to baseline according to endoscopic&#xD;
           Mayo score (improvement of ≥ 1 point)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Achievement of mucosal healing (endoscopic modified Mayo score of ≤1) at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients who achieve normalization and/or &gt;50% improvement of CRP and/or&#xD;
           calprotectin levels (computed out of patients with abnormal values at baseline for these&#xD;
           indices) at week 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients in corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improvement in IBD quality of life as gauged by questionnaire (IBDQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients in clinical remission at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with clinical response at week 16&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients with normalized fecal calprotectin and CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Intervention: Patients will be randomized into one of two arms: HF2 or placebo&#xD;
      formulation (2:1 proportion) for 8 weeks. Following the first 8 weeks, responders w ill&#xD;
      receive an additional 8 weeks of curcumin 1.5 g/d or placebo (as per original arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo clinical, laboratory (CRP, biomarkers, blood chemistry, CBC_biomarker&#xD;
      (CRP and fecal calprotectin, at week 0,4,8 and 16 , and endoscopic assessment at baseline and&#xD;
      week 8. Cardiac echo and liver US will be performed at week 0 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroid tapering will be allowed as per treating physician's discretion after week 8.&#xD;
