    <textblock>
      Implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) is an invaluable tool for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia&#xD;
      (1). Cryptogenic stroke, unexplained syncope and arrhythmia diagnosis are the most common&#xD;
      indication for long term cardiac monitoring device. (2, 3). Reveal LINQTM (Medtronic, Inc.)&#xD;
      is widely used for all of these purposes in the country. We have previously reported the use&#xD;
      of Reveal XT in the use of atrial fibrillation (AF) surveillance in patient's post-AF&#xD;
      ablation (2). We indicated that ICM is useful in long term monitoring of atrial arrhythmia in&#xD;
      patients at risk of atrial fibrillation. Crystal AF (4) study also showed the importance of&#xD;
      using ICM in detecting occult AF in patients with cryptogenic stroke in a timely manner so&#xD;
      that appropriate treatment can be prescribed. The key to the success of ICM rest on how&#xD;
      timely and reliable the ICM data can be transmitted to physician's office immediately after&#xD;
      an arrhythmic events so the data can be analyzed and treatment rendered. Reveal LINQTM data&#xD;
      transmission consists of two steps: 1. Data needs to be download into the MyCareLink™ monitor&#xD;
      (scheduled daily at 2 am in the morning and monitor needs to be in the within 6 feet&#xD;
      proximity of the patient) 2. MyCareLink™ monitor to be connected to the 3 G cellular network&#xD;
      for the data transmission. (Fig 1). In cases of patient activated events, data transmission&#xD;
      utilizes similar pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have reported significant delay in data transmission in the Reveal LINQTM occurs&#xD;
      frequently and failure to connect among the Reveal LINQTM, MyCareLink™ monitor and the&#xD;
      cellular network is the main reason for data transmission disruption and critical data could&#xD;
      be concealed for an extended periods. To illustrate the importance of timely transmission of&#xD;
      patient data, a Reveal LINQTM was implanted in a 54-year-old gentle man with past medical&#xD;
      history of recurrent syncope. On 8/12/2017 the patient developed new onset dizziness and 6&#xD;
      seconds sinus pause was recorded by the device. However, a connection problem of MyCarelinkTM&#xD;
      system made data unavailable until next scheduled office visit on 11/15/2017. The physician&#xD;
      was notified on the same day and a pacemaker was implanted on the following day, almost 3&#xD;
      months after his significant arrhythmic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newer generation of ICM such as Confirm Rx™ (Abbott, Inc) is connected directly to a&#xD;
      patient's existing smartphone using the Bluetooth technology. By allowing patients to record&#xD;
      and transmit symptoms with the mobile app, Confirm Rx™ ICM brings continuous remote&#xD;
      monitoring to patients without the need for a home-based monitor (Fig 2). It is unclear which&#xD;
      technologies offers faster and more reliable transmission of critical patient information to&#xD;
      physician office so timely treatment can be provided. We therefore propose a pilot randomized&#xD;
      study comparing Confirm Rx™ and Reveal LINQTM in the reliability and timeliness in data&#xD;
      transmission.&#xD;
