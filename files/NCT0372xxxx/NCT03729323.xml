      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Nursing Consultation based on the&#xD;
      assumptions and techniques of Motivational Interviewing for the control of Type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus with associated diagnosis of Systemic Arterial Hypertension in primary healthcare.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Systemic Arterial Hypertension are major challenges to health&#xD;
      systems worldwide, and control, adherence and promotion of self-care are the cornerstone of&#xD;
      their management. In this context, an adequate therapist-patient relationship is the key to&#xD;
      the success of these interventions in healthcare, and nurses have a recognized and&#xD;
      outstanding role in improving adherence and care results in chronic diseases. Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) emerges as a skillful method of counseling that has proven to be effective&#xD;
      in promoting changes in a wide variety of health-related behaviors, including hypertension&#xD;
      and diabetes. Despite the increasing number of international studies in different health&#xD;
      fields, the scientific production that assess the applicability of Motivational Interviewing&#xD;
      to chronic diseases in the Brazilian setting is still modest. Recent studies suggest the need&#xD;
      for further research involving the discussion and improvement of studies utilizing&#xD;
      Motivational Interviewing in Brazil, as well as in other countries around the world, for&#xD;
      better outlook on this area of investigation. Therefore, this study intends to contribute to&#xD;
      this perspective and aims to investigate the effectiveness of this care strategy in&#xD;
      individual Nursing consultations for people with DM2 and SAH who are being treated in three&#xD;
      Primary Healthcare Clinics in the Northern Area of Porto Alegre - RS , Brazil, which are an&#xD;
      integral part of the Grupo Hospitalar Conceição (GHC) Community Health Service (SSC). GHC&#xD;
      treats patients from the Brazilian public health system exclusively, with universal and free&#xD;
      access, and the SSC is comprised of 16 primary care and mental health services, caring for a&#xD;
      population of 105,000 inhabitants in the northern and eastern areas of Porto Alegre, RS,&#xD;
      Brazil. This will be a randomized, controlled, parallel and double-blind clinical trial to be&#xD;
      conducted in the period from June to September, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAIN GOAL: To evaluate the effectiveness of Nursing Consultation based on the assumptions and&#xD;
      techniques of Motivational Interviewing in the control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with&#xD;
      associated diagnosis of Systemic Arterial Hypertension in primary healthcare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC GOALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize participants in terms of sociodemographic and economic profile, health&#xD;
           history, and life habits;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor and assess glycemic and pressure goals before and after intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the prevalence of adherence to drug therapy and healthy life habits among&#xD;
           participants before and after intervention;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess self-efficacy for participants' self-care before and after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Level of Importance and Confidence to change unhealthy behaviors among&#xD;
           participants with DM2 and SAH, before and after intervention.&#xD;
