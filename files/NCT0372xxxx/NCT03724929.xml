    <textblock>
      Vedolizumab (VDZ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the heterodimer α4β7 integrin and&#xD;
      which has shown its efficacy in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) by inducing and maintaining clinical&#xD;
      response/remission. The French marketing authorization was obtained for Ulcerative Colitis in&#xD;
      patients in failure with anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (anti-TNF) agents. In the pivotal study,&#xD;
      correlation between drug levels and clinical response during induction and maintenance&#xD;
      therapy were reported. Moreover, in 3.7% of cases, anti-vedolizumab antibodies were reported&#xD;
      during the time-course and 1% had samples that were persistently positive. Up to now, data on&#xD;
      the pharmacologic VDZ parameters are scarce and the relationships as well as the predictive&#xD;
      value of the measurement of VDZ concentrations and VDZ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) during&#xD;
      the induction and maintenance phases remains unknown. It could be of paramount interest to&#xD;
      early identify UC patients under VDZ who will be responders to VDZ induction and to identify&#xD;
      those who will achieve clinical remission under maintenance therapy with VDZ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of the pharmacokinetic studies of monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF antibodies&#xD;
      currently) has assumed increasing importance of its use in clinical practice. Therapeutic&#xD;
      algorithms for both Infliximab (IFX) and Adalimumab (ADA) have been published and are used by&#xD;
      many expert teams in the event of loss of therapeutic response. Similarly, the concentrations&#xD;
      are assuming important in the indication of therapeutic de-escalation. Lastly, the assays may&#xD;
      predict medium-term therapeutic response to treatment and thus enable proposal of preventive&#xD;
      therapeutic changes (5). The Gemini 1 study (phase 3 vedolizumab vs. placebo in Ulcerative&#xD;
      Colitis) showed a correlation between drug levels and clinical response during induction and&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. Moreover, in 3.7% of cases, anti-vedolizumab antibodies were reported&#xD;
      during the time-course and 1% had samples that were persistently positive. (1). In addition,&#xD;
      we have decided to assess the clinical response to VDZ induction at W10 (Week 10), as the&#xD;
      Gemini III trial for Crohn Disease (Crohn Disease) have reported, among patients who had&#xD;
      experienced previous Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) antagonist failure, that 15% of those given&#xD;
      vedolizumab versus 12% under placebo were in remission at W6 (P=0.433) whereas a higher&#xD;
      proportion of them were in remission (26%) under VDZ when compared with the placebo arm (12%)&#xD;
      at week 10. Therefore, in clinically non-responders at W10, an additional dose of 300 mg of&#xD;
      VDZ will be infused at W10 and every four weeks.&#xD;
