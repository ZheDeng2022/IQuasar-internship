    <textblock>
      Certified nursing assistants (CNAs), who provide the majority of care to persons with chronic&#xD;
      disease and/or cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, face&#xD;
      tremendous job and home stress, and as a result absenteeism and job turnover are high. This&#xD;
      is a preliminary study that will tailor Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) - a promising new&#xD;
      program designed to cultivate greater self-care, and strengthen resilience and coping skills&#xD;
      - for the CNA population and study its effectiveness. If results are favorable, MSC could be&#xD;
      incorporated into CNA training programs, thereby helping contribute to a more effective and&#xD;
      stable long-term care workforce.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      U.S. nursing homes (NHs) serve 1.6 million older persons, all of whom have significant&#xD;
      physical and/or cognitive impairment, and the majority of whom have Alzheimer's disease or a&#xD;
      related cognitive disorder. In these settings the vast majority of hands-on care is provided&#xD;
      by an estimated 634,000 certified nursing assistants (CNAs) - paraprofessional caregivers who&#xD;
      are racially diverse, largely female, and an annual income equivalent to the poverty&#xD;
      threshold for a family of four. Despite the crucial role of CNAs in providing care for the&#xD;
      long-term care population and efforts to recruit and retain a stable workforce, absenteeism&#xD;
      rates are high and annual turnover averages 65%, with adverse impact on the quality of care&#xD;
      provided to NH residents, making CNA retention a policy priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNAs have significant life stressors that affect their ability to work, such as single&#xD;
      parenthood, poor physical health, difficulty finding childcare, and transportation problems.&#xD;
      They also face emotionally and physically demanding job tasks, particularly when working with&#xD;
      persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, and many lack helpful strategies for&#xD;
      dealing with stress, negative feelings, and burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newly developed, standardized Mindful Self-Compassion (MSC) intervention may have&#xD;
      particularly high impact and relevance for the high-stress lives of NH CNAs. MSC training has&#xD;
      been shown to increase wellbeing, compassion for others, and stress-coping skills. However,&#xD;
      little is known about the impact, feasibility and acceptability of MSC training in&#xD;
      low-educated, stress-burdened paraprofessional populations such as CNAs, or whether it can&#xD;
      impact outcomes such as burnout, absenteeism, and turnover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary study will modify, refine, and test a MSC training intervention for CNAs, to&#xD;
      be known as the CNA Wellbeing Program, who care for nursing home residents. The researcher&#xD;
      teams' goal is to increase CNA coping skills and well-being, thereby reducing intent to leave&#xD;
      the job, reducing burnout, and improving job satisfaction and attitudes toward people with&#xD;
      dementia. The proposed research will be conducted in 3 similarly rated and structured&#xD;
      community NHs. In Aim 1 the investigators will assess intervention feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability in one NH, using the knowledge they gain to tailor an evidence-based MSC&#xD;
      program specifically for CNAs. In Aim 2 the investigators will pilot test the MSC training&#xD;
      program with 30 CNAs who work in 2 similarly rated and structured NHs, evaluating the&#xD;
      fidelity of the revised training and exploring trends in immediate, 3-month, and 6-month&#xD;
      outcome measures in order to inform power calculations for future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and necessary adaptations of MSC training&#xD;
      needed to meet the diverse cultural background, limited literacy, and job and family&#xD;
      challenges of the nursing home CNA workforce, including the unique challenges of caring for&#xD;
      persons with dementia, and of the data collection methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conduct a field trial of the standardized 8-week MSC training program with 15 CNAs&#xD;
           within a single community NH. Evaluation will focus on: (a) participation (including&#xD;
           home practice adherence); (b) attendee evaluation of the training; (c) barriers to and&#xD;
           facilitators of participation; (d) use and retention of class material by participants;&#xD;
           and (e) recommendations for improvement of training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Field test the feasibility and acceptability of our study recruitment and evaluation&#xD;
           strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Use data collected from the field test to modify recruitment strategies, protocols, and&#xD;
           course structure, content and materials so as to be maximally feasible, acceptable and&#xD;
           effective in a CNA population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Conduct a pilot test of the adapted protocols and intervention in a sample of 30 CNAs&#xD;
      from 2 similarly rated and structured community NHs to reexamine feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, identify trends in key intermediate and long-term outcomes, and estimate&#xD;
      effect size in preparation for a future randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the fidelity and immediate impact of the modified training by measuring (a)&#xD;
           training attendance; (b) satisfaction with the training; and (c) pre-and post-training&#xD;
           measures of self-compassion, perceived stress, job satisfaction, job burnout symptoms,&#xD;
           and attitudes towards persons with dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the sustained impact of the training by comparing baseline, 3-and 6-month&#xD;
           post-training measurements of: intent to leave job, self-compassion, perceived stress,&#xD;
           job satisfaction, job burnout symptoms, and attitudes towards persons with dementia.&#xD;

        <description>The researchers will assess intent to leave job by asking &quot;How likely is it that you will leave this job in the next year? &quot;Would you say... 1 is Not at All Likely, 2 is Somewhat Likely, 3 is Very Likely.&quot; Minimum = 1 (best value), maximum = 3 (worst value). For the primary outcome analysis, intent will be evaluated by totaling the count of participants who responded &quot;Somewhat Likely&quot;, &quot;Very likely&quot;, or &quot;Not at all likely.&quot; This was collected over the course of four time frames: Baseline, End-of Intervention interview, 3-Month Follow Up Interview, and 6-Month Follow Up Interview.</description>

Analysis reports mean score rather than total score; range of the mean score is 0 to 6, with lower values representing better outcomes. Measure was assessed at Baseline, at an End-of-Intervention Interview, a 3-month Follow Up Interview and at a 6-month Follow Up Interview.</description>

          <title>Change in Mean Score Over Time on Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - Personal Accomplishment Subscale</title>
          <description>Burnout will be assessed via a modified Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) - Personal Accomplishment Subscale (one of three subscales within the MBI), a 7-item scale. Items are measured on a 7-point Likert scale that asks how often respondents are feeling certain feelings. Minimum score (worst value, never) = 0. Maximum score (best value, every day) = 6. Analysis reports mean score rather than total score; range of the mean score is 0 to 6, with higher values representing better outcomes. Measure was assessed at Baseline, at an End-of-Intervention Interview, a 3-month Follow Up Interview and at a 6-month Follow Up Interview.</description>

This is done using a 5-point Likert scale. Minimum score = 1 (worst value). Maximum score = 5 (best value). Analysis reports mean score rather than total score (total range is 0.0 to 5.0), with higher values indicating better outcomes.

        <title>Change in Mean Score Over Time on Self-compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF) - Self-kindness Subscale</title>
        <description>The researchers will collect pre-post measures using the Self-compassion scale-short form (SCS-SF) - Self-kindness Subscale (one of six subscales within the SCS-SF), a 3-item scale. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Minimum score = 1 (worst value). Maximum score = 5 (best value), higher scores indicating better outcomes. Analysis reports mean score rather than total score (total range is 0.0 to 5.0). Measure was assessed at Baseline, at an End-of-Intervention Interview, a 3-month Follow Up Interview and at a 6-month Follow Up Interview.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the intervention and 6 additional months after the intervention ends, an expected average of 8 months</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is composed of participants who began the intervention. All collected data are reported. Some data are missing due to study attrition or nonresponse.</population>

        <title>Change in Mean Score Over Time on Self-compassion Scale-Short Form (SCS-SF) - Common Humanity Subscale</title>
        <description>The researchers will collect pre-post measures using the Self-compassion scale-short form (SCS-SF) - Common humanity Subscale (one of six subscales within the SCS-SF), a 3-item scale. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Minimum score = 1 (worst value). Maximum score = 5 (best value), with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Analysis reports mean score rather than total score (total range is 0.0 to 5.0). Measure was assessed at Baseline, at an End-of-Intervention Interview, a 3-month Follow Up Interview and at a 6-month Follow Up Interview.</description>

        <description>The researchers will collect pre-post measures using the Self-compassion scale-short form (SCS-SF) - Mindfulness Subscale (one of six subscales within the SCS-SF), a 3-item scale. Items are measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Minimum score = 1 (worst value). Maximum score = 5 (best value), with higher scores indicating better outcomes. Analysis reports mean score rather than total score (total range is 0.0 to 5.0). Measure was assessed at Baseline, at an End-of-Intervention Interview, a 3-month Follow Up Interview and at a 6-month Follow Up Interview.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were followed for the duration of the intervention and 6 additional months after the intervention ends, an expected average of 8 months</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis population is composed of participants who began the intervention. All collected data are reported. Some data are missing due to study attrition or nonresponse.</population>
