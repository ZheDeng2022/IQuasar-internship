      Multicenter observational program Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of Detralex&#xD;
      treatment in patients with chronic venous edema (CEAP class С3) in real clinical practice&#xD;
      Design The VAP-PRO-C3 is a multicenter observational program, which is carried out in the&#xD;
      frame of routine consultations and follow-up of patients. The program includes patients with&#xD;
      chronic venous diseases (CVDs) of CEAP class C3. It is scheduled in Russia for 2018-2019. The&#xD;
      program is expected to enroll 90 phlebologists from 60 cities of Russia. The planned number&#xD;
      of patients is 900 Aim of the study The study is aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of systemic pharmacotherapy (Detralex) as a part of combination treatment, and its influence&#xD;
      on the general outcomes of treatment of patients with chronic venous edema (CEAP class C3) in&#xD;
      real clinical practice.&#xD;
