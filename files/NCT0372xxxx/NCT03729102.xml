      To study immunological tolerance effect after frequent rabies booster vaccination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies had shown lower antibody titers among those who received frequent rabies&#xD;
      booster vaccination, compared to ones who had got primary immunization. We study&#xD;
      immunological cells i.e., regulatory T cell, regulatory B cell, T follicular helper cell, and&#xD;
      cytokines in those who received frequent rabies booster vaccination.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There would be two study groups. Those who had received primary immunization would be the control group. While persons who had received primary immunization and later received booster vaccination for at least 3 times would be the study group.&#xD;
All participants would be given one dose of rabies vaccine and monitored the immunological cells and cytokines before and after the rabies booster injection.</intervention_model_description>
