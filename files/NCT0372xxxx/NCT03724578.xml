    <textblock>
      The objective is to conduct an randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of grape seeds extract mouth wash in comparison with standard caries preventive&#xD;
      measures for the prevention of new carious lesions in high caries risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be designed to test the alternative hypothesis that using grape seed extract&#xD;
      mouth wash in addition to standard preventive measures will show significant difference over&#xD;
      using standard preventive measures alone in preventing incidence of new carious lesions in&#xD;
      high caries risk patients&#xD;

      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In high caries risk patients, will the incorporation of grape seeds extract after using&#xD;
      standard oral hygiene measures be beneficial in reducing caries risk and preventing the&#xD;
      incidence of new carious lesions?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be announced at the Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Future University&#xD;
      campus to encourage interested students to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interested participants will be screened at Conservative Department clinic for eligibility.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be assessed using caries risk assessment tool (American Dental&#xD;
      Association caries risk assessment form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly divided into three groups 1st group will follow only&#xD;
      standard preventive measures (tooth brushing twice a day with fluoride tooth paste and&#xD;
      inter-dental flossing once daily), 2nd group will use grape seeds extract mouth wash beside&#xD;
      standard preventive measure, and 3rd group will use antimicrobial mouthwash with fluoride&#xD;
      beside standard preventive measure General operative procedures Before starting the study the&#xD;
      eligible participants will undergo scaling and prophylaxis polishing, then any carious&#xD;
      cavity, or defective restoration will be treated and filled with resin composite restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New set of manual brushes and dental floss will be given to the participants, after they are&#xD;
      properly trained for the correct brushing and flossing technique. The participants will be&#xD;
      asked to brush their teeth twice a day with fluoride tooth paste and to clean their teeth&#xD;
      inter-dentally with dental floss once a day every day till the end of the study. All the&#xD;
      participants will undergo scaling and prophylaxis polishing at every recall visit Preparation&#xD;
      of the grape seeds extract mouthwash&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure of preparing Grape Seed Extract:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grape seeds will be collected from grapes which are available in the market. These seeds will&#xD;
      be dried under sunlight for 2 days, and then these seeds will be grounded with cold pressure&#xD;
      technique. Ground grape seeds (100 gm) will be extracted with ethanol/water ratio of 70:30,&#xD;
      vol/vol, by maceration method under stirring at 45 degree centigrade for 2 hours, then The&#xD;
      extract will be filtered(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention 1 group Beside the standard preventive measures that the participants&#xD;
      will be trained to follow, each patient will be given a bottle of grape seeds extract&#xD;
      mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be instructed to rinse 15 milliliter of the mouthwash twice a day after&#xD;
      breakfast and before bedtime and to retain it in their mouth for one minute before&#xD;
      expectorating it, and not to consume any food or drink for 30 minutes after the use of&#xD;
      mouthwash(12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For intervention 2 group The participants will be instructed to rinse 15 milliliter of the&#xD;
      mouth twice a day after breakfast and before bedtime and to retain it in their mouth for one&#xD;
      minute before expectorating it, and not to consume any food or drink for 30 minutes after the&#xD;
      use of mouthwash. Participants will repeat this protocol for five days every month until the&#xD;
      end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group Participants in this group will follow only the standard preventive&#xD;
      measures which is brushing twice a day after breakfast and before bed time and daily flossing&#xD;
      inter-dentally before bed time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all study groups if any patient during the period of the study develops any carious&#xD;
      cavity, the affected tooth will be treated immediately and restored with resin composite&#xD;
      restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual inspection to detect presence or absence of new caries lesions will be done according&#xD;
      to World Health Organization guidelines. Caries detection will be carried out after careful&#xD;
      drying of the tooth surface using three-way syringe to facilitate detection of initial enamel&#xD;
      lesions (white spot lesions). Also pits and fissure carious lesions will be detected using&#xD;
      visual and tactile method. (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess Incidence of new caries in Grape seeds versus standard&#xD;
      measures for prevention of caries. Based on a previous paper by Zhang 2006(27) the difference&#xD;
      in caries development (reduction by antimicrobial mouth wash) between at least 2 groups is&#xD;
      40%. Using power 80% and 5% significance level the investigators will need to study 22 in&#xD;
      each group. This number is to be increased to a sample size of 26 to compensate for losses&#xD;
      during follow up. Sample size calculation was achieved using PS: Power and Sample Size&#xD;
      Calculation software Version 3.1.2 (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, USA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by (S.K and O.N) from the students of Faculty of Oral and Dental&#xD;
      medicine, Future University as the research is targeting young Egyptian adults, only the&#xD;
      eligible participants will be chosen until reaching the target sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Baseline data collection: For every patient medical and dental history and caries risk&#xD;
      assessment profile will be obtained. Examination chart will be filled by (O.N)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual caries inspection and community periodontal index probe(28) will be used by the&#xD;
      assessor (S.K and E.A) after 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year to evaluate the presence&#xD;
      or absence of new caries lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient retention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's phone number will be recorded in their charts and before every visit the&#xD;
      patient will receive a reminder call by (O.N). If the patient did not answer, another&#xD;
      appointment will be scheduled within a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No harms are expected as the intervention product is natural product and Considered as&#xD;
      (generally recognized as safe) by The FDA (Food and Drug Administration Informed consent The&#xD;
      trial will be explained to the patients by the principle investigator. The researcher will&#xD;
      discuss the interventions and possible harms with patients and obtain written consent (in&#xD;
      Arabic) from the patients willing to participate in the trial. An appendix of the consent&#xD;
      form is attached to the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-trial care All patients will complete their treatment by the same operator at the clinic&#xD;
      of the Conservative Department. The participants will be followed up even after the trial&#xD;
      ends (6 months follow up period) to treat patient's complaints and prevent any possible&#xD;
      complications&#xD;
