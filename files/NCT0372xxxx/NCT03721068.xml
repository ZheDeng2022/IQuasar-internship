  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infections and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are molecules that fight infections and protect your body&#xD;
      from diseases caused by bacteria and toxic substances. Antibodies work by sticking to those&#xD;
      bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or&#xD;
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been enough to cure most&#xD;
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a&#xD;
      more effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T&#xD;
      lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells (CAR) cells targeted against the&#xD;
      disialoganglioside (GD2) antigen that express Interleukin (IL)-15, and the inducible caspase&#xD;
      9 safety switch (iC9), also known as iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it has been shown that when T cells have part of an antibody attached to&#xD;
      them they are better at recognizing and killing cancer cells. The antibody that will be used&#xD;
      in this study is called anti-GD2. This antibody floats around in the blood and can detect and&#xD;
      stick to cancer cells called neuroblastoma cells because they have a substance on the outside&#xD;
      of the cells called GD2. For this study, the anti-GD2 antibody has been changed so instead of&#xD;
      floating freely in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. However, it is unknown how&#xD;
      long the iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells last in the body, so their chances of fighting cancer&#xD;
      cells are not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve the tumor fighting power of GD2-CAR-T cells, our researchers have added two&#xD;
      additional components to these cells. The IL-15 gene was added so that the GD2-CAR-T cells&#xD;
      can attack tumor cells more effectively. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a chemical that cells use&#xD;
      to communicate with one another. Other research using IL-15 in combination with CAR-T cells&#xD;
      has shown there is an increase in the body's ability to allow the CAR-T cells to survive and&#xD;
      grow in the body. The iC9 gene was added as an &quot;off switch&quot; so it can stop the activity of&#xD;
      the GD2-CAR-T cells if you experience any serious bad side effects. Bad side effects seen&#xD;
      previously in patients receiving the GD2 antibody alone include pain. In this study, the&#xD;
      &quot;stop switch&quot; can be used to turn off the GD2-CAR-T cells if you experience intense pain that&#xD;
      does not respond to normal pain treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9.GD2.IL-15 T cells is&#xD;
      safe and tolerable in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a single center, open-label, Phase I clinical trial to establish a safe&#xD;
      dose (i.e., number of cells/kg) of autologous iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma. The study will enroll a minimum of 10 subjects;&#xD;
      all subjects will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to the cell infusion as outlined&#xD;
      in section 4.2.2. The continual reassessment method (CRM) will be used to estimate the&#xD;
      maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of cells that can be administered in dose escalation cohorts&#xD;
      comprised of 2-6 subjects. The final MTD will be the dose with estimated probability of DLT&#xD;
      closest to the target toxicity rate of 20%. The three cell doses that will be evaluated are&#xD;
      outlined in the table below starting at the lowest dose level 1: 0.5 x 106 CAR+ cells/kg&#xD;
      iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells. Cohort enrollment will be staggered and each subject must complete&#xD;
      at least 2 weeks of cell treatment without incident of DLT before another subject can be&#xD;
      enrolled at that dose level. A minimum of two subjects must complete the 4-week post-infusion&#xD;
      DLT safety assessment period before cohort enrollment of subjects at the next higher dose&#xD;
      level will be considered. If dose level 1 is determined to be above a tolerable dose,&#xD;
      de-escalation would occur to dose level -1 where subjects would receive 0.25 x 106 CAR+&#xD;
      cells/kg. After dose escalation is completed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8&#xD;
      subjects at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) to further assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells. In the expansion phase, subjects will receive iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15&#xD;
      T-cells at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with lymphodepletion given prior to a cell&#xD;
      product administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cell Procurement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 3 mL/kg of peripheral blood will be obtained (in up to 3 collections) from patients for&#xD;
      cell procurement. For subjects with inadequate lymphocyte count or who are unable to donate&#xD;
      adequate amounts of peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate sufficient&#xD;
      T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be up to 2 blood volumes. Approximately 4-6 weeks&#xD;
      later, subjects for whom cells have been successfully generated and who meet eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for lymphodepletion will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lymphodepleting Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be given lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine. This will consist of four days total and should be timed to be completed 2-14&#xD;
      days before planned infusion of CAR T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide will be given IV 500 mg/m2/day on days 1-2 and fludarabine will be given IV&#xD;
      30 mg/m2/day on days 1-4. No mesna will be required, although it may be used at investigator&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will&#xD;
      receive iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the lymphodepleting&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen. We will administer T-cells post lymphodepletion as dosed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After dose escalation is completed, an expansion cohort will enroll up to 8 subjects to&#xD;
      further assess the safety and efficacy of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 T-cells. In the expansion phase,&#xD;
      patients who meet criteria outlined in Section 4.2.5 will be allowed to receive a second cell&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy in LCCC 1743-ATL involves infusion of iC9.GD2.CAR.IL-15 CAR T cells. Treatment will&#xD;
      be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject decides to withdraw from study treatment, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the subject's condition render the subject unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is ineligible for a second infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for RCR evaluation or until death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. In addition to this follow-up, subjects removed from study treatment for&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who receive new therapy after receiving a cell infusion will still be required to&#xD;
      complete abbreviated follow up procedures.&#xD;
