  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to search for effective and low toxicity anti-tumor angiogenesis drugs, jiangsu&#xD;
      hengrui pharmaceutical co., ltd. developed the high-efficiency VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor apatinib. This drug is mainly used to treat malignant tumors by inhibiting VEGFR2&#xD;
      to play an anti-angiogenic role. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that&#xD;
      apatinib has good tumor growth inhibition activity for lung cancer. This study aims to&#xD;
      further confirm the effectiveness and safety of apatinib third-line treatment for patients&#xD;
      with advanced lung squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib, 250mg, once a day (qd), take it half an hour after meal (the time for taking the&#xD;
      medicine should be the same as possible), and take it with warm water. 28 days is a drug&#xD;
      delivery cycle.According to the patient's condition, a single drug was selected for 6 cycles&#xD;
      of chemotherapy in gemcitabine, yew and ruibin, changchun. After the chemotherapy, the single&#xD;
      drug apatinib was maintained.Adverse reactions should be closely monitored during the use of&#xD;
      apatinib and adjusted as needed to enable patients to tolerate treatment. The adverse&#xD;
      reactions caused by apatinib can be treated by symptomatic treatment, drug withdrawal and&#xD;
      dose adjustment. In clinical studies, dose adjustment usually occurs in the second and third&#xD;
      cycles (28 days is one cycle). In case of 3/4 grade adverse reactions, the drug can be&#xD;
      suspended until the toxic and side effects are completely recovered. Exit the study if 3/4&#xD;
      level of adverse reactions occur again after resumption of medication.&#xD;
