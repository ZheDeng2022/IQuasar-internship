  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa can have serious adverse consequences for the mother, including an increased&#xD;
      risk of maternal mobility, antenatal and intrapartum hemorrhage, and the mother may,&#xD;
      therefore, require a blood transfusion or even an emergency hysterectomy. Although it is a&#xD;
      relatively rare condition with an overall incidence of 0.28-2.0% of all deliveries, it has&#xD;
      been suggested that the incidence of placenta previa is increasing. Many gynecological&#xD;
      surgeons use a local injection of vasopressin, which is a known peripheral vasoconstrictor,&#xD;
      at the time of laparoscopic myomectomy to decrease blood loss. In addition, the useful role&#xD;
      for local infiltration of vasopressin to arrest hemorrhage from the placental bed has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in several obstetrical case reports. The vasopressin V1Î± receptor has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to be present in the myometrium of both non-pregnant and pregnant women and&#xD;
      contributes to myometrial contraction. Therefore, the investigators evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      local injection of vasopressin on the blood loss and secondary impact on complications during&#xD;
      cesarean section in cases of placenta previa.&#xD;

      The study drug was administered immediately after delivery, as soon as the umbilical cord was&#xD;
      clamped. The experimental group received a bolus injection of vasopressin (4 IU) diluted to 2&#xD;
      mL with saline into the myometrium of the placental bed during slow (30-seeconds) Conversely,&#xD;
      the placebo group received a 10-mL bolus injection of saline into the myometrium during slow&#xD;
      (30-seconds).&#xD;
