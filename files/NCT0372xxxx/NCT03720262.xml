      PHaLIR is a prospective, double-blinded randomized study in which patients planned for stoma&#xD;
      reversal after rectal cancer surgery are randomized between retro muscular mesh Ultrapro&#xD;
      Advanced or standard treatment without mesh.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A temporary loop ileostomy is widely used when operating rectal cancer. The ostomy is then&#xD;
      reversed in a separate operation. Morbidity of stoma reversal is significant, but not clearly&#xD;
      defined. One complication in connection with stoma closure is development of hernia at the&#xD;
      former stoma site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hernia is a weakening of the muscular layers and the connective tissue of the abdominal&#xD;
      wall, which may cause pain and discomfort, as well as an inconvenient bulge. A hernia could&#xD;
      also cause more serious complication of obstructed or strangulated bowel. According to&#xD;
      international studies, the incidence of hernia at the ostomy site varies between 7% and 35%.&#xD;
      Many of the studies are heterogenic and some of them include both colostomies and&#xD;
      ileostomies. Among studies that focus on reversal of ileotomies the hernia incidence varies&#xD;
      between 11-15%. Preliminary results from a retrospective study in Stockholm indicates a&#xD;
      frequency of 7,9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The best method to avoid hernia after stoma closure is not known. Most commonly surgeons tend&#xD;
      to close the fascia in one layer with monofilament suture. In the study mentioned above 91%&#xD;
      of the operations were done with one-layer monofilament, mostly PDS. Use of prophylactic mesh&#xD;
      in the abdominal wall has been proposed, but there is currently insufficient scientific&#xD;
      evidence to recommend it as a routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is focused on loop ileostomy closure after rectal cancer. A&#xD;
      non-heterogenous group of ostomies will serve as a base to evaluate whether the incidence of&#xD;
      hernia may be reduced. If this study detects a decreased frequency of hernia when using&#xD;
      prophylactic meshes, it may lead to new recommendations for this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHaLIR is a prospective, double-blinded randomized study in which patients planned for stoma&#xD;
      reversal after rectal cancer surgery will be randomized to retro muscular mesh Ultrapro&#xD;
      Advanced or standard treatment without mesh. Operating time, complications, LOS, pain,&#xD;
      infections and postoperative hernia are to be studied. The patients will be identified and&#xD;
      asked about participation when they come for postoperative control after rectal cancer&#xD;
      operation and are planned for the ileostomy reversal after check of the rectal anastomosis.&#xD;
      They will be given oral and written information and signed informed consent is required from&#xD;
      all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At operation the operation-protocol should be filled in. The operation notes will be written&#xD;
      in a blinded way and the original version will be stored on paper until after the study is&#xD;
      finished and then added to the patient chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At discharge from the surgical ward the patient should be planned for a follow up at the&#xD;
      surgical clinic at 30 days postoperatively. The doctor at the follow up visit should be&#xD;
      another than the operating surgeon. The patients should then fill in a questionnaire and the&#xD;
      surgeon should note the postoperative complications in the 30-days follow up form. At the&#xD;
      30-day follow up the surgeon checks that the one-year follow up after the cancer operation is&#xD;
      commissioned. Normally this is a CT thorax and abdomen with contrast. For the study-patients&#xD;
      it should be complemented with the question of hernia and the CT scan shall be a CT with&#xD;
      straining. The normal 1-year follow up for the cancer will be the follow up for the ileostomy&#xD;
      reversal also. That means that in most cases it will take place 6-9 months after the&#xD;
      reversal. At this control and at the three years control (after cancer operation) the patient&#xD;
      will be given or mailed a questionnaire (the same as the 30-day questionnaire). The follow up&#xD;
      by doctor could be done either with a clinical visit or a telephone call according to the&#xD;
      routines of the clinic when they follow up their cancer patients. At three years follow up&#xD;
      after cancer operation patients will also get the same questionnaire and the CT scan follow&#xD;
      up at three years will also be with straining.&#xD;
