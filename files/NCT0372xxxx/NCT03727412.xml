      INTRODUCTION Post-implantation syndrome is the clinical and biochemical expression of an&#xD;
      inflammatory response following endovascular repair of an aortic aneurysm. PIS is mainly a&#xD;
      clinical condition associated with the implantation of an endograft and is diagnosed by the&#xD;
      presence of fever accompanied by elevated WBC count above normal without any evidence of an&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between the type of the endograft placed and the development of PIS may&#xD;
      indicate that the inflammatory reaction is due to the material of the endograft itself (&#xD;
      polyester or PTFE ). Based on the results of different studies the type of endograft's&#xD;
      material seems to play an important role in PIS development and may have a predictive role&#xD;
      for a significant number of patients undergoing endovascular repair of abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm (EVAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most studies PIS is considered a benign condition, although it may lead to a more&#xD;
      demanding postoperative care characterized by prolonged hospitalization. In an other&#xD;
      prospective study patients with PIS were more likely to suffer from an adverse event during&#xD;
      the 30 days after the procedure. The occurrence of PIS was the only independent predictor of&#xD;
      a MACE ( major cardiovascular events ) or an adverse event during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current available literature data certainly raise the question of altering current approach&#xD;
      and treat patients with PIS by focusing on the reduction of the inflammatory response by&#xD;
      administration of steroid or non-steroidal drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomized placebo-controlled study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      perioperative administration of Naproxen (NPR) an anti-inflammatory drug with a beneficial&#xD;
      cardiovascular safety profile in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm undergoing&#xD;
      endovascular repair could have any effect on the inflammatory response and patients outcome&#xD;
      during the first year of follow-up after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD PIS will be considered as the presence of fever (persisting body temperature &gt; 38 ° C&#xD;
      lasting more than 1 day during hospitalization) and leukocytosis ( white blood cell count &gt;&#xD;
      12,000 / mL ) with negative blood and urine culture. All patients with AAA that will be&#xD;
      subjected to EVAR in our department since February 2018 and who will receive an endograft&#xD;
      made from polyester will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients after being informed pre-operatively about the way and the purpose of the&#xD;
      clinical study, the patients will be randomly selected to receive either naproxen ( NPR ) 500&#xD;
      mg x 2 or placebo, starting the previous day before the procedure and for 3 days&#xD;
      postoperatively. The NPR was selected due to the expected significant anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      activity and favorable cardiovascular safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients presenting with fever during the post-operative period, whether or not&#xD;
      fulfilling the PIS criteria, will undergo a thorough work up for possible infection. If any&#xD;
      of these tests reveal evidence of an early pulmonary, urinary tract or any other kind of&#xD;
      infection, the patient will not be considered to suffer from PIS. Patients will be discharged&#xD;
      in the absence of any complications, with a body temperature &lt; 38oC for at least 24 hours and&#xD;
      a WBC &lt; 12.000/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides the traditional inflammatory markers (WBC, hs-CRP, and fibrinogen ) the investigators&#xD;
      will also measure interleukin 6 (IL-6) because it was the only marker significantly altered&#xD;
      in PIS patients in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up will be performed at 1, and 12 months after surgery. Patient quality of life&#xD;
      will also be studied by completing the SF36 questionnaire preoperatively and in the first&#xD;
      year post-operative follow-up.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Post-implantation syndrome is the clinical and biochemical expression of an&#xD;
      inflammatory response following endovascular repair of an aortic aneurysm.1 PIS is mainly a&#xD;
      clinical condition associated with the implantation of an endograft and is diagnosed by the&#xD;
      presence of fever accompanied by elevated WBC count above normal without any evidence of an&#xD;
      infection. The reported incidence of PIS in the literature has been varying widely from 14 to&#xD;
      60%.2-5 The correlation between the type of the endograft placed and the development of PIS&#xD;
      may indicate that the inflammatory reaction is due to the material of the endograft itself&#xD;
      (polyester or PTFE). Gerasimidis et al. in a relatively underpowered study concluded for the&#xD;
      first time in 2005 that fever was more common in a group of patients receiving an endograft&#xD;
      made from polyester in contrast to those receiving a PTFE graft. Interleukin 8 (IL-8) was&#xD;
      higher in the first group, indicating a stronger host reaction in the specific material.&#xD;
      Voute et al. in a later study showed that the implantation of stent grafts based on polyester&#xD;
      was independently associated with a stronger inflammatory response. Moulakakis et al.,&#xD;
      observing a milder inflammatory activation in patients with a PTFE endograft, have confirmed&#xD;
      this finding in a later report. Accordingly a previous study found that the use of polyester&#xD;
      endograft independently predicted PIS and was correlated with an above 10 times higher risk&#xD;
      for an inflammatory response. Based on the results of the above 3 mentioned studies the type&#xD;
      of endograft's material seems to play an important role in PIS development and may have a&#xD;
      predictive role for a significant number of patients undergoing endovascular repair of&#xD;
      abdominal aortic aneurysm ( EVAR ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation of PIS with patient's outcome has not been adequately established. In most&#xD;
      studies PIS is considered a benign condition, although it may lead to a more demanding&#xD;
      postoperative care characterized by prolonged hospitalization. In a prospective study of 214&#xD;
      patients after EVAR this group found that patients with PIS were more likely to suffer from&#xD;
      an adverse event during the 30 days after the procedure. Adverse events occurred in 25.9% of&#xD;
      the PIS group compared to 2.9% of the non- PIS group and included any major cardiovascular&#xD;
      event, acute renal failure, readmission, and death by any cause. For the same cohort, at the&#xD;
      1-year follow-up, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin 6 were attenuated&#xD;
      toward the values of the non-PIS group. During the one-year follow-up period, MACE and&#xD;
      adverse events occurred, respectively, in 17.2% and in 18.8% of patients in the PIS group and&#xD;
      in 4.3% and 5.1% of the non-PIS group. The occurrence of PIS was the only independent&#xD;
      predictor of a MACE or an adverse event during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current available literature data certainly raise the question of altering current&#xD;
      therapeutic approach and treat patients with PIS by focusing on the reduction of the&#xD;
      inflammatory response by administration of steroid or non-steroidal drugs. Motte et al&#xD;
      published recently a prospective trial of 150 EVAR patients who were randomized to receive a&#xD;
      single preoperative dose of methylprednisolone or placebo. The inflammatory response, as&#xD;
      assessed by the inflammatory biomarkers levels, was reduced in the methylprednisolone group,&#xD;
      although no differences were noted in patient outcomes between the two groups during a&#xD;
      3-month follow-up period. Data on postoperative use of anti-inflammatory drugs are absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because PIS was the only independent predictor of an adverse event during the first year&#xD;
      after EVAR, it seems that even a strong inflammatory stimulus at the immediate postoperative&#xD;
      period could probably affect the cardiovascular health of these patients at the long term.&#xD;
      Any therapeutic measurements that might thus focus on PIS acute treatment or even prevention&#xD;
      seem reasonable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present randomized placebo-controlled study is to evaluate whether the&#xD;
      perioperative administration of Naproxen (NPR) an anti-inflammatory drug with a beneficial&#xD;
      cardiovascular safety profile17 in patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm undergoing&#xD;
      endovascular repair could have any effect on the inflammatory response and patients outcome&#xD;
      during the first year of follow-up after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient quality of life will also be studied by completing the SF36 questionnaire&#xD;
      preoperatively and in the first year post-operative follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD According to the definition of PIS, it must fulfill at least two of the criteria of&#xD;
      the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), i.e. fever and leukocytosis. Therefore,&#xD;
      PIS will be considered as the presence of fever (persisting body temperature &gt; 38 ° C lasting&#xD;
      more than 1 day during hospitalization) and leukocytosis ( white blood cell count &gt; 12,000 /&#xD;
      mL ) with negative blood and urine culture. All patients with AAA that will be subjected to&#xD;
      EVAR from February 2018 and who will receive an endograft made from polyester will be&#xD;
      included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be clinical and / or laboratory indications of an infection&#xD;
      preoperatively, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leukocytosis (white blood cell count [WBC]&gt; 10,000 / mL) and elevated body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signs of gangrene&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous trauma or surgery two months before enrolling in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Previous implantation of endoprothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any autoimmune disease or systemic inflammatory condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Use of anti-inflammatory drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, immunosuppressants or&#xD;
           anticoagulants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe severe renal impairment (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absolute contraindications of NSAIDs such as: NSAID-allergic patients, patients who have&#xD;
           experienced asthma attacks following the use of acetylsalicylic acid or other&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory nonsteroidal drugs, patients with nasal polyps, patients with&#xD;
           anaphylactic or other severe NSAID allergies, severe hepatic insufficiency, heart&#xD;
           failure patients (moderate to severe), patients with ischemic heart disease or other&#xD;
           vascular diseases, presence of old or active gastric or ulcer of duodenum, history of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal haemorrhage in the past, proctitis or recent rectal bleeding, a history&#xD;
           of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approval by the Scientific Council of the University Hospital of Larissa and written&#xD;
      consent of all patients after being informed pre-operatively about the way and the purpose of&#xD;
      the clinical study, the patients will be randomly selected to receive either Naproxen (NPR )&#xD;
      500 mg x 2 or placebo, starting the previous day before the procedure and for 3 days&#xD;
      postoperatively. The NPR has a half-life of 12-17 hours and reaches a maximum concentration&#xD;
      at 1 to 4 hours after administration. All regimens will be given during patient&#xD;
      hospitalization. A computer algorithm will be used in the randomization. The NPR was selected&#xD;
      due to the expected significant anti-inflammatory activity and favorable cardiovascular&#xD;
      safety profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be treated by the same surgical and anesthesiology team . Every effort will&#xD;
      be made to follow the selection criteria recommended by the manufacturer of the stent graft,&#xD;
      however, the surgeon' s decision as to which device to use will be based on the anatomical&#xD;
      characteristics of the proximal neck, the iliac artery configuration, and the presence of&#xD;
      thrombus or calcifications. Systemic heparinization will be achieved with 5,000 IU of&#xD;
      heparin. Every effort will be made to deploy the endovascular device just below the level of&#xD;
      the lowest renal artery. All the devices will be bifurcated systems. All patients will&#xD;
      receive antibiotic prophylaxis (Daptomycin 500mg and Piperacillin/Tazobactam 2/0.25 gr) half&#xD;
      an hour pre-operatively and for the day of operation, as well as 3500 IU of low molecular&#xD;
      weight heparin (tinzaparin) from the first postoperative day until discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all patients, demographics, intra-operative and post-operative complications, the&#xD;
      incidence of PIS, the diameter of the aneurysm, the type of the graft deployed, the operation&#xD;
      time, the amount of contrast media administered and length of postoperative stay, will be&#xD;
      recorded. Temperature will be recorded eight times daily for the duration of hospitalization.&#xD;
      Blood tests including troponin levels will be measured on the first and second post-operative&#xD;
      day and the day before discharge. Post-operative pain will be controlled with intravenous&#xD;
      tramadol, while in cases of fever &gt; 38.5oC lasting more than 2 hours intravenous paracetamol&#xD;
      ( 1 g ) will be administered. All patients presenting with fever during the post-operative&#xD;
      period, whether or not fulfilling the PIS criteria, will undergo a thorough work up for&#xD;
      possible infection. If any of these tests reveal evidence of an early pulmonary, urinary&#xD;
      tract or any other kind of infection, the patient will not be considered to suffer from PIS.&#xD;
      Patients will be discharged in the absence of any complications, with a body temperature &lt;&#xD;
      38oC for at least 24 hours and a WBC &lt; 12.000/mL. Outpatient follow-up will be performed at&#xD;
      1, and 12 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will include any major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ), acute renal&#xD;
      failure, readmission, and death by any cause. MACE is defined as a composite of death from&#xD;
      cardiac causes, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction ( ST and non-ST ), ischemic stroke, or&#xD;
      transient ischemic attack. Death is considered due to cardiac causes if the patient died of&#xD;
      MI, cardiac arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure caused primarily by a cardiac condition.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of MI requires elevated troponin concentration with at least one of two 12-lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram changes, including development of new Q waves or new persistent ST-T&#xD;
      segment or T wave changes.13 Unstable angina is defined as severe chest pain lasting for at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes, unresponsive to standard therapeutic intervention, and associated with&#xD;
      transient ST segment deviation of 0.05 mV, new or T wave inversion of 0.3 mV, without&#xD;
      development of Q waves, or creatinine kinase-MB elevation. Stroke is defined according to the&#xD;
      current World Health Organization definition as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal&#xD;
      (or global) disturbance of cerebral function, lasting &gt;24 hours or leading to death, with no&#xD;
      apparent cause other than that of a vascular origin. Transient ischemic attack includes brief&#xD;
      episodes of neurologic dysfunction resulting from focal cerebral ischemia, not associated&#xD;
      with a permanent cerebral infarction, lasting &lt; 24 hours. Acute kidney failure is defined as&#xD;
      impaired renal function according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical&#xD;
      practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin 100 mg once daily) for at least 3 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the procedure. Preoperative medications will be continued immediately after surgery.&#xD;
      Patients who will become enrolled and will be already receiving a statin will continue their&#xD;
      medication. For patients not already on statin, atorvastatin ( 20 mg once daily ) will be&#xD;
      initiated at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood will be collected without a tourniquet preoperatively, at days 1 and 2&#xD;
      postoperatively. Besides the traditional inflammatory markers (WBC, hs-CRP, and fibrinogen )&#xD;
      interleukin 6 (IL-6) will be evaluated as it was the only marker significantly altered in PIS&#xD;
      patients in a previous study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Power analysis: Assuming the frequency of PIS after elective EVAR with a&#xD;
      polyester endograft is 50%, the study will required 186 patients in both groups to have the&#xD;
      80 % power to detect a decrease in frequency to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) as appropriate, except for&#xD;
      non-Gaussian parameters, which are presented as median (range). Comparisons of continuous&#xD;
      variables will be performed by Student t test for normally distributed variables and Mann-&#xD;
      Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables, while the chi-square test was used for&#xD;
      categorical variables. To assess the effect of the independent variables observed within the&#xD;
      study context, each one will be initially examined separately and the significant predictors&#xD;
      at level p1=.25 will be identified. These will be used in a binary logistic regression model.&#xD;
      The formerly non-significant factors will then be considered again at level p2=.10.&#xD;
      Interactions between the main effects of the final model will then be examined. The enter&#xD;
      method with significance level p3=.05 will be used to obtain p values and odds ratios for the&#xD;
      main effects and interactions. All analyses will be carried out with SPSS 20.0 statistical&#xD;
      package for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York).&#xD;
