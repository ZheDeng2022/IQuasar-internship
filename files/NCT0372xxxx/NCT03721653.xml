  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the addition of atezolizumab to&#xD;
      FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab as first line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer in terms of Progression Free Survival.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II randomized in a 1:2 ratio trial in&#xD;
      which patients initially unresectable and previously untreated mCRC will receive induction&#xD;
      treatment with FOLFOXIRI plus bev up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus&#xD;
      bev until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal (arm A) versus&#xD;
      FOLFOXIRI plus bev plus atezolizumab up to 8 cycles followed by maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus&#xD;
      bev plus atezolizumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal&#xD;
      (arm B). If disease progression does not occur during induction, at the treating physician's&#xD;
      discretion, the reintroduction after progression of the same induction treatment (up to 8&#xD;
      cycles) according to randomization arm, followed by maintenance until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal, is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at investigators' choice.&#xD;
