  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study which will recruit participants when they attend for a routine cervical&#xD;
      screening. The study will evaluate the use of CINtec PLUS for triage of human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) positive participants in HPV primary screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit participants (9800) prospectively by verbal invitation from the sample&#xD;
      taker when they attend for their cervical screening test. Recruitment will take up to one&#xD;
      year to complete. Participants in the study will undergo primary HPV testing. This will be&#xD;
      followed by cervical cytology testing as per the normal National Health Service Cervical&#xD;
      Screening Programme (NHSCSP) screening invitation pathway. Participants testing HPV negative&#xD;
      will have reached their end point and will exit the study. Participants who test HPV positive&#xD;
      will be triaged by cytology (the cytology screening result, available through the NHSCSP&#xD;
      screen will be used). Participants with moderate or severe dyskaryosis (high-grade disease)&#xD;
      will be immediately referred to colposcopy (as per NHSCSP guidelines) without further&#xD;
      testing. Participants with borderline or mild dyskaryosis (low-grade findings) will undergo&#xD;
      CINtec PLUS Cytology triage simulation; however, regardless of the CINtec PLUS result, all&#xD;
      participants will also be referred to colposcopy as per NHSCSP guidelines. Participants with&#xD;
      negative cytology will undergo CINtec PLUS Cytology triage and those testing positive (an&#xD;
      indication of increased risk of CIN2+ [high-grade disease]) will be referred to colposcopy.&#xD;
      Participants with negative cytology who also test CINtec PLUS negative will only be referred&#xD;
      to colposcopy if they have tested positive for HPV16 or HPV18 as these 2 genotypes have been&#xD;
      shown to confer an elevated risk for CIN2+ compared with the other HPV types. Participants&#xD;
      with negative cytology who also test CINtec PLUS negative and have tested positive for non&#xD;
      HPV16 and HPV18 types will undergo repeat HPV testing at 12 months as the low risk of CIN2+&#xD;
      associated with these participants does not justify immediate colposcopy referral and is&#xD;
      unlikely to be granted ethical approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes based on colposcopy and/or histology and/or cervical cytology will be&#xD;
      recorded. All biopsies will have one slide stained with CINtec Histology (p16). The risk of&#xD;
      CIN2+ will be evaluated for all participants in the study. Subsequently, clinical performance&#xD;
      of CINtec PLUS Cytology will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will also include a cost analysis.&#xD;
