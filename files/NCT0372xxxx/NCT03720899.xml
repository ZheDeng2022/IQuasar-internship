  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. with approximately 18% of&#xD;
      the population continuing to smoke. However, smoking is concentrated in disadvantaged&#xD;
      populations where the prevalence of smoking may be as high as 70-80 %. Participants will&#xD;
      receive a sampling experience (use of nicotine lozenges or NicoBloc during sessions) with&#xD;
      counseling focused around their experience of using these interventions, including side&#xD;
      effects and smoking cessation expectancies.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>NicoBloc</intervention_name>
    <description>For Session 1, participants will use one drop of NicoBloc (which will block 33% of tar and nicotine) on their conventional cigarette and then will smoke this cigarette in session. Following smoking, they will discuss the effects of the NicoBloc on their withdrawal, cravings, and overall enjoyment of their cigarette. To bolster their in vivo NicoBloc experience, participants will be provided with NicoBloc to use between sessions to acclimate to the NicoBloc and to make practice quit attempts (PQAs). Sessions 2 and 3 are similar to Session 1 except they will use more NicoBloc product during the session and will be instructed to use the product between sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants who receive nicotine lozenge (mini lozenge) will be given either a 2 or 4 mg lozenge to use in session, depending on how soon they smoke after waking. If a participant smokes within 30 minutes of waking, they start with the 4 mg lozenge; more than 30 minutes, they start with the 2 mg lozenge. They will be given lozenges between sessions to make PQAs.</description>
