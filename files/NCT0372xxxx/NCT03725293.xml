  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are central catheters that are placed via&#xD;
      peripheral vein under ultrasound guidance and may be used for patients with difficult venous&#xD;
      access for long-term central or peripheral infusion therapies as well as central venous&#xD;
      pressure monitoring in a critical care setting. Although PICCs provide a great option for&#xD;
      some patients, these catheters have known complications including catheter-related&#xD;
      bloodstream infection, catheter-related venous thrombosis or clotting, malfunction, and high&#xD;
      cost. Midline catheters represent a potentially attractive alternative to PICCs for&#xD;
      peripheral infusions. As midlines have increased in popularity and new midlines have been&#xD;
      introduced into the market, it is necessary to better understand complication profiles of&#xD;
      various midline catheters, as it is likely that all catheters are not created equal.&#xD;
      Specifically, the incidence of symptomatic catheter-related thrombosis is of interest. Some&#xD;
      midline catheters are coated to provide protection against catheter-related venous thrombosis&#xD;
      and/or catheter-related bloodstream infection. The theoretical benefit(s) of these catheters&#xD;
      need further validation in human subjects.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective single-site, parallel, two-arm, randomized&#xD;
      investigation to assess catheter-related symptomatic upper extremity venous thrombosis&#xD;
      (CR-UEVT), catheter-related bloodstream infection, and functionality of two single lumen&#xD;
      midline catheters: AngioDynamics BioFlo 4 F and Teleflex Arrowg+ard Blue Advance 4.5 F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff of Beaumont Health Institute will allocate two midline catheters to eligible&#xD;
      participants according to a pre-generated randomized list at a 1:1 ratio in block&#xD;
      randomization to AngioDynamics BioFlo or Tele-flex Arrowg+ard Blue Advanced midline&#xD;
      catheters. Participant enrollment will take place from November 2018 until recruitment of 250&#xD;
      participants, 125 in each group, is complete. Demographic and health-related information will&#xD;
      be obtained from electronic medical records during enrolled period at William Beaumont&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practitioner Participation/Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advanced Practice Providers within the bedside PICC/Midline service at the Royal Oak campus&#xD;
      are eligible to place catheters for this study. All investigators are credentialed in placing&#xD;
      PICCs and midlines by institutional policy and have greater than one year of experience in&#xD;
      these procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-cannulation and post securement, functionality is confirmed with blood sampling (10 cc)&#xD;
      and flush without resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team also will document practitioner details, the vascular access device (VAD)&#xD;
      used, the time of VAD placement, number of attempts, need for a rescue inserter, the vein&#xD;
      that was cannulated, depth and diameter of the vein, and the indication for VAD placement. An&#xD;
      attempt is defined as each time the needle punctures the skin. Data will be collected from&#xD;
      the electronic medical record and includes: age, gender, body mass index (BMI), vital signs,&#xD;
      relevant past medical history. Indication for catheter placement will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will perform a follow-up assessment on all catheters within 24 hours of&#xD;
      insertion and then daily for the life of the VAD. At each follow-up interval, the researcher&#xD;
      will document the time of evaluation and assessment of functionality as well as review the&#xD;
      patient chart for signs and symptoms of catheter-related bloodstream infection. If the&#xD;
      catheter was identified to have failed during follow-up assessment the date and time of&#xD;
      failure and the reason for failure will be documented. For all failed catheters, re-insertion&#xD;
      attempt data will be tracked through the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) rates will be calculated&#xD;
      based on upper extremity proven diagnosis of SVT and/or DVT in symptomatic cases. Radiology&#xD;
      interpretations will be reviewed for findings consistent with CR-UEVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection rate will be tracked using confirmed catheter-related blood stream infection data&#xD;
      from the surveillance team within the epidemiology department. The team utilizes the CDC&#xD;
      definition of laboratory-confirmed blood-stream infection (LCBSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medication administration record will be queried for all medications given through each&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
