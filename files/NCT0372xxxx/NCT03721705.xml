    <textblock>
      A Randomized Pivotal Study of RenewTM NCP-5 for the Treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment&#xD;
      due to Alzheimer's Disease or Mild Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type is a pivotal, single&#xD;
      blind, parallel design, multi-site study intends to examine the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      RenewTM NCP-5 therapy in the treatment of Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's Disease or&#xD;
      Mild Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type. Subjects will be prospectively randomized to treatment&#xD;
      or sham (in a 1:1 ratio) using stratification for Cognitive Impairment due to Alzheimer's&#xD;
      Disease or Mild Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type, and CVR score at multiple sites. Subjects,&#xD;
      ages 55-85, will be consented for 13 months and will receive thirty-five 60-minute RenewTM&#xD;
      NCP-5 treatment sessions during a 7-to-12-week initial treatment period, and then transition&#xD;
      to a lower frequency maintenance period (twice a week) for a total treatment period of 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <description>The first four sessions will be the escalation phase using the Renew NCP-5. There will be a 5-minute ramp up period where the pressure is increased 1 psi/min until the desired pressure is reached. The goal for the treatment group will be at least 2.5 psi for the first treatment, and then escalate the pressure gradually through the fourth session with an average goal of 3 psi/session. After the fourth session, the pressure will be slowly increased to reach the maximum level the subject can tolerate with a goal of reaching 3-6 psi.</description>
