      To characterize the impact of orthostatic hypotension (OH) and reflex syncope on signals&#xD;
      measured using a wearable cardiac monitor prototype device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the relationship of signals measured from the wearable cardiac monitor prototype&#xD;
      device with reported symptom severity of orthostatic intolerance per standard data&#xD;
      collection, analysis, and questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized feasibility study that will enroll up to 50 participants that have&#xD;
      undergone a previous autonomic reflect screen (ARS) assessment and were either diagnosed with&#xD;
      OH or reflex syncope, or considered to be control subjects for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 20 subjects diagnosed with reflex syncope, a maximum of 10 subjects diagnosed&#xD;
      with OH and a maximum of 10 control subjects will be enrolled. There will be one study visit&#xD;
      per subject.&#xD;
