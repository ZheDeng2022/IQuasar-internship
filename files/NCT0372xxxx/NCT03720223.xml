    <textblock>
      This is a single blinded-randomized controlled trial that recruit male patients for&#xD;
      substitution urethroplasty using buccal mucosal graft. The study investigators aim to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of liposomal bupivacaine injection to the buccal graft harvest site&#xD;
      on post-operative main score, morphine equivalence requirement and oral morbidities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain following urethroplasty with buccal mucosal graft (BMG) harvesting is primarily related&#xD;
      to the oral graft harvest site. This pain results in significant increases in narcotic use,&#xD;
      patient morbidity, and limits nutritional intake following surgery. During BMG harvesting,&#xD;
      lidocaine with epinephrine is routinely injected for hydrodissection and to assist with&#xD;
      hemostasis. The analgesic benefits from this local anesthetic, however, have abated prior to&#xD;
      completion of the urethral reconstruction and contribute little to post-operative pain&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to alleviate pain following BMG harvesting, several centers have evaluated&#xD;
      technical aspects of the procedure to reduce post-operative pain. These have primarily&#xD;
      focused on location of the graft harvest and wound closure. A novel liposomal formulation of&#xD;
      bupivacaine has recently been introduced as a 96-hour delayed release formulation. It has&#xD;
      been safely used in multiple surgical wounds and results in significantly reduced&#xD;
      post-operative pain and narcotic usage. Given that patient reported pain from the BMG harvest&#xD;
      site is worst in the first 1-2 days following surgery, infiltration of this medication has&#xD;
      the potential to dramatically reduce post-operative pain in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our objective is to evaluate post-operative pain and narcotic usage following BMG harvesting&#xD;
      with liposomal bupivacaine infiltration. Our hypothesis is that infiltrating the buccal graft&#xD;
      harvest surgical site with liposomal bupivacaine will decrease both post-operative pain and&#xD;
      narcotic usage and increase patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a prospective, randomized, single blind controlled trial. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited from the offices of Urology of Virginia, Devine-Jordan Center for reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery and pelvic health. Eligible patients will include all males 18 years of age or older&#xD;
      identified as requiring a urethroplasty with BMG harvesting. On the initial visit, eligible&#xD;
      patients will complete a research consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive either standard of care BMG harvesting or standard of&#xD;
      care plus buccal infusion of liposomal bupivacaine. Randomization will be determined with a&#xD;
      random number generator in the Urology of Virginia research office prior to surgery. Patient&#xD;
      randomization will be revealed to the operative surgeon on the day of surgery following&#xD;
      induction of general anesthesia. The remainder of the procedure will be performed as per&#xD;
      routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operatively, a member of the research team who was not a member of the operative team&#xD;
      will monitor the patient's pain and narcotic usage. Pain will be assessed using a validated&#xD;
      10-point pain scale as well as a non-validated BMG harvest site morbidity questionnaire, an&#xD;
      evaluation technique that has been used previously. Inpatient narcotic usage will be&#xD;
      calculated post-op through cumulative morphine equivalents on a 24-hour basis on the day of&#xD;
      surgery as well as post-op days one, two and three. All patients are routinely discharged&#xD;
      home on post-op day two or three. The pain and morbidity questionnaire will be administered&#xD;
      in the pre-operative holding area, then daily for the first seven days followed by monthly&#xD;
      through 6 months of follow up. Studies have shown a return to baseline pain within six months&#xD;
      following BMG harvesting and assessments beyond that time are unnecessary. Responses to&#xD;
      questionnaires will be obtained either by a member of the Urology of Virginia research staff&#xD;
      through either a phone call or email message to the patients at each time point. Preferred&#xD;
      method of contact, including a preferred phone number and email address will be obtained&#xD;
      during the initial visit when study consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be reduction in post-op pain on the 10-point numerical rating&#xD;
      scale, post-operative narcotic requirements and oral morbidities. Secondary endpoints will be&#xD;
      return of eating a regular diet, perioral numbness, salivary changes and the ability to open&#xD;
      the mouth completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis shows that 40 patients would be required to attain 80% power to detect a &gt; 1&#xD;
      point change in the numeric pain scale at a 2-sided level of 5%. Accounting for 10-20%&#xD;
      dropout rate, the study investigators plan to recruit 50 patients for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Urology of Virginia research department will maintain all study data. Patients will be&#xD;
      identified by medical record number for the purpose of data collection. However, in the&#xD;
      database, patient information will be associated only with a non-identifying subject&#xD;
      identification number that will be assigned at study entry. A file linking patient medical&#xD;
      record numbers with subject identification numbers will be maintained separately from the&#xD;
      database. All files will be kept on an encrypted, password-protected external data drive for&#xD;
      additional security. All files will be destroyed no later than three years following the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring for this study will be done at each subject encounter and maintained within&#xD;
      the Urology of Virginia research office. Adverse effects will be queried during each&#xD;
      interaction with the patient and is also included in the questionnaire to be filled out&#xD;
      throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rudimentary statistical analysis will be carried out using excel spreadsheets, which will&#xD;
      include mean/median values, percentages and data trends. Additionally, multivariate&#xD;
      regressions models will be created using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk to Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal bupivacaine has been used for several years in a variety of surgical settings&#xD;
      without significant adverse events compared to traditional bupivacaine. However, its specific&#xD;
      use in buccal infiltration for BMG harvesting has not previously been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liposomal bupivacaine has been studies in several clinical trials. The reported adverse&#xD;
      reactions related to its use include, but are not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;

           depression, respiratory failure, body temperature increased, blood pressure increased,&#xD;
           blood pressure decreased, oxygen saturation decreased, urinary retention, urinary&#xD;
           incontinence, vision blurred, tinnitus, drug hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specific neurological and cardiac adverse reactions o Dizziness (6.2%), headache (3.8%),&#xD;
           somnolence (2.1%), hypoesthesia (1.5%), and lethargy (1.3%), tachycardia (3.9%) and&#xD;

&#xD;
      This study does involve data collection from medical records and depends upon patient&#xD;
      identifiers for data collection. HIPAA compliance in clinical data handling will ensure&#xD;
      protection of patient's right to privacy. Information in the database will be&#xD;
      non-identifiable. All collected data will be stored on an encrypted, password-protected&#xD;
      external data drive. No personal health information data will be released. Only investigators&#xD;
      listed within this Institutional review board proposal will have access to the data&#xD;
      collected. Despite these safeguards, there is always risk for incidental release of patient&#xD;
      personal health information. As outlined above, every effort will be made to limit these&#xD;
      risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disposition of Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will be communicated in presentations at society meetings (such as&#xD;
      the American Urologic Association national meeting). Final disposition of this study will be&#xD;
      submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. All information is&#xD;
      unidentified.&#xD;
