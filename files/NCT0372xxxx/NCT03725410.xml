  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study utilizing the Venus&#xD;
      Fiore™ (MP)2, a table-top device designed to deliver multi-polar RF energy and pulsed&#xD;
      electromagnetic fields for use in dermatological and general surgical procedures to&#xD;
      temporarily improve blood circulation and to induce modification of collagen structure,&#xD;
      neocollagenesis and angiogenesis for the treatment of symptoms associated with vulvovaginal&#xD;
      atrophy.&#xD;

      Multicenter, single-blind, randomized, sham-controlled study of multi-polar radio-frequency&#xD;
      (RF) and pulsed electro-magnetic field (PEMF) technologies for the treatment of symptoms&#xD;
      associated with vulvovaginal atrophy. The study will enroll up to 106 subjects requesting&#xD;
      treatment of symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy (vaginal dryness, decreased lubrication during&#xD;
      sexual activity, decreased elasticity, irritation, discomfort during intercourse and&#xD;
      discomfort of the vaginal and vulvar tissues in general) in order to have 88 subjects&#xD;
      complete the study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either multi-polar RF and&#xD;
      PEMF technologies or sham treatment and will receive a total of three internal and external&#xD;
      treatments with the Venus Fiore™ (MP)2 device at four-week intervals. Study treatment will be&#xD;
      administered as per the parameter recommendations as set out in the Venus Fiore™ (MP)2 user&#xD;
      manual. Subjects will be followed up at three and six months after their initial treatment.&#xD;
      Analysis will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one treatment. Three- and&#xD;
      six-month outcomes from the active arm will be compared to data from the sham arm.&#xD;
