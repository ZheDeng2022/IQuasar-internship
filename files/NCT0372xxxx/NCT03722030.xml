  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2-arm pilot trial will enroll 40 participants to test the feasibility, adherence, and&#xD;
      benefits of a home-based strength training intervention for endometrial cancer survivors&#xD;
      relative to a wait-listed control group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer survivors have an extremely high prevalence of inactivity and obesity.&#xD;
      Inactivity and obesity are associated with poorer outcomes among survivors. Other&#xD;
      interventions have demonstrated that walking and aerobic exercise are safe and feasible in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer patients. However few published studies have examined strength training in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer survivors, and these have done so only in combination with aerobic&#xD;
      intervention (and often also dietary change) in the context of a larger multi-component&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a critical need for data about the feasibility and benefits of strength training in&#xD;
      this population. The investigators propose a 2-arm pilot trial of a home-based strength&#xD;
      training intervention (vs. waitlist control) among 40 endometrial cancer survivors. The&#xD;
      intervention will consist of (a) an initial in-person instructional session; (b)&#xD;
      instructional materials and resistance training equipment (e.g., resistance bands) and (c)&#xD;
      support and feedback provided via video coaching sessions. The purpose of a pilot trial is&#xD;
      not to conduct hypothesis testing, but rather to field-test the logistical components of the&#xD;
      study to incorporate into a larger, future study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial will determine the feasibility of an at-home resistance training protocol&#xD;
      and measurements of exercise logging, functional fitness testing, DXA, dried blood spots and&#xD;
      questionnaire measures. Participants will be assigned either to the resistance training&#xD;
      program (i.e., initial in-person instructional session, telephone coaching, and&#xD;
      self-monitoring) or to a comparison arm (wait-list control).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining endometrial cancer&#xD;
           survivors to a home- based resistance training 2 sessions per week of 20-40 minutes of&#xD;
           exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 2: To determine participant satisfaction with each component of the intervention and&#xD;
           identify opportunities for refinement of the intervention prior to testing in a larger&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 3: To establish that functional and objective assessments are feasible and&#xD;
           well-tolerated in enrolled participants, as assessed using the functional fitness test&#xD;
           (FFT) battery, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), finger-pricks for dried blood&#xD;
           spots and patient-reported outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline and Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in mental well-being from baseline, mid-point, and post-study (including anxiety, depression, and fatigue) will be assessed using standardized NIH-provided Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.&#xD;
The fatigue assessment asks about self-reported systems of fatigue and tiredness, all the way up to exhaustion overall, and ask about fatigue over the past seven days. The depression assessment asks about depressive symptoms over the past seven days. The anxiety assessment asks about symptoms adjacent-to and including anxiety over the past seven days. For each of these three instruments (which comprise the mental well-being assessments) the data will be reported as change over time, specifically using the T-score (standardized mean) and the standard error.&#xD;
Each is standardized to a mean of 50 and a range of 0-100; a higher scores indicate a higher &quot;level&quot; of that construct, whether it's higher levels of depression, fatigue or anxiety.</description>

The FACT assessment measures physical, social/family, and functional well-being, each on a scale of 0-28, and emotional well being on a scale of 0-24. The Endometrial component contains concerns specific to endometrial cancer such as hot/flashes, cramps, and swelling; measured on a scale of 0-64. Each of these sections will be scored for sub-scale scores and then the entire instrument will have a total composite score (0-172; the higher the score, the more quality of life improvements) and will be reported as such.</description>

        <description>Changes in mental well-being from baseline, mid-point, and post-study (including anxiety, depression, and fatigue) will be assessed using standardized NIH-provided Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures.&#xD;
The fatigue assessment asks about self-reported systems of fatigue and tiredness, all the way up to exhaustion overall, and ask about fatigue over the past seven days. The depression assessment asks about depressive symptoms over the past seven days. The anxiety assessment asks about symptoms adjacent-to and including anxiety over the past seven days. For each of these three instruments (which comprise the mental well-being assessments) the data will be reported as change over time, specifically using the T-score (standardized mean) and the standard error.&#xD;
Each is standardized to a mean of 50 and a range of 0-100; a higher scores indicate a higher &quot;level&quot; of that construct, whether it's higher levels of depression, fatigue or anxiety.</description>

        <description>Self-efficacy will be assessed at baseline, mid-point, and post-study using the validated self-efficacy for exercise scale, modified for specificity to strength training.&#xD;
This instrument has 9 items, each of which is scored from 0-10, with a maximum score of 90. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy for exercise. These scores will be reported descriptively at each time point (baseline, mid-point, final), and will also be reported in a table as change over time.</description>

        <title>Changes in Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity From Baseline</title>
        <description>Although aerobic and lifestyle physical activity (PA) are not a focus of the intervention, they will be assessed to determine baseline PA level and identify whether uptake of resistance training is associated with changes in other PA types. Participants will wear the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) for 7 days during all waking hours, at baseline, mid-point, and post-study visit. The ActiGraph is a gold standard method of objective activity assessment. Accelerometer data will be measured in total minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity over a 7-day period.&#xD;
