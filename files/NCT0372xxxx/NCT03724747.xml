  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study medication (BAY 2315497 Injection) is a thorium-227 labeled immuno-conjugate,&#xD;
      specific for the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which will be evaluated in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. In this study, this&#xD;
      investigational medication will be administered to patients for the first time. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to define the safety and tolerability profile and Maximal Tolerated&#xD;
      Dose (MTD) of BAY2315497 Injection alone, or in combination with darolutamide. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the recommended dose for further clinical development of&#xD;
      BAY2315497 Injection alone, or in combination with darolutamide and to investigate how the&#xD;
      study drug is distributed and cleared from the body.&#xD;
