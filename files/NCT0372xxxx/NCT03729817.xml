  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent prospective observational data has established that hemodynamic compromise identifies&#xD;
      a high risk subgroup of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease. The&#xD;
      currently proposed study aims to determine if an endovascular intervention, submaximal&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty, can be performed with adequate safety in this high risk subgroup of&#xD;
      hemodynamically-compromised patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. The study&#xD;
      will also examine as secondary aims, the effect of the intervention on hemodynamics and on&#xD;
      subsequent in-territory ischemic events.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      VERiTAS II REFRESHED is a prospective two-arm randomized multi-center pilot study to assess&#xD;
      the safety of submaximal balloon angioplasty in conjunction with intensive medical therapy in&#xD;
      patients with hemodynamically-compromised symptomatic 70-99% atherosclerotic intracranial&#xD;
      stenosis (ICAS). This study builds on lines of evidence from prior prospective studies that&#xD;
      established the markedly elevated risk of subsequent stroke in ICAS patients with hemodynamic&#xD;
      compromise, and preliminary data from small case series that support submaximal angioplasty&#xD;
      as a potentially safe option for revascularization. The primary objective of the current&#xD;
      study is to determine the safety of submaximal balloon angioplasty for treatment of&#xD;
      hemodynamically-compromised symptomatic ICAS. The secondary objectives are to obtain&#xD;
      preliminary estimates for the risk of subsequent in-territory stroke at one year in patients&#xD;
      treated with submaximal angioplasty in conjunction with intensive medical therapy and in&#xD;
      patients treated with intensive medical therapy alone, to evaluate the hemodynamic effect of&#xD;
      submaximal balloon angioplasty on distal blood flow, and to examine the hemodynamic&#xD;
      durability of submaximal balloon angioplasty over follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 196 patients will be enrolled in this open-label study and randomized 2:1 to&#xD;
      receive the submaximal angioplasty intervention in conjunction with intensive medical therapy&#xD;
      or intensive medical therapy alone. Patients with stroke attributable to ICAS serve as the&#xD;
      source population for the study, and will be identified as inpatients or outpatients at&#xD;
      participating centers or their referring sites. Patients with recently (within 30 days prior&#xD;
      to enrollment) symptomatic 70-99% ICAS of the intracranial internal carotid (ICA), middle&#xD;
      cerebral (MCA), vertebral (VA) or basilar (BA) artery will first be identified by a standard&#xD;
      of care screening imaging modality (e.g. CTA, MRA, TCD). If the patient is eligible based on&#xD;
      available inclusion/exclusion criteria, informed consent will be obtained and MRI/&#xD;
      quantitative magnetic resonance angiography (QMRA) will be performed (if not already as&#xD;
      standard care); patients demonstrating evidence of hemodynamic compromise based on borderzone&#xD;
      infarct pattern for the anterior circulation (ICA and MCA) and by low flow state on QMRA for&#xD;
      the posterior circulation (VA and BA) will be considered eligible. QMRA will be used for&#xD;
      determination of eligibility in posterior circulation ICAS patients, but will be performed in&#xD;
      both anterior and posterior circulation patients as a baseline for hemodynamic comparison&#xD;
      post-procedure. The patient will then undergo CTA (if not performed already as standard care)&#xD;
      to confirm eligible intracranial ICAS, and will be randomized 2:1 to undergo either&#xD;
      submaximal angioplasty plus intensive medical therapy or intensive medical therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized to submaximal angioplasty will undergo the procedure in accordance with the&#xD;
      study protocol within 48 hours of randomization, followed by SAMMPRIS regimen intensive&#xD;
      medical therapy, including initial dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel for 3&#xD;
      months followed by aspirin monotherapy), and targeting primary and secondary stroke risk&#xD;
      factors. Those randomized to intensive medical therapy alone will receive the same SAMMPRIS&#xD;
      regimen intensive medical therapy. Assistance in achieving the risk factor goals will be&#xD;
      provided by an INTERVENT lifestyle coach, who will call the participant by phone at 1, 3, 5,&#xD;
      7, 9, 11 weeks, and then every 4 weeks throughout follow-up. On a scheduled basis, INTERVENT&#xD;
      will send a report of the participant's progress and goals for risk factor modification to&#xD;
      the participant and study coordinator/ study neurologist. Participants will have follow-up&#xD;
      for a total of one year. All participants will have clinical visits at 1, 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
      months, performed by local study personnel not directly involved with the angioplasty&#xD;
      procedure. The study visits will include assessment of neurological, functional and cognitive&#xD;
      status, as well as status of primary and secondary stroke risk factor control. For those&#xD;
      randomized to submaximal angioplasty, QMRA will be performed post procedure and at 12 months;&#xD;
      the follow-up QMRA results will be blinded to the local study personnel and patients. The&#xD;
      main outcomes of interest are: (1) any periprocedural (within 30 day) stroke or death; (2)&#xD;
      stroke in the symptomatic vessel territory; and (3) distal flow status post procedure and at&#xD;
      follow-up (using QMRA). Additional measured endpoints will include cerebral infarct on&#xD;
      imaging associated with temporary signs, restenosis and functional and cognitive outcomes at&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculations have been based on a confidence interval (CI) approach aimed at&#xD;
      determining if the intervention can be performed with a clinically specified periprocedural&#xD;
      event rate of 5% (90% CI 2,10%), in order to establish sufficient periprocedural safety of&#xD;
      submaximal angioplasty to warrant further investigation in a future phase 2/3 randomized&#xD;
      trial. The sample size calculation assumes a CI approach around the stroke/death event rate&#xD;
      at 30 days; for the presumed event rate of 5%, a sample size of N=117 would yield a 90% CI of&#xD;
      (2%,10%). Adjusting for the inflation factor 1.02 due to a planned interim analysis and a 4%&#xD;
      attrition rate for the 30-day follow-up, 124 patients are required to undergo submaximal&#xD;
      angioplasty for analysis of the primary safety endpoint. With an anticipated 5% ineligibility&#xD;
      for submaximal angioplasty at time of catheter angiography performed for the procedure, a&#xD;
      total of 131 patients will be randomized to submaximal angioplasty to obtain the safety&#xD;
      dataset of 124 patients. An interim analysis of safety is planned with a stopping rule if&#xD;
      30-day periprocedural risk exceeds 5% (i.e. lower bound of CI of observed estimate exceeds&#xD;
      the threshold). To ensure that the intervention is stopped early if it is harmful, the timing&#xD;
      of the interim analysis will be flexible, to occur once 30 day follow-up has been completed&#xD;
      on one third of submaximal angioplasty patients (41 patients) or alternatively, when 12&#xD;
      events are observed, whichever comes first; the number of events, 12, has been specified as&#xD;
      the minimal event number which would result in the lower bound of the 90% CI exceeding 5% and&#xD;
      thus claim a &gt;5% event rate. As related to the study's go/no go criteria for a future trial,&#xD;
      our definitive no go parameter is proposed as the lower bound of the observed pre-specified&#xD;
      CI exceeding the safety (30-day periprocedural risk) threshold of 5%. Other outcomes from the&#xD;
      study (i.e. the secondary clinical and hemodynamic endpoints at 12 months) would also be&#xD;
      taken into account in determining whether the procedure warrants additional study in a future&#xD;
      seamless phase 2/3 trial.&#xD;
