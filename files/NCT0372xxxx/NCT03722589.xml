      This randomized, open-label trial will assess humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to&#xD;
      cell culture-based and recombinant unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccines compared to&#xD;
      conventional egg-based unadjuvanted quadrivalent standard dose (15µg of HA per strain)&#xD;
      influenza vaccines among persons aged 18-64 years. The trial will be conducted at two sites&#xD;
      in the United States during two influenza seasons (2018-19 and 2019-20). Stratified&#xD;
      enrollment procedures will be used to enroll a mix of participants based on age.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In year 1 of the trial (the 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere influenza season), eligible&#xD;
      participants at each site will be randomized 2:2:1:1 to receive a single dose of cell&#xD;
      culture-based vaccine (Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent by Seqirus, Inc., 15µg of HA per strain)&#xD;
      versus recombinant vaccine (Flublok® Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur, 45µg of HA per strain)&#xD;
      versus one of two standard dose egg-based vaccines (Fluzone® Quadrivalent by Sanofi Pasteur,&#xD;
      15µg of HA per strain and Fluarix® Quadrivalent by GlaxoSmithKlein, 15µg of HA per strain)&#xD;
      during August-September of 2018. All study vaccines are licensed for use in adults aged &gt;18&#xD;
      years in the United States. Participants will have blood collected just prior to vaccination&#xD;
      and at approximately 28 days and 6 months post-vaccination (or at the end of influenza virus&#xD;
      circulation as determined by available surveillance data) to evaluate humoral immune&#xD;
      responses to vaccination. Additional blood will be collected from a subset of participants&#xD;
      pre-vaccination and at approximately 7 days, 28 days and 6 months post-vaccination (or at the&#xD;
      end of influenza virus circulation) to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccination. Active surveillance with mid-turbinate nasal swab collection for influenza-like&#xD;
      illness (ILI) defined as new onset of cough or worsening of chronic cough within the&#xD;
      preceding 7 days will be conducted during the period of influenza circulation at each study&#xD;
      site. Additional blood will also be collected at 6 months post-vaccination (or at the end of&#xD;
      influenza virus circulation) from participants with reverse-transcription polymerase chain&#xD;
      reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed ILI during the influenza season to evaluate cell-mediated immune&#xD;
      responses to natural influenza virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In year 1, sites will aim to enroll 864 participants (432 per site) at the start of the&#xD;
      2018-19 season, including up to 200 participants (up to 100 per site) who will contribute&#xD;
      additional blood at all study visits to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccination. Efforts will be made to retain participants enrolled in the first year of the&#xD;
      study for both years of the study. Sites will also enroll additional participants at the&#xD;
      start of the 2019-20 season to make up for participants who withdraw or are lost to follow-up&#xD;
      prior to the start of the 2019-20 season. Both participants and study investigators will be&#xD;
      aware of study arm assignments with the exception of laboratory investigators who will be&#xD;
      blinded to study arm assignment until testing is completed, as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In year 1 , relative efficacy of single doses of study vaccines will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      immunologic responses to vaccination among participants between study arms using Fluzone®&#xD;
      Quadrivalent and Fluarix® Quadrivalent as the comparator groups for participants in the&#xD;
      Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent or Flublok® Quadrivalent arms. In addition, the effect of frequency&#xD;
      of prior vaccination during the preceding five years on immunologic responses to vaccine will&#xD;
      be evaluated in subgroup analysis. Both humoral (influenza antibody) and cell-mediated&#xD;
      (influenza- specific CD4 and CD8 T cell) immune responses will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In year 2 of the trial, (the 2019-20 Northern Hemisphere influenza season), participants from&#xD;
      the first year of the trial who received Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent or Flublok® Quadrivalent&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent or Flublok® Quadrivalent, and&#xD;
      participants who received an egg-based standard-dose vaccine in year one (Fluzone®&#xD;
      Quadrivalent or Fluarix Quadrivalent) will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive Flucelvax™&#xD;
      Quadrivalent , Flublok® Quadrivalent , or Fluzone® Quadrivalent. In addition, both sites will&#xD;
      enroll additional participants in year 2 to achieve a total of 150 participants per site&#xD;
      (including participants who continue from year one plus additional newly enrolled&#xD;
      participants) who received egg-based standard dose influenza vaccine during the 2018-2019&#xD;
      influenza season and who will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive Flucelvax™ Quadrivalent,&#xD;
      Flublok® Quadrivalent, or Fluzone® Quadrivalent in year two. The Kaiser Permanente Northwest&#xD;
      site site will also enroll up to 80 new participants for a non-randomized study arm that will&#xD;
      receive Fluzone® High-Dose. All study vaccines except Fluzone High-Dose are licensed for use&#xD;
      in adults aged &gt;=18 years in the United States. Fluzone High-Dose is licensed for use in&#xD;
      adults aged &gt;=64 years in the United States and will be used off-label in this trial.&#xD;
      Participants will have blood collected just prior to vaccination and at approximately 28 days&#xD;
      post-vaccination (or at the end of influenza virus circulation as determined by available&#xD;
      surveillance data) to evaluate humoral immune responses to vaccination. Additional blood will&#xD;
      be collected from a subset of participants pre-vaccination and at approximately 7 and 28 days&#xD;
      post-vaccination to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In year 2, sites will aim to retain from year 1 or newly enroll 750 participants.&#xD;
