    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients suffer from gait impairments responsible for falls and bad&#xD;
      quality of life: reduced speed and stride length, randomness in stride duration variability&#xD;
      (reduced Long-Range Autocorrelations (LRA)). On the other hand, treadmill walking has shown&#xD;
      long-term effectiveness on PD patients' gait and quality of life. The purpose of this single&#xD;
      blinded randomized controlled trial is to study the effect of a combination of immersive&#xD;
      virtual reality and treadmill walking on LRA.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common degenerative neurological disease. PD&#xD;
      induces gait disorders that lead to increased risk of falls. These falls seriously affect&#xD;
      patients' quality of life and generate significant health care costs. Unfortunately, gait&#xD;
      disorders do not respond well to drug treatments and their management is mainly based on&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment. The rehabilitation approach comprises two steps: a functional&#xD;
      assessment of locomotor capacities followed by completion of a therapeutic physical exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like heart rate, stride duration varies in the short and long term according to a complex&#xD;
      dynamic of temporal variations. These variations present long-range autocorrelations (LRA):&#xD;
      the stride duration does not vary randomly but in a structured way. The study of LRA is based&#xD;
      on complex mathematical methods requiring recording of 512 consecutive gait cycles. LRA are&#xD;
      altered in PD patients whose gait rhythm is excessively random. Alteration of LRA is&#xD;
      correlated with neurological impairments (Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale and UPDRS) and patients'&#xD;
      locomotor stability (ABC scale &amp; BESTest). Measurement of LRA would be the first available&#xD;
      objective and quantitative biomarker of stability and risk of falling in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines concerning rehabilitation programs for PD patients are based on education&#xD;
      (prevention of falls and inactivity,...), physical exercises, functional training (double&#xD;
      task, complex tasks,...), learning, adaptation strategies (cueing) and action observation.&#xD;
      The combination between immersive virtual reality (iVR) and treadmill walking will be&#xD;
      developped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treadmill walking has shown long-term effectiveness on PD patients' gait and quality of life.&#xD;
      A study carried out recently has shown that a single treadmill session reduces the stride&#xD;
      duration variability during the intervention. There remains then to determine the long-term&#xD;
      effect of this rehabilitation method on LRA, apart from the intervention, when walking&#xD;
      overground. Combining iVR with treadmill walking rehabilitation offers interesting insights.&#xD;
      Indeed, for stroke patients, this combination is more effective than classical techniques.&#xD;
      For PD patients, non-immersive virtual reality methods (Wii, Kinect) have shown relative&#xD;
      efficacy. Indeed, the use of non-immersive virtual reality on treadmill induces more&#xD;
      efficient cognitive engagement and frontal lobe activation among PD patients. Non immersive&#xD;
      VR gives longer-term effects and a greater decrease in the number of falls than without&#xD;
      virtual reality. Furthermore, iVR makes it possible to give a functional character to&#xD;
      reeducation and to enrich feedbacks. Indeed, iVR allows to give patients a visual flow when&#xD;
      walking on treadmill as if they were walking overground and patients could benefit from it.&#xD;
      But apart from a feasibility study, the therapeutic interest of iVR has not been studied yet&#xD;
      for PD patients, especially iVR combined with treadmill walking. iVR is now easily accessible&#xD;
      and its price is reduced, suggesting a potential for everyday clinical practice. Indeed,&#xD;
      these new devices of good quality seem to have a good potential for neurorehabilitation. The&#xD;
      purpose of this single blinded randomized controlled trial is then to study the effect of a&#xD;
      comibination of immersive virtual reality and treadmill walking on LRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be unicentric. 46 PD patients will be included, 23 in the intervention group&#xD;
      and 23 in the control group. Patients will be recruited from the department of Neurology of&#xD;
      Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc (Brussels, Belgium). The study was approved by the local&#xD;
      ethics committee. All patients will give informed written consent to the study. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be described in another section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional assessments will cover the 3 domains of International Classification of&#xD;
      Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) : body functions and structures, activity and&#xD;
      participation. Assessments will be described in another section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LRA analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 512 consecutive gait cycles will be recorded when walking overground at a&#xD;
      self-selected speed on an oval track of 42 meters. The duration of each cycle will be&#xD;
      measured using an accelerometer, placed on the head of the fibula, at an acquisition&#xD;
      frequency of 512 Hz. LRA will be analyzed using the integrated method validated by our team&#xD;
      for the analysis of physiological signals. This method combines calculation of the Hurst&#xD;
      exponent (H) obtained by the Rescaled Range Analysis and the α exponent obtained by the Power&#xD;
      Spectral Density Analysis. Consistency of the values of H and α is verified through the&#xD;
      relation d = H-[(1 + α) / 2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of LRA can be shown with a high level of proof when these 3 conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H &gt; 0.5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  α is significantly different from 0 and less than 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  d ≤ 0.10 If an inconsistency appears between H and α, the Randomly Shuffled Surrogate&#xD;
           Data Test is applied in order to reject null hypothesis of an absence of temporal&#xD;
           structure in studied series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD patients will follow a total of 18 treadmill exercise sessions with 3 sessions a week&#xD;
      spread over 6 weeks. Sessions will be held at Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc. During&#xD;
      sessions, patients will walk 45 minutes at their comfortable speed on the treadmill with 1&#xD;
      pause allowed if necessary. The speed is determined according to the following technique:&#xD;
      increase of the treadmill speed in increments of 0.10 m/s, with a starting speed of 0.15 m/s,&#xD;
      until that the patient indicates that speed is too fast. Speed is then reduced by 0.10 m/s to&#xD;
      have a comfortable walking speed. Every week, this walking speed will be re-evaluated. When&#xD;
      walking on treadmill, patients will be secured with a harness (LiteGait, Mobility Research,&#xD;
      Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the intervention group will wear a virtual reality headset while walking on the&#xD;
      treadmill. Patients will walk in a straight line in a coherent, immersive and simple virtual&#xD;
      environment created from a graphics software (Unity, USA). Before the first session, a&#xD;
      15-minute session will focus on patient familiarization with iVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the control group will walk on the treadmill without iVR. Patients will also&#xD;
      receive a short familiarization to the treadmill before strating the experimentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between the effect of the different treatments proposed by the two studies on LRA&#xD;
      (primary outcome), a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (Group x Time) will be performed.&#xD;
