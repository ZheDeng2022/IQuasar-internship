  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2a open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and anti-viral efficacy of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 antibodies for HIV prevention and&#xD;
      therapy. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 are recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
      that target a V3 glycan-dependent epitope region of the HIV envelope protein and the CD4&#xD;
      binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV envelope protein. PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 mAbs were&#xD;
      chosen for this study because of their potency, their ability to neutralize a wide array of&#xD;
      cross-clade HIV viruses in a complementary pattern, and their proven antiviral activity in&#xD;
      animal studies, e.g., their capacity to robustly prevent and treat simian-human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in rhesus monkeys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potency and breadth of PGT121, VRC07-523LS and PGDM1400 raise the possibility that&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies may be effective for HIV prophylaxis at low doses and against global&#xD;
      viruses. Neutralization sensitivity profiles are complementary; and the combination of these&#xD;
      mAbs with unique epitope specificities will provide experience assessing the potential&#xD;
      additive, synergistic, or antagonistic properties of two bNAbs given sequentially.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Any clinically significant acute or chronic medical condition, other than HIV&#xD;
             infection, that is considered progressive or in the opinion of the investigator makes&#xD;

             significant by the investigator within the previous 6 months. The following exceptions&#xD;
             are permitted and will not exclude study participation: use of corticosteroid nasal&#xD;
             spray for rhinitis, topical corticosteroids for an acute uncomplicated dermatitis; or&#xD;
             a short course (duration of 10 days or less, or a single injection) of corticosteroid&#xD;

             polyclonal immunoglobulin. Note: receipt of placebo in a previous HIV vaccine or&#xD;
             monoclonal antibody trial will not exclude a volunteer from participation if&#xD;
             documentation is available and the Medical Monitor gives approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. History of severe local or systemic reactogenicity to injections or IV infusion (e.g.,&#xD;
             anaphylaxis, respiratory difficulties, angioedema).&#xD;
