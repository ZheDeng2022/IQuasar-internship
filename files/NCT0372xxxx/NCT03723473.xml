      To explore the reliability of P-31 MR spectroscopy mitochondrial function in patients with&#xD;
      peripheral arterial occlusive disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is defined as the partial or total obstruction&#xD;
      of one or more lower extremity arteries, most often of atherosclerotic origin. It is a common&#xD;
      disease whose 5-years mortality is near 30%.The positive diagnosis is based on clinical&#xD;
      examination and measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI), which is the ratio of systolic&#xD;
      pressure of ankle and brachial systolic pressure. The threshold value for the diagnosis is&#xD;
      &lt;0.90. Physiopathologically, mitochondria have the predominant role of providing the ATP&#xD;
      necessary for the energetic needs of myocytes, which increase drastically during muscle&#xD;
      contraction during exercise. This energy production is of course conditioned by the&#xD;
      availability of oxygen. In patients with PAOD, the decrease in blood flow secondary to&#xD;
      significant stenosis has the direct consequence of disrupting oxygen delivery to distal&#xD;
      muscles and thus limiting muscular performance. Because mitochondrial respiration is the only&#xD;
      metabolic pathway capable of providing the energy needed to sustain an effort of several&#xD;
      minutes, intermittent claudication in PAOD has logically been related to a hemodynamic&#xD;
      mechanism of intermittent muscle hypoperfusion. Recently, an increasing number of&#xD;
      histological or functional studies have suggested that episodes of ischemia-reperfusion could&#xD;
      induce mitochondrial dysfunction. Medical treatment of patients frequently includes statins&#xD;
      while a direct deleterious effect on mitochondrial function has been suspected, inducing a&#xD;
      deterioration of the muscular oxidative capacity which would increase the factors&#xD;
      hemodynamics and may accumulate in mitochondrial myopathy. In the light of these elements, it&#xD;
      is clear that there would be a benefit in being able to distinguish and quantify 1) the part&#xD;
      of the reduction of mitochondrial activity secondary to the hemodynamic factor alone due to a&#xD;
      decreased muscle perfusion 2) the mitochondrial involvement (mitochondriopathy) potentially&#xD;
      induced by oxidative stress in PAOD. 2 sub-groups are distinguished to identify the&#xD;
      statin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
