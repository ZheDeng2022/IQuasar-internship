    <textblock>
      While preliminary data show that oral nicotinamide riboside (NR) supplementation increases&#xD;
      myocardial levels of oxidized nicotine-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels in mice, there has&#xD;
      been no direct evidence that suggests oral NR increases NAD+ levels or improves mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in human hearts. This Pilot Study is designed to obtain feasibility data for a&#xD;
      planned, larger study testing the hypothesis that oral NR supplementation will increase&#xD;
      myocardial NAD+ levels and improve cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function in participants with&#xD;
      advanced heart failure planned for elective left ventricular assist device (LVAD)&#xD;
      implantation. To demonstrate safety and feasibility of NR in this patient population, the&#xD;
      investigators propose to enroll 5 participants planned for LVAD implantation in a Pilot Study&#xD;
      of NR in which participants will receive NR, up-titrated over 3 days to a final NR dose of&#xD;
      1000mg twice daily. Blood and myocardial tissue analyses collected previously from age- and&#xD;
      gender-matched LVAD recipients will serve as controls.&#xD;

      This Pilot Study will examine the following Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Enroll 5 participants scheduled for elective left ventricular assist device (LVAD)&#xD;
      placement into an open-label study of nicotinamide riboside (NR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Participants will have labs (including safety panels) drawn at baseline (Day 1), then&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of NR to a maximum dose of 1000mg twice daily by Day 3. Participants&#xD;
      will be continued on NR at 1000mg twice daily until LVAD implantation surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of LVAD implantation Surgery (Day 5 or later), participants will have final&#xD;
      labs drawn. Samples of fresh cardiac tissue removed from the left ventricular apex during&#xD;
      LVAD implantation surgery will be collected in the operating room. The primary analyses will&#xD;
      be performed on NR-treated participants who were on the maximum NR dose of 1000mg twice daily&#xD;
      for at least 2 days prior to LVAD implantation surgery. The maximum duration of NR&#xD;
      administration will be capped at 14 days. If the surgery doesn't happen by then, the&#xD;
      participant will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine the effect of NR (as compared to historical controls) on levels of the&#xD;
      oxidized and reduced forms of nicotine-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ and NADH, respectively),&#xD;
      mitochondrial function and its regulation through modifications of the epigenome in the&#xD;
      failing myocardium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure NAD+ and NADH levels in the blood and myocardium of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess mitochondrial morphology and function in cardiac tissue using, respectively,&#xD;
           electron microscopy (EM) and isolated mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine protein acetylation in the mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial compartments&#xD;
           and changes in nuclear gene regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that NR improves mitochondrial function and reduces inflammatory&#xD;
      response in heart failure (HF) patients receiving NR (as compared to historical controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measure mitochondrial function in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the inflammatory response in PBMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare effects on the circulating inflammasome vs. myocardial inflammation.&#xD;
