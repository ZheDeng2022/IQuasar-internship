    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of single-vial lyophilized ID93 + GLA-SE compared to the&#xD;
      two-vial presentation consisting of lyophilized ID93 and liquid GLA-SE administered as two IM&#xD;
      injections in healthy adult subjects (aged 18 - 55).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a total of two doses administered IM on Days 0 and 56. Subjects will be&#xD;
      monitored for approximately 421 days (one year following the last study injection), including&#xD;
      safety laboratory analyses done just prior to and 7 days following each study injection.&#xD;
      Tears and nasal swabs will be obtained for exploratory antibody analysis at Days 0, 70, and&#xD;
      224. Blood samples will be obtained for immunological assays (secondary and exploratory) at&#xD;
      Days 0, 7, 14, 56, 63, 70, 84, and 224).&#xD;
