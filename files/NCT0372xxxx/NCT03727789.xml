    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies best dose and side effects of CBL0137 in treating patients with&#xD;
      extremity melanoma or sarcoma that has spread to other places in the body. Drugs, such as&#xD;
      CBL0137, may work by binding to tumor cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to stop the cell from&#xD;
      growing further.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and examine the dose-limiting toxicities of&#xD;
      intra-arterial facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137&#xD;
      (CBL0137) in patients with advanced extremity melanoma or sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the tumor response in advanced melanoma and sarcoma patients treated with&#xD;
      intra-arterial administration of CBL0137.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define both response in-field (area of the limb distal to the infusion point) and&#xD;
      out-of-field (any area proximal to the infusion point) in patients treated with CBL0137 based&#xD;
      intra-arterial infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess the pharmacokinetics of CBL0137 in the study population pre-and post CBL0137&#xD;
      intraarterial infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess tumor protein expression profiles before and after treatment with CBL0137.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess if the proposed treatment has any effect on quality of life as measured by the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ? Melanoma (assessment tool also applicable to&#xD;
      sarcoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive FACT complex-targeting curaxin CBL0137 intra-arterially (IA) over 15&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 6 and 12 weeks, every 3&#xD;
      months for 12 months, then at 24 months.&#xD;
