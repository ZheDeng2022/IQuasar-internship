      This study is being conducted to determine safety and effectiveness of transplanting lungs&#xD;
      from Hepatitis C-positive donors into Hepatitis C-negative patients on the lung transplant&#xD;
      waitlist, who will then be treated with appropriate direct-acting antiviral (DAA) after&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;

      Open-labelled pilot clinical trial of Zepatier (Grazoprevir + Elbasvir), Epclusa (Sofosbuvir&#xD;
      + Velpatasvir), or another appropriate DAA in at least 10 HCV-negative subjects receiving a&#xD;
      lung transplant from a hepatitis C (HCV)-positive donor. Eligible subjects will receive a&#xD;
      lung transplant from a deceased-donor, and then will receive treatment after lung&#xD;
      transplantation when infection with HCV is confirmed in these lung transplant recipients.&#xD;
      Treatment will be complete after 12 weeks for most subjects.&#xD;
