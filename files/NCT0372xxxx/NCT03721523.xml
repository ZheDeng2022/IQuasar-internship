  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a significant medical problem with 150,000 events occurring per year in the UK and&#xD;
      incurring healthcare costs of Â£4 billion per year. Fifty percent of strokes will leave a&#xD;
      lasting disability on first manifestation and 10-15% (roughly 16,500 per year) are unheralded&#xD;
      ischaemic events in previously asymptomatic Carotid artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid Artery Disease is caused by the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque in the vessel.&#xD;
      Stroke or TIA occurs when plaque or adherent thrombus breaks off and embolises to the brain,&#xD;
      blocking off its blood supply. Hence, a carotid plaque is said to be symptomatic if it has&#xD;
      caused a Stroke or TIA in the territory of the brain supplied by that vessel in the previous&#xD;
      six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the degree of stenosis (narrowing) of the artery by doppler ultrasound is the main&#xD;
      assessment performed. Doppler ultrasound measures stenosis and elevation of blood flow&#xD;
      velocity in the artery prior to surgical intervention. However, it has been shown that the&#xD;
      degree of stenosis is a poor predictor of stroke as many asymptomatic patients have severe&#xD;
      stenosis and many symptomatic patients have moderate stenosis. Stenosis is a two dimensional&#xD;
      assessment of a 3-D structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other features of the plaque should be considered including the volume of the carotid plaque&#xD;
      and its constituents. Carotid Plaque Volume has been measured in 339 individuals, with plaque&#xD;
      volume being higher in symptomatic than asymptomatic individuals. In this study, plaque&#xD;
      volume did not correlate with stenosis degree. No studies have been conducted measuring the&#xD;
      change in carotid plaque volume and morphology following a stroke. This pilot study will&#xD;
      perform serial duplex scans on recently symptomatic individuals over a 12 week period and&#xD;
      observe the changes in Plaque Volume and morphology. This will attempt to prove that carotid&#xD;
      plaque volume is a better predictor of stroke than stenosis. The investigators will also aim&#xD;
      to identify other plaque features that may have an important role in predicting stroke risk.&#xD;
      Documenting the timescale of change in plaque volume will aid us in defining appropriate&#xD;
      timescales for treating the symptomatic population and when those having medical management's&#xD;
      risk has returned to baseline. Observing the change in plaque immediately after stroke will&#xD;
      improve our knowledge of the changes in plaques that lead to symptoms and may in the future&#xD;
      help us predict which patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis need operation.&#xD;

      Carotid Stenosis and stroke risk&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although carotid stenosis is the primary factor used to determine stroke risk and clinical&#xD;
      priority in carotid artery disease, stenosis is in fact a poor predictor of stroke risk.&#xD;
      Specifically, in asymptomatic patients with &gt;70% carotid stenosis, the risk of ipsilateral&#xD;
      stroke is under 2% a year. Therefore in these patients the benefit of intervention with&#xD;
      carotid endarterectomy is minimal, in simple terms around 32 CEA's would need to be&#xD;
      undertaken to prevent just one stroke in carotid artery disease patients over a five year&#xD;
      follow up period. This clearly indicates that carotid stenosis itself is a poor indictor of&#xD;
      stroke risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several other factors have been proposed as potentially relevant to stroke risk determination&#xD;
      in carotid artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid plaque volume&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid plaque volume (CPV) is the actual volume of atherosclerotic plaque present within the&#xD;
      carotid artery. CPV may impact on stroke risk in Carotid artery disease as an increased&#xD;
      atherosclerotic burden may disrupt carotid flow leading to thrombus formation and subsequent&#xD;
      embolisation leading to CVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent pilot study recruiting over 200 patients demonstrated that CPV in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CEA within four weeks of symptoms was almost double of that seen in asymptomatic&#xD;
      patients, with mean CPV in the symptomatic group being 1.1cm3 compared with 0.68cm3 in the&#xD;
      asymptomatic group (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, carotid plaque volume was also shown to fall&#xD;
      rapidly following symptoms of cerebral ischemia from 1.1cm3 within four weeks of cerebral&#xD;
      symptoms to 0.91cm3 at six weeks and a mean of only 0.62 cm3 more than eight weeks following&#xD;
      symptoms. This data demonstrated that there may be a crucial link between CPV and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular symptoms in carotid artery disease and therefore between CPV and stroke risk&#xD;
      in the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid Plaque Morphology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies have detailed carotid plaque histology to identify features that are related&#xD;
      to cerebrovascular symptoms. The main features being; intra-plaque haemorrhage, plaque&#xD;
      ulceration, fibrous cap thickness and lipid rich necrotic core. Fisher et al showed plaque&#xD;
      ulceration was significantly more common in plaques in symptomatic patients. Xu et al also&#xD;
      reported that disruption of the luminal surface, by fibrous cap rupture, intraplaque&#xD;
      haemorrhage or ulceration is indicative of a high risk lesion. The project aims to identify&#xD;
      these features on 3D duplex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D Duplex&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D duplex has been used to measure plaque volume and is proven to be reliable. The inter and&#xD;
      intra observer variability have been shown to be low but increase with reducing amounts of&#xD;
      total plaque volume. The study hypothesises that Carotid Plaque volume will correlate more&#xD;
      with risk of stroke than the degree of stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antiplatelet Resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      All carotid patients are treated with antiplatelet agents, commonly aspirin or clopidogrel,&#xD;
      to reduce the incidence of thrombus formation around plaques. This intervention is thought to&#xD;
      reduce stroke risk by around 9% annually and is therefore a key therapy in the management of&#xD;
      carotid artery disease. Research has suggested that up to 37% of the population may be&#xD;
      resistant to the actions of antiplatelet agents; if this is true in carotid artery disease&#xD;
      patients it would represent a severe shortfall in current treatment and the prevalence and&#xD;
      impact of this resistance may also impact on the risk of stroke in CAD patients. Patients&#xD;
      will be tested for antiplatelet resistance at two timepoints to establish if they have&#xD;
      resistance to the agents but also to see the effect of the acute embolic event on the&#xD;
      efficacy of antiplatelet agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent pilot study involving 35 patients demonstrated a significant prevalence of&#xD;
      antiplatelet resistance in CAD patients and showed an association between cerebrovascular&#xD;
      symptoms and residual platelet aggregation. This further strengthens the hypothesis that&#xD;
      antiplatelet resistance may be associated with stroke risk in CAD. Data from this project&#xD;
      demonstrates that antiplatelet resistance may be prevalent in the CAD patient population and&#xD;
      that the impact of this resistance, although potentially significant, is as yet not fully&#xD;
      understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
