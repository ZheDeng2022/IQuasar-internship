             lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The first dose of CS1001 will be administered within 1 - 42 days (including 42 days)&#xD;
             after concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Platinum-containing chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Absence of progression after concurrent/sequential chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group(ECOG) Perfomance Status (PS) of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject with prior anti-cancer treatment can only be enrolled when all toxicities&#xD;
             except for hearing loss, alopecia and fatigue, of prior anti-cancer treatment has&#xD;
             recovered to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI]&#xD;
             Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v4.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must have adequate organ function as assessed in the following laboratory&#xD;
             tests.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Immune deficient disease or systemic corticosteroid treatment within 7 days prior to&#xD;
             the first dose of investigational product, or any other form of immune suppressing&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. A known additional malignancy within 5 years prior to the first dose of&#xD;
