      A crucial factor in evaluating the risk of dioxins, and related endocrine disruptor compounds&#xD;
      (dioxins for short) in the human population is the accumulation of these chemicals in the&#xD;
      human body. Human data on tissue background levels is extremely limited, and there are no&#xD;
      studies in UK populations, although there are several European studies looking at blood&#xD;
      levels of dioxins. Adipose tissue concentrations were 139 ng of TEQ (total dioxin-like&#xD;
      compounds) per kg lipid weight (5.4 ± 4.6 ng of TCDD per kg lipid weight). However, given the&#xD;
      different dietary habits of Japanese populations, compared to European populations, these&#xD;
      estimates may differ considerably from UK values. Thus determining human tissue&#xD;
      concentrations of dioxins is an important issue for assessing the risk to public health from&#xD;
      these compounds, and this information is currently lacking for European populations. This&#xD;
      information will also guide and inform the necessity fro continued measures to reduce the&#xD;
      environmental dioxin levels in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigation of the toxicodynamics of/dioxin distribution in adipose of a morbidly&#xD;
           obese and comparative control population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterisation of the burden of dioxins in liver and adipose tissue, and the&#xD;
           relationship with blood levels of dioxins, in a UK population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining whether bariatric surgery-induced weight loss causes an increase in tissue&#xD;
      concentration of dioxin-like compounds&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of this study will yield useful information to refine the risk assessment&#xD;
      process for the obese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Methodology This proposal seeks to examine thirty non-obese patients taking&#xD;
      liver (500mg) and adipose tissue (visceral and subcutaneous: 40g each) samples at the time of&#xD;
      gastric/abdominal surgery; and thirty obese patients, taking liver (500mg) and adipose tissue&#xD;
      (visceral and subcutaneous: 40g each) samples at the time of undertaking Roux -en-y bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Weight and bioimpedance and a food diary will be performed prior to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further body weight and bioimpedance will be undertaken at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months from the&#xD;
      obese population. A subcutaneous adipose biopsy will be taken under local anaesthetic from&#xD;
      these individuals at after bariatric surgery (minimum of 10% body weight loss). A record of&#xD;
      weight loss since bariatric surgery will documented with the change in body composition. The&#xD;
      statistical power for seeing an effect of gastroplasty, assuming a coefficient of variation&#xD;
      of TEQ measurements of 75% and an increase in TEQ of two-fold, is 90% at P&lt;0.05 for a&#xD;
      population of thirty individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should subjects need additional surgery (eg. cholecystectomy, diagnostic laproscopy) either&#xD;
      as a consequence of bariatric surgery or for any other reasons during the 24 month following&#xD;
      initial operation, a liver biopsy and visceral fat biopsy will be taken during the future&#xD;
      surgery. If subjects undergo abdominal wall surgeries (eg. Apronectomy, ventral hernia&#xD;
      repair) in the 24 months following initial bariatric surgery, an subcutaneous fat biopsy will&#xD;
      be taken during the future surgery.&#xD;

      Background A crucial factor in evaluating the risk of dioxins, and related endocrine&#xD;
      disruptor compounds (dioxins for short) in the human population is the accumulation of these&#xD;
      chemicals in the human body. The &quot;half-life&quot; of the prototypical dioxin,&#xD;
      2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in the human is estimated as ~7 years, as such&#xD;
      accumulation of these chemicals in the body is an important issue. These lipophilic chemicals&#xD;
      accumulate in adipose tissue, and (in a congener-dependent fashion) in the liver, so an&#xD;
      accurate estimation of human body burden requires knowledge of their concentrations in liver,&#xD;
      and adipose tissue. The concentration of these endocrine disruptors in blood is an essential&#xD;
      piece of information for understanding how these chemicals dispose between the organs, and&#xD;
      for calibrating tissue concentrations to the most common measurement of dioxins and in&#xD;
      humans, which is a measurement of dioxins in blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, human data on tissue background levels is extremely limited, and I am unaware of any&#xD;
      studies in UK populations, although there are several European studies looking at blood&#xD;
      levels of dioxins. There is one study in an American population, which features some people&#xD;
      with a history of (presumably occupational) exposure to TCDD, but this was published in 1988,&#xD;
      when background levels were considerably higher. Adipose tissue concentrations were 83 ± 178&#xD;
      ng of TCDD per kg lipid weight. There are three recent studies from Japan, spanning&#xD;
      1999-2007, so these should be indicative of the much lower current background level of dioxin&#xD;
      exposure. Adipose tissue concentrations were 139 ng of TEQ (total dioxin-like compounds) per&#xD;
      kg lipid weight (5.4 ± 4.6 ng of TCDD per kg lipid weight). However, given the different&#xD;
      dietary habits of Japanese populations, compared to European populations, these estimates may&#xD;
      differ considerably from UK values. Thus determining human tissue concentrations of dioxins&#xD;
      is an important issue for assessing the risk to public health from these compounds, and this&#xD;
      information is currently lacking for European populations. This information will also guide&#xD;
      and inform the necessity fro continued measures to reduce the environmental dioxin levels in&#xD;
      the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A further topical issue relates to the body burden of dioxins in obese individuals, since an&#xD;
      increased BMI is associated with increased blood concentration of dioxin and other lipophilic&#xD;
      contaminants, and the impact of weight reduction upon the concentration and amount of dioxins&#xD;
      in the body is unknown. There is the possibility that weight reduction could result in the&#xD;
      release of dioxins from adipose tissue depots, as the adipose tissue is lost, and that the&#xD;
      circulating dioxin levels (and other toxic lipophilic chemicals) could increase if the dioxin&#xD;
      is maintained in the body, or alternatively as adipose tissue is lost dioxins may be&#xD;
      concentrated in the remaining adipose tissue. Although there is some evidence that weight&#xD;
      loss is associated with an increase in some lipophilic contaminants, dioxins have not been&#xD;
      examined to see if these are increased after weight loss. If dioxin concentrations in lipids&#xD;
      increase following weight loss, it will also be useful to evaluate whether those increased&#xD;
      concentrations persist or rapidly equilibrate, and the data from this study may allow some&#xD;
      evaluation of that question as well. The toxicodynamics information will allow estimation and&#xD;
      prediction of what will happen to other lipophilic chemicals in the body.&#xD;

      The primary aims of this study will yield useful information to refine the risk assessment&#xD;

      repair) in the 24 months following initial bariatric surgery, an subcutaneous fat biopsy will&#xD;
      be taken during the future surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of dioxins and TEQ will be performed with high resolution GC-MS in a laboratory&#xD;
      accredited for working with dioxins, according to ISO17025. The method is validated to have&#xD;
      high sensitivity (necessary for the small volumes of clinical samples) and robust quality&#xD;
      control (essential for analyses of background levels of dioxins), and the analytical team&#xD;
      have extensive experience of using this technology with demanding biological samples. Lipid&#xD;
      content of sampled tissues will also be measured to allow assessment of lipid-adjusted tissue&#xD;
      concentrations for comparison across tissues and blood, as previous work has demonstrated&#xD;
      that these compounds partition across tissues principally on the basis of lipid content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of the effect of gastroplasty on dioxin burden and concentrations will&#xD;
      use a conventional repeated measures methodology. Modelling the relationship between tissue&#xD;
      distribution and blood concentrations of dioxins, especially with regard to different&#xD;
      congeners, will be undertaken by Summit Toxicology, who have extensive experience of these&#xD;
      analyses. The data will be evaluated in the framework of a previously-published toxicokinetic&#xD;
      model, and potential congener-specific differences in behaviour will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that initial data analysis will be undertaken comparing the dioxin burden&#xD;
      between the obese and non-obese subjects (per gram tissue on a wet weight and on a&#xD;
      lipid-adjusted basis, and related to lean body mass). The final data analysis will also take&#xD;
      into account the change in dioxins with time associated with loss of body weight/change in&#xD;
      lean body mass, together with the dioxin load in subcutaneous fat tissue before and after&#xD;
      weight loss.&#xD;
