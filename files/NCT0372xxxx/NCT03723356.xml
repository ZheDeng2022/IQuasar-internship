  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common progressive neurologic disorder to occur in adults&#xD;
      of working-age. Despite longstanding recognition of cognitive impairment as a symptom of MS,&#xD;
      two obstacles in measurement have limited understanding its biological basis, and therefore&#xD;
      identifying targeted options for management. First is the absence of a sensitive and precise&#xD;
      measure of cognitive impairment. Second is the absence of an index of disease status linked&#xD;
      to brain pathophysiology and cognitive performance. This project overcomes both obstacles to&#xD;
      link cognitive impairment to MS disease biomarkers. The absence of a sensitive and precise&#xD;
      measure of cognitive impairment, along with the absence of an index of disease status linked&#xD;
      to brain pathophysiology and cognitive performance, limits the understanding of the&#xD;
      biological basis for multiple sclerosis (MS). This project overcomes both obstacles to link&#xD;
      cognitive function to MS disease biomarkers, and provides preliminary evaluation of a disease&#xD;
      modifying therapy (Tecfidera) for preserving cognitive function.&#xD;
