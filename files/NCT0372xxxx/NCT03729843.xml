  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The selection of a regenerative approach is primarily based on the configuration of the&#xD;
      intrabony defect and esthetic risk of treatment. Accurate diagnosis of periodontal bone&#xD;
      defects, such as vertical bone defects or furcation involvements, is a challenge for dental&#xD;
      clinicians. A deficiency in comprehensive diagnosis may result in: 1) compromised prognosis&#xD;
      of teeth; 2) changes in treatment plan; 3) unnecessary treatment; 4) longer treatment time;&#xD;
      and 5) unanticipated treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, it is very important to have access to accurate diagnostic tools that can aid&#xD;
      clinicians in cultivating an appropriate treatment choice. Periodontal assessments utilizing&#xD;
      both clinical and radiographic examinations allow for the establishment of an accurate&#xD;
      diagnosis as well as subsequent treatment choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiography plays an important role in periodontal diagnosis mainly because radiographs can&#xD;
      reveal the amount and type of damage caused to the alveolar bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital imaging technique has created challenging opportunities for dental radiographic&#xD;
      diagnosis. Digora was the first digital system for dental radiography based on a&#xD;
      photostimulable phosphor technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E9ickholz et al. at 1999 compared linear measurements of interproximal bone loss on digitized&#xD;
      radiographic images after application of different filters to the gold standard of&#xD;
      intrasurgical measurements they concluded that all radiographic assessments on the digitized&#xD;
      images came close to the intasurgical gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2D technologies do not allow for measurement of the bucco-lingual (B-L) width of the defect.&#xD;
      Only the vertical height and the mesio-distal (M-D) width of the defect can be measured with&#xD;
      2D images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of 3D volumetric images and 2D images in artificial bone defects have shown that CBCT has&#xD;
      a sensitivity of 80% to 100% in detection and classification of bone defects, while intraoral&#xD;
      radiographs present a sensitivity of 63% to 67%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared with periapical and panoramic images, the CBCT has also shown an absence of&#xD;
      distortion and overlapping, and the dimensions of the images that it presents were compatible&#xD;
      with the actual size of the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have been published comparing CBCT with digital radiography for the detection&#xD;
      and measurements of periodontal bone defects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is caused by an imbalance between bone formation and resorption, leading&#xD;
      to an ultimate reduction in bone height. Detection of periodontal disease is important in the&#xD;
      prevention of tooth loss. The detection and accurate assessment of the location, extent and&#xD;
      configuration of the endosseous defect is important for the determination of the tooth&#xD;
      prognosis, the treatment plan and the maintenance procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regenerative therapies for both intrabony and furcation defects are viable options, but early&#xD;
      management of these defects offers the greatest potential for periodontal health. Intrabony&#xD;
      defect morphology as well as degree of furcation involvement may affect overall regenerative&#xD;
      outcomes and/or optimal treatment strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic bone loss is also useful for assigning descriptors to indicate severity of&#xD;
      periodontitis: &lt;1/3 bone loss = mild, 1/3 to ½ bone loss = moderate, and &gt;½ bone loss =&#xD;
      severe. Classification of bony defects given by Papapanou et al. 2000 was used to&#xD;
      differentiate bone defects into: Suprabony defects (SB), Infrabony defects (IB),&#xD;
      Interradicular defects (IR).For classifying the intrabony defects (IT), the investigators&#xD;
      used classification system by Goldman and Cohen 1958 which classified the IT defects into: 1&#xD;
      wall, 2 wall , 3 wall and Combined bone defects (CB). Other bone defects (OB) were classified&#xD;
      by their topography as:Bulbous bone contour (BB), Reversed architecture (RA), Dehiscence&#xD;
      (DH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potentially existing radiological furcation involvement was examined by identifying the&#xD;
      furcation upper boundary and furcation lower boundary and was classified as Subclass A, B,&#xD;
      and C according to the classification system by Tarnow and Fletcher 1984, where he added the&#xD;
      vertical component to the diagnosis of furcation involvement. Subclass based on the vertical&#xD;
      bone resorption from the furcation fornix was added.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subclass A: Denotes furcation involvements with vertical bone loss of 3 mm or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subclass B: Denotes furcation involvements with vertical bone loss from 4 to 6 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subclass C: Presents with bone loss from the fornix of 7 mm or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The SB, IB, and OB defects were considered as absolute defects while IR defects&#xD;
                were considered as relative defects because IR defects do not depict a particular&#xD;
                bone lesion or defect rather they represent the stage in progress of periodontitis,&#xD;
                i.e., once the periodontal disease progresses or its severity increases, it is&#xD;
                bound to erode the bone between the multirooted teeth and involve the furcation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital radiography is changing the diagnosis and treatment of dental diseases by&#xD;
      incorporating computer technology into the field of dentistry. digital radiography have&#xD;
      several advantages over film radiography, including immediate image production with&#xD;
      solid-state devices; interactive display on a monitor with the ability to enhance image&#xD;
      features and make direct linear and densitometric measurements; integrated storage; fast&#xD;
      communication of images; lower contamination of the environment; security mechanisms to&#xD;
      identify original images; ability to tag information such as a patient identifier, date of&#xD;
      exposure and other relevant details; interoperability of the Digital Imaging and&#xD;
      Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file format, which enables practitioners with different&#xD;
      equipment and software to view and enhance the same images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, digital radiography offers a plethora of technical innovations to dentistry and&#xD;
      is sure to significantly influence the arts of diagnosis, monitoring, research, as well as&#xD;
      the treatment of dental diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a relatively new extra-oral imaging system which was&#xD;
      specifically developed to overcome the limitations of periapical radiographs as it produces&#xD;
      undistorted 3D information of the maxillofacial skeleton with a substantially lower radiation&#xD;
      dose compared to conventional CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, CBCT has the potential to become non-invasive diagnostic instrument for various&#xD;
      dental applications in which defect characterization, localization and volume measurements&#xD;
      are important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CBCT is currently being considered as a superior diagnostic tool for applications in&#xD;
      periodontology. CBCT scanning was found to be more effective than other 2D imaging modalities&#xD;
      in assessing periodontal structures. As CBCT had better potential of detecting periodontal&#xD;
      bone defects in all directions compared with periapical radiographs. More over interproximal&#xD;
      areas also, buccal and lingual defects could not be recognized from each other with intraoral&#xD;
      radiographs.&#xD;
