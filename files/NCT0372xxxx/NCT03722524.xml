      The use of TRIple fixed-dose COmbination in the treatment of arteriaL hypertension:&#xD;
      opportunity for effective BP control with cOmbined antihypertensive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study to assess the antihypertensive effectiveness effect on the 24-hour&#xD;
      BP profile, as well as tolerability of and compliance to the treatment with a triple FDC of&#xD;
      amlodipine / indapamide / perindopril arginine in hypertensive patients in the real clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of program: Multicenter, observational, non-controlled, open-label program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators: Cardiologists and outpatient (primary care) physicians (general&#xD;
      practitioners).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients: 1,300 hypertensive patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is multicenter, observational, non-controlled, open-label program. The baseline&#xD;
      characteristics will be analyzed in all the patients who started the treatment&#xD;
      (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). In case of significant differences between two&#xD;
      treatment groups, the baseline characteristics will be provided for both of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in the SBP and DBP (with the corresponding confidence intervals) will be assessed in&#xD;
      the patients who completed the program without major deviations from protocol (per-protocol&#xD;
      population [PPP]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of parameters with normal distribution will be performed using the Student's&#xD;
      t-test for paired measurements; otherwise the non-parametric Wilcoxon test will be used. The&#xD;
      percentage of patients with normalized BP, as well as the percentage of patients who&#xD;
      responded to treatment (with 95% confidence intervals), will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: The score for each scale will be calculated as the sum of scores for&#xD;
      questions constituting the scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the AEs will be carried out in all the patients who started the treatment (ITT&#xD;
      population).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the mean office systolic BP levels (in mm Hg) in the sitting position Blood pressure was measured in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) using the auscultatory or oscillometric method and a semi-automated sphygmomanometer. Before taking measurements, the patient remained in a sitting position for 3-5 minutes. Blood pressure was determined on each arm, and the arm with the highest value was taken as the reference. Measurements were taken thrice in the sitting position of a patient, and the average of the second and third BP measurements on the reference arm with an interval of at least 1-2 minutes was recorded.</description>

    <description>Change in the mean score of the of the physical component of the The Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) survey.&#xD;
The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <description>The patient is included in the program if prior to the study his/her doctor decided to adjust treatment, targeted at the BP control improvement, by prescription of a triple FDC of amlodipine / indapamide / perindopril arginine. The prescription of the triple FDC of amlodipine / indapamide / perindopril arginine during the program is made by the doctor's decision according to the instructions for medical use of this FDC.&#xD;
Presumably, each doctor will include 4 patients in average. It is planned to include 1,300 patients.</description>

        <title>The Mean Systolic BP Changes (mm Hg) at the Visit 4 vs. Baseline</title>
        <description>Changes in the mean office systolic BP levels (in mm Hg) in the sitting position Blood pressure was measured in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) using the auscultatory or oscillometric method and a semi-automated sphygmomanometer. Before taking measurements, the patient remained in a sitting position for 3-5 minutes. Blood pressure was determined on each arm, and the arm with the highest value was taken as the reference. Measurements were taken thrice in the sitting position of a patient, and the average of the second and third BP measurements on the reference arm with an interval of at least 1-2 minutes was recorded.</description>

Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
