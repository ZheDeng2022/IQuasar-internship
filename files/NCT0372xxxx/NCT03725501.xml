  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this phase 2 study is to determine the optimal dose of ALS-L1023 by&#xD;
      evaluating the safety and efficacy of ALS-L1023 comparing with placebo when used in&#xD;
      combination with Ranibizumab for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration(AMD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, three-arm&#xD;
      parallel-group phase 2 study in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of two separate phases: a loading phase and a PRN(pro re nata) phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject provides a written informed consent, subject information including&#xD;
      demographics, medical history, and concomitant medications will be collected, and only those&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be randomized into three groups Group A&#xD;
      (Ranibizumab 0.5mg &amp; ALS-L1023 600mg) or Group B (Ranibizumab 0.5mg &amp; ALS-L1023 1200mg) or&#xD;
      Group C (Ranibizumab &amp; placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified by whether&#xD;
      or not the subject has PCV(polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) confirmed at Screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3-month loading phase, all subjects will receive a Ranibizumab 0.5mg injection&#xD;
      into the vitreous every month and take either the placebo or ALS-L1023 orally twice a day.&#xD;
      During the following 3-12 month PRN phase, subjects will continue to take the placebo or&#xD;
      ALS-L1023 in the same frequency as above but receive Ranibizumab injection only when it meets&#xD;
      retreatment criteria. Subjects must instill antibacterial eye drops three times a day for&#xD;
      three days after Ranibizumab injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will visit the study site monthly during the 12 month study period in order to&#xD;
      receive scheduled assessments and evaluate safety and efficacy of treatment. Image&#xD;
      interpretation will be performed by a central reading center. The central reading center will&#xD;
      confirm eligibility for enrollment and the discrimination of Polypoidal Choroidal&#xD;
      Vasculopathy(PCV) at screening and play a role in interpreting whole images of all subjects&#xD;
      after the end of the study.&#xD;
