  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and temozolomide work in treating patients&#xD;
      with small-cell lung cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with&#xD;
      small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and&#xD;
      temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have&#xD;
      progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1),&#xD;
      or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line&#xD;
      of therapy (cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as&#xD;
      per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients&#xD;
      treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in&#xD;
      immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSC]) in&#xD;
      peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor&#xD;
      O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to&#xD;
      therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict&#xD;
      clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed&#xD;
      with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also&#xD;
      receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
