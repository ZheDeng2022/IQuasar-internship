  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to collect data on patients that had the Legion Porous HA&#xD;
      Tibial Baseplates and/or the Legion Porous HA Femoral component implanted in the past. Smith&#xD;
      &amp; Nephew will evaluate the safety and performance of these implants for 10 years&#xD;
      post-surgery.&#xD;

        Maximum of 150 subjects enrolled to obtain a minimum of 150 implanted components:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Maximum of 75 subjects to obtain a minimum of 75 implanted tibial baseplate components&#xD;
             (with or without holes) to attain 30 evaluable baseplates with holes and 30 evaluable&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subject received primary TKA with the LEGION Porous HA Tibial Baseplates (either with&#xD;
             holes or without holes) and/or the LEGION Porous HA CR Femoral Component, due to&#xD;
             degenerative joint disease (primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis, post-traumatic&#xD;
             arthritis, or degenerative arthritis).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Subject has ipsilateral hip arthritis resulting in flexion contracture.&#xD;

          3. At the time of enrollment, subject has one or more of the following arthroplasties&#xD;
             that are not fully healed and well-functioning, as determined by the investigator:&#xD;
             Ipsilateral or contralateral primary total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing&#xD;
             arthroplasty; Contralateral primary total knee or unicondylar knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a condition that may interfere with the TKA survival or outcome (e.g.&#xD;
