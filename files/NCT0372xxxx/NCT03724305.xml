  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) alone or enhanced by mindfulness-augmented telemedicine CBT-I&#xD;
      (tCBT-I) with trained nurse therapists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to use a &quot;stepped care&quot; model of CBT-I treatment beginning with an online&#xD;
      (dCBT-I) approach for initial treatment and then stepping up to a more personalized,&#xD;
      telemedicine approach with mindfulness delivered via trained nursing staff (tCBT-I) with&#xD;
      individuals who are insomnia non-remitters. By successfully treating insomnia, the objective&#xD;
      is to prevent acute and long-term effects of insomnia; daytime symptom clusters (daytime&#xD;
      fatigue and sleepiness, depressive symptoms, and quality of life); and nocturnal rumination&#xD;
      and worry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial utilizes a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design to test&#xD;
      the effectiveness of the stepped care model to treat insomnia. The initial phase of the&#xD;
      design will use randomization to dCBT-I or an attention control group. Following this phase,&#xD;
      a second randomization to tCBT-I or attention control will be provided to those who do not&#xD;
      respond to initial dCBT-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The digital CBT-I treatment is delivered through the online program Sleepio. tCBT-I will be&#xD;
      delivered by nursing staff trained in CBT-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female participants who have insomnia, are age 18 and older, and who are recruited&#xD;
      into the study will complete an initial assessment of their qualifications that are based on&#xD;
      the severity of their insomnia symptoms, depression symptoms, and physical and mental health&#xD;
      status. Qualified participants will then be administered an in-depth survey to evaluate&#xD;
      several facets of sleep and mental health. At the completion of this initial survey,&#xD;
      participants will be randomized into either an active control or dCBTI. Following the first&#xD;
      treatment, participants will again be surveyed (Post-treatment 1) to determine if there have&#xD;
      been changes since study initiation. Insomnia non-remitters from the dCBT-I group will be&#xD;
      randomized into the next treatment in the sequence, which is tCBT-I or attention control.&#xD;
      tCBT-I will incorporate previously introduced material with a personalized approach; therapy&#xD;
      components include sleep restriction, stimulus control, mindfulness, relaxation therapy, and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy as it relates to sleep and sleep-related dysfunctional&#xD;
      cognition. Participants will be compensated.&#xD;
