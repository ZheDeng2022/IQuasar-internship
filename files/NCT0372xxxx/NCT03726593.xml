  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are conducting this study due to recent reports of many of existing malaria&#xD;
      drugs becoming less effective for treatment of malaria. The drugs may not always kill all the&#xD;
      parasites, therefore not all patients with malaria are being cured. The main objective of the&#xD;
      study is to find out which malaria drugs and what drug combinations are still effective in&#xD;
      Cambodia, an area of multi-drug resistance where 4-5 artemisinin-based combination therapies&#xD;
      have shown inadequate response, below that established by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO). New drug combinations (taking more than one drug for malaria at the same time), as&#xD;
      long as well tolerated, can provide cure in patients that harbor parasites not responsive to&#xD;
      standard first-line medications. Human genetic testing will be done to identify patients who&#xD;
      may have suboptimal response to treatments and to study the differences in human gene&#xD;
      expression to explain why some persons are at higher risk of complications during treatment.&#xD;
      Markers of drug resistance to commonly used antimalarial drugs will also be evaluated and&#xD;
      shared with national malaria program (CNM) to better guide future malaria treatment decisions&#xD;
      in Cambodia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy to drugs that are currently available and new antimalarial candidates that are in&#xD;
      development are threatened by multidrug resistant (MDR) malaria parasites, widely prevalent&#xD;
      in Cambodia. Without effective interventions, MDR malaria can pose a substantial public&#xD;
      health threat in the years to come. Therefore, accurate, timely and relevant data on&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance is of critical importance. Prompt, effective and well-tolerated&#xD;
      treatment remains one of the cornerstones in the malaria case management. Recent malaria&#xD;
      outbreak in Thailand and rise of malaria cases observed in Cambodia in 2017 has brought to&#xD;
      the forefront the urgency with which new drug candidates and new combination drug treatments&#xD;
      must be identified; otherwise, patients may be left with ineffective treatments. Lack of&#xD;
      available alternatives has a potential to result in significant setback to the recent gains&#xD;
      in malaria control and malaria elimination efforts. Innovative approaches to treatment&#xD;
      proposed here, using current ACTs in combination with non-ACT drugs, such as&#xD;
      atovaquone-proguanil, need to be investigated to assess drug tolerability and overall&#xD;
      efficacy when used under combination treatment. By early investment in the studies of drugs&#xD;
      such as pyronaridine-artesunate (ASPY), in combination with other antimalarials, and drug&#xD;
      combinations proposed under this protocol, this study will try to provide the latest evidence&#xD;
      on the interventions that are most likely to work, even in areas of MDR, such as Cambodia,&#xD;
      and along the Cambodia-Thai border. It is hoped that our approach for using combination&#xD;
      treatments will not only provide more effective treatments, but it might prolong the lifespan&#xD;
      of the remaining antimalarials and delay the spread of MDR malaria to neighboring countries.&#xD;
