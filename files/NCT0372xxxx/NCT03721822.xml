  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure the extent of lung inflammation between different&#xD;
      groups of participants using a radioactive tracer called [18F]NOS. A radioactive tracer is a&#xD;
      type of imaging drug that is labeled with a radioactive tag and injected into the body. This&#xD;
      study will see how the tracer is taken up in the lungs using an imaging scan called Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT). [18F]NOS is an experimental radioactive&#xD;
      molecule used in PET imaging to measure inflammation in various organs in the body.&#xD;
      Investigators are interested in studying whether there are differences in lung inflammation&#xD;
      between E-cigarette users (vapers) cigarette smokers and non-smokers. [18F]NOS has not yet&#xD;
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use except in a research study.&#xD;
      The use of [18F]NOS in this study is allowed under an Investigational New Drug Application&#xD;
      approved by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are also going to be studying how the information from the PET/CT scan compares&#xD;
      to other markers of inflammation in the blood. During the PET scan, Investigators will image&#xD;
      Brain and Lungs in order to see if there is a difference between inflammation seen in the&#xD;
      brain and the lungs and if these differences change depending on whether a subject is a&#xD;
      smoker, e-cigarette user or non-smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consented participant in this study will undergo one (1) experimental [18F]NOS PET/CT scan.&#xD;
      During the scan, PET/CT images will be taken of participant chest/torso in order to capture&#xD;
      their lungs and a short image will be taken of their brain. Blood samples will be taken at&#xD;
      various time points to test for markers of inflammation and to measure the concentration of&#xD;
      the tracer in participants blood during the scan and participants will undergo some specific&#xD;
      psychological questionnaires and tasks.&#xD;
