  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if whole genome sequencing (WGS) improves the diagnosis of&#xD;
      patients in the NICU. Using WGS in this way, which is relatively new, researchers at Penn&#xD;
      State College of Medicine will look at approximately 5000 genes that are known to be&#xD;
      associated with genetic diseases to see if the neonatal patient has a known disease causing&#xD;
      mutation. Comparing the parents' DNA with the child's will help the investigators better&#xD;
      understand the child's DNA.&#xD;

      1.0 Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1 Study Objectives The goal of this research project is to assess the potential for&#xD;
      applying whole genome sequencing (WGS) as a diagnostic tool in the neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit. Newborn children who require treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often&#xD;
      suffer from genetic defects, the nature of which is difficult to diagnose. The investigators&#xD;
      currently know of more than 5000 genes in which mutations may cause diseases that can affect&#xD;
      newborn children, so determining which one is responsible for a new neonatal patient's&#xD;
      disease is daunting. However, many of these diseases can be effectively treated if they are&#xD;
      diagnosed in a timely fashion. The investigators propose to use new sequencing&#xD;
      instrumentation coupled with rapid analytical tools to sequence NICU patients along with both&#xD;
      parents to identify whether a patient carries a de novo mutation or compound heterozygous&#xD;
      variants in one of the known disease genes. If so, the mutation will be confirmed in an&#xD;
      in-house CLIA laboratory and the results provided within 72 hours to attending neonatologists&#xD;
      to inform treatment decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Primary Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this protocol will be an assessment of the degree to which WGS improves&#xD;
      diagnosis of patients admitted to the NICU. The investigators propose to perform sequencing&#xD;
      on approximately 50 patients over the course of this project. The investigators will evaluate&#xD;
      on an ongoing basis the success rate for identifying clinically actionable genetic defects in&#xD;
      the selected patients, particularly as that would inform the initial selection criteria used&#xD;
      to enroll the patient. This information will be useful to determine whether such sequencing&#xD;
      efforts can improve the outcome of NICU patients and which class of patients are most likely&#xD;
      to benefit from the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second goal will be an assessment of the effectiveness of targeted sequencing of the whole&#xD;
      exome or a panel of 5000 genes in identifying the genetic defects revealed by whole genome&#xD;
      sequencing and the relative cost in money and time of the various approaches. This could&#xD;
      yield a significantly more efficient and cost effect method over that currently described&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the investigators propose to use the data to begin to develop a cost-benefit&#xD;
      analysis of WGS in the NICU. The investigators will assess the extent to which WGS provided a&#xD;
      diagnosis distinct from that initially proposed by the neonatologists and the extent to which&#xD;
      that change in diagnosis altered the treatment regimen. If the novel diagnosis did, in fact,&#xD;
      alter treatment, The investigators would use historical data to assess the degree to which&#xD;
      that altered treatment affected the number of days the patient remained in the NICU. The&#xD;
      investigators can then estimate the cost savings/loss as the number of NICU days saved times&#xD;
      the cost per day of NICU residence versus the cost of performing the sequencing over the&#xD;
      entire cohort of sequenced patients. While this is not as rigorous as a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial, it would point to whether this is a methodology worth exploring in more depth.&#xD;
