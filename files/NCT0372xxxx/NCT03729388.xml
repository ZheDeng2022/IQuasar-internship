  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A global and integrative treatment of opioid-use disorders (OUD) with opiate maintenance&#xD;
      therapy (OMT) and psychosocial interventions is recommended by all current guidelines.&#xD;
      Treatment of OUD aim at prevents risks and consequences of opioid use (death by overdose,&#xD;
      contamination with infectious diseases, mental and physical degradation, social exclusion and&#xD;
      decrease of quality of life). OMT are approved since more than 20 years for OUD and a large&#xD;
      number of patients have been treated. Nevertheless, identification of prognosis factors&#xD;
      associated with good outcome is still limited. OMT duration, high dosages of OMT and patient&#xD;
      good consistency have been identified as good prognosis factors but other individual factors&#xD;
      could be involved and explain why OMT isn't as effective for all patients. The investigators&#xD;
      assume that social environment, other addictive behaviors, psychiatric comorbidities,&#xD;
      personality disorders and pharmacogenetics parameters might be of interest. Association&#xD;
      between phenotype/ genotype, safety of OMT and therapeutic outcome will be especially&#xD;
      assessed. For voluntary patients specific tools for risk reduction will be implemented&#xD;
      (screening of infectious diseases with blood tests and fibrosis with fibroscan). Thus, the&#xD;
      aim of TOPAZE study is to highlight prognosis factors for good outcome in the treatment of&#xD;
      OUD moderate to severe at 12 months follow-up. Three main axes will be considered: clinical,&#xD;
      pharmacological and pharmacogenetics.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All patients with moderate or severe OUD diagnosis (according to Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual Diploma in Social Medicine 5) who initiate OMT in addictionology department of Nantes&#xD;
      hospital or in addiction care and prevention centers of Nantes could be included. Data will&#xD;
      be collected during 3 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit (inclusion), clinical interview, electrocardiogram, urinary and blood&#xD;
      tests (pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics analysis) will be provided. Infectious disease&#xD;
      screening and fibroscan could be also provided as the patient wishes. Inclusion visit will&#xD;
      also correspond to initiation of OMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months follow-up (second visit) clinical interview, electrocardiogram, urinary and blood&#xD;
      tests (pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics analysis) will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months follow-up (final visit) clinical interview, electrocardiogram and urinary test&#xD;
      will be provided.&#xD;
