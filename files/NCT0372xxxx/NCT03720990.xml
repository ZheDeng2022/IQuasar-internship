  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether dietary cholic acid therapy benefits people&#xD;
      with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) by leading to an increase in serum cholesterol and&#xD;
      reduction in harmful cholesterol precursors. SLOS participants will be treated with dietary&#xD;
      cholic acid for 8 weeks and serum cholesterol and cholesterol precursor metabolites will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with SLOS have a deficiency of the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase enzyme that makes&#xD;
      cholesterol. Consequently, they exhibit deficient cholesterol levels and increased&#xD;
      cholesterol precursor lipids, which are thought to be toxic. Cholesterol itself normally&#xD;
      regulates the cholesterol synthesis pathway in the body and under conditions of low serum&#xD;
      cholesterol seen in SLOS, more of the toxic cholesterol precursors are made. Since&#xD;
      cholesterol is also necessary for production of bile acids in the liver, which help digest&#xD;
      dietary cholesterol from the intestine, it is likely that low cholesterol levels in SLOS&#xD;
      impairs bile acids from being made, which in turn prevents dietary cholesterol from being&#xD;
      absorbed properly and contributes to the cholesterol deficiency seen in SLOS. Raising serum&#xD;
      cholesterol in SLOS people by improving its absorption from the diet is expected to decrease&#xD;
      the potentially toxic cholesterol precursor lipids, and both changes would be theoretically&#xD;
      beneficial for SLOS people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine whether treatment with cholic acid (a major bile&#xD;
      acid made in the body that improves fat absorption) will increase dietary absorption of&#xD;
      cholesterol, reverse serum cholesterol deficiency, and reduce harmful cholesterol precursor&#xD;
      lipids. These changes would be favorable for SLOS people. To accomplish this objective, SLOS&#xD;
      participants will be given dietary cholic acid (brand name Cholbam, manufactured by&#xD;
      Retrophin) for 8 weeks and serum cholesterol and its precursor lipids will be measured before&#xD;
      and while taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLOS participants who are between 2 years and 25 years of age and are taking supplemental&#xD;
      dietary cholesterol for at least 3 months will be enrolled. Participants must be clinically&#xD;
      stable and able to travel to a study site. No change in supplemental dietary cholesterol&#xD;
      intake will be allowed during the study, and dietary records will be obtained throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify for cholic acid therapy, participants must have two measurements of serum&#xD;
      cholesterol ≤100 mg/dl within one month before starting cholic acid. Participants will be&#xD;
      treated with cholic acid for 8 weeks and will have blood specimens drawn at baseline (day 0),&#xD;
      4-weeks, 8-weeks and 12 weeks (4 weeks after stopping cholic acid therapy).&#xD;
