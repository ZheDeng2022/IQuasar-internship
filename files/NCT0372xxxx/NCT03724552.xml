  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 8-week open-label study is to assess the tolerability, safety, and&#xD;
      efficacy of Transcranial LED Therapy in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The&#xD;
      investigators propose to enroll up to 30 subjects of both genders ages 18-59 years with&#xD;
      intact intellectual functions who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation requires treatment sessions at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) twice&#xD;
      weekly for eight weeks, totaling 16 visits. Each session lasts approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
      During the treatment session, the subject will lie down comfortably on an exam bed. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete a series of self-report questionnaires related to their&#xD;
      symptoms and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Reduction in ASD symptoms as measured by change from baseline on the clinician-rated Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2) scale.The SRS-2 identifies social impairment associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders and quantifies its severity across the lifespan. A lower score on the SRS-2 indicates a reduction in ASD symptoms. (Minimum score=0, Maximum score= 195).</description>

    <measure>Reduction in ASD Symptoms (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in ASD symptoms as measured by change from baseline on the clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement scales. The clinician-rated CGI can make an expert clinical global judgment about the severity of the illness (ASD) across various time points within the context of that clinical experience. A higher score CGI-improvement score indicates more improvement and therefore a reduction in ASD symptoms. (Minimum score=1, Maximum score=7).</description>
