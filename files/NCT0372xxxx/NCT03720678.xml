  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/1b, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and clinical activity of&#xD;
      etrumadenant (AB928) in combination with mFOLFOX in participants with advanced metastatic&#xD;
      gastroesophageal Cancer (GEC) or colorectal cancer (CRC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the dose escalation phase, escalating doses of etrumadenant in combination with mFOLFOX at&#xD;
      standard doses will be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as well as IV infusion of&#xD;
      mFOLFOX. The recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of etrumadenant will be determined upon&#xD;
      completion of the dose-escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose expansion phase, etrumadenant at the RDE in combination with mFOLFOX at standard&#xD;
      doses may be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment&#xD;
      may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in&#xD;
      the protocol.&#xD;

          9. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small-molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to Day 1 or has not recovered (ie, ≥ Grade 1 or baseline) from AEs due to&#xD;
             a previously administered agent, except ≤ Grade 2 alopecia or ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy and&#xD;
             other AEs considered not clinically significant by the Medical Monitor and&#xD;
