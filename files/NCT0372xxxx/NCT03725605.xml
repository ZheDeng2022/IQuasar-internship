  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ATLAS-IT-04 is a two part, single arm study designed to determine the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of LTX-315 to induce T-cell infiltration prior to TIL expansion in patients&#xD;
      with soft tissue sarcoma. Following intratumoural injection of LTX-315 to a selected lesion,&#xD;
      the lesion will be extracted for T-cell culture, expansion and infusion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced/metastatic tumours who have received at least one approved standard of&#xD;
      care treatment will be recruited. All patients must have at least two lesions, one that can&#xD;
      injected with LTX-315 and another that can used to assess response. In the first part of the&#xD;
      study, LTX-315 will be administered intratumorally on 4-6 dosing days over a 2-4 week period&#xD;
      to an index lesion which will be biopsied or removed after treatment for T-cell expansion.&#xD;
      The second part will involve culturing and expanding T-cells for infusion of tumour&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) following an induction regimen. The safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the LTX-315 and TIL treatment will be assessed. Patients will be followed up for 15 months.&#xD;
