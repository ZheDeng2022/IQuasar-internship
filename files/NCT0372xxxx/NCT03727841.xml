      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ependymomas are rare tumors that arise from the ependyma. That is a tissue of the central&#xD;
      nervous system. They can develop in the brain or the spine. They are usually treated with&#xD;
      surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Researchers want to see if the new drug marizomib&#xD;
      can help people with a certain kind of ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if marizomib stops tumor growth and prlongs the time that the tumor is controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults age 18 and older who have been diagnosed with ependymomas and have already been&#xD;
      treated with standard therapies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following tests or recent results from similar tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate the heart&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of symptoms and ability to perform normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computed tomographic scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to produce an image&#xD;
           of the brain or spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tests of tumor samples. Participants may have to have new tumor samples taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drug in cycles. Each cycle is 4 weeks. Participants will have&#xD;
      up to 24 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drug through a small plastic tube in a vein on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each cycle, some screening tests will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questions about their general well-being and functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 4 5 weeks after finishing the study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit.&#xD;
      They will answer questions about their health, get a physical and a neurological exam, and&#xD;
      have blood tests. They may have an MRI or CT scan.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ependymomas are rare primary brain tumors arising from radial glial stem cells. They&#xD;
           comprise 5.2% of all pediatric primary brain tumors and 1.9% of all adult primary brain&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The standard therapy for newly diagnosed ependymoma is gross total resection followed by&#xD;
           radiation therapy. For anaplastic ependymoma, recurrence rate is high with a median&#xD;
           progression free survival (PFS) of 2.3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are limited chemotherapy options for recurrent ependymomas, which have already&#xD;
           been irradiated. Therefore, there is an unmet need to target novel pathways for&#xD;
           treatment of ependymomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  About 70% of supratentorial ependymomas have a characteristic signature C11orf95-RELA&#xD;
           fusion which drives tumorigenesis in ependymomas by activating the NF-KB transcription&#xD;
           pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Marizomib is a second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor which penetrates&#xD;
           across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). It inhibits the activity of 20S proteasome in&#xD;
           glioma cells, activates caspases, builds up reactive oxygen species and thus induces&#xD;
           apoptosis. Marizomib blocks the NF-pathway by proteasome inhibition. Thus, it may have&#xD;
           an additional targeted therapeutic effect in the RELA-fusion molecular subgroup of&#xD;
           ependymomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with marizomib in RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma and&#xD;
      non RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months&#xD;
      (PFS6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically proven intra-cranial or spinal ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic evidence of tumor progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have had prior radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy of marizomib in recurrent ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A novel 2-stage sequential design will be employed to conduct the trial for recurrent&#xD;
           ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the first stage, we will enroll 18 patients with RELA-fusion ependymoma and if 4 or&#xD;
           more patients in Cohort 1 are progression free at 6 months, we will proceed to stage 2;&#xD;
           otherwise we will terminate the trial and conclude that marizomib is not effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the second stage, we will enroll 32 patients with non RELA-fusion ependymoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be treated with marizomib in cycles consistent of 28 days until disease&#xD;
           progression or a maximum of 24 cycles.&#xD;

                  (radiosensitizer does not count) within 7 days; Avastin within 21 days. Any&#xD;
                  questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to&#xD;
                  the NCI Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 28 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of&#xD;
             the cervix), unless patient is in complete remission and off all therapy for that&#xD;
             disease for a minimum of 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to marizomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg&#xD;
             and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current active hepatic or biliary disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert s&#xD;
             syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, or stable chronic liver disease per investigator&#xD;
             assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II heart failure or greater or history of&#xD;
             hospitalization for congestive heart failure diagnosis within 12 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (e.g., repeated demonstration of a&#xD;
             QTc interval &gt;480 milliseconds (ms) (CTCAE grade 1) using Frederica s QT correction&#xD;
&#xD;
        formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of additional risk factors for TdP (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia, family&#xD;
             history of Long QT Syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of concomitant medications that prolong the QT/QTc interval&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 3 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because marizomib s potential&#xD;
             forteratogenic or abortifacient effects is unknown. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with marizomib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated&#xD;
             with marizomib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of Human&#xD;
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or active anti-viral treatment for Hepatitis A, B or C&#xD;
             infection. Anti-viral therapy, when combined with marizomib, poses a potential for&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions. Marizomib also increases immunosuppression, placing&#xD;
             patients at an increased risk of acquiring lethal infections. Appropriate studies will&#xD;
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion Criteria for Pregnancy Cohort (P)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the drug manufacturer would like to study the effect of the study therapy on&#xD;
        pregnancy, and because the required information cannot be collected unless a subject is&#xD;
        enrolled per ruling of the OGC, the following additional groups of subjects may be enrolled&#xD;
        if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -A child whose parent (male or female) is/was an active participant in the study at any&#xD;
        time during the child s gestation. Active participant is defined as having received at&#xD;
        least one dose of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An expectant mother of child whose father is/was an active participant in the study at&#xD;
             any time during the child s gestation. The father must have received at least one dose&#xD;
             of study therapy. Active participant is defined as having received at least one dose&#xD;
             of study therapy through 6 months after the last dose of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The expectant mother must be age 18 or older and must have the capacity to provide&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
