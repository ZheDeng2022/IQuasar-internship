  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will include two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase I part: safety will be assessed in consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients&#xD;
           at increasing doses of TG6002 in combination with oral flucytosine (5-FC) in patients&#xD;
           with advanced gastro-intestinal (GI) tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the phase IIa part: evaluation of efficacy and further evaluation of safety of&#xD;
           multiple administrations of TG6002 in combination with flucytosine (5-FC) in patients&#xD;
           with colorectal cancer and liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts, tumor response will be evaluated on local assessment using RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up until disease progression or death due to any cause or the&#xD;
      date of data cut-off, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
