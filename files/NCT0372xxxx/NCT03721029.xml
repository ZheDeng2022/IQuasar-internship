      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the use of intraoperative nerve monitoring&#xD;
      during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) can predict and improve post-surgery&#xD;
      urinary continence and erectile function.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, single blinded, prospective, clinical trial. The study&#xD;
      population will comprise of 100 men that will undergo either a non-nerve sparring or&#xD;
      unilateral-nerve sparring RARP. This means that the preoperative evaluation has suggested&#xD;
      that it will not be possible to preserve the cavernous parasympathetic nerves lying in the&#xD;
      fascia on either side of the prostate gland during surgery (called bilateral-nerve sparring).&#xD;
      Despite the term, non-nerve sparring surgery, the surgeon will still attempt to preserve the&#xD;
      somatic fibers of the pudendal nerve as best possible. However, due to the extent of cancer&#xD;
      tissue the surgeon will generally need to operate closer to the pudendal nerve then when&#xD;
      performing bilateral-nerve sparring surgery. So, the somatic fibers of the pudendal nerve are&#xD;
      more likely to be severed. The same is the case on one side when performing unilateral&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will consist of 50 subjects that will undergo nerve monitoring during&#xD;
      RARP. Results will be compared to a control cohort consisting of 50 patients that will&#xD;
      undergo contemporary RARP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from the usage of nerve monitoring in the intervention-group, all procedures and care&#xD;
      from admission to the hospital through discharge will be standard of care for subjects in&#xD;
      both the control and Intervention-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation and collection of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be screened for eligibility on the phone, and if eligible and they accept they&#xD;
      will be scheduled to a visit at the hospital where the following data will be registered for&#xD;
      all participants prior to surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age at time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Known co-morbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body Mass Index (BMI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partner status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Level of education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Employment Clinical status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical stage (cT-staging)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gleason score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prostate specific antigen (PSA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery participants will also have answered the questionnaires listed either prior&#xD;
      to or during the first visit and have undergone an MRI and the bulbocavernosus-reflex test:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ICIQ (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire) form about incontinence&#xD;
           symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Danish Prostate Symptom Score (DAN-PSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Erection Hardness Scale (EHS) score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence or absence of bulbocavernosus-reflex. The physician test for this by shortly&#xD;
           squeezing the penis while observing if the urethra retracts or the anal sphincter&#xD;
           contracts. The test is not painful and only takes a few seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan with measurements of the urethral length and&#xD;
           width, and prostate volume along with other specific anatomical structures in relation&#xD;
           to the urethra. Contrast agents will not be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraction of the sphincter musculature during stimulation via the nerve monitoring&#xD;
           system before removal of the prostate gland&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraction of the sphincter musculature during stimulation via the nerve monitoring&#xD;
           system after removal of the prostate gland.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non- or unilateral nerve sparring&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lymph node dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total surgical time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sphincter lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The surgeon's subjective prediction whether the patient will return to continence&#xD;
           postoperatively&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the procedure, through discharge and before follow-up regime begins, the following&#xD;
      data points will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to removal of catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leakage of the anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other adverse effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic cancer stage (pT-stage)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic Gleason score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status of surgical margins&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated 14 days after catheter removal and at standard clinical controls&#xD;
      at 3, 6 and 12 months. The following questionnaires are answered at every visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ) for incontinence,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Danish Prostate Symptom Score (DAN-PSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and Erection Hardness Scale (EHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last 3 visits subjects also answers a fluid intake/output questionnaire and hand&#xD;
      in the results of a 24-hour pad test. In addition to the questionnaires the patients will&#xD;
      also undergo an MRI and a bulbocavernosus reflex test 12 months postoperative.&#xD;

ICIQ is a self-reported survey and screening tool for incontinence. It consists of 3 questions regarding symptoms in the past 4 week, with an overall 0-21 score, where greater values indicate increased severity. Question 1 scores from 0-5, question 2 scores either 0,2,4 or 6 and question 3 scores from 0-10. Only the total score is evaluated. Furthermore there is 1 self-diagnostic question.</description>
