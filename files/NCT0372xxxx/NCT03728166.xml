  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized medical patients have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) across&#xD;
      the continuum of care, including after hospital discharge. In the APEX Trial of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with acute medical illness, extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with&#xD;
      oral betrixaban reduced the frequency of asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT),&#xD;
      symptomatic proximal or distal DVT, symptomatic nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), or&#xD;
      VTE-related death compared with short-duration enoxaparin. Obstacles to integration of these&#xD;
      data in the hospitalized Medical Service patient population, including failure to identify&#xD;
      at-risk patients, educational gaps in strategies for VTE prevention after discharge, and&#xD;
      medication nonadherence, can be overcome with alert-based computerized decision support. This&#xD;
      study is a single-center, 400-patient, randomized controlled trial of an EPIC Best Practice&#xD;
      Advisory (BPA; alert-based computerized decision support tool) to increase prescription of&#xD;
      extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis and decrease symptomatic VTE in high-risk&#xD;
      patients hospitalized with medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: To determine the impact of electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC Best Practice&#xD;
      Advisory [BPA]) on prescription of extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in&#xD;
      high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness who are not being prescribed any&#xD;
      prophylactic anticoagulation for VTE prevention after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: To estimate the impact of electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) on the&#xD;
      frequency of symptomatic VTE in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness who are&#xD;
      not being prescribed any prophylactic anticoagulation for VTE prevention after discharge.&#xD;

      Design: U.S.-based, single-center, randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Hospitalized medical patients have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism&#xD;
      (VTE) across the continuum of care (from before admission to after discharge). In the APEX&#xD;
      Trial of 7513 hospitalized patients with acute medical illness, reduced mobility, and risk&#xD;
      factors for VTE, extended-duration post-discharge thromboprophylaxis with oral betrixaban for&#xD;
      35 to 42 days reduced the frequency of asymptomatic proximal deep venous thrombosis (DVT),&#xD;
      symptomatic proximal or distal DVT, symptomatic nonfatal pulmonary embolism (PE), or&#xD;
      VTE-related death by 24% in the overall study population compared with 10-14 days of&#xD;
      enoxaparin. The integration of oral betrixaban with a computerized decision support (CDS)&#xD;
      tool has the potential to increase the appropriate prescription of extended-duration&#xD;
      post-discharge thromboprophylaxis in high-risk patients hospitalized with medical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: 400-patient U.S.-based single-center Quality Improvement Initiative in the form&#xD;
      of a randomized controlled trial focused on the feasibility of implementation of this&#xD;
      electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) (Figure 1). The allocation ratio will be 1:1 for an&#xD;
      electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) notification versus no notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients are eligible if they are ≥40 years of age, are hospitalized for&#xD;
      acute medical illness (heart failure, respiratory failure, infectious disease, rheumatic&#xD;
      disease, or ischemic stroke), have reduced mobility, and have one additional risk factor for&#xD;
      VTE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age ≥60&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prior VTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. History of cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are not prescribed thromboprophylaxis at hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: An EPIC Electronic Health Record (EHR) Best Practice Advisory (BPA) will&#xD;
      identify patients hospitalized with medical illness who are not ordered for&#xD;
      extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis 48 hours after admission. A first&#xD;
      on-screen electronic alert will provide the clinician with the opportunity to consider&#xD;
      extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis and start any required processes for&#xD;
      prior authorization or medication coverage. A second on-screen electronic alert will be&#xD;
      issued if extended-duration, post-discharge thromboprophylaxis has still not been ordered&#xD;
      that again notifies the provider about the increased risk for VTE after discharge and&#xD;
      indication for thromboprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Efficacy Outcome: Prescription of extended-duration post-discharge&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis. Investigators will review the order entry section of the Electronic&#xD;
      Health Record (EPIC) to make this determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Efficacy Outcome: Frequency of symptomatic VTE at 90 days from randomization.&#xD;
      Investigators will review the notes and diagnostic testing sections of the Electronic Health&#xD;
      Record (EPIC) to make this determination. The proposed study will not be powered to show a&#xD;
      difference in clinical events, such as symptomatic VTE, with the electronic alert-based CDS&#xD;
      but will provide estimates from which to plan a possible subsequent multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Outcome: Major bleeding (as defined by the ISTH bleeding classification&#xD;
      system) at 90 days from randomization. Investigators will review the notes and diagnostic&#xD;
      testing sections of the Electronic Health Record (EPIC) to make this determination. The&#xD;
      proposed study will not be powered to show a difference in clinical events, such as bleeding,&#xD;
      with the electronic alert-based CDS but will provide estimates from which to plan a possible&#xD;
      subsequent multi-center trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up: Follow-up will consist of Electronic Health Record review at 90 days from&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
