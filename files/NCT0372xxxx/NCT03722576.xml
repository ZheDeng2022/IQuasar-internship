    <measure>Subjects Who Experience a Positive Outcome as Measured by Combination of Serum Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) Levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects who have both an ALP reduction from baseline to week 24 that is greater or equal to 25% and their AST increase from baseline is less than or equal to 33% at week 24. ALP measured as international units per liter (IU/L). AST measured as international units per liter (IU/L).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects with abnormal (not within normal range) AST levels. AST is an enzyme found in high amounts in liver, heart, and muscle cells. This test is mainly done along with other tests such as alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin to diagnose and monitor liver disease. This test evaluates hepatocyte integrity, as serum levels of this enzyme rise in response to a variety of forms of injury to hepatic cells. The normal range is 5 to 40 U/L . Units: U/L</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects with abnormal (not within normal range) ALT levels. An enzyme normally present in liver and heart cells that is released into the bloodstream when the liver or heart is damaged. The blood ALT levels are elevated with liver damage (for example, from viral hepatitis) or with an insult to the heart (for example, from a heart attack). The normal range is 7 to 56 U/L. Units: U/L</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Total Bilirubin</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects with abnormal (not within normal range) Total Bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver. A small amount of older red blood cells are replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool. The normal range for total bilirubin is 0.3 to 1.2 mg/dL Units: mg/dL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Abnormal Direct Bilirubin</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of subjects with abnormal (not within normal range) direct bilirubin levels. In the liver, bilirubin is changed into a form that your body can get rid of. This is called conjugated bilirubin or direct bilirubin. This bilirubin travels from the liver into the small intestine. A very small amount passes into your kidneys and is excreted in your urine. Normal range for direct bilirubin is 0.3 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Units: mg/dL</description>
