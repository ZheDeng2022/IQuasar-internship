    <time_frame>THREE months</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is made up of 42 items.

The evaluation score for the first item to the 39th item is 0 to 4 points. The evaluation score for the 40th to the 42th item is 0 to 1 points. The higher score means the worse condition. This scores indicate severe symptoms.</description>
