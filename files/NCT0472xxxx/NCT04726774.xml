  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fear of falling is associated with numerous negative health outcomes in older adults and can&#xD;
      limit rehabilitation. Few treatments are effective in fear of falling. Hypnosis is now&#xD;
      recognized as an effective treatment for a variety of conditions, especially anxiety and&#xD;
      pain, which can be integrated safely with conventional medicine. Therefore, the objective was&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to examine whether hypnosis&#xD;
      reduces fear of falling in an inpatient geriatric population. In this randomized pilot trial,&#xD;
      patients hospitalized in geriatric rehabilitation wards were randomly allocated to either an&#xD;
      intervention group (hypnosis plus usual rehabilitation program) or a control group (usual&#xD;
      rehabilitation program only). Primary feasibility outcomes were recruitment rate, retention&#xD;
      rate, and adherence to the intervention. Secondary outcomes concerned the impact of hypnosis&#xD;
      in rehabilitation in fear of falling scores, functional scores, length of stay, and drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted in a 296 beds acute&#xD;
      care and rehabilitation geriatric hospital of Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent, patients were randomized to either the intervention group or the control&#xD;
      group. The randomization sequence was computer-generated (ratio 1:1) and concealed until&#xD;
      official patient enrolment. All study staff members, including physiotherapists and&#xD;
      occupational therapists, were blinded to group allocation, with the exception of the&#xD;
      hypnotherapist. All statistical analyses were performed by a blinded statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consisted of two hypnosis sessions of about 30 minutes, weekly provided, by&#xD;
      a physician trained in medical hypnosis. Each session was realized as possible during&#xD;
      walking, according to the agreement and the physical status of the participant. The&#xD;
      intervention was provided in the complement of the usual rehabilitation program. Both the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups received the usual rehabilitation program, a multifactorial&#xD;
      fall-and-fracture risk-based assessment, and management intervention, which has been shown to&#xD;
      be effective in improving physical parameters related to the risk of fall and disability&#xD;
      among high-risk oldest-old patients. This program includes intensive physiotherapy for 2&#xD;
      weeks (i.e., focused on walking and enhancing balance exercises in group or individual and&#xD;
      group) and patient education on the risk of falling and on prevention of falls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target sample size was 30 participants (15 participants in each group, pilot study). The&#xD;
      study was approved by the State of Geneva's Ethics Committee (2018-01550). All patients&#xD;
      provided written informed consent before any study-related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility of a randomized controlled trial with hypnosis in rehabilitation was assessed&#xD;
      by recruitment rate, retention rate, adherence to hypnosis, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fear of falling was assessed by different validated scales. Each scale was completed by each&#xD;
      participant three times (week 0 (at baseline): before intervention; week 1 (during&#xD;
      intervention): between the two hypnosis sessions; week 2 (at the end of the study): after all&#xD;
      interventions), with or without the help of the occupational therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were reported as mean Â± standard deviation or number (percent). The&#xD;
      hypnosis and the control groups were compared at baseline using t-tests or Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test as appropriate. Longitudinal data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      concept. Longitudinal data for fear of falling scores, Functional Independence Measure score,&#xD;
      and Short Physical Performance Battery score, were analyzed using linear mixed-effects&#xD;
      regression models, a negative binomial model for in-hospital falls, and t-tests for&#xD;
      medications and length of stay. The incidence of in-hospital falls during hospital stay was&#xD;
      analyzed using a negative binomial regression model.&#xD;
