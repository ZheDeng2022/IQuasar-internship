  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Survivors of childhood brain tumours have the poorest health-related quality of&#xD;
      life of all cancer survivors due to the multiple physical and psychological sequelae of brain&#xD;
      tumours and their treatment. Remotely delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) may&#xD;
      be a suitable and accessible psychological intervention to support young people who have&#xD;
      survived brain tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims. This study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remotely delivered ACT&#xD;
      to improve quality of life among young brain tumour survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. This study is a two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial comparing ACT&#xD;
      with waitlist control. Participants will be aged 11-24 years and survivors of brain tumours&#xD;
      who have completed cancer treatment. Participants will be randomised to receive 12 weeks of&#xD;
      ACT either immediately or after a 12-week wait. The durability of treatment effects will be&#xD;
      assessed by further follow-up assessments at 24-, 36- and 48- weeks. The DNA-v model of ACT&#xD;
      will be employed, which is a developmentally appropriate model for young people. Feasibility&#xD;
      will be assessed using the proportion of those showing interest who consent to the trial and&#xD;
      complete the intervention. A range of clinical outcome measures will also assess physical and&#xD;
      mental health, everyday functioning, quality of life and service usage. Acceptability will be&#xD;
      assessed using participant evaluations of the intervention, alongside qualitative interviews&#xD;
      and treatment diaries analysed thematically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion. This study will provide an initial assessment of the value of remotely delivered&#xD;
      ACT in supporting recovery and coping for young people after brain tumour treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a two-arm, parallel group, randomised controlled trial comparing ACT with waitlist controls who will then receive ACT after the 3-month waiting period. Participants will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive 12-weeks of treatment either immediately or following a 12-week wait. The treatment will be DNA-v which is a model of ACT adapted to those aged 11-24 years. The model will be further adapted for those who have undergone brain tumour treatment. As trial therapists will perform assessments, blinding is not possible. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 12-, 24-, 36-, and 48-weeks post-randomisation with primary end point at 12-weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an evidence-based psychological therapy that has been used to improve physical and mental health among adults with health conditions, including cancer (Graham, Gouick, Krahe, &amp; Gillanders, 2016). It fosters engagement with, rather than avoidance of, painful experiences, to move towards acceptance of unchangeable difficulties alongside building a rich and meaningful life despite the presence of ongoing problems.</description>
