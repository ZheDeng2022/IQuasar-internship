  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Fabry disease (FD), α-galactosidase A deficiency leads to the accumulation of&#xD;
      globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3 and Gb3), triggering a pathologic cascade that causes&#xD;
      progressive damage to multiple organs, including the heart. The heart is one of the organs&#xD;
      that is very sensitive to the deficiency of α-galactosidase A. There is a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with significant residual α-galactosidase activity and a phenotype with primary&#xD;
      cardiac involvement, occasionally referred as &quot;cardiac variant.&quot; The manifestations of&#xD;
      cardiac involvement in FD are left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction,&#xD;
      microvascular angina. Cardiac hypertrophy is the most common cardiac pathology and cause of&#xD;
      death in patients with FD. The elevation of the inflammatory markers strongly demonstrates&#xD;
      that chronic inflammation drives the cardiovascular pathophysiology in FD. Moreover, plasma&#xD;
      TNF, TNFR2, Il-6 specifically elevated in FD patients with cardio hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chronic inflammation in combination with elevated Lyso-Gb3 further drives the FD&#xD;
      progression even under therapy. The expression of the endothelial-cardiomyocyte growth&#xD;
      factors will change in response to chronic inflammation during the development of cardiac&#xD;
      hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical observational study designed to identify the role of inflammatory&#xD;
      signaling markers and secreted growth factors in the progression of cardiac pathology in FD&#xD;

    <textblock>
      α-Gal A catalyzes the lysosomal hydrolysis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) to&#xD;
      lactosylceramide and digalactosylceramide (Gal-Gal-Cer) to galactosylceramide (Gal-Cer). The&#xD;
      deficiency of this enzyme leads to an accumulation of Gb-3, its metabolite,&#xD;
      globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb-3), and Gal-Gal-Cer in lysosomes. The deposition of Gb-3&#xD;
      and Lyso-Gb-3 within the myocardium is affected the cardiac function with resultant&#xD;
      progressive cardiovascular pathology. Gb-3 accumulation was demonstrated in the cardiac&#xD;
      valves, cardiomyocytes, nerves, and coronary arteries. At the cellular level, Gb-3 and&#xD;
      Lyso-Gb-3 accumulation trigger a cascade of events leading to inflammation and end-stage&#xD;
      fibrosis. In the cardiac tissue, Lyso-Gb-3 deposition is associated with increased release of&#xD;
      inflammatory molecules and transforming growth factors. Endomyocardial biopsies show&#xD;
      infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages, indicating that inflammation plays a significant&#xD;
      role in cardiac damage. Overall, accumulated data suggest that chronic inflammation leads to&#xD;
      multisystemic FD pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions, including enzyme replacement&#xD;
      therapy (ERT), must be started early, before the process becomes irreversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The separation of reversible stages of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy from irreversible stages&#xD;
      (1 and 2) the major challenge is the identification of an ideal &quot;tipping point&quot; . In patients&#xD;
      with HCM, the elevation of the inflammatory markers NF-kB, TNF, Il-6, Il-2, TNFR1, MCP1&#xD;
      strongly correlates with cardiovascular pathology; however, TNF, TNFR2, and Il-6 are&#xD;
      specifically elevated in patients with cardiac hypertrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, cardiac hypertrophy corresponds to the expansion of the coronary vasculature to&#xD;
      maintain a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients. Thus, activation of coronary&#xD;
      angiogenesis and fibrosis plays a vital role in cardiac vascularization and pathological&#xD;
      hypertrophy, and tissue remodeling may cause the secretion of growth factors, VEGF, IGF-1,&#xD;
      TGFβ, and FGF2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NF-κB activation plays a subsequent role in the inflammatory response to cardiac dysfunction&#xD;
      and advanced heart failure. NF-κB and TNF signaling pathways protect the heart by ischemic&#xD;
      preconditioning; however, this protective effect depends on the concentration of TNF-α.&#xD;
      Therefore, the appropriate concentration of TNF-α is a critical factor in the determination&#xD;
      of the grade of cardio-pathology. Plasma circulated marker, prostaglandin D2 synthase&#xD;
      (PTGDS), promotes cardiomyocyte survival. Integrated data from different FD studies indicates&#xD;
      that PDGDS may be a mediator of the inflammatory process in FD. The secretion of these&#xD;
      factors into the bloodstream activates the innate immune response. Thus, the interaction&#xD;
      between the inflammatory pathways and cardiac vascularization is a bi-directional process.&#xD;
      The co-coordination of these two processes and the role of ERT in influencing immune aspects&#xD;
      of cardiac vascularization has never been explored in FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify the blood-based biomarkers for early detection of&#xD;
      cardiac involvement and identification of different stages of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      (thickening of the heart walls) in patients with Fabry disease. The markers used to assess&#xD;
      Fabry disease activity such as Gb3 and Lyso Gb3 will be measured. The investigators will&#xD;
      explore different inflammatory pathways, and secreted tissue growth factors. The&#xD;
      investigators will analyze the role of therapy, especially its timing and the activation of&#xD;
      the immune system that relates to cardiac involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to identify the role of inflammatory signaling markers and secreted&#xD;
      growth factors in the onset and progression of cardiac pathology in FD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Identify blood-based biomarkers for early detection of cardiac involvement&#xD;
      and identification of different stages of HCM pathology in patients with FD.&#xD;
