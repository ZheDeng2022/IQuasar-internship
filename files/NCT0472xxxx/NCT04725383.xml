  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 30 children and adolescents (15 per group x 2 groups) aged 6&#xD;
      to 17 years with ASD and significant repetitive behaviors that cause problems to them and to&#xD;
      others around them. Subjects will be randomized to either amitriptyline (AMI), dosed flexibly&#xD;
      according to response and tolerability with a maximum dose of 100mg per day or 1.5mg/kg/day,&#xD;
      in divided doses to minimize side effects, or placebo in look-alike capsules, for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Rating scales, and eye-tracking will be used to measure outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the screening visit, investigators will perform a full history-taking, mental status&#xD;
      examination, physical and neurological examinations, the ADI-R with a caregiver or parent to&#xD;
      confirm autism, an EKG and complete rating scales, as well as a pregnancy test (beta-HCG) in&#xD;
      sexually active females of childbearing age. Sexually active females of childbearing age must&#xD;
      be on a form of birth control during the study, such as the oral contraceptive pill,&#xD;
      intrauterine device or Depo Provera shot. A parent or guardian will sign informed consent, as&#xD;
      appropriate, and written assent will be obtained from subjects. Blood tests for CBC and diff,&#xD;
      CMP, amitriptyline level will be obtained at at baseline (except for amitriptyline) week 6&#xD;
      and 12. An eye-tracking test will be done at baseline and week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to amitriptyline (AMI) or placebo. Parents and guardians will be&#xD;
      instructed to lock up all medications, warned regarding overdose toxicity and this will be&#xD;
      documented in writing. Treatment will be low dose AMI or placebo for 12 weeks. Study visits&#xD;
      will occur at weeks 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8,10, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will complete a Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), and have the&#xD;
      accompanying adult or parent complete rating scales, at each visit, notably the Child Yale&#xD;
      Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale modified for Pervasive Developmental Disorder (CYBOCS-PDD),&#xD;
      Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability subscale (ABC-I), Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised&#xD;
      (RBS-R), ADHD-RS, adverse events form, ADI-R item 11 for phrase speech, and a concomitant&#xD;
      treatment review form, which will also detail for example any over-the-counter medications,&#xD;
      supplements or antibiotics taken. Also a gastrointestinal symptom form based on that used by&#xD;
      Valicenti-McDermott et al. 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all interim visits, the PI will perform a follow-up history taking, mental status&#xD;
      examination, vital signs, rating scales as above and study drug dispensing. Any unused&#xD;
      capsules must be returned at each visit, to monitor compliance as well as to prevent&#xD;
      accidental overdose. Parents and caregivers will agree to lock medication up, and will be&#xD;
      reminded of overdose toxicity at each study visit, with written documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flexible dosing, arranged by calling the pharmacy to randomize the subject and then dispense&#xD;
      and mail study capsules, according to the psychiatrist's instructions at each visit, to a&#xD;
      maximum dose of 100mg/day or 1.5mg/kg/day maximum by subject weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals and their parents or guardians will be questioned about suicidal ideation at each&#xD;
      visit, and instructed to call study staff if that should arise. At that time the PI will&#xD;
      arrange an urgent visit to closely assess risks of remaining in the study. In our experience&#xD;
      suicidal ideation has not occurred. Subjects may drop out at any time however, and in the&#xD;
      unlikely case, if warranted, be admitted to hospital for close observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be double- blind and placebo-controlled. All investigators except a child&#xD;
      psychiatrist co-investigator will be blinded, as will caregivers, families and subjects.&#xD;
