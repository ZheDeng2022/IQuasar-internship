  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interdialytic weight gain determines how much fluid (ultrafiltration) has to be removed&#xD;
      during each hemodialysis session. High ultrafiltration volumes stress the organism and lead&#xD;
      to a higher risk of death. Thirst is the main driving factor of interdialytic weight gain,&#xD;
      and thirst is mainly driven by salt intake, molecules that increase blood tonicity (such as&#xD;
      sugar in diabetics) and fluid loss (such as in dehydration and blood loss). It has been&#xD;
      speculated that fluid loss during hemodialysis could increase the sense of thirst immediately&#xD;
      following dialysis, but this statement requires further evidence.&#xD;

      Overview: In this observational study, we will have a sample of approximately 20 patients on&#xD;
      chronic thrice weekly HD self-monitor their weight gain and blood pressure during the&#xD;
      interdialytic intervals for one week. Demographics, anthropometrics, HD prescription and&#xD;
      treatment information will be recorded. Study participants will complete four questionnaires&#xD;
      at the first study visit and will then be provided medical grade scales and a blood pressure&#xD;
      monitor, and will be asked to prospectively record weight changes and blood pressure at home&#xD;
      four times a day for one week using a logbook.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with significant residual urinary volume and diabetes mellitus will not be&#xD;
      recruited, the latter to remove the bias of blood glucose in determining osmotic thirst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Body Weight Monitoring Study participants will be asked to perform daily home body&#xD;
      weight monitoring for the duration of the whole study with medical grade scales. Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to monitor their body weight four times per day: upon waking up,&#xD;
      between 12:00 and 2:00 pm, between 6:00 and 8:00 pm and at bedtime. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear similar clothing for all measurements. Monitoring will start after the first HD&#xD;
      session of the week until the first HD session of the following week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Blood Pressure Monitoring Study participants will be asked to perform daily home blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring for the duration of the whole study with a validated, automated device.&#xD;
      Participants with an arteriovenous fistula or graft will be asked to measure blood pressure&#xD;
      on the arm without the arteriovenous fistula or graft. Study participants will be asked to&#xD;
      monitor blood pressure four times per day, concomitantly with their body weight. Study&#xD;
      participants will be asked to record three consecutive blood pressure measurements in a&#xD;
      sitting position, after 5 minutes of rest in a quiet room. Monitoring will start after the&#xD;
      first HD session of the week until the first HD session of the following week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Reminders Study participants will be given the option to receive a daily reminder phone&#xD;
      call for the duration of the whole study, to encourage compliance to the self-monitoring&#xD;
      procedures and to encourage reproducibility (e.g. by wearing similar clothing at each&#xD;
      measurement) to weighing procedures. The phone calls will be made from an in-hospital office&#xD;
      phone by either the research coordinators or the Ph.D. student attached to this study,&#xD;
      following a script. Participants can decline the option of receiving daily reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scored Sodium Questionnaire Dietary sodium intake will be estimated with the Scored Sodium&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SSQ)12 on the first study visit, a 10-item food frequency questionnaire to&#xD;
      screen for high sodium intake in CKD. A cut-off value of 65 will be used to identify patients&#xD;
      with high sodium intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dialysis Thirst Inventory The Dialysis Thirst Inventory (DTI) is a questionnaire developed by&#xD;
      Bots et al.13 It is a seven items questionnaire that quantifies the perception of thirst.&#xD;
      Each item has a five-point Likert type scale (never = 1, to very often = 5). The scores are&#xD;
      summed and provide a DTI score ranging from 7 (no thirst) to 35 (very thirsty). The items are&#xD;
      the following: (1) Thirst is a problem for me. (2) I am thirsty during the day. (3) I am&#xD;
      thirsty during the night. (4) My social life is influenced because of my thirst feelings; (5)&#xD;
      I'm thirsty before dialysis. (6) I am thirsty during dialysis. (7) I am thirsty after&#xD;
      dialysis. This questionnaire will be administered on the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Xerostomia Inventory The validated Xerostomia Inventory (XI) consists of 11 items, each with&#xD;
      a five-point Likert type scale (never=1, to very often=5) to evaluate xerostomia, that is a&#xD;
      feeling of dry mouth.14 Examples of items from the XI are &quot;My mouth feels dry...&quot;, &quot;I have&#xD;
      difficulty in eating dry foods...&quot; and &quot;I sip liquids to aid in swallowing food.&quot; The&#xD;
      responses to the 11 items result in an individual XI score for each participant that can&#xD;
      range from 11 (no dry mouth) to 55 (extremely dry mouth). This questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered on the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minutes to Recovery after HD This is a clinically validated, simple question, as published by&#xD;
      Lindsay et al.15 The question is: &quot;How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis&#xD;
      session?&quot;, to which participants are free to respond by providing exact times to approximate&#xD;
      estimates such as &quot;half a day&quot;. The final answer will be converted to minutes for analysis&#xD;
      purposes. Responses to this question were reported to be highly reproducible over time and&#xD;
      correlated with several quality of life questionnaires, mainly pointing towards physical&#xD;
      wellbeing rather than mental health. Furthermore, this measure was sensitive enough to show&#xD;
      differences in recovery time between different HD prescriptions (standard vs daily vs&#xD;
      nocturnal HD). This question will be administered on the first study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collection When applicable, participants will be asked to collect and record their&#xD;
      urine volume on the last day of the long interdialytic interval (Sunday for&#xD;
      Monday-Wednesday-Friday patients, Monday for Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday patients).&#xD;
      Participants will be provided a disposable urine collection container for this purpose. After&#xD;
      completing the collection and recording the total urine volume, the participants will dispose&#xD;
      of the urine themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications Throughout the study, all participants will continue to take all&#xD;
      medications as prescribed by their clinical care team and will follow any changes to their&#xD;
      medication as seen fit.&#xD;
