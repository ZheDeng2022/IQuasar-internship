      INTRODUCTION Anal Incontinence (AI) is a loose of voluntary control for bowel movements, with&#xD;
      recurrent leaking of flatus, liquid or solid stools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI is a frecuent pathology. Prevalence is similar among men and women. AI´s ethiology is&#xD;
      quite variable. Nevertheless, the most frecuent one is sphinteric injuries, obstetric,&#xD;
      traumatic or secondary to anal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conservative measures have to be iniciated and they are essential for every patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a sphincteric injury exists, several choices of surgical treatment exist. The long term&#xD;
      results obtained with sphincteroplasty, with a uniform surgical technique, follow up and&#xD;
      complementing with other therapeutic options, has been considered interesting to analyze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS Sphincteroplasty with the adoption of the appropriate complementary treatments,&#xD;
      provides satisfactory results in the very long term, and should be considered as the&#xD;
      procedure of choice in patients with Anal Incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze the very long term results obtained with Sphincteroplasty as surgical technique&#xD;
           for treatment of severe anal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the results of the different types of surgical repair performed, according to&#xD;
           the CCIS Score (Wexner Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the importance of patient follow-up and incorporation of complementary&#xD;
           treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish patient´s satisfaction with the procedure after a long term follow up period&#xD;
           after the intervention.&#xD;

      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENTS AND METHOD A retrospective Cohort study was designed, based on a prospectively&#xD;
      maintained database, including every consecutive patient operated on severe AI secondary to&#xD;
      sphincteric injury with sphincterolplasty, between January 1985 and December 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every operations were performed by the same surgeon in two centers, Hospital Clinico San&#xD;
      Carlos and Santa Elena Clinic, both in Madrid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA Every patients, without limitation of gender or age, with any kind of&#xD;
      sphincteric lesion susceptible of surgical repair, presenting with AI and severe impairment&#xD;
      in quality of life, after following a conservative treatment and unsatisfactory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA There are not exclusion criteria except non-fitting inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDEPENDENT VARIABLES EVALUATED The independent variables considered for the analysis are&#xD;
      age, gender, etiologic factors, impact on daily life measured with the Wexner et al Score&#xD;
      (CCIS), diagnostic tests used, type of surgical intervention performed, obtained results and&#xD;
      long term satisfaction reached with the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A.- PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Exhaustive anamnesis to determine the severity of AI using the Wexner Score (CCIS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Anal and perineal exploration to determine the extension of sphincteric lesion and&#xD;
           exclude other possible pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Complementary tests, mainly ano-rectal Manometry and Endo-Anal Ultrasound. Other tests&#xD;
           chosen selectively in certain cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B.- OPERATIVE DETAILS All patients underwent antegrade mechanic colon cleansing and&#xD;
      antibiotic and thromboembolic prophylaxis. Under general or spinal anesthesia the patient is&#xD;
      fixed in lithotomy position, the rectum is irrigated and a meticulous cleansing of the vagina&#xD;
      is done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin incision of a sufficient size is done to facilitate the appropriate dissection and&#xD;
      freedom of the sphincter endings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it was a &quot;clear&quot; lesion of the external Sphincter, a tensión-free overlapping with&#xD;
      absorbable 2/0 material is performed. If accompanying internal anal sphincter lesion was&#xD;
      found, a suturing or plication of the anterior rectal wall, including internal anal sphincter&#xD;
      fibres was done. Finally, when a levatorplasty is also going to be associated, the whole&#xD;
      procedure includes the plication of the internal anal sphincter, levatorplasty by the midline&#xD;
      plication of the pubo-rectalis muscle with two or three stitches and, at the end, the&#xD;
      external anal sphincter overlapping sphincteroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When any other ano-rectal disorder was also identified it was simultaneously repaired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.- POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW-UP All the patients are exhaustively followed in the clinic for&#xD;
      postoperative sphincteric function assesing and individualized counseling depending on their&#xD;
      progress, varying from dietetic and farmacological advice, biofeedback prescription, or even&#xD;
      the indication of further surgical treatments when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was stablished a follow-up visit every six months during the first three postopeative&#xD;
      years, and then anual visits until the fifth postoperative year. From this point every year a&#xD;
      in-person or telephone control was kept, selected by each patient based on personal&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an improvable sphincter anal function is detected during follow up, although no heavily&#xD;
      impacting on quality of life, prescription of biofeedback therapy was done. If a more&#xD;
      significative impact was determined, biofeedback during the first years and posterior tibial&#xD;
      nerve stimulation (PTNS) or SNS the last years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the different options prescription was based on an individualized evaluation of&#xD;
      quality of life, advantages, disadvantages and always centered in benefiting the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D.- PERSONAL INTERVIEW / DEFINITE EVALUATION: LAST FOLLOW-UP For the completion of this&#xD;
      study, it was decided to carry out simple assessments based on easy to answer questions that&#xD;
      reflected as accurately as possible the situation of each patient, discarding for this reason&#xD;
      the use of any of the quality of life scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar parameters to those used in other studies have been used, both through direct or&#xD;
      telephone interview conducted from September through November 2015. A total of 105 patients&#xD;
      who had undergone surgery in the past were interviewed and this was considered as &quot;the last&#xD;
      control&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout this interview the following infomation was recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - CCIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Questions focusing in determine level of satisfaction:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. - Browning-Parks´ Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. - Clinic Score.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. - Visual Analogic Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. - Subjective Situation after Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. - Would you take the operation again?&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. - Would you recomend the operation to any friendo r relative?&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHOD Statistical Analysis Qualitative variables are presented by their&#xD;
      frecuency distribution. Quantitative variables are summarized in their mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) in cases of asymmetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variation of quantitative variables was studied with the T of Student test for paired data&#xD;
      and analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA), correcting significance level with&#xD;
      Bonferroni´s test. Mean absolute effects and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were&#xD;
      estimated. We adjusted covariance models to evaluate the variables related to the final&#xD;
      Wexner score adjusted for the initial values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, the distribution of the variable was checked against the theoretical models and&#xD;
      the variance homogeneity hypothesis was contrasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In every hypothesis contrasts, the null hypothesis was rejected with a type I error or an α&#xD;
      error less than 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical package used for the analysis was SPSS for Windows version 20.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
