      The trial aims to investigate the use of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles as&#xD;
      a tracer for delayed sentinel lymph node dissection (d-SLND) in patients where upfront&#xD;
      axillary surgery (SLND) is oncologically deemed unnecessary and should be avoided. This&#xD;
      includes but is not limited to patients with a preoperative diagnosis of ductal cancer in&#xD;
      situ of the breast (DCIS), an unclear BIRADS 4-5 planned for diagnostic excision or women&#xD;
      planned for risk reducing mastectomy. SPIO is injected in the primary operation, and should&#xD;
      final specimen pathology demonstrate invasive breast cancer, only then is an operation in the&#xD;
      axilla (d-SLND) performed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SentiNot 2.0 protocol aims to elucidate the effectivity and accuracy of the delayed&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node dissection concept (dSLND) when upfront SLND is considered unnecessary,&#xD;
      such as in the setting of a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, in cases of unclear BIRADS 4 or 5&#xD;
      lesions that are planned for diagnostic excisional biopsy or in selected cases of risk&#xD;
      reducing mastectomy. Acknowledging the large variance of practice in this setting, the study&#xD;
      aims to address pragmatism to allow for inclusion. For this reason, the trial is designed&#xD;
      separately and independently for mastectomy and breast conserving surgery, so that&#xD;
      participating sites can recruit as fitting in their practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients included in the SentiNot 2.0 trial, SPIO (MagTrace,2.0 ml) is injected up to 24&#xD;
      hours preoperatively or perioperatively during primary breast surgery on patients with a&#xD;
      preoperative diagnosis of DCIS (or suspicious lesions with no clear diagnosis of invasive&#xD;
      cancer but, considered for SLND). The SPIO is injected close to the lesion. If injected less&#xD;
      than 24 hours before the operation, a 5 minute massage should be performed. Planned breast&#xD;
      surgery is performed. The transcutaneous magnetic counts by SentiMag in the axilla is&#xD;
      measured at the end of the breast procedure, so as to allow for confirmation that SLND may be&#xD;
      identified. Thus,the SLN is consequently marked with SPIO, but not excised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this manner, women that have pure DCIS on final histopathological examination have avoided&#xD;
      unnecessary upfront SLND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is underlying invasive breast cancer on final histopathological examination, SLND&#xD;
      will be performed at a second operation (d-SLND). A preoperative injection of radioisotope&#xD;
      (RI) RI will be added to maximize the chance to detect the SLN. SLND will start with a&#xD;
      registration of the magnetic and isotope signal in the axilla, and the incision will be&#xD;
      placed in relation to the signal. In patients that have undergone mastectomy, tracers are to&#xD;
      be injected intracutaneously in the lateral part of the mastectomy scar. The routine use of&#xD;
      blue dye (BD) is strongly advised, but is not compulsory. However, if no transcutaneous&#xD;
      signal for SPIO and RI is measured in the axilla pre-incision, an injection of BD according&#xD;
      local routines will be administered. Subsequently, SLND will be performed. Patients with&#xD;
      upgrade to invasive cancer will undergo SLND, but will be randomized with an allocation ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1 to SentiMag first or Radioactive probe first. This will mandate the &quot;principal&#xD;
      modality&quot; to perform SLND. Every step of the procedure will be controlled; if the principal&#xD;
      modality fails, then the surgeon will use the &quot;secondary&quot;. If the principal modality&#xD;
      succeeds, the secondary will be registered and documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure will be divided to the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transcutaneous axillary signal detection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subcutaneous axillary detection, after the incision has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In situ SLN identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SLN retrieval ex vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residual axillary signal (&quot;Background counts&quot;). If a SLND is successfully completed with&#xD;
           the primary modality and no residual axillary signal is detected, before completing the&#xD;
           procedure, the secondary modality will be undertaken to allow for the detection of&#xD;
           &quot;discordance&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle modalities maybe either RI or SPIO. If BD is used, dyed lymphatics should be&#xD;
      ignored until failure with both modalities has been reached. The success of each modality,&#xD;
      principal and secondary, will be controlled per step. If the surgeon documents principle&#xD;
      modality failure for a given step, this is to be documented. The intention-to-treat principle&#xD;
      will apply, but if there is failure of the modality randomized as principle, then the&#xD;
      per-protocol-analysis principle will apply. All SLNs (magnetic, brown, radioactive, blue)&#xD;
      will be removed. Palpable nodes may be removed according to surgeon discretion, but should be&#xD;
      reported as such. Total technique failure has to be discussed with the patient in advance,&#xD;
      and a plan with patient consent consisting of no-surgery, sampling, axillary dissection or&#xD;
      treatment according to intraoperative decision has to be available. If no SLN is found, the&#xD;
      procedure performed (axillary clearance, sampling. etc) should be discussed in advance with&#xD;
      the patient. The SLN may be sent for frozen section in order to avoid a third operation, if&#xD;
      SLN metastases are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care patients (SLND performed upfront for diagnoses included in the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria or patients going to l-SLND without SPIO) may also be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      prospectively as a control arm.Additionally, patient preference will be tolerated and results&#xD;
      will be reported for study secondary and other pre-specified endpoints. Patients in the&#xD;
      control group has to be informed that their un-identified data will be used as a comparison&#xD;
      and, an oral consent has to be given before surgery regardless whether SLND is planned or&#xD;
      not. This will allow for controlled real world data from a prospective control arm in fashion&#xD;
      of a cohort.&#xD;

Transcutaneous signal&#xD;
Incision in the axilla (skin, subcutaneous fat and fascia) and &quot;In situ&quot; signal&#xD;
SLN identification &quot;in situ&quot;&#xD;
SLN excision and signal &quot;ex vivo&quot;&#xD;
Background axillary counts. For step &quot;d&quot; the radioactive counts are registered for each SLN that has been excised.
