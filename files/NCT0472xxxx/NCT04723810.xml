  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study in patients presenting with any solid tumor and/or diseased tissue&#xD;
      even benign nodules presumed to be resectable and at risk for recurrence on pre-operative&#xD;
      assessment who are considered to be good surgical candidates to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the image-guided surgery using indocyanine green for intramolecular imaging of&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
