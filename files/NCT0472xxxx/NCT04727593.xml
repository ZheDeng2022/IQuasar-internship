  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR),&#xD;
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR), have&#xD;
      been showing promising results in different health-related and psychosocial outcomes in the&#xD;
      context of cancer. More recently, the possibility of delivering MBIs using technological&#xD;
      tools and resources, such as internet and applications, has been receiving much attention,&#xD;
      also accompanied by promising findings. However, few randomized controlled studies have been&#xD;
      conducted and published to date. Moreover, few studies have addressed the long-term stability&#xD;
      and trajectory of gains across time. Also, even though prior evidence had suggested that&#xD;
      face-to-face MBIs might modulate several biological markers (e.g., pro-inflammatory gene&#xD;
      expression and inflammatory signaling; telomere length), as far as we know, no previous study&#xD;
      addressed the impact of online MBIs on biological indices, especially on extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles (EVs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of an internet-based MBCT&#xD;
      intervention (vs. Treatment as Usual - TAU) on EVs (objective measure), as well as on&#xD;
      psychological distress (subjective measure), considering a sample of distressed people with&#xD;
      history of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objective, this study aims to investigate the effects of this same intervention&#xD;
      on psychosocial outcomes, including quality of life, fear of cancer recurrence, emotion&#xD;
      suppression, mindfulness, sleep quality, posttraumatic growth, health-related behaviours&#xD;
      (physical activity; smoking habits), and perceived social support. The biological secondary&#xD;
      outcomes studied will be: inflammatory response genes interleukins (ILs, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8,&#xD;
      IL-10), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and c-reactive protein (CRP);&#xD;
      telomerase activity; antigens related to cancer (cancer antigen - CA 15-3; prostate-specific&#xD;
      antigen - PSA; carcinoembryonic antigen - CEA); other health-related markers&#xD;
      (adrenocorticotropic hormone - ACTH; erythrocytes number; hemoglobin glycosylated).&#xD;

    <masking_description>At baseline, everyone (participants, study coordinator, mindfulness instructor(s), research assistant, and statistician) will be blinded to conditions as it is expected to occur before randomization. Once participants are randomized, the study coordinator will inform them of the group assignments, and all of them will become unblinded to the conditions. Due to the specificities of this type of study and intervention, it is not possible to guarantee the blinding of personnel and participants.</masking_description>

    <description>Measured with Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 - DASS-21, a self-report and public domain questionnaire that evaluates negative affective states. It is composed of 21 items, 7 focused on depression, 7 on anxiety, and 7 on stress. Each item is rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale, wherein in 0 represents &quot;did not apply to me at all&quot; and 3 represents &quot;applied to me very much or most of the time&quot;. The score for each subscale ranges between 0 and 21. In the current study, a total score will be computed by summing all items, with higher scores being indicative of higher self-reported psychological distress.</description>

    <description>Experimental group: MBCT is program developed by Zindel Segal, Mark Williams, and John Teasdale , based on Jon Kabat-Zinn's Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. Participants learn to acknowledge their unhelpful thoughts and feelings, allowing the mind to move from an automatic and spiraling thought pattern to a more conscious emotional processing. Mindfulness practices include breath awareness, sitting and walking meditations, and mindful yoga. In this study, the following MBCT structure will be followed: group setting of 12 participants (maximum); 8 online weekly meetings of 2 hours via a videoconference platform (e.g., Cisco Webex), each one mediated by a trained mindfulness instructor(s); daily home practice of the learned skills; 2 hours of retreat after the fifth week; 6 months of home practice; 4 monthly consolidation sessions of 90 minutes each.</description>
