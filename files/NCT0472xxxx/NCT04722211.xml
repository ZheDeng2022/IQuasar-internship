    <textblock>
      This RCT study is designed to examine the extent to which L. plantarum PS128 can improve&#xD;
      symptoms in PD patients. L. plantarum PS128 is a psychobiotic that regulates the level of&#xD;
      dopamine in specific brain regions. Patients with PD will receive PS128 or placebo&#xD;
      intervention for 12 weeks. Symptoms of PD will be clinically evaluated before and after the&#xD;
      treatment, and the results will be compared.&#xD;

    <description>The Chinese Version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index is a self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1-month time interval. The measure consists of 19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5-10 minutes to complete.The maximum total score is 21. A higher score reflects more poor sleep quality.</description>

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a line, 10 cm in length. Individuals point to or mark a spot on the line where they feel indicates their current their emotion, fatigue level and sleep quality. The score of emotion level is from 0cm (very nervous) to 10 cm (very relaxing). The score of fatigue level is from 0 cm (very energetic) to 10 cm (very sleepy). The score of sleep quality is from 0 cm (poor) to 10 cm (sleep well). The maximum total score is 100% (equal 10cm).</description>
