  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The beneficial effects of regular exercise on both physical and mental health are widely&#xD;
      known; it is a pivotal component in the treatment and prevention of many metabolic disorders,&#xD;
      including obesity. Exercise facilitates weight management, not only by increasing energy&#xD;
      expenditure but through its effect on appetite regulation and, therefore, energy intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors influence the effect of exercise on appetite regulation including body fat ,&#xD;
      gender, intensity and duration of exercise and levels of habitual physical activity .&#xD;
      However, recently interest has grown around the impact time-of-day of exercise may have on&#xD;
      appetite regulation . Subjective feelings of hunger follow a strong diurnal pattern, with&#xD;
      feelings of hunger peaking in the evening and appearing lowest in the morning . Evening&#xD;
      energy intake has been associated with increased total energy intake and body mass index&#xD;
      Evening exercise could potentially counteract or lessen the evening hunger sensations and&#xD;
      therefore reduce evening and total energy intake. The aim of this study is to investigate any&#xD;
      changes in total energy intake, distribution of energy intake, and food preference on the day&#xD;
      of and 24 -hours after a bout of moderate-intensity exercise completed in the morning or&#xD;
      evening in a group of physically inactive adults. A total sample of 12 physically inactive&#xD;
      adults aged 18-60 will be recruited on to the study. The study will take the form of a&#xD;
      two-armed randomised controlled crossover trial consisting of two 48-hr overnight stays in&#xD;
      the Human Intervention Studies Unit (HISU) at Ulster University, Coleraine, Northern Ireland.&#xD;
      The participant information sheet will focus on the effect of morning and evening exercise on&#xD;
      ambulatory blood pressure and exercise-induced feeling states to prevent the participants'&#xD;
      knowledge of the true purpose of the study from influencing their feeding behaviours.&#xD;
      Ambulatory blood pressure will be monitored for at least 24 hours after the exercise session&#xD;
      and participants will be asked to complete questionnaires of exercise induced feeling states&#xD;
      immediately before and after each exercise session. Participants will be briefed on the true&#xD;
      purpose of the study following the study completion. During the visits, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to perform 1 hour of exercise at 70% of their maximal heart rate on a motorised&#xD;
      treadmill between either 0800-1000 or 1800-2000 on the first full day of the study&#xD;
      appointment. Food will be provided ad libitum for the duration of the study. All food intake&#xD;
      will be noted and covertly weighed and directly observed through security cameras in the HISU&#xD;
      dining room and lounge areas to measure food-related behaviours, such as grazing or bingeing.&#xD;
      A 24 hour dietary recall will be conducted at the end of each study appointment to validate&#xD;
      recall against observed intake.&#xD;
