      Placenta praevia is associated with an increased risk of preterm delivery (PTD) especially if&#xD;
      associated with bleeding and uterine contractions .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will determine the effect of Progesterone in preventing a second attack of&#xD;
      antepartum haemorrhage in pregnant women diagnosed with placenta previa&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta previa is a problem of pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of&#xD;
      the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of placenta previa has been recently estimated to be approximately 0.5% of all&#xD;
      pregnancies, and this increase correlates to the elevated cesarean section rate .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placenta previa is a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality because of the&#xD;
      associated massive antepartum and intrapartum hemorrhage .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, placenta previa is associated with preterm delivery, with the neonatal mortality&#xD;
      increasing threefold as a result of prematurity. Although placenta previa is associated with&#xD;
      antepartum hemorrhage, massive hemorrhage necessitating preterm cesarean section is not&#xD;
      observed in all women with the condition .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term placenta praevia should be used when the placenta lies directly over the internal&#xD;
      os. For pregnancies at more than 16 weeks of gestation the term low-lying placenta should be&#xD;
      used when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os on transabdominal or&#xD;
      transvaginal scanning (TVS) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the placenta is thought to be low lying (less than 20 mm from the internal os) or praevia&#xD;
      (covering the os) at the routine fetal anomaly scan, a follow-up ultrasound examination&#xD;
      including a TVS is recommended at 32 weeks of gestation to diagnose persistent low-lying&#xD;
      placenta and/or placenta praevia The ability to predict severe antepartum hemorrhage and&#xD;
      emergency cesarean section is critical in the management of placenta previa To date, no&#xD;
      consensus exists on the preterm delivery risk of different types and locations of placenta&#xD;
      previa (Fan et al., 2017). Only a few reports have focused on the maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes of different types of placenta previa .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the effect of anterior/posterior placental position on preterm delivery is&#xD;
      unknown, although increased perinatal risks, including placenta previa, excessive&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, hysterectomy, and neonatal anemia, have been reported to be&#xD;
      associated with anterior placenta previa .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptomatic placenta previa are being treated with tocolytic agents. The progesterone is&#xD;
      necessary for the preservation of pregnancy and aids in the extension of pregnancy The&#xD;
      progesterone, also known as pregn-4-ene-3, 20-dione is an endogenous steroid and involved in&#xD;
      the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans . It is included in a steroid&#xD;
      hormone group known as progestogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progesterone is also a key metabolic intermediate in the making of other endogenous&#xD;
      steroids such as the sex hormones and the corticosteroids . They show a vital part in brain&#xD;
      function as a neurosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of the rate of long-term morbidity requires delayed delivery which facilitates the&#xD;
      maturity of vital organs. Though the thorough mechanism of action is not known but proposed&#xD;
      mechanisms were: (a) It acts principally through creating uterine inertness and upholds&#xD;
      cervical length. It has immunosuppressive activity and stops consequence of oxytocin on&#xD;
      myometrium. (b) It is a powerful inhibitor of gap junctions between myometrial cells. (c)&#xD;
      Local fluctuations in progesterone or estrogen or progesterone ratio. (d) Suppression of&#xD;
      calcium-calmodulinmyosin light chain kinase system, decreasing calcium flux and shifting the&#xD;
      resting potential of smooth muscle are the root of progesterone action&#xD;
&#xD;
      72. AIM/ OBJECTIVES This study aims to determine the effect of vaginal progesterone in&#xD;
      preventing a second attack of antepartum haemorrhage in pregnant women diagnosed with&#xD;
      placenta previa.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Does vaginal progesterone prevent a second attack of antepartum haemorrhage in pregnant women&#xD;
      diagnosed with placenta previa?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal progesterone prevents the second attack of antepartum haemorrhage in pregnant women&#xD;
      diagnosed with placenta previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. METHODOLOGY: Patients and Methods/ Subjects and Methods/ Material and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of Study:double blinded randomised controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Setting: Ain Shams university, Maternity hospital, Faculty of medicine-Ain Shams&#xD;
           university.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period: January 2021-july 2021 or until completing the required cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women diagnosed with placenta praevia. • Ethical considerations: The study will be&#xD;
      approved from the Ethical Committee of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty&#xD;
      of Medicine, Ain Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed written consents will be taken from all women before recruitment in the study, and&#xD;
      after extensive explanation and clear discussion of risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted on female patients at Ain Shams maternity hospital. The&#xD;
      participants included in the study will meet the following included and excluded criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Selection criteria for cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women diagnosed as placenta previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women aged 20-40 years, who were pregnant in a single foetus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age ranging between 24 and 34 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient had attack of Antepartum Haemorrhage or history of Antepartum Haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of previous PTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyhydramnios&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe attack of bleeding requiring an immediate intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intrauterine foetal death&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sampling method: Convenience sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sample Size: Using PASS 11 program for sample size calculation, confidence level&#xD;
                90%, margin error +/- 0.1, and by reviewing previous studies (Singh and Jain,&#xD;
                2015), showed the rates of recurrent bleeding among patients taking progesterone&#xD;
                versus patients taking placebo were (77.5%vs 87.5% respectively); based on that,&#xD;
                the required sample size will be 80 patients in each group to be sufficient to&#xD;
                detect the difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients and Methods (Methodology):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I, vaginal Progesterone (Vaginal progesterone &quot;prontogest 400 MG&quot;) Once Daily&#xD;
           starting from 24 to 34 weeks of gestation or rectal progesterone if the patient fears of&#xD;
           taking vaginal or still have bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II, included placenta praevia patients receiving a placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be conducted using a computer-generated table of random numbers with&#xD;
      allocation concealment. Once allocation has been done, it will not be changed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women with placenta previa who have attack of antepartum haemorrhage or history or attack&#xD;
      will be admitted in the hospital and kept under observation for 48 hours, and will be&#xD;
      encouraged to go home and continue follow up at our outpatient Obstetric Clinic every 1-2&#xD;
      weeks (according to patients' compliance).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All placenta praevia women with severe attack of antepartum haemorrhage will be encouraged to&#xD;
      remain in hospital until bleeding stops or up to delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They will receive prophylactic corticosteroids. Parenteral iron supplementation will be&#xD;
      needed for optimal correction of anaemia in both groups (mean haemoglobin [Hb] level was 9&#xD;
      g/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During follow-up visits, women will carefully be asked about abdominal pain, number and&#xD;
      amount of vaginal bleeding attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unscheduled ultrasound examinations ± cardiotocography (CTG) will be done for foetal-maternal&#xD;
      indications as a heavy attack of bleeding, decreased foetal movement, suspected preterm&#xD;
      premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) or PTL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with features suggestive of placenta previa spectrum will carefully be examined and&#xD;
      followed by an expert sonographer using 2D grey scale imaging and colour Doppler imaging,&#xD;
      according to the guidelines of the European Working Group on Abnormally Invasive Placenta&#xD;
      used for the prenatal diagnosis of placenta previa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      you follow the Royal College of Obstetricians' and Gynaecologists' guidelines as regards the&#xD;
      time of elective delivery in placenta praevia women, so patients were delivered when&#xD;
      completed 37 weeks of gestation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hospital protocol for placenta praevia delivery recommends delivery at 37-38 weeks&#xD;
      because of limited neonatal services in our country or earlier if the women developed another&#xD;
      severe attack of antepartum haemorrhage, developed contractions.&#xD;
