    <description>Participants will receive a brief standardized psychoeducation module, presented via a video recording.&#xD;
Participants will then complete up to 10 analogue teleconferencing calls, each lasting a maximum of two minutes.&#xD;
Between speeches participants will have a 1-minute break.&#xD;
Participants will complete the subjective units of distress scale (SUDS) before and after each speech trial.&#xD;
The experimental attention guidance condition: (1) the intervention rationale will include information about the importance of visually attending to the faces of the audience; (2) participants will be given target audience members to focus their gaze on during the their impromptu response. They will be told that they should look at and focus on the target audience member for the whole response.</description>
