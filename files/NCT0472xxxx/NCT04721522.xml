    <textblock>
      Implantation is a complex process which requires coordination and interaction between a&#xD;
      blastocyst and the endometrium. Impaired embryo quality or impaired endometrial receptivity&#xD;
      may negatively affect this interaction that in turn results in implantation failure.&#xD;
      Successful implantation entails a process of strict synchronization of endometrial and&#xD;
      blastocyst development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advancements made since the introduction of assisted reproductive technology (ART),&#xD;
      fewer than 40% of ART treatment cycles result in a live birth. Endometrial receptivity&#xD;
      remains a crucial rate-limiting step affecting the success of ART treatment. Embryos are&#xD;
      thought to be responsible for one-third of implantation failures, whereas the remaining&#xD;
      two-thirds result from sub-optimal endometrial receptivity or abnormal embryo-endometrium&#xD;
      dialogue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 main methods used to assess endometrial receptivity: endometrial biopsy, hormone&#xD;
      profile, and ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound has been established as an appreciated, simple,&#xD;
      and non-invasive technique in evaluation of endometrial preparation before embryo transfer in&#xD;
      IVF cycles. Several sonographic parameters have been assessed that include endometrial&#xD;
      thickness (Ent), endometrial pattern (EnP) and sub-endometrial blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrial thickness (EMT) is the most widely used prognostic factor for endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity during ART. Both clinical pregnancy and live birth rates decreased significantly&#xD;
      for each millimeter below 8 mm in fresh IVF-ET cycles and below 7 mm frozen ET cycles.&#xD;
      Regarding endometrial patterns and vascularization, data are still contradictory. Increased&#xD;
      contractility frequency before embryo transfer was inversely related to the clinical&#xD;
      pregnancy in fresh and frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is an emphasis on a new endometrial parameter called endometrial compaction,&#xD;
      which is the decrease in endometrial thickness on the day of ET. In a Study of 274 frozen&#xD;
      embryo transfer cycles, patients whose endometrium compacted had a significantly higher&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancy rate than patients whose endometrium became thicker or did not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, a large-scale cohort study revealed that an increased endometrium&#xD;
      thickness after progesterone administration in FET was associated with better pregnancy&#xD;
      outcome. The role of endometrial compaction in fresh ART cycles is not yet studied. So, it's&#xD;
      better to test its effect on fresh cycles ART outcome.&#xD;
