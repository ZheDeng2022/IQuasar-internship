  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to establish an innovative model of a comprehensive precision&#xD;
      oncology platform to help individualizing drug therapy for patients with advanced cancers at&#xD;
      The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The other objectives include to optimize the genomic&#xD;
      matching and access of patients with unique cancer subtypes to the relevant clinical trials&#xD;
      of novel therapies, and to construct a personalized drug screening platform for individuals&#xD;
      using novel cancer models established from patient-derived cancer cells and tissues. Other&#xD;
      objectives include to investigate the utility and feasibility of genomic sequencing using&#xD;
      circulating tumor DNA(ctDNA), and to establish a biobank of tumor tissues derived from&#xD;
      patients with unique cancer subtypes.&#xD;

          -  Gastrointestinal cancers: esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer,&#xD;
             esophago-gastric junction cancer, pancreatic cancer (including neuroendocrine&#xD;
             cancers), small bowel cancer, appendiceal cancer, anal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cancers that are known to carry unique genomic aberrations that are clinically&#xD;
             relevant and/or potentially actionable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded types of neoplastic or dysplastic disorders:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Lymphoma, leukemia, lymphoproliferative disease, plasma cell neoplasms,&#xD;
        histiocytosis-related proliferative disorders.&#xD;
