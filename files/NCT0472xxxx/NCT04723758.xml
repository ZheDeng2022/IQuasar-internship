  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COLO-DETECT is a clinical trial to evaluate whether an Artificial Intelligence device (&quot;GI&#xD;
      Genius&quot;, manufactured by Medtronic) can identify more polyps (pre-cancerous growths of the&#xD;
      bowel lining) during colonoscopy (large bowel camera test) than during colonoscopy without&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is common, affecting 1 in 15 men and 1 in 18 women in the UK in their&#xD;
      lifetime. Many colorectal cancers develop from polyps via the adenoma-carcinoma sequence:&#xD;
      there is a pre-cancerous stage (adenoma) during which it is possible to remove the polyp and&#xD;
      therefore prevent it from progressing to colorectal cancer. The gold standard tool for doing&#xD;
      this is colonoscopy. However, colonoscopy does not pick up all polyps, particularly flat&#xD;
      polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missed polyps can result in colorectal cancer, so it is imperative to detect and remove as&#xD;
      many polyps as possible. Many different interventions have been introduced to improve polyp&#xD;
      detection, the most recent of which is artificial intelligence devices. GI Genius is an&#xD;
      artificial intelligence device which integrates with existing colonoscopy equipment and&#xD;
      analyses the video feed from the colonoscope camera in real time. Any areas that may&#xD;
      represent an abnormality are then highlighted (without any lag) within a green box, alerting&#xD;
      the colonoscopist to its presence. The potential abnormality can then be assessed more&#xD;
      closely by the colonoscopist to decide whether it needs to be removed or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COLO-DETECT is a 2-arm, prospective, randomised controlled trial to assess whether GI Genius&#xD;
      is able to detect more polyps (specifically, adenomas) during colonoscopy than standard&#xD;
      colonoscopy without GI Genius. The primary outcome will be the mean number of adenomas per&#xD;
      procedure (MAP) and the key secondary outcome will be the proportion of colonoscopies in&#xD;
      which one or more adenomas is detected (Adenoma Detection Rate - ADR). These are both&#xD;
      important quality markers for colonoscopy; the study will be powered to detect a clinically&#xD;
      meaningful difference in ADR, which will by default detect a meaningful difference in MAP as&#xD;
      the sample size required for ADR is larger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to measuring the effect of GI Genius on polyp detection, COLO-DETECT will provide&#xD;
      a health economics analysis concerning the use of GI Genius, perform long-term passive&#xD;
      follow-up to examine for future outcomes related to colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer,&#xD;
      and perform additional nested studies (subject to ethical approval) that examine the effect&#xD;
      upon users (for example through a visual scanning study) and their experience of using the GI&#xD;
      Genius.&#xD;
