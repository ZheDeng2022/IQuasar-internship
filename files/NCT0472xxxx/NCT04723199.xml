  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal malignant biliary obstruction results from different types of tumors including&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer (BTC), gallbladder cancer, and metastasis, which can&#xD;
      lead to obstructive jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)&#xD;
      represents the gold standard for jaundice palliation in this setting of patients. However,&#xD;
      surgically altered anatomy (i.e., Whipple intervention, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Billroth II&#xD;
      surgery), periampullary diverticula, gastric outlet obstruction, and malignant obstruction of&#xD;
      the lumen determine the failure of the procedure in about 5-10% of cases, requiring&#xD;
      alternative methods of decompression. Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and&#xD;
      surgical bypass are well established alternatives in these patients, but associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity, longer length of hospital stay and higher costs, and patient discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2001 Giovannini et al. described the first EUS guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) through a&#xD;
      transduodenal access with a needle knife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, EUS-BD has considerably evolved thanks to the development of dedicated devices&#xD;
      such as lumen apposing metal stents (LAMS), specifically designed for endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      procedures. LAMS are made up of braided nitinol, that is fully covered with silicone to&#xD;
      prevent tissue ingrowth, with wide flanges on both ends to provide anchorage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, LAMS have been incorporated into a delivery system with an electrocautery mounted&#xD;
      on the tip (Hot Axios; Boston Scientific Corp.), which allows the device to be used directly&#xD;
      to penetrate the target structure without the need to utilize a 19G needle, a guidewire, and&#xD;
      a cystotome for prior dilation. This has been described for drainage of peri-pancreatic fluid&#xD;
      collections, common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder, and for creation of gastro-jejuno&#xD;
      anastomosis. The biliary drainage procedure performed with the Hot Axios sistem is a one step&#xD;
      procedure that requires less or no need for accessory exchange and becomes faster, thus&#xD;
      potentially decreasing the risk of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure has been described as safe and effective with a technical success of 98.2 %,&#xD;
      clinical success of 96.4 %, and low rate of complications 7 % (duodenal perforations,&#xD;
      bleeding and transient cholangitis). A systematic review and meta-analyses showed clinical&#xD;
      and technical success rates of 87% and 95% respectively. Currently, the EUS-BD is indicated&#xD;
      as a rescue therapy for jaundice palliation after ERCP failure.&#xD;

        This is an observational multicentric prospective study coordinated by Dr. Benedetto&#xD;
        Mangiavillano, Gastroenterology and Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Unit, Humanitas Mater&#xD;
        Domini, Castellanza (VA), Italy. Data from consecutive patients with jaundice caused by&#xD;
        distal malignant biliary obstruction will be evaluated and, if eligible and agreed to&#xD;
        participate, will be recorded in an electronic register. Patients will be followed until&#xD;
        death or for at least 6 months&#xD;
