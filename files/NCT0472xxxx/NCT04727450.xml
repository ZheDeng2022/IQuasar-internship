  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elderly population worldwide is expected to increase exponentially. There will be a&#xD;
      higher percentage of older adults suffering cognitive decline in the coming decades.&#xD;
      Cognitive impairment, being the most common health problem associated with ageing,&#xD;
      contributes to possible loss of functional independence and disability. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to determine the effectiveness of four mixed modalities of three training programs&#xD;
      (combined cognitive and physical training [CCPT], cognitive or physical training only) on&#xD;
      cognition and fitness of community-dwelling older adults in Hong Kong. The study hypotheses&#xD;
      will be set as the integrated format of all three training will have higher cognition and&#xD;
      fitness scores than other combinations of two training modes and all these mixed modalities&#xD;
      will have greater positive outcomes than the active control subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Twenty-four elderly centers as&#xD;
      clusters will be randomly selected and assigned to be intervention (n=20) or control groups&#xD;
      (n=4) in two study phases. A total of 8-10 older adults (age â‰¥ 60) from each cluster (total&#xD;
      subjects = 228) will be invited to be study participants. Each intervention cluster will&#xD;
      receive either an integrated training format or one out of three combinations of two training&#xD;
      modes. Each intervention training mode will last for 2-month of 16 sessions in total, 2&#xD;
      sessions per week and 60 min per session, hence, the total intervention will last for 4&#xD;
      months for two training modes or an integrated training format. Assessments will be conducted&#xD;
      at pre-test, two post-training tests, and a 2-month follow-up test after completion of all&#xD;
      training.&#xD;

Each elderly center as a cluster will be randomly assigned to be either an intervention group (IG) to receive intervention training modes (A: cognitive training, B: physical training only, C: CCPT) or a control group (CG).
