    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-center, placebo-Controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new pharmaceutical form Minoxidil 5% in men&#xD;
      after 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized at a 2: 1 ratio to receive new pharmaceutical form Minoxidil&#xD;
      5% and placebo, respectively. Through this method, it is possible to obtain more information&#xD;
      about the effectiveness of investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate efficacy by assessing nonvellus target area&#xD;
      hair count after using a new topical formulation of Minoxidil 5% compared to placebo applied&#xD;
      topically for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the secondary objectives, other aspects of effectiveness and safety will be evaluated,&#xD;
      such as quality of life, vital signs, and other parameters.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Masking will be adopted in this study, in which the experimental products under evaluation will be provided in a masked way, that is, one group will receive an experimental drug (Minoxidil 5%) and another group will receive a placebo (product without the active ingredient) in identical primary and secondary packaging to avoid potential bias, so neither the researcher nor the research participant will know what is being applied.</masking_description>
