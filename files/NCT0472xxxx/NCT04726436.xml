    <description>Number of participants who experienced PONV grade â‰¥2 as assessed by PONV score . The PACU nurses assessed and documented PONV using a Verbal Descriptive Scale, which correlates to visual analog nausea scores, with an objective measure of severity: 0 = no PONV: patient reports no nausea and has had no emesis episodes; 1 = mild PONV: patient reports nausea but declines antiemetic treatment; 2 = moderate PONV: patient reports nausea and accepts antiemetic treatment; and 3 = severe PONV: nausea with any emesis episode (retching or vomiting). The score was obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after PACU arrival; thus 5 scores were recorded during PACU stay. A 24-hour PONV assessment that elicited any nausea and emesis episode since PACU discharge was obtained by a blinded investigator by telephone or in person at the patient's bedside (delayed PONV).</description>
