  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized control trial and feasibility study designed to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of a larger RCT in our setting that would examine prenatal probiotic use in&#xD;
      Group B Strep (GBS) positive pregnant women at term. Investigators hope to address the&#xD;
      question of whether prenatal oral probiotic use, taken by healthy low risk GBS positive women&#xD;
      from approximately 37 weeks gestation until the time of birth, will reduce the number of&#xD;
      women who test positive for GBS at the time of admission to Labor and Delivery (L&amp;D).&#xD;

      This is an open-label randomized control trial and feasibility study designed to determine&#xD;
      the feasibility of a larger RCT in our setting that would examine prenatal probiotic use in&#xD;
      Group B Strep (GBS) positive pregnant women at term. We hope to address the question of&#xD;
      whether prenatal oral probiotic use, taken by healthy low risk GBS positive women from&#xD;
      approximately 37 weeks gestation until the time of birth, will reduce the number of women who&#xD;
      test positive for GBS at the time of admission to Labor and Delivery (L&amp;D). In this study we&#xD;
      aim to determine whether such a study is acceptable in our population, whether any adverse&#xD;
      events are identified, and what barriers or confounding variables might exist to probiotic&#xD;
      use at term. We will also look at whether probiotic use had any reported effect on maternal&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.&#xD;

             bacteriuria other than GBS, and we will not exclude women who have taken an antibiotic&#xD;
             during pregnancy, but we will track this as it is addressed in the Questionnaire for&#xD;
             Women.&#xD;
&#xD;
