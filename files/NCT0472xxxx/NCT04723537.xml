  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 2-part, multicenter, Phase 2/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel&#xD;
      group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of upamostat in adult patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      disease who do not require inpatient care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be seen in a medical facility (ER or COVID-19 clinic) for initial evaluation.&#xD;
      Consenting, diagnostically-confirmed COVID-19 patients not in need of hospitalization per&#xD;
      investigator assessment and who meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment and provided with medication and home monitoring devices, and&#xD;
      instructed in drug administration and use of the devices. They will take medication daily for&#xD;
      two weeks, complete a smartphone-based questionnaire, provide additional monitoring&#xD;
      information via devices provided periodically over an 8-week period. Patients will be seen at&#xD;
      home by a study nurse or return to the clinic after 2, 4 and 8 weeks on study (&quot;follow up&quot;&#xD;
      visits); additional televisits will also be conducted. At the follow up visits nasal swab&#xD;
      specimens for COVID-19 PCR and blood specimens for safety labs and disease markers will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In part A of the study, patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of two doses of upamostat or&#xD;
      placebo. Based on safety results of part A, a dose for part B will be selected, and patients&#xD;
      will be randomized 3:2 to active vs placebo.&#xD;

    <measure>Part A - Determination of the safety and tolerability of two dose levels and selection of an upamostat dose for part B</measure>
    <time_frame>57 days</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be determined based on the relative incidence and severity (CTCAE v 5.0 criteria) of adverse events, both clinical and laboratory (SOC=investigations) in each active treatment group as compared to placebo. In addition, toxicities (i.e., adverse events considered at lease possible related to study medication) resulting in dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy will be tabulated and compared among treatment groups.</description>

    <measure>Part B - Comparison between upamostat and placebo in time to sustained recovery from symptomatic illness.</measure>
    <time_frame>57 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained recovery: recovery maintained for at least 14 or 28 days or through EOS, whichever comes first (assessed in part A and a decision reached as to which period to use for definition of sustained recovery in part B). A patient will be considered to have recovered after meeting the following criteria: 1) is afebrile for at least 48 hours without use of antipyretics; 2) all symptoms have resolved or returned to pre- illness levels, except for: a. fatigue, anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia, which may be persistent at level similar to that during the acute illness; b. chest pain, cough or dyspnea which if persistent must be at least one grade lower than at the start of treatment and no worse than grade 1 (mild).</description>
