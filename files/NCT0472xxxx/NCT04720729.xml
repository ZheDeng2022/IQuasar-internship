  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm, single site, open-label phase II study. Patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      screening step at the start of the second line of chemotherapy, and will undergo blood draws&#xD;
      for ctDNA detection. Patients for whom ctDNA was successfully detected and found informative&#xD;
      by the study executive board could then be included in the interventional step when starting&#xD;
      a new line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ctDNA will be quantified using the customized test, at baseline and day 15 (+/- 3 working&#xD;
      day) of cycle #1, and results will be made available before the cycle 2 Day 1, together with&#xD;
      a treatment management recommendation by the Study Executive Board (continuation or&#xD;
      discontinuation of the corresponding chemotherapy)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be enrolled in the screening step at the start of the second line of&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and will undergo blood draws for ctDNA detection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      That second line of treatment will be managed by clinical and radiological evaluations&#xD;
      (RECIST); ctDNA will not be released to clinician and patient in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the included patient is being treated by second line therapy, a customized ctDNA&#xD;
      detection based on tumor mutations (droplet-digital PCR) will be developed. Once set up, the&#xD;
      two blood above-mentioned samples will be subjected to ctDNA detection. The SEB will then&#xD;
      retrospectively assess whether ctDNA levels changes during the second line of treatment were&#xD;
      indicative of the efficacy of the second line therapy. Patients for whom ctDNA was&#xD;
      successfully detected and found informative by the SEB (Steering Executive Board) could then&#xD;
      be included in the interventional step when starting a new line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third blood draw for ctDNA detection will be used to compare results to the tumor&#xD;
      evaluation performed by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the interventional step, ctDNA analyses and interpretation will be performed in real time;&#xD;
      results made available before the cycle 2. Quantitative results will be interpreted by the&#xD;
      laboratory committee, with two possible recommendations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ctDNA changes at day 15 display a major drop (Mutant Allelic Frequency (MAF) or&#xD;
           copies/ml) reduced by 40% or more compared to baseline: continuing the same chemotherapy&#xD;
           will be recommended;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ctDNA changes at day 15 display no major drop (MAF or copies/ml) either increased,&#xD;
           stable or reduced by less than 40% compared to baseline: changing chemotherapy will be&#xD;
           recommended; In light of ctDNA levels changes observed during the second line for each&#xD;
           included patient, the above-mentioned thresholds might be modified, on a case-by-case&#xD;
           basis, by the SEB (to keep into account individual characteristics).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test will be repeated for any new line of therapy that may be initiated during the first&#xD;
      6 months following the accrual of each patient in the interventional step. If this strategy&#xD;
      is considered efficient (on an individual basis), further ctDNA tests will be made available&#xD;
      on request for the next six months. Consequently, the patients who will change chemotherapy&#xD;
      line after the recommendation following result from C1D15 ctDNA results will have a new ctDNA&#xD;
      test at C1D1 and C1D15 of the new chemotherapy line.&#xD;

    <description>During the screening step (2nd chemotherapy line, cycle 1) : at each time point (L2C1D1 &amp; L2C1D15), 30 ml of blood will be drawn on special tubes with conservative suited for ctDNA analyses (e.g. STRECK® tubes).Then cell-free circulating DNA (cfcDNA) will be extracted from plasma following the manufacturer recommendations. cfcDNA will be quantified, and minimum 500-1000 copies will be analyzed by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Analyses will define if ctDNA could be detected during L2.&#xD;
For the interventional step, from L3 (3rd chemotherapy line) : 20 ml of blood will be drawn at L3C1D1 and L3C1D15. If ctDNA at D15 shows a major drop (&gt; 40%) from D1, treatment will be continued. If ctDNA at D15 shows no major drop from D1, chemotherapy will be changed.</description>
