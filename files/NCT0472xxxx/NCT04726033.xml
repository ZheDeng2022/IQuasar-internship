  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial of TLX592, a humanised, engineered monoclonal antibody HuX592r&#xD;
      conjugated with a DOTA chelator and radiolabelled with 64Cu (64Cu-TLX592). TLX592 is being&#xD;
      developed as a PSMA-targeting antibody to be radiolabelled with a therapeutic radiosotope for&#xD;
      the treatment of PSMA-expressing tumours, therefore this study has been designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, whole body biodistribution and radiation&#xD;
      dosimetry of 64Cu-TLX592.&#xD;

      The optimisation dose and imaging conditions will be conducted in prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      with with oligometastatic disease ( (defined as 5 sites or less outside of the prostate bed).&#xD;
      On determining the optimal dose and imaging conditions, an additional cohort of patients with&#xD;
      a higher tumour burden such as multiple metastatic sites across ≥10 regions will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study conduct:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine, prostate cancer patients with oligometastatic disease as detected using 68Ga-PSMA-11 or&#xD;
      18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CT scanning (defined as 5 sites or less outside of the prostate bed) will&#xD;
      be randomised to one of three treatment groups to receive a single injection of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu combined with 8mg of&#xD;
           unlabelled TLX592 (mass dose of 10mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: 2mg of TLX592, labelled with 300 MBq (± 10%) 64Cu combined with 18mg of&#xD;
           unlabelled TLX592 (mass dose of 20mg). If one of the three patients in a specific group&#xD;
           experiences a dose-limiting toxicity, three more patients will be treated at the same&#xD;
           dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a higher tumour burden such as multiple metastatic sites across ≥10 regions&#xD;
      [regions: prostate bed, pelvic lumph nodes, skeleton, distant sites (including viscera)] as&#xD;
      detected on 68Ga-PSMA or 18F-DCFPyl PMSA imaging agent will be allocated to a fourth group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Group 4: based on the result of Groups 1-3, the optimal dose and imaging timepoints will be&#xD;
      selected to treat 3 patients with higher tumour burden (≥10 metastatic sites and/or visceral&#xD;
      disease as detected on a 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 18F-DCFPyl PSMA PET/CTscan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dosimetry analysis, biodistribution whole body PET/CT imaging will be performed at 1, 4 ±&#xD;
      0.5h, 20 ± 4h, with the option for a an additional two scans to be performed between the&#xD;
      36-120 hours post administration of the investigational product. The additional scans after&#xD;
      the 20h timepoint will be at the discretion of the investigator. Patients will be imaged on a&#xD;
      Siemens Biographe scanner, offering the possibility of TOF (time-of-flight) and non-TOF&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative tumour PET/CT imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 0, 1 and potentially at 36-120h the biodistribution and tumour imaging will be&#xD;
      performed using gated or list mode acquisition, for generation of sub-partitioned data.Such&#xD;
      data will allow the mathematical generation of statistically independent images for various&#xD;
      dose levels, based on the actual dose administered in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of study visit will be conducted on Day 28 ± 2 days. 64Cu-TLX592 images will be&#xD;
      centrally analysed for absorbed organ and whole body doses in a standardised fashion. In&#xD;
      addition, tumour absorbed doses will be determined for scientific purposes (estimation of&#xD;
      achievable tumour doses of therapeutic nuclides labelled to TLX592). All image data analyses&#xD;
      will be performed / confirmed centrally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be taken at the following times and counted in a gamma counter:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1, 4 ± 0.5h, 20 ± 4h and 48 ± 4h after the administration of 64Cu-TLX592.&#xD;
