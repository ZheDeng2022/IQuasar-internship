      Limping is a common complaint among children presenting in the Pediatric ED the evaluation of&#xD;
      a limp among infants and toddlers is challenging doe to the lack of specific history and the&#xD;
      difficulty in locating the pain - therefore hip sonography is frequently used in the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation of these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonographic examination for the diagnosis of hip effusion is routinely performed by the&#xD;
      radiologist, however, since the integration of Point of care Ultrasound (POCUS) as part of&#xD;
      the clinical evaluation of children in the ED in many application - Hip pocus is frequently&#xD;
      performed by pediatric Emergency Medicine physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing data on hip POCUS is scarce and comprised of small uncontrolled studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aimed to examine the specificity and sensitivity of hip Pocus performed by pediatric&#xD;
      emergency physicians by comparing it to the scan performed by the radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the primary outcome measurement is the ability of the POCUS exam to identify or rule out the&#xD;
      existence of hip effusion as demonstrated in the formal radiological Ultrasound scan.&#xD;

      Children (0-18 years) presenting to the PED in Meir medical center with limp pain (not due to&#xD;
      trauma) or a limp are recruited After consenting to participate in the study and completing&#xD;
      the registration process the primary physician who is an approved researcher by the&#xD;
      institutes IRB will perform hip POCUS as part of the clinical evaluation and will record his&#xD;
      interpretation in the medical file. A formal ultrasound scan will be perfumed additionally by&#xD;
      the radiologist. Both examination will be reviewed by POCUS lead physician and the Pediatric&#xD;
      radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's clinical and epidemiological data will be extracted from the electronic chart.&#xD;
