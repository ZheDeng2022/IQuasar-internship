    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of an empowerment-based 13-week multimodal intervention&#xD;
      to improve neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive functions, and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      among persons with mild cognitive impairment&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia has become a global pandemic. It affects 50 million people worldwide and this number&#xD;
      is projected to have a three-fold increase to over 150 million by 2050.1 Dementia is&#xD;
      characterized by progressive deterioration in cognitive functions that interferes an&#xD;
      individual to live independently.2 It jeopardizes the quality of life of the sufferers and&#xD;
      their families, and poses tremendous economic burden on health and social systems.4 In 2018,&#xD;
      the total cost incurred by dementia worldwide was up to US$ 1 billion and it was forecasted&#xD;
      to double in 2050.5 Since dementia is incurable, efforts to mitigate the burgeoning&#xD;
      population of dementia should be directed to its prodromal reversible stage, that is, mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (MCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MCI refers to the transitional stage between normal age-related cognitive decline and&#xD;
      dementia. It is characterized by cognitive decline in a single or multiple cognitive domains&#xD;
      including memory, executive functions, attention, language and visuospatial skills, but the&#xD;
      ability to engage in activities of daily living is preserved.6 The global prevalence of MCI&#xD;
      is 10 to 20% in persons aged 65 or older, and up to 25.9% for those aged above 80.5 Current&#xD;
      research effort focuses on addressing the cognitive symptoms of persons with MCI (PwMCI),&#xD;
      least attention was paid to the co-existing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). Such&#xD;
      non-cognitive symptoms, indeed, affect persons in different stages of cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      there is no exception for MCI.1 NPS is an umbrella term that captures psychological and&#xD;
      behavioural symptoms, typical psychological symptoms encompass depression, apathy and&#xD;
      anxiety, which may cluster into a syndrome and precipitate behavioural symptoms such as&#xD;
      agitation and disinhibition.7 Two systematic reviews8,9 simultaneously reported that up to&#xD;
      85% of the MCI population are afflicted with at least one of these symptoms, with depression&#xD;
      being the most prevalent followed by anxiety and irritability. Comparing to those without&#xD;
      such symptoms, they tend to have poorer quality of life, more severe functional loss, and&#xD;
      with a fourfold increased risk for progression to dementia.10-12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite of the fact NPS is highly prevalence among PwMCI, effective management with&#xD;
      comprehensive outcome measurement is yet to be determined. An empowerment-based,&#xD;
      comprehensive multimodal intervention with MCI-specific outcome measurement on overall NPS is&#xD;
      warranted. Such intervention should cover skills compensation with transferral into daily&#xD;
      life, lifestyle reform, strength-based activity, cognitive restructuring and disease-specific&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
