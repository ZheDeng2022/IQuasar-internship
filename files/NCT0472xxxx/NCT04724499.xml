  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16-week high intensity interval&#xD;
      training (HIIT) exercise program will improve brain health among women undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy and also improve cardiovascular (heart) function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are/is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)&#xD;

      This research study is a randomized controlled pilot trial that will compare an exercise&#xD;
      group to a control group on brain health, cardiac fitness and overall quality of life in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients starting chemotherapy either before (pre-operative or neoadjuvant) or&#xD;
      after surgery (post-operative or adjuvant)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first-time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this intervention in this setting. The study is trying to determine whether participating in&#xD;
      a specific exercise program can improve brain and heart function, as there is some evidence&#xD;
      that there can be cognitive changes after chemotherapy among some patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer. This study intends to evaluate whether HIIT can improve cognitive function as well as&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory fitness, among patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) for 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B: Attention Control for 16 weeks home-based stretching; the HIIT intervention&#xD;
           will be available after the study ends&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      extensive evaluations of your fitness and brain health, including MRI, blood tests, bone&#xD;
      scans, fitness and strength assessments, and surveys at study entry and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for 4 months and will be followed for 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time for participation in this study will be about 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Institute for Cancer Research is supporting this research by providing funding&#xD;
      for the study.&#xD;
