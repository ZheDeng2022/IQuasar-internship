    <measure>auditory skills as measured by the LittleEars Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LittleEars auditory questionnaire (LEAQ) uses parent responses to assess auditory behavior in children up to 24 months of age. The questionnaire is scored from 0 to 35 with 0 indicating poorer performance and 35 indicating better performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>auditory skills as measured by the Auditory Skills Checklist (ASC)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>ASC has a Total Score ranges from zero to 70, with higher scores indicating development of increasingly complex listening skills</description>

    <measure>hearing disability as measured by the Speech, Spatial and Qualities Hearing Scale (SSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SSQ is a a 49 item self-report test of hearing disability across three main sections and 10 pragmatic subscales. The total score ranges from zero to ten, with a lower score indicating a higher degree of hearing disability</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd Edition (BASC-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>BASC-3 is scored 0-120 as a T score. Any scores between 60-70 is considered at risk / requires monitoring and scores greater than 70 are considered clinically significant / an area that likely requires therapeutic intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>PHQ-8 has 8 items rated on a scale from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;nearly every day&quot; (3), with higher scores indicating greater frequency of depressive symptoms. The sum of the items indicates the overall level of depressive symptoms indicating mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), and severe depressive symptoms (20- 24).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>GAD-7 is a 7-item self-report questionnaire of anxiety symptomatology in the past 14 days. Respondents rate the frequency of each item during the past two weeks on a 0-3-point scale ranging from not at all (0) to nearly every day (3). The sum of the items indicates the overall level of anxiety symptoms indicating mild (0-4), moderate (5-9), moderately severe (10-14), and severe (15- 21).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life- CI (QoL-CI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>QoL-CI is scored 0-100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cochlear Implant Quality of Life-35 Profile (CIQOL-35 Profile)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>CIQOL-35 Profile is a 35 item questionnaire with a total score ranging from 0-100% with a higher score indicating a higher level of functional ability with a cochlear implant</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parenting Stress Index/Short Form (PSI) contains 36 items rated on a 6-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree) and a total score. Higher scores indicate increased parenting stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parenting Stress-CI</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Parenting Stress-CI is completed by the parent and scored from &quot;not at all stressful&quot; (0) to &quot;very stressful&quot; (3) with higher scores indicating greater degrees of parenting stress. For parents of children 0-5 years, there are 15 items. For parents of children 6-12 years there are 8 items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scale of Parental Involvement and Self-Efficacy-Revised (SPISE-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPISE-R is comprised of 46 questions that uses a 7-point Likert scale to query parents' beliefs, knowledge, confidence, and actions relevant to supporting their child's auditory access and spoken language development. The total average score will range from 1 to 7 with 7 indicating the highest score / highest level of parental involvement and self efficacy.</description>
