  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aviation related deaths are often fatal, with most patients dying at the scene; however, with&#xD;
      increased safety and improvement in medical management, patients are surviving aviation&#xD;
      accidents. Among the aviation-related deaths reported between 1980 and 1990, polytrauma was&#xD;
      listed as the immediate cause of death in 42% of fatalities, followed by head injuries (22%),&#xD;
      internal organ injuries of the thorax, abdomen, pelvis (12%), burns (4%), and drowning (3%) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis and interpretation of aviation-pattern injuries may provide healthcare facilities&#xD;
      with planning information on the spectrum of possible injuries that may be expected, and,&#xD;
      furthermore, tools for a protocol and guidelines on the comprehensive and complete management&#xD;
      of such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study was to describe the injury patterns, and mortality rate resulting from&#xD;
      air crashes presenting at a level 1 trauma centre in Johannesburg, South Africa&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the twenty-first century, transportation disasters and subsequent injuries are on the&#xD;
      rise, in particular air travel, and, thus, contributing significantly to the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of this millennium. However, information regarding injuries sustained by air crash&#xD;
      survivors is lacking. As the number of commercial and non-commercial flights are increasing,&#xD;
      health care facilities are faced with a rise in the number of patients with air crash&#xD;
      injuries. Consequently, management guidelines must be formulated for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with these air crash injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the South African Civil Aviation authority, 565 aviation accidents and incidents&#xD;
      were reported from 2011 to 2019. The injuries and outcomes of patients involved in these&#xD;
      accidents are unknown. There is little data to describe injury patterns and outcomes of&#xD;
      patients in aviation accidents within our setting. Consequently, to find data on the&#xD;
      frequency distribution of aviation injury patterns in hospitalized patients, one must use&#xD;
      other data sources Injury patterns from several aircraft disasters have been previously&#xD;
      described. Some authors have described injury patterns and fatalities from aviation accidents&#xD;
      based on their patients and aircraft data. Friedman et al. described that when a plane&#xD;
      impacts with the ground, the landing gear of an aircraft may be retracted, resulting in&#xD;
      energy being directly transmitted from the aircraft to the passengers, through the body of&#xD;
      the aircraft from the bottom going upwards along the axial skeleton causing vertebral column&#xD;
      injuries that are coming with air crash patients. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that&#xD;
      such survivors of crashes be transferred to an adequately equipped trauma center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2009, Baker et al. aimed to explore the configurations of aviation-related injuries in&#xD;
      hospitals in the United States of America (USA) whilst comparing them to the aviation deaths&#xD;
      over the same time frame (2000 - 2005). This revealed just over 4500 aviation-related (87%&#xD;
      non-commercial aircraft, and 7% commercial aircraft) deaths occurred in the USA - an average&#xD;
      of 753 per year, with one death for every 1.3 hospitalizations. This represents the largest&#xD;
      number of patients reported to date. Lower limb fractures/injuries were the most common&#xD;
      sustained injuries, followed by head injuries, various open soft tissue wounds, upper&#xD;
      extremity fractures/injuries, and lastly internal organ injuries. Head injuries were the&#xD;
      cause of most fatalities. This study's case-fatality showed that 39% were due to vascular&#xD;
      injuries, 13% due to burns, followed by 8% from head injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rautji et al. discussed the injury pattern examined in the post-mortem findings in eight&#xD;
      occupants of a light executive jet aircraft crash. One body was severely burnt, but the other&#xD;
      seven were intact. On serum blood toxicology, it was established that there was no&#xD;
      carboxyhemoglobin present. Therefore, all burns were sustained post-mortem; concluding that&#xD;
      the cause of death in all these cases was polytrauma. This evaluation found that the most&#xD;
      commonly occurring fractures were ribs (72.3%), skull (55.1%), facial bones (49.4%), tibia&#xD;
      (37.9%), and pelvis (36%) [9]. The common organ injuries were liver (48.1%), lung (37.6%),&#xD;
      heart (35.6%), spleen (30.1%), and hemorrhagic cerebral and pulmonary injuries being 33.3%&#xD;
      and 32.9%, respectively. Once again, injuries of sudden deceleration transmitted in a&#xD;
      vertical fashion were also described, resulting in vertebral column injuries and extensive&#xD;
      visceral damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A report discussed by Afshar et al. illustrated that up to 85% of injuries of survivors of a&#xD;
      Boeing 727 flight were extremity injuries (particularly lower limb injuries), followed by&#xD;
      vertebral column injuries at various levels, and a minority sustained internal organ injuries&#xD;
      . Similarly, Rowles et al. (1990) concluded that most M1 Kegworth air crash injuries were&#xD;
      orthopedic in nature, approximately 85%, and 3.8% were general surgical procedures&#xD;
      (laparotomies, thoracotomies, vascular repair, and a tracheostomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aviation related deaths are often fatal, with most patients dying at the scene; however, with&#xD;
      increased safety and improvement in medical management, patients are surviving aviation&#xD;
      accidents. Among the aviation-related deaths reported between 1980 and 1990, polytrauma was&#xD;
      listed as the immediate cause of death in 42% of fatalities, followed by head injuries (22%),&#xD;
