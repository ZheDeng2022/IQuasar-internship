    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of atezolizumab and bevacizumab before surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with liver cancer that can be removed by surgery (resectable).&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of tumor&#xD;
      cells to grow and spread. Giving the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab may help to&#xD;
      prevent liver cancer from returning after surgery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and tolerability of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab combination therapy&#xD;
      in the pre-operative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the rate of pathologic complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the correlation between rate of pathologic complete response, overall response&#xD;
      rate at time of surgery (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 and&#xD;
      modified RECIST 1.0), duration of response as defined by time to recurrence/recurrence-free&#xD;
      survival, in addition to overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the predictive value of dynamic changes in fibrosis stage (defined by a&#xD;
      minimum 1-point improvement in fibrosis stage 0-4 per magnetic resonance elastography [MRE])&#xD;
      and in IGF-1 blood score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure baseline and longitudinal changes of immune infiltration including&#xD;
      CD8/regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio and CD68+ density, and fibrosis stage by MRE for up to one&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery during week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.&#xD;
