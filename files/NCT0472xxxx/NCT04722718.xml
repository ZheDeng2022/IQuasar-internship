      1. The efficacy and safety of immunotherapy and antiangiotherapy in combination with&#xD;
           chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were&#xD;
           determined by the addition of sintilimab and apatinib to neoadjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To clarify the breast-conserving rate, toxicity, difference in pathologic complete&#xD;
           response (pCR) rate of patients with PD-L1 (+) and PD-L1 (-) after neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
           of TNBC with immunotherapy and anti-vascular therapy combined with chemotherapy and the&#xD;
           relationship between pCR rate of immunomodulated type (IM) and non-immunomodulated type&#xD;
           patients in &quot;Fudan classification&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Through post-treatment efficacy evaluation and safety analysis, we provide new treatment&#xD;
           strategies for TNBC patients, increase the pCR rate of TNBC patients, and ultimately&#xD;
           improve the long-term survival of patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decades, the incidence of breast cancer in humans has continued to rise, posing a&#xD;
      huge threat to the lives and health of patients worldwide. According to statistics released&#xD;
      by the American Cancer Society,In 2019, there were more than 271,000 new cases of breast&#xD;
      cancer and about 42260 deaths in the United States. As a highly heterogeneous disease, breast&#xD;
      cancer can be based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) and antigen Ki-67 is divided into several subtypes. TNBC is&#xD;
      one of the subtypes of breast cancer, which is characterized by the lack of protein&#xD;
      expression of ER, PR and HER-2. Clinically, TNBC is a very aggressive subtype of breast&#xD;
      cancer, accounting for about 12% to 17% of all breast cancers. Due to its aggressiveness and&#xD;
      lack of drug targets, compared with other subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC patients have a&#xD;
      shorter overall survival (OS) and the median OS of metastatic TNBC is only 8-15 months.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy is still the main systemic treatment for TNBC, but drug resistance develops&#xD;
      rapidly and is poorly tolerated. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatment&#xD;
      strategies for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical and molecular heterogeneity of TNBC is now well understood. Gene expression&#xD;
      analysis showed that immune markers, androgen receptors, mesenchymal phenotypes, stem cell&#xD;
      markers and basic markers are all related to TNBC subtypes .With reference to previous&#xD;
      studies, according to the results of transcriptomics research, and based on transcriptome&#xD;
      data, China's &quot;Fudan Classification&quot; divides TNBC into 4 subtypes: (1) luminal androgen&#xD;
      receptor (LAR), (2) Immunomodulatory (IM), (3) basal-like and immune-suppressed (BLIS) and&#xD;
      (4) mesenchymal-like (MES). Possible therapeutic targets or biomarkers have been identified&#xD;
      for each subtype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has played an important role in the treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced TNBC patients. Through neoadjuvant chemotherapy, tumor shrinkage and stage reduction&#xD;
      can improve the surgical radical cure rate and breast conserving rate. Postoperative pCR rate&#xD;
      is of great significance in predicting the prognosis of patients, and those who achieve pCR&#xD;
      tend to have better prognosis. A meta-analysis of 52 studies showed that the availability of&#xD;
      pCR for neoadjuvant therapy in TNBC patients was significantly associated with event-free&#xD;
      survival (EFS), with a 5-year EFS of 90% in the pCR group and only 57% in tumor survivors&#xD;
      (HR=0.18). The prognosis of non-pCR or drug-resistant patients is relatively poor, and in&#xD;
      order to reduce the recurrence and metastasis rate and improve the prognosis, intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy is often needed. Currently, there is no standard treatment regimen for TNBC.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that the pCR rate of traditional anthracyclines followed by&#xD;
      sequenzine therapy for TNBC can reach 25%-40%, but there are still nearly 20% patients with&#xD;
      recent recurrence. Therefore, the optimization of TNBC treatment regimen is still a hot spot&#xD;
      and difficulty in current clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, platinum drugs have attracted more and more attention in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      therapy of TNBC due to their ability to significantly improve pCR rate. Carboplatin can kill&#xD;
      cancer cells by destroying their DNA. Currently, it has become an important neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy drug in the treatment of TNBC. Studies have shown that adding the DNA damage&#xD;
      agent carboplatin to the neoadjuvant regimen can improve the pCR rate of TNBC. In 2020, the&#xD;
      latest studies showed that carboplatin combined with nab-paclitaxel showed good anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity and a high PCR rate of 48%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, antiangiogenic therapy has been considered as a potential therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      for patients with TNBC. In 2008, bevacizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for significantly increasing patients' PFS in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Mesylate path is for our country to develop a new type of oral small molecule&#xD;
      anti angiogenesis inhibitors, mainly through highly selective inhibition of vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR - 2) the activity of tyrosine kinase, blocking&#xD;
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor signal transduction pathways, thus&#xD;
      potent inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, play a role of anti-tumor. In addition, preclinical&#xD;
      studies have shown that anti-angiogenic therapy can improve the sensitivity of anti-PD-1&#xD;
      /PD-L1 therapy by increasing PD-L1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in the tumor&#xD;
      microenvironment. Therefore, anti-angiogenic therapy may enhance the response to PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      blockade and improve survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, blocking of programmed death protein 1(PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1)&#xD;
      is an attractive treatment option for TNBC, since stromal infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) and&#xD;
      PD-L1 are associated with favorable outcomes for TNBC. Impassion130 showed that first-line&#xD;
      treatment with albumin paclitaxel combined with atzumab (anti-PD-L1 antibody) increased PFS&#xD;
      by 2.2 months in patients with PD-L1 positive advanced TNBC, and increased OS by 7 months&#xD;
      compared with placebo plus albumin paclitaxel. Therefore, the combination of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy was proved to be effective. Meanwhile, in 2020, Impassion031 and Keynote-522&#xD;
      published the results of two classic studies: the pCR rate after immunotherapy combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy neoadjuvant therapy reached 58% and 64.8%, respectively, further confirming the&#xD;
      high efficacy of immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNBC as one of a kind of high heterogeneity of breast cancer subtypes, its aggressive is&#xD;
      strong, postoperative recurrence occurred more transfer, lack of effective treatment of&#xD;
      molecular therapeutic targets, endocrine therapy and its ehrs resistance - 2 treatment often&#xD;
      invalid, therefore, compared with other subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC after neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy to pCR has more significant prognostic value. Currently, there is no standard&#xD;
      treatment for TNBC except traditional anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is critical to optimize the neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens for TNBC to&#xD;
      increase the pCR rate and improve the long-term prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, 6 clinical trials of apatinib combined with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for TNBC have&#xD;
      been registered in China. However, there are no relevant reports on immunotherapy and&#xD;
      antiangiogenesis therapy combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC at&#xD;
      home and abroad. Based on the results of previous classic studies and preclinical studies,&#xD;
      the researchers initiated this clinical study to clarify the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      sintilimab and apatinib combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC, in&#xD;
      order to provide treatment for TNBC patients Strategy.&#xD;
