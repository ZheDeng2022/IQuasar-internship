  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine whether a 16-week exercise program for&#xD;
      individuals with newly diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer and have completed treatment&#xD;
      (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation) for breast cancer within the past 12 months will&#xD;
      decrease inflammation in fat tissue.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is about using different types of exercise to reduce inflammation in fat tissue in&#xD;
      an effort to minimize the risk of cancer recurrence related to being overweight or obese. The&#xD;
      investigators hope to learn whether participating in a specific exercise program can cause&#xD;
      inflammation in the fat tissue to decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circuit-style aerobic and resistance exercise (CARE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Traditional aerobic and resistance exercise (TARE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment will be for 4 months and participants will followed for 8 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total time for participation in this study will be about 12 months. It is expected that&#xD;
      about 300 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
