  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with ASD often show disruptive behaviors. However, interventions that were&#xD;
      specifically designed to improve these symptoms have not been sufficiently investigated,&#xD;
      especially in children with level 1 to level 3 ASD. PCIT has large effects on externalizing&#xD;
      behavior problems in children with disruptive behavior disorders. Recently PCIT was adapted&#xD;
      for children with autism spectrum disorder (PCIT-A). ESDM is an evidence-based treatment for&#xD;
      ASD but has not been investigated in combination with PCIT-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary aims, the investigators assess a) the effect of PCIT-A on disruptive behavior and&#xD;
      b) the effect of ESDM on autism symptoms in toddlers and preschool children with ASD level 1&#xD;
      to 3. As secondary aims, the investigators evaluate a) the maintenance of the effect of&#xD;
      PCIT-A one year after the end of intervention and b) the effect of both interventions on&#xD;
      secondary outcomes (developmental level, intelligence, adaptive behavior, and parenting&#xD;
      stress), c) the combined intervention effect of PCIT-A and ESDM depending on intervention&#xD;
      overlap periods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder with recognizable&#xD;
      symptoms often beginning between one and two years of age and an estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      about 0.6%. Both social communication deficits, and restrictive and repetitive behavior&#xD;
      depict the core symptoms of ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESDM is an evidence-based treatment for ASD. A recent meta-analysis comprising 12 studies&#xD;
      show favorable effects of ESDM on cognition and language with a moderate effect size, in&#xD;
      contrast to control groups. ESDM showed to become cost-efficient within a few years after&#xD;
      treatment as a result of less use of other health care services in the years following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with ASD often show disruptive behaviors such as angry outbursts, irritability,&#xD;
      aggressive and oppositional behaviors. However, interventions that were specifically designed&#xD;
      to improve these symptoms have not been sufficiently investigated, especially in children&#xD;
      with level 1 to level 3 ASD. PCIT has large effects on externalizing behavior problems in&#xD;
      children with disruptive behavior disorders. Recently, PCIT was adapted for children with&#xD;
      autism spectrum disorder (PCIT-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary aims of the so-called TAFF (Tagesklinik für Autismus und Frühförderung [Day Clinic&#xD;
      for Autism and Early Intervention]) pilot study, the investigators assess a) the effect of&#xD;
      PCIT-A on disruptive behavior and b) the effect of ESDM on autism symptoms in toddlers and&#xD;
      preschool children with ASD level 1 to 3. As secondary aims, the investigators evaluate a)&#xD;
      the maintenance of the effect of PCIT-A one year after the end of intervention and b) the&#xD;
      effect of both interventions on secondary outcomes (developmental level, intelligence,&#xD;
      adaptive behavior, and parenting stress), c) the combined intervention effect of PCIT-A and&#xD;
      ESDM depending on intervention overlap periods.&#xD;

    <description>PCIT is a behavioral family therapy approach emphasizing the integration of traditional child play therapy techniques within a behavioral framework of parent-child therapy and was developed by Eyberg (1988). It is based on attachment theory, social learning theory, and parenting styles theory. Recently, the intervention was adapted to children with ASD by our team (McNeil, Quetsch, &amp; Anderson, 2019). PCIT-A will last about 8 months, 1 day per week, 60min per day (see Study Protocol, Fig. 2).</description>

    <description>ESDM intervention provides intensive teaching by trained therapists and parents during natural play and relationship-focused daily routines. It is evidence-based and uses principles of developmental psychology and applied behavior analysis. It was designed for toddlers and preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder by Rogers and Dawson (2010). The first intensive part of ESDM intervention (20h per week) will last 40 weeks of intervention within a period of 12 months. It includes 2 days per week for 6h a day clinic therapy, and 5 days per week for 1h homework tasks, and 2 days per week for 1.5h an early special needs education at home. After the first 12 months, children receive the second lower intensity part of ESDM (7 hours per week). It includes 1 days every two weeks 1h day clinic therapy, and 5 days per week for 1h homework tasks, and 1 days per week for 1.5h an early special needs education at home (see Study Protocol, Fig. 2).</description>
