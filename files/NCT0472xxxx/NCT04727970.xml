      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of tricaprilin&#xD;
      in subjects with infantile spasms. This is a single-arm, open-label, pilot study in up to 10&#xD;
      subjects with infantile spasms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             parent/legal guardian signing the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical diagnosis of IS, confirmed by analysis of a 24-hour&#xD;
             video-electroencephalogram (vEEG) recording, including at least one documented spasm&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Continued infantile spasms despite adequate treatment with oral prednisolone (or&#xD;
             adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) and vigabatrin&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If being treated with concomitant ASDs (other than ketogenic therapies/diet), current&#xD;
             ASDs have been at a constant daily dose for at least 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is taking no more than 3 concomitant ASDs&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Subject has clinically significant renal impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant abnormality on ECG that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             increases the safety risks of participating in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known or suspected allergy to the investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known history of aspiration pneumonia within the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Previous participation in another clinical study of the investigational product or&#xD;
             received any investigational drug, device, or therapy within 30 days of study entry or&#xD;
             within five half-lives of another investigational drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Within 14 days of screening, subject has:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. received therapy with felbamate, cannabinoids, ketogenic diet, or vagus nerve&#xD;
                  stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. received therapy with ACTH, prednisolone or other steroid&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pre-existing lethal or potentially lethal condition other than infantile spasms&#xD;
