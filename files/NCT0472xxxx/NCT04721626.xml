  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm prospective trial of an intra- and postoperative topical antiseptic&#xD;
      bundle. The study will recruit patients undergoing an open surgical resection of the upper&#xD;
      aerodigestive tract requiring a planed vascularized reconstruction, which may be either&#xD;
      pedicled and/or free flap. The objectives are to evaluate antimicrobial effects of a&#xD;
      perioperative topical antiseptic bundle and to identify the source of surgical site infection&#xD;
      as well as the rate of 30-day adverse events in head and neck cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a single-arm prospective trial. It will investigate the microbial effects&#xD;
      of topical antisepsis on upper aerodigestive tract and reconstructive surgery in head and&#xD;
      neck cancer patients. The primary hypothesis is that topical antisepsis will significantly&#xD;
      decrease oral bacterial load and the presence of pathogenic organisms. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include identification of the source of the infectious bacterial organisms, surgical and&#xD;
      non-surgical site infections, serious topical antisepsis-related complications, serious&#xD;
      adverse events, and hospital revisits. The study populations will include head and neck&#xD;
      cancer patients age 18 or greater undergoing head and neck reconstructive surgery in which&#xD;
      there is a communication between the upper aerodigestive tract and the cervical skin which&#xD;
      requires a planned vascularized reconstruction, either a regional pedicled flap or a free&#xD;
      tissue transfer. The accrual goal will be 25 patients. Data collection will occur in both the&#xD;
      inpatient and outpatient settings. Patients will be enrolled during their preoperative clinic&#xD;
      visit. Each patient will be followed for study outcomes until 30 days postoperatively.&#xD;
