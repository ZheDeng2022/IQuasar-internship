  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After a stroke, more than two out of three patients experience problems with upper limb&#xD;
      movement and sensation. During the past decade, robotic technology has been increasingly used&#xD;
      to asses these problems in a detailed and accurate manner. However, sensory processing, one&#xD;
      of the most important sensory functions, has not been assessed using robotic technology yet.&#xD;
      Therefore, our group has developed a robotic assessment of sensory processing. This study is&#xD;
      set up to obtain detailed information on how healthy controls perform on this task. This&#xD;
      information can then help in identifying abnormal performances (i.e. upper limb sensory&#xD;
      problems) in stroke patients. We aim to examine 40 healthy younger adults and 40 healthy&#xD;
      older adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 70% of stroke survivors show upper limb impairments consisting of motor and/or&#xD;
      somatosensory impairments. These impairments often persist well into the chronic stage, and&#xD;
      may lead to significant limitations in activities of daily living and may negatively affect&#xD;
      quality of life. It is therefore of utmost importance to accurately assess upper limb&#xD;
      impairments. Clinical assessments exist for both motor and somatosensory function, but lack&#xD;
      good psychometric properties. Robotic technology show promising potential and is readily&#xD;
      available to assess motor function and proprioception. Robotic assessment for sensory&#xD;
      processing is currently not yet available, despite being the most relevant somatosensory&#xD;
      function. Indeed, sensory processing shows the strongest association with upper limb&#xD;
      movement, and only shows incomplete recovery at 6 months after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has recently developed a novel robotic assessment of sensory processing, using the&#xD;
      Kinarm End-Point Lab (BKIN Technologies Ltd., Canada). This cross-sectional study is set up&#xD;
      to collect a large amount of data from healthy controls, in order to obtain reference values&#xD;
      for future research and to serve as control data for comparison with stroke patients. 40&#xD;
      younger healthy adults and 40 older healthy adults will be recruited and will undergo&#xD;
      extensive clinical and robotic assessment of upper limb motor and somatosensory function, as&#xD;
      well as cognitive function. This study also allows to investigate possible age-related&#xD;
      decline in task performance, as well as investigation of the role of cognition in performance&#xD;
      on this novel task.&#xD;
