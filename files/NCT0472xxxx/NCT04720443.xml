             results of the study may be permitted on a case by case basis following approval by&#xD;
             the investigator and the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;

             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with history of hepatitis, or positive result at screening for hepatitis B&#xD;
             surface antigen (HepBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HepBcAb), hepatitis C antibody&#xD;

             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Blood donation (excluding plasma donations) of approximately 450 mL or more within 60&#xD;
             days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin induced thrombocytopenia (if heparin is&#xD;
             used to flush intravenous catheters used during serial blood collections).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
         16. Any other medical or psychiatric condition that may interfere with the interpretation&#xD;
             of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject&#xD;
             inappropriate for study participation.&#xD;
