  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases rapidly in recent&#xD;
      decades. NAFLD has become a major public health problem in the whole world, and it is&#xD;
      considered as the main cause for the chronic liver diseases (Feng, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eslam et al. (2020) recently published an international expert consensus statement about a&#xD;
      new definition of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) to replace&#xD;
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new nomenclature of MAFLD is based on the presence of steatosis in &gt;5% of hepatocytes and&#xD;
      the absence of excessive alcohol consumption or other causes of chronic liver disease,&#xD;
      diagnosis of MAFLD could be established on the presence of hepatic steatosis in combination&#xD;
      with one of the following three criteria: overweight/obesity; presence of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus; or evidence of metabolic dysregulation (Eslam et al. (2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic dysregulation is defined as having at least 2 of the following metabolic risk&#xD;
      abnormalities: high waist circumference, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, pre-diabetes,&#xD;
      insulin resistance, and high plasma C-reactive protein levels (Eslam et al. (2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      New diagnostic criteria for MAFLD were proposed, in which hepatic steatosis (HS) detected&#xD;
      either by imaging techniques, blood biomarkers/scores or by liver histology (Bedogni et al.,&#xD;
      2006; Wong et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, NAFLD is commonly associated with one or more component of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia and is defined as the presence&#xD;
      of ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis in histological examination without evidence of hepatocellular&#xD;
      injury such as hepatocyte ballooning (Chalasani et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 20% of patients with NAFLD develop non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which may&#xD;
      progress to cirrhosis, however the most common cause of death in NAFLD patients is&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD is the third most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (Matteoni et al., 1999; Chalasani et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple fatty liver with little inflammation to&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver inflammation and fibrosis. The global&#xD;
      prevalence of NAFLD is about 25.2% whereas the limited number of studies from Africa reports&#xD;
      13% (Younossi et al., 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Burned out&quot; NAFLD can be a hidden cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. So, early diagnosis, and&#xD;
      treatment of NAFLD and underlying predisposing factors are important to avoid liver damage&#xD;
      which may progress to liver cell failure (Paul, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD is strongly associated with MS and is currently considered as the hepatic manifestation&#xD;
      of MS. In addition, obesity is a common risk factor for NAFLD (fan et al., 2008; Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Medina-Santillán et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liver is not only the largest metabolic organ, but also it act as an immunological organ.&#xD;
      Immune cells including liver resident macrophages )Kupffer cells, KCs( and lymphocytes&#xD;
      account for 10-20% of total cells in the liver (Racanelli et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These immune cells cross the blood from gastrointestinal tract, which contains abundant&#xD;
      antigens from outside and sometime pathogens under pathological conditions, to maintain a&#xD;
      unique immune tolerance microenvironment (Racanelli et al., 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, when excessive fat deposited in the hepatocytes and metabolic status was changed,&#xD;
      the immune microenvironment was found to be also changed. Numerous studies indicated that&#xD;
      different immune cells in the liver (both innate and adaptive) played critical roles in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH(Feng, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innate immune system includes KCs/infiltrated macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells&#xD;
      (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, while adaptive immune system includes conventional T cells,&#xD;
      natural killer T (NKT) cells and B cells(Feng, 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith et al. (2003) examined healthy human donor livers and detected the B cells located in&#xD;
      the portal tracts and those scattered throughout the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B cells are specialized adaptive immune cells producing antibodies, it can also secrete&#xD;
      cytokines and regulate the activation and function of other cells. Little studies focused on&#xD;
      the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, especially direct effects. One study showed&#xD;
      that increased production of T-helper 1 cell (Th1) cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-a, which&#xD;
      were found in intrahepatic B cells in mice fed with high-fat diet. These cytokines may&#xD;
      promote Th1 cell differentiation and contribute to inflammation in NAFLD (Zhang et al.,&#xD;
      2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As regard role of B cells in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MS) which promote&#xD;
      inflammation in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through modulation of T-cell&#xD;
      function and an inflammatory cytokine profile and they also promote insulin resistance (IR)&#xD;
      through the production of pathogenic IgG2a. Meanwhile, B cells can regulate T cells via a&#xD;
      major histocompatibility complex-dependent manner and promote inflammation mediated by T&#xD;
      cells in both obese mice and T2DM patients (Jagannathan et al., 2009; Winer et al., 2011;&#xD;
      DeFuria et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAFLD is strongly associated with MS and is currently considered as the hepatic manifestation&#xD;
      of MS. In addition, obesity is a common risk factor for NAFLD (fan et al., 2008; Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Medina-Santillán et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surprisingly, IgA, which is mainly produced by B cells, has been reported to be positively&#xD;
      related to the stages of fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. The B cell activating factor&#xD;
      (BAFF), which regulates the development and maturation of B cells, was found to be increased&#xD;
      in the serum of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). All these results&#xD;
      indicate that there are systemic changes in B cells in patients with NAFLD (Kim et al., 2009;&#xD;
      Miyake et al., 2013; McPherson et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the changes in humoral factors in NAFLD and the roles of B cells in MS, we&#xD;
      hypothesized that B cells might participate in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. So, our study aimed&#xD;
      to focus on B cells, to investigate its general changes and their functions in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of the disease.&#xD;

    <description>4-Evaluation of the Frequency of regulatory B cells (Bregs) by Flow Cytometry Using flow cytometry, circulating Bregs will be detected using FITC-conjugated-CD38, PE-conjugated-CD24 (Bioscience, USA), and PerCP-conjugated CD19 (BD Bioscience, USA). Briefly, 100 µl of blood sample will be incubated with 10 µL of CD24, CD38 and CD19 for 20 minutes at 4 °C in the dark. Following incubation, RBCs will be lysed and washed. Cells will be fixed and permeabilized then stained with APC-conjugated IL-10 (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) and analysis will be done by FACS Calibur flow cytometry with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).&#xD;
An isotype-matched negative control will be used for each sample. Forward and side scatter histograms will be used to define the lymphocytes population. CD19+ IL-10+ B cells will be gated, then the expression of CD38 and CD24 on the CD19+B cells will be detected. Bregs will be identified as CD19+ IL-10+CD24+hiCD38+hi cells.</description>
