  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine children's eating behavior. The study will enroll approximately 400&#xD;
      participants (200 child/parent pairs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At certain time points, participants will engage in activities involving the presentation of&#xD;
      food and the observation of behavioral responses to these presentations, as well as the&#xD;
      completion of questionnaires&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a complex, long term investigation of the relationships between&#xD;
      children's eating behaviors, and parent-child interaction during eating and their&#xD;
      associations with BMI and dietary intake. It builds on earlier observational research which,&#xD;
      like this research, had small experimental components used to classify children into&#xD;
      different phenotypic groups based on different responses to the experimental conditions. The&#xD;
      small activities and experiments of this follow up study constitute a trial as defined by&#xD;
      NIH, registered here. The exploratory outcomes measured from these activities are not listed&#xD;
      in this registration for reasons of scientific integrity. To be clear, the bigger structure&#xD;
      of this research is essentially an observational follow up study with the same children who&#xD;
      were previously studied as infants. The goal of the project is to identify potential future&#xD;
      intervention targets.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The research will generate demographic, behavioral, videorecorded, and anthropometric data. (Note the researchers will not make video data available). Meta data will also be included in the selected repositories. Of note, this will include only child age, but not birthdate or date of study visit as these would violate confidentiality. The metadata will include the data dictionaries, which describe the generation of all variables.</ipd_description>
