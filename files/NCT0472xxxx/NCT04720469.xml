    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-centre, prospective, single-arm, open-label, 12-week pilot trial&#xD;
      assessing the safety and preliminary efficacy of a second MR-guided focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (MRgFUS) thalamotomy on the naïve brain hemisphere after 48 weeks or more of the first MRgFUS&#xD;
      thalamotomy in patients with medication-refractory ET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the Focused Ultrasound Centre of Excellence at Sunnybrook&#xD;
      Health Sciences Centre/University of Toronto.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are medication-refractory for ET often require a surgical option to relieve&#xD;
      symptoms of ET and improve quality of life. To-date, unilateral MRgFUS has been beneficial in&#xD;
      providing patients with some of relief from tremor. However, tasks that require two hands&#xD;
      remain a challenge for many patients. Historical risks of bilateral treatment have been an&#xD;
      impediment to complete tremor relief. The introduction of MRI and current stereotactic&#xD;
      methodologies has significantly reduced the probability of non-target tissue injury. In this&#xD;
      study, a second MRgFUS thalamotomy will be performed in a cohort of patients who have already&#xD;
      successfully undergone unilateral MRgFUS treatment. Tremor severity, speech, balance, gait,&#xD;
      and cognition will be assessed during baseline and follow up visits.&#xD;
