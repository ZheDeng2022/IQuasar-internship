  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is an independent risk factor for venous thrombosis (VTE), which leads to a&#xD;
      significant increase in the mortality and disability rate after stroke. For patients with&#xD;
      high risk factors for VTE such as advanced age, paralysis, infection, dehydration, etc., the&#xD;
      incidence of death and disability is higher. Studies have shown that the incidence of deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis in bedridden ischemic stroke patients is about 20%, and the incidence of&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism is about 2%, and causes 10% of post-stroke deaths. In order to prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of VTE, the American Heart Association, the American Stroke Association, the&#xD;
      Cerebrovascular Disease Group of the Neurology Branch of the Chinese Medical Association,&#xD;
      etc. pointed out in the guidelines that heparin or low molecular weight heparin should be&#xD;
      used for stroke patients with &quot;restricted mobility&quot; or &quot;incapable mobility&quot; to prevent VTE.&#xD;
      For patients with evidence of thrombosis or symptoms of DVT, antithrombotic therapy should be&#xD;
      initiated immediately. Paradoxically, ischemic stroke significantly increases the risk of&#xD;
      cerebral hemorrhage. Besides There is an increased risk of primary intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      (ICH) associated with aspirin or antiplatelet agent monotherapy and it is difficult to&#xD;
      achieve a balance between preventing blood clots and reducing the risk of bleeding&#xD;
      complications. In addition, stroke patients are elderly and have speech and intellectual&#xD;
      impairment, and the non-specific symptoms and signs of intracranial hemorrhage caused by&#xD;
      improper antithrombotic therapy make the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis extremely&#xD;
      high. Therefore, clarifying the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with VTE and&#xD;
      launching targeted interventions to effectively balance the risk of anti-thrombosis and&#xD;
      bleeding have become the key to improving the prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is based on real-world data to study the bleeding risk and antithrombotic&#xD;
      treatment options in VaS (1) the risk factors associated with hemorrhage in patients with VTE&#xD;
      after stroke; and (2) the characteristics and pharmacotherapeutics regimen of high-risk&#xD;
      populations with VTE after stroke; and(3) the Optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen for&#xD;
      patients with VTE after stroke, including the timing of starting and stopping the&#xD;
      antithrombotic treatment, selection of varieties, dosage, and course of treatment, etc.&#xD;
