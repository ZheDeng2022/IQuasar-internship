  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage, is one of the most deadly complication of pregnancy worldwide and&#xD;
      major cause of maternal mortality especially in third world countries .1 PPH affects about 5%&#xD;
      of all women giving birth around the world 2 .Primary PPH is defined as ≥500 mL blood loss&#xD;
      after vaginal delivery or ≥1000 mL after CS delivery within 24 hours after birth1 . Globally,&#xD;
      almost one quarter of all maternal deaths are linked with PPH 2. Due to the high prevalence&#xD;
      of anemia among pregnant women in low-resource settings, the outcome of PPH is often&#xD;
      deteriorated, resulting in damaging health consequences 3. Roughly in 70% of cases of primary&#xD;
      pph are due to uterine atony11. Uterine atony is due to loss of contraction and retraction of&#xD;
      myometrial muscle fibers can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock. There are several reasons&#xD;
      behind uterine atony including maternal anemia, fatigue due to prolong labour and rapid&#xD;
      forceful labour. Blood loss is double in caesarean section due to use of increased anesthetic&#xD;
      agents4. According to WHO use of oxytocin (10 IU, IM /IV) is recommended for prevention of&#xD;
      PPH for all births2. Despite its effectiveness, 10-40% of cases need additional uterotonics&#xD;
      to ensure good uterine contraction.5 After oxytocin , Misoprostol is increasingly known as a&#xD;
      potential treatment option for PPH 5 .Misoprostol is easily available , rapid acting , and&#xD;
      cost effective with minimal side effects, however in caesarean section owing to the effect of&#xD;
      anesthesia limits its use . In recent study conducted at Egypt, oxytocin plus misoprostol&#xD;
      (study group) is compared with oxytocin alone (control group). Incident of pph was&#xD;
      significantly lower in study group (p=0.018), as in study group (1.33%) than control group&#xD;
      (6.67%)8. Misoprostol is an autacoid substance and act better if placed closed to target&#xD;
      organ 9. Several routes of misoprostol, with or without oxytocin, and its result on&#xD;
      intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage are described in the literature. The practice of&#xD;
      misoprostol by the intrauterine route during caesarean section is under trial.10. Aim of&#xD;
      study is to observe the effectiveness of intrauterine misoprostol in addition to oxytocin to&#xD;
      minimize the blood loss during caesarean section.&#xD;

      Data will be collected from all the patients full filling inclusion criteria on especially&#xD;
      designed Performa after informed consent of patient, demographic data will be collected on&#xD;
      that preform Patients will be randomized and divide in to two groups group A ( study group )&#xD;
      and group B (controls) , patients under group A will be given 600 microgram misoprostol&#xD;
      through intra uterine route during lower segment caesarean section after delivery of placenta&#xD;
      in addition to oxytocin 10IU IV and Group B (control) only oxytocin 10IU IV will be given&#xD;
      according to WHO protocol .In both groups pre-operative hemoglobin done within 24 hours&#xD;
      before the surgery will be recorded and compared with post-operative hemoglobin estimated by&#xD;
      blood sample taken 48 hours after the surgery .Mean blood loss during caesarean section will&#xD;
      be documented by counting the number of towels , need of additional drugs (repeat oxytocin,&#xD;
      tranexamic acid, additional misoprostol) ,time of contractility of uterus, blood transfusion,&#xD;
      side effects of misoprostol that is fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting will be recorded 24&#xD;
      hours postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the collected data will be entered and analyzed by SPSS v. 21. Mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation will be calculated for quantitative variables like age, gestational age, BMI, pre&#xD;
      and post Hb, and blood loss during caesarean section. Frequencies along with percentages will&#xD;
      be presented for qualitative variables like need of additional drugs, and side effects of&#xD;
      misoprostol (fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting). Paired sample t-test will be used to&#xD;
      compare pre and post Hb levels of both groups. Independent sample t-test will be applied to&#xD;
      compare post Hb level, blood loss between both groups. Chi-square test will be employed to&#xD;
      compare side effects (fever, shivering, nausea, vomiting) between both groups. P-value ≤ 0.05&#xD;
      will be taken as significant.&#xD;
