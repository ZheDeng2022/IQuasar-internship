  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases. Little change in morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      has occurred despite improvements in pharmacotherapy. In the last few decades, there has been&#xD;
      an increase in the prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases. The precise cause for&#xD;
      this increase in disease prevalence is not known but it has coincided with changes to the&#xD;
      quality of indoor air with increases in the levels of allergens and pollutants. Bedroom&#xD;
      exposure to dust-mite allergens has been linked to worsening asthma symptoms and increase in&#xD;
      bronchial responsiveness. In places where dust mites cannot thrive, allergens from cat,&#xD;
      cockroach and Alternaria assume importance. High indoor temperatures and humidity may, by a&#xD;
      number of mechanisms, increase the allergenic burden, particularly the proliferation of&#xD;
      house-dust mites and moulds. Therefore, modern living conditions are associated with a higher&#xD;
      risk of allergen exposure causing increase in sensitisation and symptoms of asthma. In&#xD;
      addition to allergens, the indoor environment contains other biological materials (such as&#xD;
      microbiome and endotoxin), and pollutants (gases and particulate matter) which can adversely&#xD;
      affect asthma development and morbidity. Indoor pollutants include smoke from cigarettes and&#xD;
      wood, coal or gas fires, particulate materials associated with bio-fuel combustion, chemical&#xD;
      vapours and gases including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde and volatile organic&#xD;
      compounds (VOCs). The latter may come from sources including building products, cleaning&#xD;
      agents, and paints. One such VOC is formaldehyde, which can be irritant to both upper and&#xD;
      lower respiratory tract. Small particulate matter (PM2.5) is particularly damaging as it gets&#xD;
      to the small airways of the lung. Major indoor sources of NO2 and particulate matter include&#xD;
      gas stoves and cigarette smoke but outdoor sources such as traffic and industrial pollution&#xD;
      can also contaminate indoor environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been suggested that exposure to pollutants can potentiate the effects of&#xD;
      allergen. Indeed, a combination of high levels of indoor pollution and allergens is causally&#xD;
      related to the development and severity of asthma. Allergens, microbiome and pollutants can&#xD;
      interact with each other to augment the immune response leading to harmful effects on the&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, indoor air pollution is a significant environmental trigger for acute exacerbation of&#xD;
      asthma (and other respiratory conditions such as COPD), leading to increasing symptoms,&#xD;
      emergency department visits, hospital admissions and even mortality. An estimated 75% of&#xD;
      hospital admissions for asthma are avoidable. Maintaining high air quality with lower levels&#xD;
      of allergens and pollutants is therefore important in improving the health of individuals&#xD;
      with asthma and other respiratory diseases. Therefore, a feasible and practical intervention&#xD;
      that can reduce allergen and pollutant levels in the indoor air should reduce morbidity and&#xD;
      improve asthma control.&#xD;
