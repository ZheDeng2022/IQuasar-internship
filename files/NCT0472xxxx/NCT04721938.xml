  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The detrimental effect of overweight and obesity on fecundity has been well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to investigate the intervention program for weight loss before&#xD;
      fertility treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently to gain knowledge on the effect of overweight/obesity and weight loss on the&#xD;
      vaginal microbiome, on DNA damage on sperm cells, on the occurrence of endocrine disruptors&#xD;
      in the endometrium, and on the gene expression in the endometrium.&#xD;

      Purpose and aim of the study The Fertility Clinic at Zealand University Hospital wishes to&#xD;
      introduce a new care concept: 'Healthy Parents - Healthy Children´ with the purpose of&#xD;
      changing the behaviours of infertile men and women towards a healthier life style now and for&#xD;
      future generations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Zealand Region includes areas of significant deprivation compared to Copenhagen and has a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of obesity and poor diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These inequalities generate socio-demographic and long-term health challenges, decrease the&#xD;
      chance of becoming pregnant and increase risk of life style related diseases for parents and&#xD;
      their offspring in the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The waiting time before fertility treatment (12 months in the region) represents a unique&#xD;
      window of opportunity to encourage long-term life style changes. The aforementioned reasons&#xD;
      initiated the planned Preconception Clinic 'Healthy Parents - Healthy Children´.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Preconception Clinic utilises waiting list time to optimise parental health prior to&#xD;
      conception. We will provide weight loss interventions aimed at helping the patients to a&#xD;
      healthier lifestyle, an increased chance of conception and a decreased risk of life style&#xD;
      diseases for themselves and their future offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient weight loss of at least 10% at the end of intervention and at annular follow up until&#xD;
      5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Sub-fertile population referred to the Fertility Clinic Region Zealand due&#xD;
      to infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 women and 20 men with a BMI&gt;30, age 18-40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inability to understand the written and oral information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and end of intervention-sampling:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood tests (metabolic markers), blood tests for Biobank and for miRNA biomarkers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Urine sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Women: Endometrial biopsy and vaginal swab for microbiome testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Men: Sperm sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Weight reduction through life style changes in diet and exercise by the&#xD;
      following means:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Counselling with a Nutritionist Nurse on diet and exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Online smartphone coaching program (LifeSum-App)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motivational and adjustment dialogue and counselling with Nutritionist Nurse including&#xD;
           anthropometric measures every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Weight loss of at least 10%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated impact The aim of this study is to find a feasible intervention that can change&#xD;
      adverse life styles in a preconception setting. Elements from the weight loss intervention&#xD;
      can be incorporated to the broader community, for instance as Preconception weight loss&#xD;
      packages in the local municipalities, aimed at optimizing health before conception in the&#xD;
      general fertile population.&#xD;
