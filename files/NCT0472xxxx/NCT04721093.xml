  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study has two goals. The first is to see if the cognitive improves when VA and CA&#xD;
      are stimulated in MCI patients, and the second is to do an explanatory data analysis to see&#xD;
      if that improves cognitive in relation to the rCBF improvement.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed codsent sill undergo a 1 day screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Subjects who pass the screening test will receive a registration number within 7 days&#xD;
      and proceed with the pre-intervention test as follows.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Korean Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA is a validated, instrument assessing overall cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. Possible scores range from 0 to 30(Higher numbers indicate better cognitive function). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT) z-score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SPECT is a validated, instrument assessing regional Cerebral Blood Flow(rCBF). Possible scores range from -6.5 to 6.5. The score indicates how far the data value is from the means for each region from the normal database. Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The verbal learning test(VLT) score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The VLT is a validated, instrument assessing memory domain. The VLT is a task in which the examiner reads 12 words and the subject is immediately asked to remember as many words as possible. Possible scores range from 0 to 12(Higher numbers indicate better). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The trail making test(TMT) score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The TMT is a validated, instrument assessing frontal/executive functions domain, requires the subject to draw a line that alternates between numbers and days of the week in a consecutive manner.&#xD;
The score is calculated by subtracting the number of errors from the total time it took to complete the test. And the score is converted to %ile(0 to 100) based on the normal database and changed(Higher numbers indicate better). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Boston naming test(BNT) score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The BNT is a validated, instrument assessing visual confrontation naming. BNT assesses the naming ability using 60 black and white images that are organized. The subject is asked to name what is depicted in the image. Possible scores range from 0 to 60(Higher numbers indicate better). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rey complex figure test(RCFT)-'copy' score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The RCFT 'copy' is a validated, instrument assessing visuo-constructive abilities. The RCFT 'copy' requires the subject to observe and replicate an image. The score is scored as 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 for each of the 18 factors. Point 2 is when the shape and position of the element is accurately drawn, point 1 is when one of the shape or position is correct. Point 0.5 is when both the shape and position are incorrect, but the examinee can determine what the subject was trying to draw, and point 0 is the case when the shape and position difference are both inadequate, and when the element is not drawn. The total score is the sum of the scores scored for each of the 18 elements; It is possible scores range from 0 to 36(Higher numbers indicate better). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rey complex figure test(RCFT)-'Immediate Recall' score change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The RCFT 'immediate recall' is a validated, instrument assessing visuo-constructive memory abilities. The RCFT 'immediate recall' requires the subject to flip the page and replicate the image. The score is scored as 0, 0.5, 1 or 2 for each of the 18 factors. Point 2 is when the shape and position of the element is accurately drawn, point 1 is when one of the shape or position is correct. Point 0.5 is when both the shape and position are incorrect, but the examinee can determine what the subject was trying to draw, and point 0 is the case when the shape and position difference are both inadequate, and when the element is not drawn. The total score is the sum of the scores scored for each of the 18 elements; It is possible scores range from 0 to 36(Higher numbers indicate better). Change=(week 8 score-baseline score).</description>

    <description>In this study, PBM was applied using a machine made to be attached to the subject in the form of a probe. In this clinical trial, a low-intensity irradiation device (Color-DNA-WSF U) from Color seven was used to deliver visible light (610nm± 10nm wavelength, 3.0mW/㎠±20%) irradiation. PBM was applied 5 times a week for 8 weeks, 30 minutes per session.</description>
