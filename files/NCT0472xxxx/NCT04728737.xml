  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After acute stroke, 25âˆ¼45% of patients show difficulties in swallowing, which is associated&#xD;
      with a high risk of pneumonia, malnutrition, and mortality. In addition to traditional&#xD;
      swallowing therapies for post-stroke dysphagia (PSD), the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument&#xD;
      (IOPI) is used to provide tongue exercise program which improving swallowing function.&#xD;
      Additionally, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is also beneficial to manage PSD.&#xD;
      In rehabilitation unit, ultrasound is a convenient tool and is more widely used in&#xD;
      investigating oropharyngeal muscles mass and quality in PSD. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      hope to assess the effects on swallowing function and oropharyngeal muscle mass on sonography&#xD;
      after IOPI swallowing training and neuromuscular electrical stimulation in PSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, the investigators will enroll 20 normal people, whose ages should be from 40-80 years&#xD;
      old, to verify the inter-rater and intra-rater reliability of sonography and use IOPI to&#xD;
      assess maximal muscle strength and endurance of oropharyngeal muscles. Second, 40 stroke&#xD;
      patients with different levels in dysphagia will be enrolled. Each patient will receive&#xD;
      clinical assessments of swallowing and tongue functions, general and oropharyngeal muscles&#xD;
      mass and quality by sonography, and life quality. These stroke patients with dysphagia will&#xD;
      be randomly allocated in two groups. the investigators will provide two interventions&#xD;
      including combined simple and IOPI therapies(n=20), and combined swallowing therapy with&#xD;
      NMES(n=20) for the 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the differences of swallowing and tongue functions,&#xD;
      oropharyngeal muscles on sonography in patients with PSD. The effects of the swallowing&#xD;
      therapies in swallowing function, oropharyngeal muscle mass, and life quality will be&#xD;
      explored in PSD by using different swallowing therapies. The investigators will find out the&#xD;
      most effective swallowing therapy from these 2 interventions for PSD. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators could explore that sonography is a clinically practical tool for assessing&#xD;
      oropharyngeal muscles mass and quality in PSD.&#xD;
