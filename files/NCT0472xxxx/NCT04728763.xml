  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common opportunistic mold found in lung fungal infections&#xD;
      in humans. Aspergillus is the cause of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with a poor prognosis&#xD;
      in immunocompromised patients and the chronic pulmonary aspergillosis which affects 3 million&#xD;
      patients worldwide, with underlying pulmonary pathologies such as tuberculosis and its&#xD;
      sequelae. The medicinal means to fight against these different forms are limited and not very&#xD;
      effective. In addition, the emergence of resistance makes the search for new therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies of major importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interaction between the fungal spore and our innate immune system is the first step&#xD;
      leading to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The innate immune system is made up of cellular immunity and humoral immunity. While the&#xD;
      first is well described, the second, consisting of soluble mediators, is essential for&#xD;
      anti-aspergillus immunity but relatively little studied. The study of soluble mediators&#xD;
      present in the alveolar fluid interacting directly with the Aspergillus spore would make it&#xD;
      possible to analyze the first stages of infection. The analysis of the proteome present in&#xD;
      the bronchoalveolar lavage of uninfected patients, suffering from various forms of&#xD;
      aspergillosis and suffering from other types of infections would make it possible to&#xD;
      highlight the essential and specific components of anti- immunity aspergillary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to analyze the protein profiles of innate immunity in the&#xD;
      pulmonary alveoli in the absence or presence of Aspergillus or non-fungal infection in order&#xD;
      to highlight the soluble mediators of the more specific immunity of the Aspergillosis.&#xD;
