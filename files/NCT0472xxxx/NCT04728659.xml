    <textblock>
      Progestin primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) has been shown to be effective in avoiding&#xD;
      premature spontaneous ovulation, without affecting the number of retrieved oocytes or the&#xD;
      quality of the embryos obtained. The utilization of progestins permits lower costs, an easier&#xD;
      administration (oral assumption instead of injections) and a tight control over LH levels.&#xD;
      Hence the PPOS may be a valid alternative to the standard ovarian stimulation protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, it may be anticipated some degree of superiority of PPOS in particular&#xD;
      categories of patients: donors, women at risk of OHSS, women who preserve their as well as&#xD;
      poor responder or suboptimal responders for whom oocytes/embryo accumulation or double&#xD;
      ovarian stimulation protocols are proposed The aim of this trial will be to investigate the&#xD;
      use of Desogestrel in controlling the LH surge during ovarian stimulation in IVF/ICSI cycles.&#xD;
      This study is a noninferiority trial in which the the primary efficacy endpoint will be the&#xD;
      number of oocytes retrieved per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was performed with the assumptions that the non-inferiority margin is&#xD;
      corresponding to three or less oocytes . With the objective to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      difference in average number of oocytes retrieved between the Desogestrel and the ganirelix&#xD;
      groups would not exceed three, the power for a comparison between the two groups would be&#xD;
      equal to 87% for 75 evaluable patients in each treatment groups (for an allocation of 1:1 and&#xD;
      a total sample size of 150). To allocate at least 150 patients, an additional 10% to cover&#xD;
      possible dropping out were planned to allocate. A total of 165 patients will be included in&#xD;
      this study Patients will be assigned to either the study or the control group. The study&#xD;
      group will be administered follitropin alfa (Bemfola 150-225 IU/die) and Desogestrel&#xD;
      (Cerazette 75 mcg daily ) will be started on stimulation day 7 or when the leading follicle&#xD;
      will reach 14 mm, whichever comes first. An antagonist protocol will be used for the control&#xD;
      group. Patients will be administered follitropin alfa (Bemfola 150 - 225 IU/die) and&#xD;
      Ganirelix (Orgalutran 0.25 mg/die) will be started on stimulation day 7 or when the leading&#xD;
      follicle will reach 14 mm, whichever comes first. When a diameter of 18 mm is reached, the&#xD;
      final stage of oocyte maturation will be triggered with triptorelin 0.2 mg + hCG 1000 U s.c.&#xD;
      Fertilization of the aspirated oocytes will be carried out in vitro, by either conventional&#xD;
      insemination or ICSI, depending on semen parameters. Viable embryos will be then frozen by&#xD;
      means of vitrificaton on the day in which they will reach the blastocyst developmental stage.&#xD;

      Study design A prospective controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be conducted to&#xD;
      assess the non inferiority of Desogestrel (75 mcg) versus a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol&#xD;
      with ganirelix (0.25 mg/day) in ovarian stimulation cycles.All partecipants will provide&#xD;
      informed consent after counselling for infertility treatments and routine IVF procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective non-inferiority trial. Given the possibility of dropouts, the&#xD;
      study will be designed to include a total of 165 patients Patients will be recruited&#xD;
      consecutively and allocated to one of the two groups in alternating manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size The number of oocytes retrieved will be the primary efficacy endpoint of the&#xD;
      study. Sample size calculation was performed with the assumptions that the non-inferiority&#xD;
      margin is corresponding to three or less oocytes . With the objective to demonstrate that the&#xD;
      difference in average number of oocytes retrieved between the Desogestrel and the ganirelix&#xD;
      groups would not exceed three, the power for a comparison between the two groups would be&#xD;
      equal to 87% for 75 evaluable patients in each treatment groups (for an allocation of 1:1 and&#xD;
      a total sample size of 150). To allocate at least 150 patients, an additional 10% to cover&#xD;
      possible dropping out were planned to allocate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovarian stimulation Patients will be screened using transvaginal ultrasound on menstrual&#xD;
      cycle day 2 to 3 . Patients will be then assigned to either the study or the control group.&#xD;
      The study group will be administered follitropin alfa ( Bemfola 150 - 225 UI/die) from day&#xD;
      2-3 onward. The initiating dose of follitropin alfa will be decided upon the antral follicle&#xD;
      count (AFC). After 4-5 days, ultrasound examination will be performed and the dose of FSH&#xD;
      will be adjusted according to follicle development. Ovulation inhibition will be performed&#xD;
      using Desogestrel (Cerazette, 75 mcg) starting on stimulation day 7 or when the leading&#xD;
      follicle will reach 14 mm, whichever comes first. When the dominant follicles will reach 18&#xD;
      mm in diameter, the final stage of oocyte maturation will be triggered with triptorelin&#xD;
      (Decapetyl) 0.2 mg s.c and serum FSH, LH, E2 and P concentrations will be measured using&#xD;
      patients' blood tests on the same day of oocyte maturation. Transvaginal ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      oocyte retrieval will be conducted 34 - 36 hours after trigger. All follicles with diameter&#xD;
      of more than 10 mm will be retrieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An antagonist protocol will be used for the control group. Patients will be administered&#xD;
      follitropin alfa (Bemfola 150 - 225 IU/die) from day 2-3 onward, with the dose of FSH&#xD;
      administration based on the same criteria as for the study group. After 4-5 days, ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will be performed and the dose of FSH will be adjusted according to follicle&#xD;
      development. Ovulation inhibition will be performed using ganirelix (Orgalutran, 0.25 mg/die)&#xD;
      starting on stimulation day 7 or when the leading follicle will reach 14 mm, whichever comes&#xD;
      first. When dominant follicles reach 14 mm in diameter. When a diameter of 18 mm is reached,&#xD;
      the final stage of oocyte maturation will be triggered with triptorelin (Decapeptyl) 0.2 mg&#xD;
      s.c and serum FSH, LH, E2 and P concentrations will be measured using patients' blood tests&#xD;
      on the same day of oocyte maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fertilization of the aspirated oocytes will be carried out in vitro, by either conventional&#xD;
      insemination or ICSI, depending on semen parameters. According to the number and regularity&#xD;
      of the blastomers and the degree of embryonic fragmentation, good-quality embryos will be&#xD;
      frozen by means of vitrificaton on the third day after oocyte retrieval, and non-top quality&#xD;
      embryos will placed in extended culture, out of which good morphological grade blastocysts&#xD;
      were frozen on day 5.&#xD;
