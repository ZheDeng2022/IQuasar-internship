      Study participants will be randomly assigned to Test or Control group and the following&#xD;
      schedule will be followed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: metronidazole tablets + doxycycline hyclate tablets simulant are consecutively&#xD;
      taken for 14 days, while Fuke Qianjin capsule is consecutively taken for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: metronidazole tablets + doxycycline hyclate tablets, are consecutively taken&#xD;
      for 14 days, while Fuke Qianjin capsule simulation is consecutively taken for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fuke Qianjin Capsules and their simulants are taken as 2 capsules at a time, 3 times a day,&#xD;
      orally after breakfast, lunch and dinner, respectively; Metronidazole Tablets are taken as 2&#xD;
      tablets (0.2 g/tablet) at a time, twice a day, at the same time as breakfast and dinner,&#xD;
      respectively; Doxycycline Hyclate Tablet and their simulants are taken as 1 tablet (0.1&#xD;
      g/tablet, Doxycycline Hyclate Tablet calculated as C22H24N2O8) at a time, twice a day, at the&#xD;
      same time as breakfast and dinner, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scoring pain, symptoms, local signs, routine leucorrhea, cervical secretions, gynaecological&#xD;

    <description>Applying the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) i.e. 0-10 Numeric Pain Intensity Scale on a 10 cm line segment the pain will be assessed as 0 is painless, 10 is extremely painful. Patients will mark in the corresponding position according to the degree of pain, and the researcher will give a specific score. The grading criteria of Pelvic pain with VAS score will be, normal: 0 cm; mild: 1-3 cm; moderate: 4-6 cm; severe: 7-10 cm.</description>
