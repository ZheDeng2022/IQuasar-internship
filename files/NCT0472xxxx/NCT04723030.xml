      This trial will explore the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab combined with apatinib&#xD;
      mesylate and radiotherapy and chemotherapy (paclitaxel (albumin binding) combined with&#xD;
      gemcitabine and cisplatin) in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer in patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, observational, single-center, single-arm clinical&#xD;
      research.Conversion treatment lasted for a total of 12 weeks, with one treatment cycle every&#xD;
      two weeks.Carilizumab was administered every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were orally taken apatinib after meals and evaluated by DLT(3+3) in the first 2&#xD;
      cycles.The drugs were stopped for 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy.Before&#xD;
      radiotherapy, patients received 2 cycles of karyolizumab combined with apartinib and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was performed in the first week of cycle 3 with a total dose of&#xD;
      30Gy in five doses within one week.Imaging evaluation was conducted once every 6 weeks. If&#xD;
      the patients met the indications for surgical resection, the treatment was stopped&#xD;
