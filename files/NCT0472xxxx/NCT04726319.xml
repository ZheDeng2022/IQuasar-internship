      A complete family history (FH) may identify persons at high risk for certain conditions. They&#xD;
      can be offered genetic testing and life-saving screening and treatment. In practice, complete&#xD;
      FH is rarely collected or entered into the electronic medical record (EMR). The Family&#xD;
      History Screening Questionnaire is a survey patients complete to tell whether they are at&#xD;
      increased risk of specific cancers, heart disease or diabetes. We will test a new way to&#xD;
      record FH that includes an app to improve use of FH by family physicians and patients. The&#xD;
      strategy includes education for patients and physicians about the importance of FH; patient&#xD;
      completion of the FH questionnaire prior to appointments; and prompts in the EMR. We expect&#xD;
      this to help family physicians and patients interpret FH and make the best decisions. We will&#xD;
      assess the proportion of patients with new EMR FH information. We will explore if the&#xD;
      strategy increases appropriate referrals for screening and genetic consultation for those at&#xD;
      increased FH risk. We will also obtain patients' and physicians' feedback on this strategy.&#xD;
      This new approach may improve FH information exchange between patients and physicians,&#xD;
      encourage shared decision-making and reduce cancer deaths and chronic disease burden.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family history (FH) is one of the cornerstones of medicine, and provides a glimpse of the&#xD;
      genetic make-up of a family. Family physicians (FPs) are in an ideal position to identify&#xD;
      those at risk of harboring a genetic mutation requiring further genetics assessment. A&#xD;
      challenge in the family medicine clinic is obtaining an adequate FH to triage appropriate&#xD;
      patients for further assessment and management. Patients with an identified germline mutation&#xD;
      have a variety of therapeutic options including prophylactic surgeries and high risk&#xD;
      screening for hereditary cancer syndromes, cardiac devices for inherited cardiac conditions,&#xD;
      and intensive statin therapy for those with hypercholesterolemia, all of which can be&#xD;
      potentially life-saving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review showed that the application of systematic tools which enable information&#xD;
      gathering, improves FH accuracy and completeness. Patient-completed FH questionnaires are&#xD;
      gaining attention with evidence of reasonable completeness and accuracy. However, challenges&#xD;
      have been reported in incorporating these tools including uploading FH results into the EMR&#xD;
      and into management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the challenge of obtaining an adequate FH and triaging appropriate patients for&#xD;
      further assessment and possibly life-saving interventions, we propose to use a simple FH&#xD;
      questionnaire, the &quot;Family History Screening Questionnaire&quot;, which will be filled out by&#xD;
      patients electronically with the results integrated into the EMR to identify families at risk&#xD;
      of inherited diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overarching Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate an innovative strategy to collect family history (FH) and improve&#xD;
           personalized primary care. Strategies include: a novel Family History Screening&#xD;
           questionnaire (FHSQ) (app), provider alerts, seamless integration into the electronic&#xD;
           medical record (EMR), electronic clinical decision support through point-of-care tools,&#xD;
           and patient and provider education&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: to determine if this innovative strategy will increase the proportion&#xD;
           of intervention patients that have updated documentation of family history in the EMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objective: to describe contextual factors that may influence implementation of&#xD;
           this family history strategy into primary care. To explore whether the intervention led&#xD;
           to increased discussion about FH and resulted in more personalized screening/management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if increasing awareness of the importance of FH and facilitating&#xD;
      collection through a novel FH app with physician alerts, integration into the EMR, electronic&#xD;
      decision support and resources, is associated with: increased collection of FH in the EMR, FH&#xD;
      discussion by patients and clinicians and personalized, risk appropriate&#xD;
      screening/management. Development and implementation of this novel FH app and strategy have&#xD;
      the potential to improve FH information exchange between patients and primary care providers,&#xD;
      facilitate shared decision-making about personalized screening and management based on FH&#xD;
      risk, reduce cancer deaths and chronic disease burden and build the foundation for&#xD;
      personalized medicine.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive an invitation email prior to their scheduled clinical visit which includes information about the study, a link to the YouTube patient presentation, and a link to the consent form and questionnaire. Patients will be invited to fill out the questionnaire prior to their appointment. After patients complete the initial questionnaire, physicians will receive an EMR message on the day of patient's clinic visit alerting them that patient family history information is available and to complete the Family History Action Form. They will be prompted to respond to the message which will open the action form and ask what action the provider intends to take with this family history information. The form will then link to management support tools for use during the patient visit. All participants will attend their clinical visit after which they will receive a post-visit electronic survey regarding their clinical visit and whether family history was reviewed with their provider.</description>
