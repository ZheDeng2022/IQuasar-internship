    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the sedative and analgesic effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Midazolam/Ketamine melt compared to Midazolam melt alone or Ketamine melt alone in subjects&#xD;
      undergoing intraocular surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract surgery today is a highly effective and efficient procedure, with average times for&#xD;
      completion ranging around 15 minutes in duration. Patients undergoing cataract surgery are&#xD;
      typically given sedatives and often times pain medication (e.g. opioids) just prior to and&#xD;
      during the procedure. The overwhelming majority of patients are given these medications via&#xD;
      intravenous administration. The insertion of an IV line has been associated with patient&#xD;
      complaints of pain and bruising, and can increase the administrative burden on the clinical&#xD;
      staff. In addition to the national crisis surrounding opioid abuse, opioids have many&#xD;
      negative side effects during cataract surgery such as respiratory depression, dizziness,&#xD;
      nausea, and post- operative vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the side effects, improve patient satisfaction, and help surgical center flow the&#xD;
      Midazolam/Ketamine melt (MK Melt) has been suggested as an alternative to provide sedation&#xD;
      and analgesia in subjects undergoing minor outpatient surgery, such as cataract surgery. The&#xD;
      addition of ketamine should provide enough analgesia for the mild discomfort reported during&#xD;
      cataract surgery. This study is intended to evaluate the MK Melt and its ability to provide&#xD;
      an adequate level of both sedation and intraoperative pain control vs an active control.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This is a double masked study in which the doctor/nurse anesthetist evaluating the subject with the Ramsey scale will be masked to the treatment given. The subject will also be masked to the treatment group and the study/control drug.&#xD;
To keep the doctor/nurse anesthetist masked, the unmasked nurse will prepare the study/control drug and then administer it to the subject without unmasking the doctor/nurse anesthetist or the subject. The unmasked nurse will administer one 3/50mg MK melt, or one 3mg Midazolam melt, or one 50mg Ketamine melt sublingually based on the subject's randomization assignment.</masking_description>

    <description>The Doctor/Nurse Anesthetist will evaluate the subject's level of sedation on the&#xD;
Ramsey Sedation Scale. Adequate sedation demonstrated by a score of 2 or higher on the Ramsey Scale:&#xD;
Upon entering operative room (before being prepped and draped)&#xD;
Immediately post-op upon entering the PACU&#xD;
The Ramsey scale is:&#xD;
Patient is anxious and agitated or restless, or both&#xD;
Patient is co-operative, oriented, and tranquil&#xD;
Patient responds to commands only&#xD;
Patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus&#xD;
Patient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus&#xD;
Patient exhibits no response&#xD;
