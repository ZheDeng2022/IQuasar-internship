  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use fMRI to map movement activity in motor and somatosensory cortex&#xD;
      using enriched imagery in people with chronic tetraplegia. The investigators expect that&#xD;
      somatotopic organization of movement activity will be preserved in people with upper limb&#xD;
      impairments, which can be quantified using the strength, area, and location of sensorimotor&#xD;
      activity. Accurate mapping of the motor and somatosensory cortices using covert stimuli will&#xD;
      help guide brain-computer interface (BCI) electrode design and placement. Moreover, these&#xD;
      advanced mapping procedures will provide new insights into the functional interactions&#xD;
      between sensory and motor areas of the brain after injury or disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND: Advanced understanding of brain structure and function has improved the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, and spinal cord injury&#xD;
      (SCI). Over half a century ago, the pioneering studies of Penfield used electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of motor and sensory areas of cerebral cortex and revealed a distinct somatotopic&#xD;
      organization of the brain. Today, this and additional knowledge of neuronal coding functions&#xD;
      are being used to develop revolutionary devices that interface directly with motor and&#xD;
      sensory neurons in the brain to establish functional connections with prosthetic and&#xD;
      assistive devices. These so-called brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require electrodes to be&#xD;
      placed precisely in brain areas responsible for volitional control and sensation of limb&#xD;
      movements, particularly the arm and hand regions. Mapping those brain regions is possible&#xD;
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, such mapping studies are&#xD;
      difficult to perform in persons with motor and sensory impairments. People with ALS and SCI&#xD;
      have disrupted efferent and afferent pathways between the cortex and the limbs making it&#xD;
      necessary to rely on covert techniques, such as kinesthetic motor imagery, to map&#xD;
      sensorimotor brain activity in order to guide BCI electrode placement or to study cortical&#xD;
      plasticity resulting from injury or intervention. Challenges associated with brain mapping&#xD;
      after injury likely contribute to the widely varying reports regarding the extent and&#xD;
      prevalence of functional reorganization occurring in the brain following SCI. fMRI is a&#xD;
      non-invasive tool that allows for measurement of motor and sensory-related brain activity&#xD;
      with minimal risk to study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE: Restoration of upper limb function is a top priority for individuals with&#xD;
      tetraplegia. It is estimated that 236,000-327,000 people in the United States have a spinal&#xD;
      cord injury. Approximately 17% of people with SCI have high tetraplegia (injury at cervical&#xD;
      levels C1-C4) although this percentage has been increasing in recent years. People with high&#xD;
      tetraplegia are the most likely group to benefit from BCI-controlled neuroprosthetics,&#xD;
      although the covert mapping strategies developed in this proposal could be used to study&#xD;
      sensorimotor activation and plasticity in anyone with motor or sensory impairment including&#xD;
      amputation. Sophisticated, motorized prostheses are being developed that enable natural upper&#xD;
      limb movement and have advanced sensing capabilities. People with tetraplegia would like to&#xD;
      restore function to their own limbs using FES, but this technology needs further advancement&#xD;
      and does not replace sensation, which may still require a BCI. While FES research and&#xD;
      development continues, people with tetraplegia could take advantage of motorized prostheses&#xD;
      by mounting them to their wheelchair. Motorized prostheses can provide function comparable to&#xD;
      that of an intact limb, but a high degree-of-freedom control interface is needed and BCI is&#xD;
      one possible solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional neuroimaging can be used to guide BCI electrode placement in order to tap into&#xD;
      existing sensorimotor circuits. Imagery-based brain mapping also enables the study of&#xD;
      cortical plasticity which could be useful for understanding maladaptive cortical changes that&#xD;
      occur after injury or beneficial changes resulting from rehabilitation interventions. Just as&#xD;
      pre-surgical brain mapping may help identify individuals who are best suited for a BCI,&#xD;
      covert brain mapping in someone with motor and sensory impairments may inform the type of&#xD;
      rehabilitation paradigm that is most likely to have a benefit. The potential benefit of being&#xD;
      able to study cortical plasticity in the absence of movement or sensation is wide-reaching as&#xD;
      it could be applied to patients with SCI, amputation, stroke, neurodegenerative diseases like&#xD;
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or other sensorimotor impairment.&#xD;
