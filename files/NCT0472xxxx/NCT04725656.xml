  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Double-blind (for the two active arms), randomized, three-arm (two active and one control)&#xD;
      clinical trial investigating factors (e.g. nicotine concentration) influencing the success of&#xD;
      smoking cessation strategies and possible health risks related to nicotine salt vaping.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the clinic screening visit demographics, smoking (including the Fagerstr√∂m Test for&#xD;
      Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) Questionnaire) and medical history, concomitant medication, vital&#xD;
      signs, body mass index (BMI) and exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) will be assessed, and a&#xD;
      physical examination will be performed. Saliva samples will be collected for cotinine and&#xD;
      nicotine metabolite ratio (NMR) measurement, urine samples for urinary anabasine,&#xD;
      4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), nicotine metabolites, tobacco-specific&#xD;
      nitrosamines (TSNA), and VOC, and blood samples for genotyping, blood lipids, creatinine, and&#xD;
      glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization the open system vape device and the nicotine salt e-liquids will be&#xD;
      distributed to the participants of the two active arms. Use of e-liquids in the active arms&#xD;
      will be ad libitum during three months and will be monitored by returned empty e-liquid&#xD;
      bottles and by documentation of pods use by the participants using a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All groups will receive smoking cessation counseling at baseline, week 1, week 2 and week 4.&#xD;
      Visits at the center at baseline, week 4, and 3 months will include questionnaires regarding&#xD;
      TC and EC use, respiratory symptoms, liking, and adverse events, measurement of heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure, BMI, plasma HDL, LDL, creatinine and glucose, and measurement of urinary&#xD;
      TSNA, VOC and nicotine metabolites. For participants self-reporting TC abstinence, exhaled CO&#xD;
      validation and urinary anabasine and NNAL will be collected to verify tobacco abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits also assessing TC abstinence will take place at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
