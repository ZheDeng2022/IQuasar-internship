      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the EEG patterns and EKG recordings of participants with no meditation&#xD;
           experience with simply closing the eyes for 10 minutes followed by relaxing for 30&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the EEG patterns and EKG recordings of participants with no meditation&#xD;
           experience by simply closing the eyes for 10 minutes and then with guided Heartfulness&#xD;
           relaxation and meditation for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the baseline anxiety score through GAD-7 questionnaire, subjective experience&#xD;
           of all the participants through MEDEQ questionnaire that measures the depth of the&#xD;
           meditation experience after the session and correlate with the EEG patterns of the brain&#xD;
           and heart rate changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EEG and EKG data from the groups will be analyzed by the sleep specialist. EKG device data&#xD;
      for HRV and the EEG data will be correlated with the subjective depth of meditation&#xD;
      experience in both the groups&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurological correlates of states of mind during meditation have been studied with&#xD;
      Electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional MRIs for many decades. Meditation practices produce&#xD;
      distinct EEG brain waveforms, and this may be reflective of the overall subjective&#xD;
      experiences. Long term meditators using mindfulness have shown gamma activation on EEG&#xD;
      recordings. Practice of Yoganidra and Sahaja meditation have been reported to show increased&#xD;
      theta activity. Transcendental Meditation practices have shown alpha waves during meditative&#xD;
      periods. While most of the meditative practices may appear similar, there may be subtle&#xD;
      differences that might make them better suited for particular conditions. However, most of&#xD;
      the studies conducted were small, non-randomized and therefore the outcomes are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to conduct a randomized controlled prospective study using&#xD;
      Heartfulness meditation techniques. Heartfulness meditation practice is a simple heart-based&#xD;
      meditation practice that has been shown to improve burnout, emotional wellness and sleep. In&#xD;
      a younger subset of patients, it has also shown to increase the telomere length. However, the&#xD;
      neurological and physiological correlates of this practice have not been assessed. This study&#xD;
      will investigate whether using this novel approach of a heart-based meditation program leads&#xD;
      to measurable changes in the EEG and also whether there is any correlation with the waveforms&#xD;
      and the depth of meditation. This may provide an explanation from a neurological basis for&#xD;
      the improvement of certain wellness parameters such as sleep. In addition, meditation&#xD;
      practices have been shown to have positive benefits on cardiovascular system including heart&#xD;
      rate variability (HRV). Cardiovascular physiology measured by continuous electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG) monitoring is a non-invasive way of measuring HRV. In this study, a correlation of the&#xD;
      EEG and HRV with the subjective depth of meditation experience measured through meditation&#xD;
      depth questionnaire (MEDEQ) along with baseline anxiety score as measured by generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary outcome will be observing a change in EEG pattern of subjects who follow a&#xD;
           Heartfulness guided meditation as compared to unguided self-relaxation and meditation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The study team hypothesize that guided Heartfulness meditation will be associated with&#xD;
           deeper relaxed brain wave patterns - predominantly theta and delta waves - compared to&#xD;
           beta and alpha waves in unguided self-relaxation and meditation. The investigators&#xD;
           anticipate that subjects will perceive an increased depth of meditation during a guided&#xD;
           relaxation session compared to simply closing the eyes for the duration of the study.&#xD;
           Since participants have no prior meditation experience, the investigators hypothesize&#xD;
           that the first attempt at meditation is adequate to induce a relaxed state and EEG&#xD;
           changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. With regards to EKG changes, the study team hypothesize that there will be a reduction&#xD;
           in heart rate and increased beat-to-beat variability with guided meditation as compared&#xD;
           to unguided self-relaxation for the same duration.&#xD;

Group 1 participants with unguided session simply close their eyes for 10 minutes while EEG and EKG recordings are performed. Following 10 minutes, after briefly opening their eyes, they will be asked to relax with eyes closed for 30 minutes. After finishing the session, they fill out meditation depth questionnaire.&#xD;
Group 2 participants with guided sessions close their eyes for 10 minutes while EEG and EKG recordings are performed. Following 10 minutes, after briefly opening their eyes, they will be guided through relaxation and meditation session for 30 minutes with a Heartfulness trainer with continued recording.
