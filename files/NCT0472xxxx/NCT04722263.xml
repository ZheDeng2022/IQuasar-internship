      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiation therapy&#xD;
      (RT) in the treatment of unresected keloids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-institution pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) for the treatment of unresected keloids. The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      toxicity within 10 weeks of follow-up. Secondary endpoints will include cessation of growth&#xD;
      or shrinkage of keloids, symptomatic response, and impact on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -evaluate feasibility and safety of radiation therapy only for the treatment of unresected&#xD;
      keloids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate toxicity of RT for the treatment of unresected keloids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate response of keloids, either stability or decrease in size, after primary RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate symptomatic response of unresected keloids to primary RT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect on quality of life of primary RT for unresected keloids After&#xD;
           review of the literature on the use of RT for the treatment of keloids, both resected&#xD;
           and unresected, as well as input of expert opinion and clinical experience by the&#xD;
           study's radiation oncologists, the RT prescription dose for this study was selected to&#xD;
           be 15 Gy, which will be divided into 5 Gy fractions delivered daily over on 3&#xD;
           consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive RT using external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), delivered via either&#xD;
      electrons or megavoltage photons, or brachytherapy; RT modality will be based on the judgment&#xD;
      of the treating radiation oncologist. We estimate we will be able to recruit 15- 20 patients&#xD;
      in 6-12 months, thus we are aiming for a sample size of 15 patients. In successive intervals&#xD;
      of enrollment and treatment of 5 patients (i.e. after 5, 10, and 15 patients have been&#xD;
      enrolled), the study team will meet and perform interim analysis to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment. Investigators will discuss rates of toxicity and symptom management&#xD;
      observed up to that point and determine if the study dose or protocol needs to be altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated frequently (see study calendar) for treatment-related toxicities&#xD;
      using CTCAE v5.0 up to 1 year after completion of RT. Any adverse event will be considered by&#xD;
      the study investigators to evaluate the safety of the protocol and to determine whether&#xD;
      changes to the dosing regimen are required.&#xD;

The treatment dose of 15 Gy in 3 fractions will be prescribed to the 90% isodose line.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Clinically diagnosed keloid -Surgical excision of keloid is either contraindicated or&#xD;
             patient has declined treatment with surgical excision. Note: patients with keloids&#xD;
             that recurred after previous resection are eligible, as long as the current keloid is&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior RT to the area of interest that would result in overlap of radiation therapy&#xD;
             fields&#xD;
