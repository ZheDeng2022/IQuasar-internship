      The aim of this thesis is; The aim of this study is to examine the effect of web-based&#xD;
      training based on transtheoretic model on exercise behavior in patients with coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a randomized controlled trial. 114 patient who meet the conditions for&#xD;
      research will be included in the study. In collecting data, the Patient Information Form,&#xD;
      Exercise Change Phase Short Question Form, Exercise Change Processes Scale, Exercise Decision&#xD;
      Making Scale and Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale developed by the researcher will be used.&#xD;

      In the first interview, the patients in the experimental group will be collected data and&#xD;
      contact information will be obtained using the Patient Information Form, Exercise Change&#xD;
      Phase Short Question Form, Exercise Change Processes Scale, Exercise Decision Making Balance&#xD;
      Scale and Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale as a pre-test. Then, the patients will be given their&#xD;
      username and password to log into the website. The change stage of the patients will be&#xD;
      determined by the researcher with the Exercise Change Phase Short Question Form, and it will&#xD;
      be ensured that they reach the educational content prepared according to the transtheoretic&#xD;
      model. Motivating interviews will be provided for the patients to receive training on the&#xD;
      website by contacting them one-on-one. In the following 1st and 3rd months, the patients will&#xD;
      be contacted individually again to confirm whether they follow the website, and they will be&#xD;
      asked to fill the scales on the website by providing consultancy on the issues they need. In&#xD;
      the 6th month, the final test data will be obtained from the website using the same data&#xD;
      collection forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the control group will be collected data and contact information will be&#xD;
      obtained at the first interview using the Patient Information Form, Exercise Change Phase&#xD;
      Short Question Form, Change Processes Scale, Decision Making Balance Scale and Self-Efficacy&#xD;
      Scale. Later, patients will be given their username and password so that they can log into&#xD;
      the website where the scales are located in order to apply the final test. No intervention&#xD;
      will be applied to the patients in the control group. At the end of the 6th month, the same&#xD;
      scales will be applied on the website as a final test. At the end of the study, the patients&#xD;
      in the control group will be able to access the exercise training content prepared for the&#xD;
      purpose of gaining exercise behavior on the website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nursing Initiative The patients in the experimental group will be given a web-based exercise&#xD;
      training based on the transtheoretic model according to the stages of change they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interference Material As the initiative material, the participants; A website will be&#xD;
      established where they can log in with an individually given username and password. As the&#xD;
      content; The harms of sedentary life, the benefits of exercise on general health, especially&#xD;
      its effects on reducing heart diseases and risks, and materials for gaining exercise behavior&#xD;
      will be included.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise Change Stage Short Question Form is an 5 item scale. 1=Exercising regularly for more than 6 months, 2=Exercising regularly for less than 6 months, 3=Does not exercise but intends to do it within 30 days, 4=Does not exercising but intends to start within 6 months, 5=Does not exercise and does not intend to start within 6 months</description>

    <description>Change Processes Scale is an 28 item scale.Individuals in the scale do not agree with each statement using a 5-point Likert scale. is determined. Each individual in scale how much to exercise in the condition stated in item he often does a It is determined by the grading score. From the interviewee, the items of this scale by reading &quot;1 = never&quot; for each item, &quot;2 = rarely&quot;, &quot;3 = occasionally&quot;, &quot;4 = often&quot;, &quot;5 very often&quot; the most suitable for him He is asked to select and mark the one. Scale, item points of all subscales score obtained from averages It is evaluated according to the average.There are cognitive and behavioral processes that facilitate change in the Exercise Change Processes Scale. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient of the scale is 0.95, and it was determined as 0.91 for cognitive processes with sub-dimensions and 0.93 for behavioral processes.</description>

    <description>Change Processes Scale is an 10 item scale. Total score of the scale, the perceived benefit of exercising is total of the total score of perceived damage It is obtained by subtraction. Your result negative (-), in decision-making balance the perceived harms of exercise dominant, positive (+), decision exercising in a giving balance a sign that the perceived benefits are dominant does. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale 25 is the lowest score is 5.</description>
