  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the major progress in anesthetic techniques, postoperative pain is still considered a&#xD;
      major problem during practice. (1-3). Leading to many co-morbidities, one to two-thirds of&#xD;
      patients will suffer postoperative pain. These co-morbidities can include; pulmonary&#xD;
      complications, cardiac complications, and delirium(4). Numerous risk factors are associated&#xD;
      with the emergence of postoperative pain, including; younger age, female sex, preoperative&#xD;
      pain, and extensive surgical procedure. The severity of postoperative pain may vary among&#xD;
      patients undergoing the same operation (5-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many techniques have been evolved to monitor nociception and predict postoperative pain&#xD;
      intensity; one of the most recent techniques is the surgical pleth index (SPI)(11).SPI is a&#xD;
      noninvasive dimensionless score; its value is obtained from heartbeat interval and pulse wave&#xD;
      amplitude monitored by pulse oximetry probe.SPI reflects the sympathetic response of the&#xD;
      patient to the surgical stimuli(12-13). It was reported that SPI is better than other&#xD;
      parameters like heart rate and blood pressure for detecting the balance between nociceptor&#xD;
      activation and analgesia(14-15), and its value is correlated with the severity of&#xD;
      postoperative pain. SPI values range from 0 to 100, and higher values indicate strong&#xD;
      surgical stimulus (16). SPI can be used as a guide for intraoperative analgesia; hence, it&#xD;
      can be a valuable tool to assess the analgesic requirement and limit opioid consumption, both&#xD;
      preoperative and postoperative(17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have been performed to predict the severity of postoperative pain using SPI&#xD;
      in adults and children (16,18). It was also used successfully to expect a hemodynamic&#xD;
      response to tracheal intubation and skin incision (19) and monitor nerve block success. (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since SPI has emerged, the most sensitive cut-off value that correlates well with&#xD;
      postoperative pain severity remained debatable. Recent studies reported a value of 30 as a&#xD;
      cut-off value of SPI. (21). On the other hand, the time of measurement to rely on was&#xD;
      debatable. Most studies recommended that a measure of SPI before recovery can be used.&#xD;
      However, a more recent study suggested that SPI response to surgical incision is highly&#xD;
      correlated with postoperative pain and opioid consumption (18). Based on these data, we&#xD;
      hypothesized that both measurements are correlated with postoperative pain and aimed to test&#xD;
      which measure is more correlated.&#xD;

      The current study's objective is to determine the optimum time to measure intraoperative SPI,&#xD;
      which correlates better with postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at Fayoum university hospital after the local institutional&#xD;
      ethics committee and local institutional review board's approval. The study design will be a&#xD;
      prospective observational study.A total of 99 patients scheduled for elective abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy under general anesthesia and their age range from 18-65 will be included in this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria included; an age &lt;18 years, significant dysrhythmia like AF or&#xD;
      atrioventricular block more than1st degree, patient with a pacemaker,treatment with&#xD;
      vasoactive medications, and any intraoperative t reatment with clonidine, beta-receptor&#xD;
      agonists or antagonists, or anyother drug that can affect the sympathovagal balance.patients&#xD;
      receiving neuraxial anesthesia will also be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia and pain management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will fast 6 hours for solid food and 2 hours for clear fluids before the&#xD;
      operation. After arriving the operating room, standard monitoring (Pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      Noninvasive blood pressure, and Electrocardiogram)will be applied and continued all over the&#xD;
      operation. An 18G peripheral cannula will be inserted.All patients will be pre-oxygenated&#xD;
      with 100% O2 and premedicated with 0.03 mg/kg IV midazolam and10 mg metoclopramide.&#xD;
      Intravenous induction of anesthesia will be performed using2mg/kg propofol, l-2µgm/kg&#xD;
      fentanyl and0.5mg/kg atracurium. All patients will receive 1gm paracetamol IV as&#xD;
      intraoperative supplementary analgesia just after the induction. An endotracheal tube will be&#xD;
      inserted for all patients. Mechanical ventilation will be adjusted as volume controlled&#xD;
      ventilation with 5cmH2oaiming to maintain end-tidalCo2 pressure of 30 to 40 mmHg by a mixture&#xD;
      of O2with fiO20.5and air. Anesthesia will be maintained with isoflurane. SPI will be recorded&#xD;
      5 min after skin incision and 10 min before recovery. Using anesthesia machine( carestatation&#xD;
      650 l GE.3.4.2019) After recovery,Upon ability of communication, all patients will be asked&#xD;
      to quantify their level of pain on a 0 - 10 point numeric rating scale (NRS) with (0= no&#xD;
      pain, 1-3 mild, 4-5 moderate and 6-10 severe) three scores will be obtained with 5 minutes&#xD;
      intervals and the highest pain score of the three will be recorded for further analysis&#xD;
      (without affection of the routine pain management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be transferred to the obstetrics ward when they reach a modified Aldrete&#xD;
      score ≥9. During the first 24 hours, all patients will receive IV paracetamol 1 g every 8&#xD;
      hours for postoperative analgesia according to the obstetric department protocol. In addition&#xD;
      to intravenous tramadol through PCA&#xD;
&#xD;
      (concentration of 4 mg/ml) with 20 mg dose, 10 minutes lockout interval, and one hour limit&#xD;
      of 50 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPI at 5 minutes after skin incision and 10 minutes before recovery, the highest pain score&#xD;
      (NRS) in the PACU,total opioid consumption during the first 24 hours, Nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (will be assessed on a scale: 0 = no symptoms, 1 = only nausea, 2 = nausea and/vomiting),&#xD;
      Respiratory depression (will be defined as respiratory rate lower than 10), Sedation (will be&#xD;
      assessed using a sedation score where 0 = awake and alert, 1 = quietly awake, 2 = asleep but&#xD;
      easily arousable, 3=deep sleep, responding to a painful stimulus) All these data will be&#xD;
      collected by a separate anesthesiologist who will be blinded with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to determine which SPI measurement is more correlated with&#xD;
      postoperative pain. The secondary outcomes is to evaluate the correlation between the SPI&#xD;
      measurements and opioid consumption in the first postoperative 24 hours and to define the&#xD;
      cut-off value of SPI measurements&#xD;
