      The aim of our study was to test the effects on endothelium of a combination of curcumin,&#xD;
      resveratrol, plus zinc, magnesium, selenium and Vitamin D in a cohort of pediatric subjects&#xD;
      with obesity. Endothelial function was assessed using two methodologies: a &quot;post occlusive&#xD;
      release hyperemic test&quot; (PORH) and a &quot;heat provocation test&quot; (HPT). Treatment tablet&#xD;
      composition (Auxilie® Immuplus, Envicon Medical, Verona, Italy): Vitamin D3: 25,00 mcg, Folic&#xD;
      acid: 90,00 mcg, Selenium: 55,00 mcg Magnesium: 300,00 mg, Zinc: 7,00 mg, Curcum (Meriva®):&#xD;
      100,00 mg Polygonum dry extract: 20,41 mg (of which Resveratrol: 20,00 mg), Soy dry extract:&#xD;
      37,50 mg. Placebo tablet composition: Saccharose, fructose, aroma, anti-agglomerate agents:&#xD;
      fatty acids magnesium salts, silicium dioxide, colorant: riboflavin 5-sodium phosphate;&#xD;
      sweetener: stevia glycoside, sucralose, neosperidin DC. Both tablets (treatment and placebo)&#xD;
      were similar in form, color and flavor.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using a computer-generated randomization schedule, study supplement and placebo were randomized (1:1) into 70 batches (each consisting of 6 packs containing 30 tablets a pack) and each was given a unique identification number. The coordinator of the study maintained the randomization list. Study physicians, other study personnel, and parents or legal guardians were blinded to of the batches of medication and to the identification. Subjects who satisfied the inclusion for the study were assigned an identification number (linked to a batch) in sequential order. Subjects took one tablet per day orally starting day one after the visit and continuing for the 6-month duration of the study. A number of tablets not taken equal to of greater of 2 tablets/month was considered not adherence to the study (drop out).</intervention_model_description>
