  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PEKMB was first named and described by Lortat-Jacob &amp; Civatte in 1961 and by Bart &amp; Kopf&#xD;
      later. This rare condition is mostly reported in elderly males. The keratotic scales is&#xD;
      usually micaceous and resembles psoriasis. Most patients are above 50 years of age and are&#xD;
      circumcised later in life, but also reported in younger age group. This mica like scales&#xD;
      contains keratin which gets dissolved in 10% potassium hydroxide solution. Disease&#xD;
      progression may lead to phimosis. Differential diagnosis of this disease entity include&#xD;
      moniliasis, wart, psoriasis ,penile horn, circinate balanitis, erythroplasia of Queyrat,&#xD;
      squamous cell epithelioma and verrucous carcinoma. It is primarily a benign entity, it is&#xD;
      capable of invasiveness. Bart and Kopf considered it to be in intermediate stage between&#xD;
      benign hyperplasia and squamous cell carcinoma. However, the histological spectrum can range&#xD;
      from hypertrophic-hyperplastic penile dystrophy to verrucous carcinoma. Fibro sarcoma has&#xD;
      been reported developing in a same patient. Etiology is unclear. Despite search for a viral&#xD;
      agent, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has not been demonstrated and its role in pathogenesis or&#xD;
      its transformation to verrucous carcinoma has been proved. The treatment of PEKMB should be&#xD;
      conservative when there is no histological evidence of malignancy. All such patients should&#xD;
      be followed up. Treatment choices include potent topical steroids, topical 5% 5-flurouracil&#xD;
      cream1, 2, cryotherapy, radiotherapy and shaving biopsy plus electro coagulation. When frank&#xD;
      malignancy is observed, excision with wide margin is the rule.&#xD;
