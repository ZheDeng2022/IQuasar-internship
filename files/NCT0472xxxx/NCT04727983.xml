  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To reveal the effects of Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) applied over the thigh&#xD;
      on incontinence symptoms, pelvic floor muscle function, bladder function, quality of life and&#xD;
      sexual function in women with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) symptoms. Our goal is to&#xD;
      contribute to the literature on electrical stimulation (ES) applications used in UUI&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients aged 18-65 years with UUI symptoms will be included in the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be divided into 2 groups randomly. The first group will be given Neuromuscular&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation (NMES) and lifestyle suggestions (LSS) (NMES group). The second group&#xD;
      will be given sham NMES in addition to LSS (SHAM ES group). Information about bladder&#xD;
      irritants, voiding posture and behavior, weight control and pelvic floor muscle training will&#xD;
      be provided in the LSS. ES applications will be performed 3 days a week for 30 minutes per&#xD;
      session for 8 weeks. All participants will be evaluated pretreatment, after the 4th week and&#xD;
      posttreatment. Pelvic floor muscle function will evulate with the Modified Oxford Scale. In&#xD;
      addition, women's bladder function with the urinary diary for 3 days, incontinence symptoms&#xD;
      with the International Incontinence Consultation Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and the&#xD;
      Coital Incontinence Score (CIS), quality of life with the King Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and&#xD;
      Sexual Function will be evaluated with Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual&#xD;
      Questionnaire (PISQ-12). At the end of the 8th week, both the Subjective perception of&#xD;
      improvement and treatment satisfaction of the patients will be questioned&#xD;

      Our study will be carried out with female patients between the ages of 18-65 who have Urge&#xD;
      urinary Incontinence (UUI) symptoms and applied to the Recep Tayyip Erdogan University&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital, Gynecology and Obstetrics Policlinic. Inclusion criterias&#xD;
      are; who do not want to use medication, who do not benefit from medication for a long time or&#xD;
      who do not use any medication. Exclusion criterias are; Those with any malignant conditions,&#xD;
      those with neurological disease, those with infection, pregnant women, those with pelvic&#xD;
      organ prolapse above stage 2 according to the POP-Q staging, those with cardiac implants and&#xD;
      pacemakers, those with cardiac arrhythmia, those with urinary retention, those with sensory&#xD;
      loss, copper coil intrauterine those who wear a vehicle, patients with metal implants and&#xD;
      patients with communication and cooperation problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the study, all participants will be questioned about demographic and physical&#xD;
      characteristics, medical, obstetric, gynecological and urological history and drug use. After&#xD;
      these evaluations, sensory and reflex evaluations will be made. Sensory assessment will be&#xD;
      performed with a light touch test to the hip circumference and pelvic floor muscles. In&#xD;
      reflex evaluation, anal and bulbocavernous reflexes will be checked. All of the applications&#xD;
      will be carried out by Specialist Physiotherapist Tuğba Birben under the supervision of&#xD;
      Specialist Gynecologist Physician Beril Gürlek.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be in 2 groups. It is estimated that the number of people will consist of 40&#xD;
      volunteers, with 20 patients for each group. The sample size will be determined after the&#xD;
      pilot study. Patients who were diagnosed with UUI, met the study criteria and accepted to be&#xD;
      included in the study, within a period of 9 months after the approval of the ethics&#xD;
      committee, with the four-block randomization method, via the website&#xD;
      https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple-randomiser/v1/lists will be included in groups&#xD;
      according to randomization. lifestyle suggestions (LSS)+ NMES (NMES group) will be applied to&#xD;
      the first group and LSS + SHAM Electrical Stimulation (SHAM ES group) will be applied to the&#xD;
      second group. Each group will be included in the 8-week treatment program for 30 minutes 3&#xD;
      days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic floor muscle function of all participants will be evaluated with the Modified Oxford&#xD;
      Scale before treatment, at the end of the 4th week and after treatment. In addition, women's&#xD;
      bladder function with the urinary diary, incontinence symptoms with the International&#xD;
      Incontinence Consultation Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and the Coital Incontinence&#xD;
      Score (CIS), quality of life with the King Health Questionnaire (KHQ) and Sexual Function&#xD;
      will be evaluated with Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PISQ-12). At the end of the 8th week, both the Subjective perception of improvement and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction of the patients will be questioned.&#xD;

    <description>quality of life will be evulated with the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ) It consists of 3 parts. In the first part; 2 questions evaluating General health perception, in the second part; 19 questions that divide the quality of life into different areas (Incontinence impact, role limitations, physical limitations, social limitations, personal relationships, emotions, sleep/ energy, general health status, symptom severity) and in the third part; It consists of 11 questions evaluating the severity of urinary symptoms.&#xD;
The individual items in the domains are scaled from 0 (best) to 100 worst. Another dimension is added which is called as Symptom severity scale; where in there are 10 different bladder symptoms, the score ranges from 0 to 30 and the values are not converted to percentages.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual Function will be evulated with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire - 12 (Short Form) (PISQ-12-SF) The questionnaire is based on 12 items that allow investigation of three different domains of sexual life; behavior (items 1-4), physical (items 5-9) and partner-related (items 10-12). Scores are calculated by totaling the scores for each question with 0 = always to 4 = never. Reversed scoring is used for items 1, 2, 3 and 4. Higher PISQ-12-SF scores indicate a better sexual function. Maximum score is 48.</description>
