  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of physiotherapeutical instructions on&#xD;
      dysfunctional breathing in children and adolescents with or without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents with dysfunctional breathing, are invited to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention study. Participants are stratified by asthma diagnose status and randomized to&#xD;
      physiotherapy or standard care. Participants are followed a year after the intervention, to&#xD;
      compare the development in asthma control ( if asthma) and quality of life.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of physiotherapeutical instructions on&#xD;
      dysfunctional breathing in children and adolescents with or without asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children and adolescents aged 10-17 years, followed in our outpatient clinic with the&#xD;
      diagnose of asthma are invited to fulfill the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ) and the Asthma&#xD;
      Control Questionnaire (ACQ5)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents where asthma was investigated and ruled out are invited to fulfill&#xD;
      the NQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the electronic patient journal are used as descriptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with dysfunctional breathing (NQ &gt;= 23) are invited to participate in the&#xD;
      intervention study. Participants are stratified by asthma diagnose status and randomized to&#xD;
      physiotherapy or standard care. Participants are followed a year after the intervention, to&#xD;
      compare the development in asthma control measured by ACQ5 (if asthma) and quality of life&#xD;
      measured by PedsQL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of physiotherapy is analyzed separately for participants with and without asthma.&#xD;
      In addition, primary outcomes are analyzed in a regression model with asthma status, age and&#xD;
      sex as explanatory variables.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ5) at 6 months.</measure>
    <time_frame>ACQ is taken at baseline and 6 months after intervention as primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ5 contains 5 questions regarding asthma symptoms. Each question is scored between 0-6 points, where 0 represents very good asthma control and 6 represents poor asthma control. Total ACQ score is calculates as an average of points. ACQ5 is taken by participants with asthma, at visits in the outpatient clinic.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory ( PedsQl) at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>PedsQL is taken at baseline and 6 months after intervention as primary outcome.</time_frame>
    <description>PedsQl consists of 23 questions in 4 segments ( physical functioning, emotions, social interaction, and school activities). Each question is scored from 0 (best) to 4 (worst). The PedsQl questionnairre exists in formats for young children ( not used here), children aged 8-12 years and Teenagers aged 13-18 years. Children and adolescents are answering the age relevant questionnairre at visits in the out patient clinic. The PedsQl score is transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0 =100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, 4=0. Health related Quality of life is calculated as a mean of scores. Psychosocial Health summary score is calculated as a mean of scores in the emotional, social and school functioning scales. Physical Health summary score is calculated as physical functioning scale score mean.</description>

    <time_frame>NQ is taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>NQ consists of 16 questions regarding dysfunctional breathing. Each question is scored between 0-4 points, where 0 is best and 4 is worst.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Brompton breathing Pattern Assesment Tool ( BBPAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>BBPAT is taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>BBPAT is a breathing scoring equipment where an observer is scoring the quality of breathing from seven parameters including respiratory rate, respiratory movements, in and expiratory sounds etc. Each parameter is scored from 0 ( best) to 2 ( worst). Total score is calculated between 0-14 point</description>

    <time_frame>ACQ5 is taken at 6 weeks and 12 months after intervention as secondary outcomes.</time_frame>
    <description>ACQ5 contains 5 questions regarding asthma symptoms. Each question is scored between 0-6 points, where 0 represents very good asthma control and 6 represents poor asthma control. Total ACQ score is calculates as an average of points. ACQ5 is taken by participants with asthma in the outpatient clinic at baseline and after 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months.</description>
