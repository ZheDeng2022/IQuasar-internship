  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACCEL® Absorbable Hemostat Powder Clinical IDE Trial is designed as a prospective,&#xD;
      multi-center, randomized, non-inferiority, controlled pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the ACCEL® Absorbable Hemostat Powder as compared to gelatin sponge,&#xD;
      for achieving hemostasis in subjects undergoing cardiovascular, liver, or soft tissue&#xD;
      surgery, when control of oozing to moderate bleeding by standard surgical techniques is&#xD;
      ineffective and/or impractical.&#xD;

             resection surgery or with a diagnosis of liver metastases where there is no upper&#xD;
