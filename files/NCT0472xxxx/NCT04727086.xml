  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will determine whether a novel pharmacotherapy, BP1. 3656, affects&#xD;
      laboratory alcohol self-administration in participants with alcohol use disorder (AUD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study employs BP1.3656, a novel investigational compound with a track record for&#xD;
      safety and tolerability in phase I clinical trials. When administered to mice, BP1.3656 was&#xD;
      associated with increased metabolism of histamine and elevated brain dopamine and&#xD;
      acetylcholine, suggestive of utility in psychiatric disorders including Alcohol Use Disorder&#xD;
      (AUD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Phase II laboratory-based trial of BP1 .3656 for AUD. 40 non-treatment&#xD;
      seeking participants with AUD will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      intervention with BP1 .3656 or placebo in a within-subject, crossover design. During each&#xD;
      intervention period, outcome measures relating to alcohol motivation and self-administration&#xD;
      will be assessed in the laboratory. It is hypothesized that relative to placebo, alcohol&#xD;
      self-administration will be decreased by BP1 .3656.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a within-subjects, counterbalanced, crossover trial with a washout period. Participants will receive either placebo or the interventional drug BP1.3656 during the initial 14-day phase of the study and receive the other intervention during the second 14-day phase of the study. The washout period will last a minimum of 14 days.&#xD;
Participants will come in to the laboratory on two separate days near the end of each intervention phase to complete alcohol self-administration sessions.</intervention_model_description>
