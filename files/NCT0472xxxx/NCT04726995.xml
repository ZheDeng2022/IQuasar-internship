      We compared the efficacy and safety of modified NHL-BFM-90 regimen and R-CHOP/CHOP regimen in&#xD;
      pediatric (aged 0-14 years) and adolescent（aged 15-18 years）DLBCL patients in a single&#xD;
      institution during a 20-year period. we compared the efficacy and safety of modified&#xD;
      NHL-BFM-90 regimen and R-CHOP/CHOP regimen in pediatric (aged 0-14 years) and adolescent（aged&#xD;
      15-18 years）DLBCL patients in a single institution during a 20-year period. To our best&#xD;
      knowledge, no reports have been previously published regarding the comparison.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma that accounts for&#xD;
      approximately 10%-20% of pediatric and adolescent non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence increases with age, with 37% of NHLs patients being adolescents aged. Poor&#xD;
      survival has been demonstrated in adolescents and young adults compared to children with&#xD;
      DLBCL. However, the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) LNH-97&#xD;
      study showed that age was not a poor prognostic factor in children and adolescents with&#xD;
      Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and DLBCL. A conclusion as to whether adolescent age is an independent&#xD;
      risk factor has not been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the preferred protocols for adolescent DLBCL patients have not been standardized.&#xD;
      Adolescents with cancer have been designated as a vulnerable population, positioned between&#xD;
      children and the adult population. Treatment strategies differ between adults and pediatric&#xD;
      patients. The pediatric strategy for DLBCL was developed in parallel by the&#xD;
      Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) and French-American-British/Lymphomes Malins B (FAB/LMB)&#xD;
      groups. The combination of rituximab plus Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, and&#xD;
      Prednisone (R-CHOP) or R-CHOP-like chemotherapy regimens are the standard therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of adult patients with DLBCL. There is currently a lack of studies that have&#xD;
      compared the treatment outcomes in adolescent patients with DLBCL who were administered&#xD;
      pediatric or adult regimens. Hence, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics&#xD;
      and prognostic factors in DLBCL patients, especially the efficacy and safety of the pediatric&#xD;
      regimen (modified NHL-BFM-90) and adult regimen (R-CHOP/CHOP), between pediatric and&#xD;
      adolescent DLBCL patients.&#xD;
