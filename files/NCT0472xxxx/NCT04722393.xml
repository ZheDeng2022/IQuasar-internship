  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and surgical resection remains the gold&#xD;
      standard curative treatment in early stage non-small cell lung cancer. However, surgery&#xD;
      itself is the direct cause of pulmonary function impairment, which dramatically reduces&#xD;
      patients tolerance to exercise and their quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR)&#xD;
      complements surgical treatment and improves patients' exercise and functional capacity,&#xD;
      decreases dyspnea, improves health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our aim is to examine the effectiveness of PR applied after lung resection in patients with&#xD;
      lung cancer, 2- To determine whether the respiratory exercise training given to patients who&#xD;
      could not participate in the PR program is effective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an evidence-based, interdisciplinary, comprehensive exercise&#xD;
      program that targets patients with symptomatic chronic respiratory disease. PR integrates&#xD;
      exercise and training interventions into a personalized treatment program. PR has become an&#xD;
      important component of the general treatment strategy in patients with high-risk surgical&#xD;
      diseases such as lung resection. It helps patients return to normal not only physically, but&#xD;
      also emotionally and mentally. In patients with lung cancer, preoperative PR increases&#xD;
      exercise capacity, decreases post-operative morbidity and mortality. Although it is reported&#xD;
      that the PR program applied in the post-operative period increases physical performance and&#xD;
      improves the quality of life, referral of patients in need of the PR unit is less than 25%.&#xD;
      There is a need to increase the awareness of both pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons about&#xD;
      the benefits of the PR program, which is a non-pharmacological and effective intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have had two objectives in this study. 1- To examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PR applied after lung resection in patients with lung cancer, 2- To determine whether the&#xD;
      respiratory exercise training given to patients who could not participate in the PR program&#xD;
      is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An 8-week comprehensive outpatient PR program will applied to half of 66 patients with&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer who underwent lung resection, and the other half received&#xD;
      respiratory exercise training. After the intervention, the results of both groups will&#xD;
      compare.&#xD;

    <description>Pulmonary Function Test Pulmonary function test (PFT) which is noninvasive tests that show how well the lungs are working. The tests will measure FEV1; It is the volume of air (in liters) exhaled in the first second during forced exhalation after maximal inspiration.&#xD;
FVC: It s the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from your lungs after taking the deepest breath possible, as measured by spirometry FEV1/FVC: It represents the proportion of a person's vital capacity that they are able to expire in the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) to the full, forced vital capacity (FVC).</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Inventory for assessment of anxiety and depression. In this scale; scores of anxiety and depression are calculated separately. The maximum score for both is 21 and high scores correspond to high degree anxiety and depression. Cut-off scores for anxiety and depression were determined as 10/11 and 7/8 respectively.</description>
