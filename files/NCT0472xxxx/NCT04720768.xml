    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase IB, non-randomised study consisting of a dose escalation phase&#xD;
      and expansion phase, evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination of encorafenib, binimetinib and palbociclib in patients with BRAF-mutant&#xD;
      metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation phase: Previously treated or treatment-naïve patients will be evaluated after&#xD;
      the first cycle for dose-limiting toxicities to ascertain the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)&#xD;
      of encorafenib, binimetinib and palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expansion phase: Two cohorts of patients will be further evaluated for the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of the RP2D of palbociclib with encorafenib and binimetinib. Cohort 1 will include&#xD;
      patients naïve to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Cohort 2 will include patients with either&#xD;
      primary or acquired resistance to both BRAF and MEK inhibitors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicentre, Phase IB, dose escalation study with dose expansion&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the encorafenib,&#xD;
      binimetinib and palbociclib combination. Patients with untreated or previously treated&#xD;
      BRAFV600 mutation-positive, locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic melanoma are&#xD;
      eligible. There will be 3 dose levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Dose Level Description Dose Level Encorafenib Binimetinib Palbociclib D1 450mg daily&#xD;
      45mg BID 75mg daily 21/7* D2 450mg daily 45mg BID 100mg daily 21/7* D3 450mg daily 45mg BID&#xD;
      125mg daily 21/7*&#xD;
&#xD;
      * 21 consecutive days on treatment, followed by 7 consecutive days off treatment in a 28 day&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate dosing regimens and schedules may be interrogated depending on the nature and&#xD;
      timing of the toxicities encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose to be evaluated will be dose level D1 and dose escalation will follow using a&#xD;
      standard 3 + 3 design (refer to Figure 6). Dose escalation/de-escalation decisions will be&#xD;
      made by the Trial Management Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) will be monitored over the first 28 days of treatment. After&#xD;
      each dose level of 3 patients complete the DLT observation period, the TMC will meet and&#xD;
      review the available toxicity and dosing information and determine the dose regimen for the&#xD;
      next dose level of 3 patients and/or identify the RP2D for the dose-expansion phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 additional patients will be enrolled into each of the two cohorts during the&#xD;
      dose-expansion phase. One cohort will consist of previously untreated patients or treated&#xD;
      patients without prior exposure to any BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy. The second cohort will&#xD;
      consist of patients who have progressed on BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimum of 10 patients in each cohort must have newly obtained tumour sample at baseline.&#xD;
      Accrual may be restricted to achieve this. Treatment of patients in both phases will continue&#xD;
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other discontinuation criterion is&#xD;
      met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the final analyses, the study will be considered completed when 12 months&#xD;
      have passed since the first day of treatment of the last patient enrolled in the expansion&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with a diagnosis of BRAFV600 mutation positive, locally advanced/unresectable&#xD;
      or metastatic melanoma who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      eligible for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will occur from all activated sites into the currently open phase and dose level&#xD;
      of the study. Dose Level 1 will be the first to open and will enroll 3 patients at a minimum.&#xD;
      The TMC will assess and determine the dose level for the next patients to open to recruitment&#xD;
      accordly. Participants in the dose escalation phase will be evaluable for assessment if they&#xD;
      complete 80% of their first cycle of combined treatment or they experience a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the RP2D has been determined by the TMC, recruitment will continue to occur from all&#xD;
      activated sites into the dose expansion phase of the study. All patients in this phase will&#xD;
      receive the RP2D. Patients in the dose expansion phase will be assigned to one of the 2&#xD;
      cohorts according to their treatment status (either BRAF/MEK-inhibitor naïve, or previously&#xD;
      treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of assessments will occur while the patient is on treatment as well as the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK sampling will be collected as part of the safety assessments according to the Schedule of&#xD;
      Events in Section 3. On PK sampling days for trough levels (cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 2 day&#xD;
      1), study visits should be scheduled in the morning so a pre-dose PK blood sample can be&#xD;
      collected. On these visit days, the morning dose of encorafenib, binimetinib and palbociclib&#xD;
      will only be administered by the investigator (or designee) at the study site, after&#xD;
      collecting the pre-dose PK sample. For PK visits, patients will be required to be fasting 2&#xD;
      hours before and 1 hour after the dose. Exact dates of drug administration (and actual PK&#xD;
      blood draw) will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Any sampling problems (e.g. patient&#xD;
      took study drug before draw took place) must be noted in the eCRF and on appropriate source&#xD;
      documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour and blood samples collected for PD and biomarker assessments will be analysed with the&#xD;
      objectives of understanding mechanisms of action and PD of the encorafenib, binimetinib and&#xD;
      palbociclib combination, identifying biomarkers that are predictive of response, and&#xD;
      explaining mechanisms of innate/acquired resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimens for dynamic (non-inherited) and genetic (inherited) biomarkers will be collected&#xD;
      from all patients on the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mandatory plasma samples will be collected from all patients, as described in the Schedule of&#xD;
      Events. Circulating tumour DNA will be extracted and analysed for BRAF V600E and V600K&#xD;
      mutation status. The mutation profile obtained from the circulating DNA will be compared with&#xD;
      the mutation profile obtained from the tumour biopsy collected at baseline, during treatment&#xD;
      and on progression. Plasma-circulating DNA carrying BRAF V600E mutation (BRAF-mutated&#xD;
      alleles) will be detected and measured over time by determining percentages of total DNA and&#xD;
      BRAF V600E concentration, either as relative percentage or absolute values. This may be&#xD;
      useful to predict either disease progression at an early stage or response to therapy. The&#xD;
      plasma samples may also be used to identify other potential predictive markers of clinical&#xD;
      response to the encorafenib, binimetinib and palbociclib combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood sample will be analysed for mutations detected in tumour tissue, in order to&#xD;
      verify the somatic nature of the mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be required to provide newly collected tumour biopsies at baseline (unless&#xD;
      inaccessible), on day 15 of cycle 1 and at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At least 2 cores per collection time point should be obtained (minimum of 1 core for FFPE,&#xD;
      and if feasible, 1 core for fresh frozen biopsy). Excisional biopsies, punch biopsies and&#xD;
      14-gauge core needle biopsies are all acceptable. Fine needle aspiration biopsies will not be&#xD;
      accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions with the greatest change in dimensional size, based on interval evaluation, are the&#xD;
      lesions to be biopsied, if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduling of the on-treatment tumour biopsies should not interfere with the scheduling of&#xD;
      the first, post-baseline FDG-PET scan. Ideally, tumour biopsies at screening and during Cycle&#xD;
      1 day 15 should be performed after the mandated FDG-PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biopsy at disease progression should be taken from an enlarging lesion. Biopsies at&#xD;
      progression should be obtained within 3 days of study drug discontinuation (i.e. continue&#xD;
      study treatment for several days beyond documentation of progression, if necessary, in order&#xD;
      to coordinate the timing of biopsy to occur within 3 days of study drug discontinuation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFPE tumour from baseline, on-treatment (Cycle 1 Day 15) and disease progression biopsies&#xD;
      will be used to perform the following biomarker analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for molecules known to be relevant for activity of the MAPK&#xD;
           and CDK4 pathways (e.g. ERK and MEK protein phosphorylation, RB1 phosphorylation).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IHC for molecules that are potential PD biomarkers for encorafenib, binimetinib and&#xD;
           palbociclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IHC for molecules potentially related to response/resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the tumour microenvironment by multiplexed IHC and Nanostring gene-array&#xD;
           technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRAF mutations (including V600E) and other somatic mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh-frozen tumour (baseline, Cycle 1 day 15, and at disease progression) may be used for&#xD;
      whole genome analysis; other techniques such as reverse phase protein array or mRNA&#xD;
      quantitation may also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that the gut microbiome plays a role in melanoma treatment&#xD;
      outcome through its immune-modulating effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, microbiome samples will be collected at baseline and at the end of treatment.&#xD;
      DNA will be extracted from faecal samples. Gene sequencing will be performed to survey&#xD;
      microbial species in the gut in order to define microbiota as a function of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. Overall changes in the gut microbiota will also be characterised in individual&#xD;
      participants that receive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, in addition to the biomarkers specified above, exploratory biomarker&#xD;
      research may be conducted on any tumour (newly obtained or archival) and/or blood and/or&#xD;
      plasma samples. These studies would extend the search for other potential biomarkers relevant&#xD;
      to the effects of the drugs given in combination in this study, and/or prediction of these&#xD;
      effects, and/or resistance to the treatment, and/or safety. This may also include research to&#xD;
      help develop ways to detect, monitor or treat cancer. These additional investigations would&#xD;
      be dependent upon clinical outcome, reagent and sample availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in all phases of this study will be treated with the encorafenib,&#xD;
      binimetinib and palbociclib combination until progression and/or experiencing unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, and/or the treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment beyond progression of disease will be allowed only under special circumstances; for&#xD;
      example: cystic lesions, mixed responses, and new brain metastasis which are treatable with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy or surgery, but not requiring whole brain radiotherapy. It is&#xD;
      judged by the investigator, in agreement with the CPI, whether or not a patient may remain on&#xD;
      study treatment as long as he/she continues to benefit from the study drug treatment per&#xD;
      investigator assessment. A treatment beyond progression consent form will not be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour response will be evaluated locally by the investigator according to the RECIST version&#xD;
      1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for all potential sites of tumour lesions at Screening/baseline&#xD;
      and every 8 weeks after starting study treatment until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On-study tumour assessments have a ± 3-day window. There will be a tumour assessment at the&#xD;
      30 day safety follow-up (± 7 days) if the patient discontinues for any reason other than&#xD;
      disease progression and the last tumour assessment has been performed &gt; 28 days prior to this&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who discontinue study treatment due to a reason other than disease progression&#xD;
      should continue to be followed and undergo tumour assessments every 8 weeks (± 3 days) until&#xD;
      disease progression or initiation of subsequent anti-neoplastic therapy, or death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort must be made to assess each lesion that is measured at Screening/baseline by the&#xD;
      same method throughout the study so that the comparison is consistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all post-Screening/baseline assessments and the 30 day safety follow-up, the following&#xD;
      should be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients are required to undergo chest, abdomen and pelvis CT/MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI or CT scan, if metastases were documented at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional imaging evaluations may be performed at any time if there is symptomatic&#xD;
           evidence suggesting the possibility of disease progression based on clinical symptoms or&#xD;
           physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria required for determining partial or complete response should be present for at least&#xD;
      4 weeks. All complete and partial responses must be confirmed by a second assessment at least&#xD;
      4 weeks later. If unscheduled imaging evaluations are performed (e.g. to confirm response or&#xD;
      if progression is suspected), every effort should be made to perform subsequent imaging&#xD;
      evaluations in accordance with the original imaging schedule. If evidence of progressive&#xD;
      disease is nonequivocal, every effort should be made to keep the patient on study medication&#xD;
      for at least one additional imaging evaluation as long as it is clinically acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scans should be acquired with IV contrast. If a patient is known to have a medical&#xD;
      contraindication to CT IV contrast agent or develops a contraindication during the study, a&#xD;
      CT scan without IV contrast of the chest and MRI with IV contrast, if possible, of the&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis may be performed. A CT scan of the brain, preferably with IV contrast, may&#xD;
      be performed if MRI is contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest x-ray or ultrasound should not be used for tumour response assessments in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any lesions that have been subjected to loco-regional therapies (e.g., radiotherapy,&#xD;
      ablation, etc.) should not be considered measurable, unless they have clearly progressed&#xD;
      since the therapy. Previously treated lesions that have not progressed should be considered&#xD;
      non-measurable and therefore, assessed as non-target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scan is not adequate for RECIST v1.1 response assessment. If a PET scan is used for&#xD;
      determination of disease progression, then a corresponding CT and/or MRI scan is required. CT&#xD;
      and/or MRI scans will be compared against PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each centre should have a designated radiologist responsible for the interpretation of CT/MRI&#xD;
      scans and response evaluations for study patients. Preferably, a single radiologist should&#xD;
      perform all evaluations for an individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, FDG-PET scans will be used to provide a non-invasive measurement of drug&#xD;
      activity and a potential early readout of anti-tumour activity in patients on day 15 of Cycle&#xD;
      1. FDG-PET scans are optional for non-Australian sites. Metabolic response in a lesion will&#xD;
      be assessed according to the method given in Wahl et al 2009 and will be centrally assessed&#xD;
      at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Scans are read visually displayed side by side with&#xD;
      liver uptake normalised between images. Response categories are defined as follows&#xD;
      (comparison is with baseline PET scans in each case:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete metabolic response (CMR): complete resolution of 18F-FDG uptake within&#xD;
           measurable target lesion so that it is less than mean liver activity and&#xD;
           indistinguishable from surrounding background blood-pool levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Partial metabolic response (PMR): reduction of minimum of 30% in target measurable tumor&#xD;
           18F-FDG SUL peak. Absolute drop in SUL must be at least 0.8 SUL units, as well&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable metabolic disease (SMD): not CMR, PMR, or PMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progressive metabolic disease (PMD): 30% increase in 18F-FDG SUL peak, with .0.8 SUL&#xD;
           unit increase in tumor SUV peak from baseline scan in pattern typical of tumor and not&#xD;
           of infection/treatment effect. OR: Visible increase in extent of 18F-FDG tumor uptake&#xD;
           (75% in TLG volume with no decline in SUL. OR: New 18F-FDG-avid lesions that are typical&#xD;
           of cancer and not related to treatment effect or infection.&#xD;
