    <textblock>
      Patients will be examined in the Orthodontic Department of the University of Damascus Dental&#xD;
      School. Patients who will be treated in conjunction with the PAOO procedure and subjects who&#xD;
      will meet the inclusion criteria will be included then the initial diagnostic records&#xD;
      (diagnostic gypsum models, internal and external oral photographs, as well as radiographic&#xD;
      images) will be studied to ensure that the selection criteria will be accurately matched.&#xD;
      This study aims to assess patients' acceptance of the PAOO procedure as well as the levels of&#xD;
      pain and discomfort associated with this treatment.&#xD;

      Surgical procedure associated with PAOO The surgery will be performed under local anesthesia&#xD;
      and then full-thickness flaps will be reflected labially only from the distal surface of the&#xD;
      lower right canine to the distal surface of the lower left canine, after washing the exposed&#xD;
      alveolar bone with saline, then a selective cortical cutting will be performed using a&#xD;
      piezosurgery and then the Bone-DÂ® xenograft (particle size of 0.2 mm-1.0 mm) from Medpark&#xD;
      (Busan, Korea) will be placed, then the wound will be sutured. Then a schedule will be set up&#xD;
      to review the patient after 1, 7, 14, and 28 days to fill out questionnaires related to pain,&#xD;
      acceptance, discomfort, satisfaction, and follow-up to orthodontic treatment.&#xD;
