  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time to defibrillation is the most important predictor of survival in cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      Traditional emergency medical system response is often to slow. The overall aim of this pilot&#xD;
      study is to evaluate if drones can deliver Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to the&#xD;
      scene of suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) prior to ambulance arrival with&#xD;
      clinically relevant time benefits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-randomized single group assignment study with the primary&#xD;
      purpose of evaluating proportion of AED-delivery prior to ambulance arrival and time&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Totally, five AED-equipped drones will be placed in hangars at five different sites covering&#xD;
      a geographic area of about 200 km2 and approximately 125,000 inhabitants for dispatch to&#xD;
      suspected cases of OHCA as a complement to standard care i.e., ambulance. By coordinating the&#xD;
      operations with local Air Traffic Control (ATC), the risk of airspace conflicts, or in worst&#xD;
      case collisions, is mitigated to an acceptable level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators estimate to enroll some 80 alerts and 60 participants during a study period&#xD;
      of up to 9 months. The investigators will closely follow and study the potential of&#xD;
      delivering AEDs prior ambulance arrival and timesaving effects as compared to ambulance&#xD;
      during a period of up to 9 months in which the investigators will follow and study the&#xD;
      potential of delivering AEDs prior ambulance arrival and timesaving effects as compared to&#xD;
      ambulance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drone operator, Everdrone, has integrated all software and hardware for the concept on&#xD;
      the DJI Matrice 600 Pro drone. Examples of added features: an integrated Parachute Rescue&#xD;
      System (validated by independent third party using the ASTM F3322 - 18 standard), a high&#xD;
      precision sense and avoid system and a winching device to safely lower the AED to ground at&#xD;
      delivery. Furthermore, Everdrone AB has fully integrated their system and operational&#xD;
      routines with the dispatch central, emergency medical services and aviation organizations. As&#xD;
      a result from the previous study (version 1.0) a number of hardware and software improvements&#xD;
      have been made to the system (version 2.0):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five hangars will be setup at optimal locations in each of the five administrative areas.&#xD;
      Hangars are large isolated tents 4x4 meters in where the drone is placed, remotely operated&#xD;
      and surveiled by camera. Hangars are within fenced areas so that the public has no access.&#xD;
      They are equipped with weather stations and an automated gate which automatically will open&#xD;
      on alert.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When an emergency 112-call is answered it is indexed by the dispatcher depending on the&#xD;
      patients condition. If an OHCA is suspected, the dispatcher indexes the event as a)&quot;ongoing&#xD;
      cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR)&quot; or b) &quot;Unconscious with abnormal or absent breathing&quot;.&#xD;
      If an emergency call is identified within administrative areas AND indexed as &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; an&#xD;
      automated (not manual as with ambulance alerts) alert is sent via radio-alert to the drone&#xD;
      operator. This triggers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  boot-up of the drone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  drone hangar gate opening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  route-planning of the mission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  weather condition confirmation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  remote pilot acceptance of the mission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  remote pilot calling ATC for takeoff approval&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drone system receives an alert from the dispatch center and the drone takes off from the&#xD;
      hangar after approval from the drone pilot. For safety reasons all beyond visual line of&#xD;
      sight (BVLOS) flights are done within the controlled airspace of Säve airport approval from&#xD;
      ATC granted for every single flight. Each flight will be carried out at 60-80 meters of&#xD;
      altitude, have a preliminary maximum flight speed of 70 km/h, and a maximum range of 6 km&#xD;
      one-way. The drone system is remotely deployed and surveiled from the drone operating center&#xD;
      at Everdrone Säve Airport, the drone is dispatched alongside ambulance as a complement to&#xD;
      standard care. The drone systems are designed to operate in dry conditions with median winds&#xD;
      not exceeding 8 m/s and primarily during daylight conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AED used is an ultra-light AED (FRED Easyport from Schiller), weighting totally 800 grams&#xD;
      with basket and siren. Upon arrival onsite the basket with the AED will be winched down from&#xD;
      about 30 m altitude and delivered within 10 meters from the object i.e., the front door or&#xD;
      onsite in public areas. Local AED drone support after completed mission includes electrode&#xD;
      change battery test, potentially pic-up up the drone after dispatch by the Everdrone&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dispatch of the drone in suspected OHCA cases will be executed as a complement to standard&#xD;
      care i.e., ambulance between 21 April to 31 December 2021, totally up to 9 months of&#xD;
      full-scale real-life flights to suspected OHCA victims. Based on historical data of OHCA from&#xD;
      the Swedish register for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (SRCR) and first ever dispatch of&#xD;
      AED-equipped drones during 2020 the drone systems will be alerted in an estimated 80 cases&#xD;
      (about 3.5 flights/ week) of suspected OHCA over the study period. In about 25% of cases,&#xD;
      predefined exclusion criteria (rain, median wind &gt; 8 m/s, high rise buildings &gt;20m,&#xD;
      pre-flight checklists not OK) will presumably prohibit flights, thus making an estimated 60&#xD;
      cases eligible for inclusion (i.e., drone takes off to deliver AEDs in suspected OHCA.)&#xD;
&#xD;
