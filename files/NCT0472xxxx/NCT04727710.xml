    <textblock>
      This research project has 2 parts: The first part of the research is to develop a&#xD;
      couples-based group mindfulness intervention for men undergoing prostatectomy, with input&#xD;
      from patients and their partners. The second part is the trial registered here, which will&#xD;
      pilot the researchers' mindfulness intervention, developed in part 1, and observe any&#xD;
      reduction of distress for men undergoing prostatectomy and their partners.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In part 1 of this research, researchers developed a couples-based group mindfulness&#xD;
      intervention for men undergoing prostatectomy, with input from patients and their partners.&#xD;
      Three patients who had previously undergone prostatectomy, and had expressed interest in&#xD;
      participating in future research endeavors, and their partners were recruited to inform the&#xD;
      design of the intervention. This group of six stakeholders identified the types of distress&#xD;
      experienced by newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and their partners, as well as their&#xD;
      favored intervention approaches. These stakeholders do participate in the intervention or&#xD;
      control groups in part 2 of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers used thematic analysis to assess the type of distress identified by stakeholders&#xD;
      as well as approaches favored by them. They mapped these themes on the available mindfulness&#xD;
      approaches, identified in their review, to develop an intervention that best captures the&#xD;
      concerns of prostate cancer survivors and partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 is the pilot study. Researchers will enroll 20 more couples (men who are planning to&#xD;
      undergo radical prostatectomy and their partners) to participate in a pilot study of the&#xD;
      intervention. The pilot study will have 2 cohorts (groups). Half of the couples will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the mindfulness intervention (intervention group) and the other half&#xD;
      will receive the usual care (control group). All participants in the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups in part 2 of the study will be analyzed to determine the effects and feasibility of&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 and 6 months post-prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is administered as part of the patient's standard clinical care at University of Michigan. PROMIS SF Anxiety is an 8 item scale, each item is scored 1-5 where 1 is never and 5 is always. Higher scores indicate higher levels of anxiety.</description>

    <description>This survey is administered as part of the patient's standard clinical care at University of Michigan. PROMIS SF Positive Affect and Well Being is an 8 item scale, each item is scored 1-5 where 1 is never and 5 is always.

    <measure>Change in salivary cortisol level (only patients will complete this, not partners)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 months post-prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva is collected through an at home collection kit that is mailed to the lab.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of distress assessed using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months post-prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The NCCN Distress Thermometer is a 1-item global screener of distress using a 0-10 scale with 10 being most distressed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in level of distress assessed using the 5-facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 months post-prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>FFMQ is a 15 item self-reported assessment of mindfulness. Each item is scored 1-5, with higher scores indicating higher use of 5 key facets of mindfulness: Observing; Describing; Acting with awareness; Non-judging; Non-reactivity.</description>

    <measure>Change in urinary and sexual function assessed using Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3 and 6 months post-prostatectomy</time_frame>
    <description>MUSIC's EPIC-26 is a 26-item survey. Response options form a Likert scale, and multi-item scale scores are transformed linearly to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores representing higher levels of continence and better erectile function.</description>
