  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is the most used technique for identifying the&#xD;
      obstruction site associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This is due to the fact that&#xD;
      it allows many patients to be examined in a daytime setting. This procedure uses sedative&#xD;
      drugs to mimic natural sleep. However, associations with the site of upper airway (UA)&#xD;
      collapse during natural sleep remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this explorative study is to identify UA collapse in patients with OSA using&#xD;
      endoscopic techniques as well as flow shape characteristics and sound analyses during natural&#xD;
      and drug-induced sleep. Furthermore, we want to optimize the measurement set-up of natural&#xD;
      sleep endoscopy (NSE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate to severe OSA requiring DISE will be recruited for this prospective&#xD;
      study at the outpatient clinic. Patients will undergo a NSE at the sleep lab at night, and a&#xD;
      DISE at the operating theatre within three months. Both the NSE and DISE set-up will include&#xD;
      gold-standard flow measurements, acoustic analysis and esophageal pressure measurements.&#xD;

    <description>The probability of falling asleep in various settings and situations in daily life will be assessed. This questionnaire consists of eight questions which can be scored on a four-point Likert-type scale. The lowest score (zero) suggests that the described incident is absent and the highest score (three) suggests the presence of this event. The summation of the eight items can range from 0 to 24.</description>

    <description>The checklist individual strength (CIS20R) is a 20-item questionnaire to assess the degree of fatigue. The patient selects the most appropriate score on each statement ranging from 1 (yes, this is true) to 7 (no, this is not true). The total score, calculated as the sum of the questions, may yield to a maximum of 140. The CIS20R measures four dimensions of fatigue: fatigue severity (8 items), concentration problems (5 items), reduced motivation (4 items) and activity (3 items).</description>

    <description>The subjective degree of snoring during sleep will be evaluated by the partner of a subject by using a VAS scoring system ranging from 0 (no snoring) to 10 (extreme snoring causing the bed partner to sleep separately). Heavy snoring is determined as a snoring index ≥7.</description>
