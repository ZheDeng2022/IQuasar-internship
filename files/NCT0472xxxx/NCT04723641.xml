  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The functional strength training is mainly dealt with anti-gravity muscles and aiming at&#xD;
      maximal carry over in day to day activities. The functional strength training can be given&#xD;
      using resistance and it may be gravity, body weight, resistance bands and free weights. The&#xD;
      exercises are specific to the muscle or muscle groups recruited during the functional&#xD;
      activities&#xD;

      Forty children were randomly assigned to one of two groups of equal number, control and study&#xD;
      groups. Random assignment of children was conducted into two stages. Stage one involved&#xD;
      instructing three physical therapists who were working in the pediatric outpatient clinic of&#xD;
      the Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, pediatric outpatient clinic of the Faculty&#xD;
      of Physical Therapy, Badr University as well as Prof. Dr/ Kamal Shoukry's pediatric&#xD;
      rehabilitation center to report all children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the&#xD;
      study and had no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
