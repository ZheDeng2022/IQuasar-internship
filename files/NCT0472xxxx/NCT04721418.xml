  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure synaptic density in the brain comparing&#xD;
      individuals with cocaine use disorder to healthy controls.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy controls (HC) will be studied as outpatient and undergo one MRI and one 11C-UCB-J PET&#xD;
      scan along with neurocognitive tasks. Individuals with Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) will&#xD;
      complete the study as inpatients on our unit and undergo one MRI and two 11C-UCB-J PET scan&#xD;
      along with neurocognitive tasks. Cocaine users will be asked to complete outpatient&#xD;
      follow-ups twice a week for up to nine weeks following their inpatient stay.&#xD;
