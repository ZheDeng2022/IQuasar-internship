  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease that affects only a&#xD;
      fraction of those who smoke tobacco. The origin of this variability in susceptibility to&#xD;
      develop COPD is unclear, but understanding its underlying biology has important implications&#xD;
      for our ability to design suitable preventative and therapeutic strategies for its&#xD;
      management. This Department of Defense (DOD) discovery research proposes to develop&#xD;
      methodologies and generate preliminary data needed to lay the foundation for a large study&#xD;
      that would investigate the underlying biological susceptibility of those who smoke tobacco to&#xD;
      develop COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot observational study of 20 subjects ≥40 years of age with smoking history of&#xD;
      at least 20 pack-years (former or current) who have preserved spirometry, as defined by&#xD;
      normal Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) / Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Of the 20 subjects, 10&#xD;
      with and 10 without air trapping as determined by high and abnormal versus low and normal&#xD;
      Residual Volume (RV) / Total Lung Capacity (TLC) measured by plethysmography. The cohort will&#xD;
      undergo extensive clinical characterization including full Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)&#xD;
      and medical, symptom, activity, and quality of life questionnaires assessment including&#xD;
      modified Medical Council Research (mMRC), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), Short Form-12 (SF12),&#xD;
      and St. George's Respiratory (SGRQ) questionnaires. Subjects will undergo bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to obtain luminal macrophages and BAL fluid (BALF). Live BAL&#xD;
      cells, BALF, and BAL cell RNA will be collected and stored in our biorepository for proposed&#xD;
      studies. Molecular, functional, and transcriptomics analyses of luminal (alveolar)&#xD;
      macrophages obtained by BAL (Aim 2) and protease activity measurement in serum and BALF will&#xD;
      be performed (Aim 2) and will be examined against the clinical phenotype of the subjects, in&#xD;
      particular air trapping-phenotype, to see if an underlying biological signature for&#xD;
      susceptibility to develop COPD could be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To perform a more comprehensive molecular and functional phenotype examination of lung&#xD;
      macrophages, additional methodologies will be developed including a second mass cytometry&#xD;
      (CyTOF) panel for single-cell proteomics and CyTOF-based phagocytosis and efferocytosis&#xD;
      assays to allow for performance of truly single-cell functional phenotyping of myeloid cells&#xD;
      from BAL and lung tissue (Aim 1).&#xD;

    <description>Bronchoscopy w/ (BAL): The bronchoscope will be introduced through mouth and directed into the right middle lobe bronchus for bronchial lavage. The BAL will be performed with two 60-mL aliquots (total of 120 ml) of saline in each of medial and lateral segments of Right Middle Lobe (RML) (total 240 ml lavage).&#xD;
Albuterol Administration: The subjects will inhale 2 puffs of respiratory medication albuterol, then repeat the breathing test.&#xD;
Peak Flow Measurement: Subjects will breathe in fully then out forcefully into the handheld device.&#xD;
Pulmonary Function Test w/ Spirometry: will be used for determination of COPD and its severity. The PFT measures breathing capacity and lung function with different types of breathing maneuvers including flow-volume curve, single breath CO diffusing capacity, and total lung capacity.&#xD;
