      This study aims to investigate the quality of life of menopausal health-care providers in&#xD;
      University Medical Center (UMC) hospitals in Nur-Sultan and identify whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in the quality of life between two major groups of women health-care&#xD;
      professionals: physicians and nurses, and to explore factors influencing on it.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life has turned into a reference for the so-called &quot;state of wellbeing&quot; that&#xD;
      includes six domains: physical health, social relationships, psychological state, spiritual&#xD;
      concerns, environmental features, and level of independence. Quality of life is perceived as&#xD;
      a major health component, especially for menopausal women, and has become an essential&#xD;
      research topic that has been discussed widely in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, from the HRQoL perspective, the consequences of the climacterium should be&#xD;
      considered as a specific aspect of health-related quality of life in studies that include&#xD;
      this segment of the population. The increased life expectancy of the general population and&#xD;
      of women in particular, has turned women's health care in this phase of life into a priority;&#xD;
      the way this should be accomplished, however, represents one of the main sources of public&#xD;
      health debate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of work life is a comprehensive and general schema, which is essential in improving&#xD;
      specialized personnel's satisfaction and attracting and preserving personnel. It also results&#xD;
      in positive theories such as increasing profits and provocation. Nevertheless, although&#xD;
      physicians and nurses are expected to provide patient care and improve their quality of life,&#xD;
      their own needs and their own quality of life have been either largely underestimated or&#xD;
      ignored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Providing care in these cases is very demanding in physical, emotional, and spiritual terms.&#xD;
      Their work requires certain qualities, such as empathy, compassion, and closeness to the&#xD;
      individuals and families they care for. Therefore, daily work may be significantly influenced&#xD;
      by the menopausal transition, especially in nurses and physicians Work is beneficial for&#xD;
      menopausal women by providing fulfilment, self-esteem, identity and social needs. But working&#xD;
      environments like those with lack of temperature control, cramped conditions, some uniforms&#xD;
      and stress can also make menopause symptoms worse. Menopause refers to the time when a&#xD;
      woman's menstrual period stops for 12 consecutive months after the last period and is&#xD;
      characterized by a decline in the production of the ovarian hormones, mainly estrogen and&#xD;
      progesterone. The lack of these hormones makes some women prone to experiencing common&#xD;
      symptoms that include, but are not limited to, sleep disorders, mood alterations, hot&#xD;
      flashes, depression, urinary tract infections, vaginal infections, and increased risk for&#xD;
      osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Providing up-to-date information to women about&#xD;
      menopause, its management, and the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) may serve as an&#xD;
      important step towards treating postmenopausal symptoms thereby improving the QOL of&#xD;
      postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to a recent study, the level of awareness and knowledge of women about the&#xD;
      menopause is directly proportional to their ability to control their symptoms as menopausal&#xD;
      symptoms can have a negative impact on work but menopause in the workplace still remains a&#xD;
      taboo. This study aims to investigate the QoL of menopausal health-care providers in UMC&#xD;
      hospitals in Nur-Sultan and identify whether there is a difference in the quality of life&#xD;
      between two major groups of women health-care professionals: physicians and nurses, and to&#xD;
      explore factors influencing on it.&#xD;

    <description>The participants will be asked to indicate whether they had experienced symptoms or problems within the past month and, if so, to rate how bothersome they were on a seven-point Likert scale from 0 to 6: with 0 indicating that they were not at all bothered and 6 indicating that they were extremely bothered. The 29 questions of the MENQOL (supported by NCBI and NHI) are divided into four domains: vasomotor (items 1-3), psychosocial (items 4-10), physical (items 11-26), and sexual (items 27-29).</description>
