      This study has been designed to evaluate how effective the Bizact tonsillectomy device is in&#xD;
      reducing operating time and complications that occur after surgery. This device operates in a&#xD;
      different way than the standard device that is used for most tonsillectomies. In 2019, a&#xD;
      study was conducted in 186 children and adults using this device in tonsillectomies. Results&#xD;
      showed lower blood loss and shortened time in surgery. However, the rate for bleeding as a&#xD;
      complication after surgery was the same as other procedures that are used in tonsillectomy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is the second most common pediatric surgical procedure, with more than 280,000&#xD;
      performed in children under the age of 15 in the United States in 2010. The most common&#xD;
      indications for tonsillectomy in children include recurrent infections and obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea. While tonsillectomy in the pediatric population is generally safe and well-tolerated,&#xD;
      post-operative complications are not uncommon, with post-operative pain, respiratory&#xD;
      compromise, and post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage being chief among them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain has been described as the main morbidity associated with tonsillectomy&#xD;
      and is often ineffectively controlled. Pain beyond the initial 24-hour post-operative period&#xD;
      has been noted to be worse with the use of electrocautery when compared to cold-knife&#xD;
      dissection and snare tonsillectomy, perhaps attributable to the high levels of heat (400 °C&#xD;
      to 600 °C) applied directly to the tonsillar area. Yet electrocautery remains one of the most&#xD;
      frequently utilized tools due to its hemostatic effects through vessel coagulation at the&#xD;
      time of dissection. Still, a recent large meta-analysis reported the rates of primary&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (bleeding within the first 24 hours) at 2.4% and secondary&#xD;
      post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage (beyond 24 hours) at 2.6%, suggesting that bleeding after&#xD;
      tonsillectomy remains a relatively common occurrence. The search for a methodology that&#xD;
      improves post-operative pain without increasing the risk of post-operative hemorrhage remains&#xD;
      an active area of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coblation, which creates an ionized plasma layer by passing a bipolar radio-frequency current&#xD;
      through a medium of saline, offers another approach. The saline irrigation results in much&#xD;
      less heat when compared to monopolar cautery, measuring approximately 40°C to 70°C. Coblation&#xD;
      can be used in both subcapsular and intracapsular fashion. Subcapsular tonsillectomy with&#xD;
      coblation has demonstrated a minimal decrease in pain, and may result in slightly higher&#xD;
      rates of post-operative hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been pointed out that bipolar cautery could result in lower thermal injury and reduced&#xD;
      blood loss, however tonsillectomy using traditional bipolar forceps leads to longer operative&#xD;
      times. One group found that the use of BiClamp, a bipolar vascular sealing device originally&#xD;
      designed for thyroidectomy, provided decreased operative times and less intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding compared to electrocautery. They noted, however, instances of posterior pillar&#xD;
      perforation, which they attributed to curvature of the device that was designed for thyroid&#xD;
      surgery, making dissection of the superior pole more difficult. Medtronic has now developed a&#xD;
      similar device designed for use in tonsillectomy with a curved jaw meant to follow the&#xD;
      contour of the tonsillar bed. In its marketing material for the recently developed BiZact ,&#xD;
      Medtronic describes a bipolar device that continuously measures the impedance of clamped&#xD;
      tissue, adjusting energy levels in real-time and automatically stopping energy delivery when&#xD;
      a seal is established. Their literature suggests the device permanently seals vessels up to&#xD;
      3mm with less thermal damage, resulting in less intraoperative blood loss, more efficient&#xD;
      procedures, and possibly less pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study of 186 patients, intraoperative blood loss was shown to be &lt;1ml of blood&#xD;
      loss in 71 cases (38.2%) and between 1 and 10ml of blood loss in 81 cases (43.5%).&#xD;
      Post-operative hemorrhage rate of 4.3% is similar to rates described by other studies. BiZact&#xD;
      tonsillectomy allows for a shortened operative time with a median time of 5.1 minutes. Other&#xD;
      studies have shown other techniques to have a time duration of 21.6 minutes (electrocautery),&#xD;
      20.20 minutes (coblator), and 16.14 minutes (microdebrider).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In off label use of the device at our institution, data from surgeons using the device showed&#xD;
      that surgeons perceived a relative improvement in following compared to standard&#xD;
      tonsillectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Less perceived thermal heat transfer to surrounding soft tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Left perceived blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Superior ease of obtaining timely hemostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Faster operative time&#xD;
