  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blindness can be caused by many ocular diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein&#xD;
      occlusion, age-related macular degeneration, pathologic myopia and glaucoma. Without timely&#xD;
      diagnosis and adequate medical intervention, the visual impairment can become a great burden&#xD;
      on individuals as well as the society. It is estimated that China has 110 million patients&#xD;
      under the attack of diabetes, 180 million patients with hypertension, 120 million patients&#xD;
      suffering from high myopia and 200 million people over 60 years old, which suggest a huge&#xD;
      population at the risk of blindness. Despite of this crisis in public health, our society has&#xD;
      no more than 3,000 ophthalmologists majoring in fundus oculi disease currently. As most of&#xD;
      them assembling in metropolitan cities, health system in this field is frail in primary&#xD;
      hospitals. Owing to this unreasonable distribution of medical resources, providing medical&#xD;
      service to hundreds of millions of potential patients threatened with blindness is almost&#xD;
      impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve this problem, this software (MCS) was developed as a computer-aided diagnosis to&#xD;
      help junior ophthalmologists to detect 13 major retina diseases from color fundus&#xD;
      photographs. This study has been designed to validate the safety and efficiency of this&#xD;
      device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As a prospective clinical trial, This study enjoys multicentric, blind film reading,&#xD;
      self-control and superiority test design. In total, 1,500 retinal fundus images from 750&#xD;
      individuals in need of fundus examination (one image for every single eye) were selected.&#xD;
      Then a test group, along with a control group was set up in our study. For the test group,&#xD;
      ophthalmologists read images with the aid of the assistant software(MCS). In contrast, the&#xD;
      same work in the control group was finished by ophthalmologists independently. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      gold standard were obtained from the cooperation of senior ophthalmologists. Diagnoses of&#xD;
      both groups were compared with those of the gold standard, thus the investigators could&#xD;
      evaluated the safety and effectiveness of this assistant software in diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is the superiority of the consistency rate of the test&#xD;
      group. A diagnosis for an image is consistent if it gives the same negative result as the&#xD;
      reference standard, or reveals any one condition indicated by the reference standard. The&#xD;
      consistency rate is the rate of consistent diagnoses for all the involved images. One control&#xD;
      group is designed, where each doctor reads and diagnoses, and give at most 3 possible&#xD;
      conditions for each image. In the test group, doctors do the same thing with the help of this&#xD;
      software. The investigators in the test group and control group are the same and they are&#xD;
      chosen from ophthalmologists with 1~3 years experience. The reference standard of each fundus&#xD;
      image is collaboratively given by retinal specialists/fellows from 5 centers. The&#xD;
      investigator of XieHe center is the arbitrator if full consensus cannot be reached for any&#xD;
      image during the building of reference standard.&#xD;

    <description>Formula for calculation: consistent rate of diagnoses=number of images with consistent diagnosis/ total number of images Ã— 100%.&#xD;
Method: the diagnoses from the test group and the control group were compared with diagnoses from the gold standard. For each image, if one or more diagnoses were consistent with those of the gold standard, which means at least one label existed in the intersection of diagnoses from the test group(or the control group)and those from the gold standard, it would be classified as &quot;image with consistent diagnosis&quot;. Otherwise, it would be classified as &quot;image without consistent diagnosis&quot;. After above-mentioned steps, the investigators had obtained the number of images with consistent diagnosis in each group. As images with 1-2 labels account for the majority in actual work, the investigators stipulated that each image in both groups could be marked with 3 labels at most in case of invalid improvement in consistent rate owing to multiple selections.</description>
