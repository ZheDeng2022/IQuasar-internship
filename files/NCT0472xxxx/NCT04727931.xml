  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective prevalence study recorded that up to 50% of adult patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      epilepsy had at least one cognitive impairment before initiation of antiepileptic drug (AED).&#xD;
      Multiple factors exist and interact in the same patient. Cognitive impairments may affect&#xD;
      psychiatric (loss of self-esteem, anxiety, depression) and social status (e.g., vocational&#xD;
      aptitude, educational). These factors in turn influence cognitive abilities in a triangular&#xD;
      and bidirectional relationship. In addition, the type of epilepsy, development in childhood&#xD;
      or cerebral ageing, antiepileptic treatments (AED, surgery) and etiology also have an impact&#xD;
      on cognitive performances. The burden of these factors differs from patient to another and&#xD;
      must be determined individually. Longitudinal follow-up seems to be crucial because it will&#xD;
      allow us to highlight the change in the cognitive profile of newly diagnosed patients over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to compare the prevalence of cognitive impairment in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed epilepsy prior to the initiation of AED with healthy subjects matched on age,&#xD;
      sex, manual laterality and socio-educational level. But also to compare the longitudinal&#xD;
      evolution of the cognitive profile of patients with healthy controls (0 to 10 years) to&#xD;
      determine, among the age of onset seizures, their etiology, the syndrome, the sex, the&#xD;
      socio-educational level and the cognitive reserve, which one are related to the severity of&#xD;
      cognitive disorders.&#xD;
